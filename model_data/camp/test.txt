We stayed there about one month be fore evacuating the camp.
I...uh...took some bread along and...uh...I...Uh...took bread along for my brother to dist ribute it in the camp and to give it to my classmate  you know.
We were in no labor camp  but I think we survived many And do you think that affected the choices you made later in life  that realization?
Could you describe what happened when you arrived in Auschwitz ?
That's a suburb of Riga  and we were met by SS men and they told us that this concentration camp is built on Jewish graves.
We ha d liberated some Canadian and U.S. Army or U.S. Air Force prisoner of war camps previous to this and we thought this was another prisoner of war camp.
But I have to ad -- say  we got in -- when we got into a concentration camp  I remember the first holiday right a -- we came -- actually  we came to Mauthausen from Auschwitz  and I remember we were in Mauthausen  this was like about a week after Auschwitz actually  a week or te -- to two weeks after Auschwitz  and it was [indecipherable] because -- I remember that.
And at that time  we really didn't know what Auschwitz was except that they were sending people there.
BZ: While we were look- ing a place in the ghetto.
And I went to a camp the D Lager 12 which was  which was sort of the major camp.
So but it means that by th e time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there  you were able to move out of the camp?
It was a very big English camp there  a nd from there  we escape to Tel Aviv.
Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 37 From when I was in labor camp it was called so-called in Slovak [indecipherable] that means  the sixth.
Through the Museum many years later I found out that that reception camp was operated by the militia  French militia  and the people were arrested and shipped to Auschwitz.
I'd rather go in a camp where I have a soup and they gave me some work to do.
And it didn't take long before we were arrested  and we were taken to some...the difference between a labor camp and a concentration camp wasn't much really  because the labor camps kind of kept you a couple of days and they weren't as well organized as a concentration camp  so it was very easy to walk out and to escape.
>> Bill Benson: They were told you need to leave here.
And was this the first time you were in a concentration camp?
Let's go back a little bit in the -- when you were going to the camp.
And this is how we came to Germany to a DP camp by the name of Pocking.
My father stayed Interview with Eric J. Hamberg 26 alive in the concentration camp.
99 And after almost two weeks  we landed -- because we go to different concentration camp  nobody like take us because no room.
They didn't like -- you know  it's the kind of a dynamics that you find in anywhere  about the newc omers  the new kid in the block  the new kid in the class  new immigrants coming to a count ry  you know  that type of a thing is almost duplicated in the dynamics of the camp situation.
And they sold us so we went to this working camp from Ravensbruck.
If you visit the exhibit upstairs  you will see an exhibit of these huge boulders that the prisoners were forced to carry in that camp where they would very often be tripped.
So I -- it may have been more than one trip  maybe several trips  bringing in as much as a -- you know  could by -- but by that time you see  there was no help  my brother was already in the camp  my -- my oldest was in the army  the Russian army.
While we were in that camp  it came our holiday Hanukah.
I know there are hungry people in the world  n -- but not right here at Camp Killmer.
I was there about two or three years til the camp was completely liquidated.
No  I did not get any information from a ny more  but the news leaked through and I knew that we are preparing to get hold of the -- what they called wuffencummer  which is the chamber of weapons  which was a wooden building in -- in the what they called four lager  in the -- that part of part of camp number one  before you got into the -- that part where we slept and where the artisans had their shops.

He has a  he had a girlfriend that he met the year before in in some camp and uh her parents have written that they will be willing to take him as a border and he should come to Brussels.
I remem I remember wal well  not exactly when I left the camp.
From Stuthoff we were taken to a camp called Burgram ?
So they sent a reporter out to talk to me and then they put a whole thing in the Santa Ana ﬁRegisterﬂ about me and Buchenwald concentration camp and so forth.
It was very dangerous for Jews to be caught in the subway because if there was an identity check and they would find on your identity card that there was a J or marks Jewish on it  they would take you right away  put aside and send you to a transit camp and from there to Auschwitz.
Dr. Kronzon  me and uh  a doctor I will recall his name--[Benjinowicz ]   who was in concentration camp.
He got a red stamp on his passport that said if you dont leave Germany within three months you go back to camp.
And then I found out...at this time I was in a concentration camp.
Men were on th e other part of camp  but mostly women.
And spent the night there in bivouac  not tents  we just s-slept outside  basically.
Well  that was branch of the bo Buchenwald   so it it was part of Buchenwald .
Did you have  in the camp  a sor -- a semblance of a little school for kids?
Particularly in one camp that I am coming to later on which was the last camp.
Anyway we were very scared and What did you do when you were scared.
We came to this camp with a little bit of bread  the four of us  my sister and I and our two friends.
Studhoff was a camp with gas chambers and furnaces and my sister--and eh saw my--my wife a few times there and then they didn't see them anymore.
They took us straight to a recruiting camp where the recruiters  they -- In what city?
37 Yeah  but before the DP camp  were there any children in the group at all that you were traveling with?
Never hit the camp  because they knew where the camps are.
>> Bill Benson: What made you leave Israel and come to the United States?
I says  ﬁfine.ﬂ So we so  I find out I this camp is they used to call it Bad Reichenhal  this DP camp.
End of Tape Two  Side B 48 Beginning Tape Three  Side A Edith  be-before we move on to the next camp that you went to  I -- A-Asherslabin  I wanted to ask you about money and Austrians and the Jews and your views about what it was that the Austrians were really interested in when the Nazis took over.
In fact  Camp Sharp had originally been commanded  during World War I  by Eisenhower.
So you were in the DP camp Interview with Sol Mackler December 28  2009 62 Yeah.
Few girls that -- that came with us to the labor camp were pregnant  and had babies there  and miscarriages.
And so we  the  the camp had already little bit more space so we were assigned in another villa  was called Villa Gowlitz a room.
So he was out of the service of the soldier  he was in -- somewhere in the kazerna  yes  in the camp  or -- camp somebody [indecipherable] exactly it was Veeberg  which is now in [indecipherable].
And we came to Stutthof  which was a big camp in eastern Germany.
So I had a teacher that come to my home to teach me Hebrew  you know.
And I intend to translate this  and then I will have an opportunity to talk about the camp and the life  I will bring this up  too.
He took us back and uh I think to Ebensee   in a different camp because the...and there in Ebensee we also went to work...we worked in different places where the hundred people they walked out in a unit and by train and some of them by trucks and sometimes not in by train and sometimes not in by trucks  to labor  hard labor.
At that time was no food  all day  till you came into the camp  they gave you something  you know  to eat  you had a little piece of bread  and a coffee in the morning  and then something evening when you came back  which was very little.
So my father's older brother died 01:04: 4 before the war  and his younger brother died in a concentration camp in  I think  Auschwitz.
One night we were having dinner together  and I asked my father a few questions about the concentration camp and he says  I really dont want to talk about it  I told you about how I kept myself alive with the potatoes and all that  I says  but I really dont want to talk about it.
And we put all our best things there because we believed that we are going to transferred to Salaspils  what...what was a bigger concentration camp.
They were taken first to a camp at across the Urals  which would have been technically Siberia .
And uh  and in...when I was shopping there in Hilversum  suddenly I saw my brother--who was in uh  in Holland ....in the concentration camp in Holland--and uh went (pause)... and I went up to him and I said  \ Mr. Poons  how are you?\
Because we arrived into the factory in was night  dark when we left it was dark.
When the war broke out  all the men were picked up and put into camp.
They were carrying this jeep in the air like they are walking through the camp all around.
It was a tough  tough camp  but sa some of the relief on on on Sundays  made it palatable.
Becaus e normally when you come into a camp you had to get rid of everything  or your clothing and yo u get fresh clothing.
When I was in Germany  or in -- no  in Brussels  I once made a trip to France and I visited the military camp where I had served in southern France.
You know the 11 blocks which were on the eastern side of the camp  were all partitioned  with barbwire  and this was a womens camp.
But at the same time  in Austria  at that time  or in Germany at that time  if anybody -- not as a criminal but only because they wanted to take his business away  was in a concentration camp.
10 >> Nesse G odin: Well  I tell you  some were in the same camp.
I talked to a friend of mine from the 493rd field artillery battalion w ho was in one of the efforts moving south parallel to us  Pete Bramble  and he mentioned the fact that his wire truck pulled up to a camp which had evidently not been entered at all  and the first thing they saw were barbed wire fences so they hit their truck  took their carbines and machine guns  moved forward in there and found out what the situation was.
While we were in Melk  the working camp  we were a mixed community.
And then eventually the the war crimes trials came in t-to the camp  and they and they tried the the people that were still living.
In Dora it was -- that was the forest -- the fo rest camp already.
So I came out on Sunda y and I had the...the box loaded with bread and shoes and everybody and for the...for the camp  you know.
Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 37 Yes  well  we had the Austrians there and and in the Reidenburg camp  there was a fire brigade in there.
When it comes to that tailor shop it was outside in Auschwitz not in where the camp is but on the outside.
They began to collect Jews into ghettos in preparation to move them out of the country.
And we heard some noise outside and the Nazis did the same thing.
Belson -- nobody really knew about Be lson until it was discovered because it had never been identifi ed particularly as an exterm ination camp.
burst out of the padlocked camp once more and break the gates.
So  well  I got typhus in Bergen-Belsen and Paul LaPietra  one of the Frenchme n stole food and send it to the camp.
01:21:22 Uh  in this period of time being in camp in Tirgu Jiu  it happened something with my father which it was very important and very difficult period of time.
And then they marched us in  we were standing there in the field  within the camp and take off everything and we're just standing there and this was just separated from the by a fence  barbed wire fence  over which they threw blankets to block out the view.
And he paid slova the Slovak Republic paid for each Jew who went to concentration camp  they prayed they paid to Hitler  I dont remember exactly how many hundred dollars for each person.
ERICA LAUFER August 19  2012 Gail Schwartz: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Erica Laufer conducted by Gail Schwartz on August 19  2012 in Chevy Chase  Maryland.
And then a little bit later  the Americans liberated  but they did not come in the camp.
And I said  \ I'm not 1 May be the same as Szydlow  a labor camp for Jews located in the Radom district.
And what about routines like there was also appelle and roll call at this camp?
The new unit that came in  did they administer the camp as well?
Uh she was quite young and since she was sent to Czechoslovakia to live with her grandparents because you see uh in that particular transport were mostly girls from Beilitz and from Czechoslovakia and you know we were all German speaking and this is why we went to that camp.
We could see from our camp that uh tall chimney  the flame uh going up day and night  smoking.
And it wasn't so bad 'til on a Friday in 1942  it must have been like September  when Amon Goeth took over that camp.
So  there was a camp right in Austria  a concentration camp  right th ere.
They knew  being in the camp  they knew everything about it.
We were transported to Birkenau to the old -- to the camp from which we originally came.
And he took me to higher...like you see him today on television was a nicer camp.
I -- I was -- from all those things which I had behind me  the camp and then the hiding  I was -- I was not myself.
And then when they arrested her and brought her to the Rounds-berg concentration camp.
And I found out from the group th at in the west Berlin there is a huge refugee camp  but huge  for thousands of people.
Side B  Tape 1) Had the war lasted  I mean had the American army not reached us on May 5  1945  if this would have lasted another week  none of us would have been alive today from that particular camp.
When you look back now  50 years later on that year  and especially on that experience you had  witnessing what had happened at the concentration camp  what does it mean to you?
And also some bombs were dropped quite close to our camp.
And  that turned out to be a work camp  living right on the prem ises in the reichsbahn right near the railroad  the main railroad station there.
We pleaded for papers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp  and he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do  but he became very well known for the fact that you could buy favors  but that was 1939  1940.
And I explained that hed been in this camp  and that camp  slave labor  etcet era  etcetera  Auschwitz.
There were other children in that camp  but I didn't know them really.
It looked like that the whole camp was either + or diseased or  you know  just ready to be buried.
They had come from a concentr ation camp and they had nothing  and I lived better in many ways where I was.
And we carried the boy from Grundo  I can't thi nk of his last  his first name  Jankl   and carried him back to camp.
>> Bill Benson: But you were living with your sisters at that point.
And so shortly I -- but I live it  my whole past  its not only concentration camp.
And he grabbed four or five prisoners who were wandering in the camp  and made them go into the attic; and from the attic they brought down four uh cabin[et]s  wooden cabin[et]s.
And we set up our hospital in three or four places on the way up and we were in Germany on VE Day  in tents  loads of mud.
Now  were in this camp with Jewish children  run by Jewish adult leaders and -- and everything is wonde rful and normal and so forth  as far as a child is concerned.
And  you know  we were -- through much as possible  we were always toge ther and we liked -- we were  thats what they called us in camp  bride and browt -- browticum  in German -- bride and -- bride and groom.
But not on a regular basis  because it was already being censored  or whatever  so So you were out now  youre in this youre in this sort of camp area  in a dormitory  going to school  getting adjusted  having a new routine.
But my two sisters were immediately sent to Auschwitz and killed.
And somehow it happened to move a lot of shoes or somethi ng  and he bribed people with shoes because we didn't have anything  and he came to vis it us in the camp  showing his military paper and acting as  \ I'm an officer of the French army.ﬂ They let him in and he actually smuggled my youngest sister out on his bicycle.
Every other camp had different forms of identification  usually Jewish stars sewn on.
We had to be in a displaced persons camp for five years  because in those days we didn't need a visa.
I used to live in the concentration camp from hour to hour.
Well  it was a rather large camp  and uh  it's calle d  was called an internment camp  but it was a concentration camp  that's just a fancy name for a concentration camp.
And one man whose father was also -- I mean  one boy in my class  his father was also a prominent lawyer  very impressive looking  was taken to a camp.
Because wa -- the 168 moment the SS noticed somebody with such qualitie s  they picked you and made -- gave to you an big job as an -- as an camp vi -- I dont know what  and it was not very nice to witness somebody to be recruited f-for an cruel job  yeah ?
Cause this happened so often  you know  that a worker would go  you know  to a -- to a camp  to a la bor camp -- these were workshops  you know  within the ghetto.
Then we had 28 to walk up a slope to get into the camp of Buchenwald  it was lo cated on a hill in that forest  theforest.
J7;6t And I remember after quarantiner they took us to a children's barrack in the...theD -Lager  which was a working lager  working camp.
Now  what he did  was -- was truly a -- an exceptional thing  to hide a child in the concentration camp.
My father uh was already quite elderly by that time and perhaps that uh can be uh for  for that reason perhaps uh he  he was not sent to a concentration camp  but all the younger a nd middle aged men were sent to concentration camps  and we would get these uh letters subsequen tly in  in  in which uh my mother or father would say uh  uh such and such a family uh still has no news uh  uh from their husband.
And we arrived in the camp  in the main camp  we were quarantined in Block 11  and as you know  between Block 11 and 10 there was the Death uh place  and uh  it was  we couldn't see anything  we heard only shooting.
In order to get back to London  I had to sit in the camp there for a week  and...uh...that was a terrible thing because I could...I was there and I saw the boys fly out in the morning.
He was in a different camp  you know  and I was in a different camp.
They didnt know about the camp  but they [indecipherable] when they heard from other guys  and I guess in their u -- papers  the journal they kept  yeah  the military journal the commanding officer keeps  what they did today  what they did yesterday  how much ammunition they have left  how many guys went sick  and [indecipherable].
You had to fill bags of cement and carry them on your shoulder to the other corner of the concentration camp.
I lately think it was 18 all in a private house  where the officers had lived  when it was a military camp.
They came back for lunch  and they were going to  torch in the evening the  the camp.
They ca lled it   never an original concentration camp  yes.
But  once we moved into this camp  there were no Ukrainian guards.
And  there was in the camp one maybe allowed to stay about 2 weeks  and they were all executed.
So my brother and I and my father were still in this particular camp when 19...when the fall of 1944 came  and that was when we started 01:44:00 already hearing rumors that the Russians were getting closer and closer.
These two -- I think they were Soviet POWs in the camp -- they were not that weak  they wanted to kill as many German s as they could get a hold of  and they did.
I dont want to go to any camp  she said to me.
What did it mean  did you know then that they had been sent to Auschwitz?
And we have a Polish si gn  but on the si -- on the side of the tank  and they run away and th-then Jewi sh people  you know  the Jewish people  it was the -- they feel like babies  you know  they people which was -- because the German [indecipherable] keep the people -- the German which keep in the concentration camp  only not the terrorist people  but the -- theres an underhanded -- theres people always lose his mind.
So I remember seeing the -- the -- ac tually the inside of the camp with the ter -- So is he picked up before the ghetto?
We  we didn't know exac tly how that camp would look.
That maybe by some chance they wound up in a camp somewhere and maybe after the war you w ill be reunited.
Apparently during the war he escape to Russia  and he came back.
And I served him  I have to say  in this camp in Auschwitz  I never ate from th e kitchen  from the  from the from the prisoner kitchen---- We have to reload.
After that  it was establish a camp -- a five miles after our area where we lived  for turf  work with the turf  you know whats turf?
And I did that  really until I went to college  working for th e Quakers  being a counselor in a refugee camp.
I think they died  one died for sure  and uh  they ma de it out of the camp.
Did the labor camp have a specific name  do you know if it had a particular name?
And one night while he was in the concentration camp  I think it was in Dachau that he was incarcerated in  he was so hungry he couldn't sleep.
But it -- the night before  a woman who had been smuggled into camp -- had -- no  not -- not smugg -- she was taken into the camp  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 40 but she didnt -- they didnt tell anyone that she ha -- that she was pregnant and she had given birth that night to a boy.
He died already in the camp  during the during the war.
Hania and Krysia  on the other hand  after all this was over  they were sent to place called Majowka  which was another camp in town.
And if a German or a policeman suspected a man to be Jewish  he would just say drop your pants and you are guilty  if you are circumcised you are guilty of being a Jew.
What did you know about Auschwitz at th at that time?
And then when I was in I went to camp  Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 101 about five days before the end of the war  it was an international camp  it was the largest prisoner of war camp in Germany   Stalag 11a  Altengrabow   located between Magdeburg   and and Berlin.
You know  there was a group of Jews sent into our ghetto.
The only trace I have of him was a friend of mine who visited the concentration camp found his name  David Ponczak  born in 1890-something.
Like I told him many time  if I was in a camp  if they took me in Auschwitz  I wouldnt survive an hour.
>> Bill Benson: In a large displaced persons camp  refugee camp  essentially.
But at camp as the rainy season began  began  and we were told every four  every day at four o'cloc k there would be a roll call  a census taken.
They took all the SS  they -- they -- they broke open our camp  they broke open the ledgers.
And they had to show...they had to show where they hid  how they ran out of the camp  how they could escape.
IRVING HEYMONT Page 23 said Mr. Patowski  that's all fine  but if you can reach into your pocket and bring out two dozen needles that will fit the sewing machines that we have on camp  you'll be the hero of the week.
And in that interim period  most of the...by far  of the camp inmates either went to the mountains  to the mainland; or  as we di d  went south toward Anglo-American-occupied Italy.
>> Jill Pauly: The queen of the Netherlands wrote a permission for these three men to stay interned in Holland in a camp  until they could leave.
The commanding officer took us out in the middle of the camp and he said we are going to leave this camp soon.
Yes --well  what they did know -- let's say this is the perimeter of the camp  right?
In the fall of 1944  as the Soviet Army approached  Susan and her family were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp to which our second arrow points.
And she was a concentration camp survivor  she was already married.
>> Michel Margosis: Well  the German camps -- I think every e xtermination camp Germany had was in Poland.
Was this Several weeks  as long as I was in that camp.
He -- he died in the -- in the -- in the daith -- death labor camp.
We didnt know what a slave labor camp was  in Chemnitz.
You know you make  yes  people but you bring food from the gypsy camp to give people who are sick.
The containers no longer had the lids on them  the rubber gaskets were gone from the lids  nobody cared about anything  it was a big deal to be able to  the 54 Americans or the prisoner committee managed to talk the cooks into staying on and cooking food for the rest of the camp.
A displaced person camp  the hospital  start working in the ho spital.
You lived in -- in camp one  in Sobibor  is that right?
We are from...they didn't mention the name and you don't even know that you saw us because they were scared that if the Germans catching me  they starting to ask questions  I would tell them that I saw partisans  where and what.
And there -- there was a big to-do in that camp  in our barrack  what happened  theres one missing.
They put us in the barracks in the same gypsy camp  a huge place.
His assistant  a woman named Fa y Green  who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his camp.. We used for transportation to Austria and the answer was U.S. Army trucks.
And Truckmay volun actually volunteered to go with them  and ended up in the concentration camp.
So you and your husband went to the camp together -- went back?
So he has a little pull  and he was going over to Radom   and bring people in to this camp.
When I got to Prague the first time  I disc overed there had been a concentration camp at Theresienstadt  or as the Czechs call it Terezin  north and a little bit west of Prague.
They didn't want to let them loose so they brought them in and put them into this camp.
At that time  dont forget the first w eek  we didnt know the extent  what happened with Auschwitz and all the sick  Kelman and all this c oncentration camp.
You were staying in the camp [indecipherable] I think -- I -- My brother had a job in the local -- they call it a canteen  it was like a co-op store that used to sell some grocerie s  fruits  you know for the inhabitants of the camp.
And they called it the gypsy camp because the gypsies were there.
It was near and but nobody in the camp  and there was a special squad  sp ecial detail Sonderkommando  so called Sonderkommando  and they were in a speci al guarded block  yes.
My class  out of the 50 we had 18 Jewish girls and we were fighting because by the time we grew -- we were growing into first [Jewish low Hitler] and some girls in the summer went to Germany to camp  others had the Nazis of Hungary with rings on their hand and we were fighting fistfights with them. [
But  I reme mber once uh  we were standing altogether in Camp One  and one of the woman say  \ Selma is a spy \  because Fre-what Frenzel did to me.
They didn't know really -- they didn't realize really that they're going to the camp  to death  so I have I happened to cut somebody's hair and they started to talk to me.
So And so what happened to then he was when he came throug h  they because my father  being an officer  he was taken to Murnau   which is Bavaria   to a [indecipherable] camp.
Can I describe my first experience when I came to prison camp?
Then they put the lights on around crazy to see if anybody was on the camp so to speak  running.
When we got to Auschwitz  there was such a smell of burning people that there was a smell.
The concentration camp  as Streicher e xplained it to me  is very simp le.
But the work se rvice seems to be more complicated  and the camp office has many more different functions.
In fact  they had a -- they -- they -- one of those camp com -- commandants had a rule that for every inmate that tried to escape  even if he was caught  they would sic -- shoot six -- six of -- of the -- of the -- of the 57 inmates in the camp  and thats -- so -- so that happened too  and he almost got shot  so -- so he -- he had a really tough time of it  but he managed just to survive.
So  we took a batch of automobiles en route to the police station  en route to the camp  and we stopped off at the cinema and  during a break in when they were changing the film  I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and take them back.
The no  they went they went with him  and I left in the camp.
By the  by uh  there  there was about  about a thousand  twelve hundred people  but uh  by the end was between 13 and  and 15 hundred people in that camp.
That all what had been deprived from us during the year or some were longer in the camp  should be given back to them  to educate again  in a way to be also busy with knowledge instead of too much time thinking. [
And I went once to the dentist in the concentration camp and it was a woman was then.
They took hi m into a camp and they burned him  to Belzec.
VERA LEVINE February 7  2013 Gail Schwartz: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Vera Levine in New Jersey conducted by Gail Schwartz in Washington  DC on February 7  2013.
They should have  could have  would have put her in a concentration camp for German Jews.
I understood la ter that thousands in the camp felt good that he would be saying the prayers for everybody.
In 49  I returned back to Fallingbostel   where my mother  with this DP civilian camp was there.
And I noticed in that camp where also experimented not only fertilizers  also from I. G. Farben  different paint materials--like  uh  latex sealers.
Everything -- every summer camp  every baby-sitting  every this and that on the other  everything was wonderful  cause was a new experience  you see?
And still living -- living in Starachowice camp with local women and some -- really newcomers  but it really was still a homogenous type of group  you see?
And eventually I also was able to commute on ce in awhile out of the camp and with the ambulance  breathe some fresh air.
It was a tremendous camp and the Jews were beaten and mishandled and treated the worst.
A very primitive camp that was our first point of -- of sanctuar y in -- in Switzerland.
I got transferred to Atlanta ja -- fa -- I was inducted in Camp Kilmer  New Jersey.
But everybody in the camp knew that resettlement ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 meant death.
Do you know the name of the camp th at he went to or where it was at?
I was told if I give him sum  I can leave the camp.
Before they went to choose us for work  a woman before us who was in Poland in a concentration camp asked where are our parents and the rest people.
And uh  they kept after me  wanting to have what they called  uh  responsibility for the camp.
So  she said that  before she went away  the women and the camp wanted to pass some kind of news about themselves to th e relatives  and they didnt know that she is going to another camp  th ey thought that shell be li-liberated.
And when my -- when my uncle decided to get out of the labor camp  he came to the Sawinskis and said -- asked them to take this and he lives with a woman at this time who was a widower.
There would be attorneys appointed or else  well  just called on  and there were some attorneys in the camp.

Uh they had milk that was delivered to them for their children ever y day and once in a while there was chocolate milk because I remember my brother being in th e infirmary and the rest of us children in the camp used to line up when those Greek people got their special rations.
Sobibor was divided into 3 camps  one camp  3 was the gas chamber  Camp 2 was the working camp  and Camp 1 was the camp where we slept and also where the little uh  place  little barracks  or little houses together with the buildings  and there were the tailor and the gold ma maker  and the uh  different people were sitting down and worked in these places and also we slept there  the man and the woman slept there  and when I came on  I saw some people from my hometown.
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 76 Another arbeits camp.
Coming coming into into the concentration camp  and and winding up in in Mauthausen   Braunskirsche and so on.
And they were... and they were throwing bombs everywhere  camp or no camp.
Some people stayed in the camp and I heard everybody in  who stayed there  that didn't come out alive  that's what I heard.
When we was in Pearl Harbor  I was already in another...in another camp...I mean in other camp.
And the lager  the camp was there  because nobody was coming out -- only we four.
And I remember my brother was one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before  and her father had to go a work camp.
And so when they saw that we have all this stuff  they told  look  give me this stuff  and I will give it to camp.
Until  until  I think was ar ound the Nixon  Nixon era  or there about and I became more conservative and definit ely when the Reagan  I really did not get involved in  in  in overt politics until Re agan  national politic s. For some reason I got involved with the Reagan camp aign here and I used to go and travel with Reagan in southern California to introduce him to Jewish audiences  B'nai Brith lodges and Temples and all this.
03:27:54 Do you remember if you prayed at all when you were in the camp?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 46 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: whelmed me with  with work yes.
7 worst in  in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who had been collaborators in our camp and had shipped some people to Auschwitz were beaten very badly.
How did he keep the SS away from you all the time in the camp?
So we went out of our ap artment and they took us to a big apartment and ev erybody was sitting there  all the Jewish people with bloody heads and they said to come and take the men to co ncentration camp  but they didn't  anyway.
Roll 3 Sandy: Did you bring in German civilians to help you with the running of the camp?
At that time we were very well awar e of concentration camps and concentration contrary to what some people think that so me people say well we didn't know there were such concentration camps  I already knew it as a child before I went to Belgium  because people used to make jokes about Hitler and say well keep your mouth shut otherwise you will go to concentration camp and on the Krista llnacht  and that is a story I missed by the way  uh  when Jews were arrested in Germany  uh  my father left our home to look after his father and was not arrested  and it was just a coincidence and uh  his brother was arrested and his  uh my mother's brother was arrested and sent to Dachau Concentration 6 Camp.
First of all  the biggest trauma that I experienced probably in my entire concentration camp life  was during the first two weeks of it and during the last three months of it.
And then we were -- we hid in the woods and -- until we met the American troops  so  two or three d -- two or three days later  until the fighting finally stopped  and we sa -- went out from the woods onto the open streets and we were stopped by a American patrol  who took us to a POW camp and then we were interrogated  and set free.
I think I was told that in one of the places you were in Germany  you were the only relief worker living in the camp itself  is that true?
And that is when she started to send for me  to come to that place where she was living  that part of the camp  to entertain her gentlemen  the SS men.
Th e Swedes came and took a number of Jewish people and others -- a -- other people from the camp out  and to safety.
We were in Westerbork from my birthday November 3 until the 15th of March 1944 and then we were told in Westerbork that we were going to Bergen -Belsen which was a so called preferential camp.
One aunt died natural course in -- in the concentration camp  and sa -- my cousin Mimi  I told you -- End of Tape Two  Side A Beginning Tape Two  Side B -- entration camp what she went thr ough.
When he came to camp  said ﬁHey  how are old are you?ﬂ ﬁOh  Im 29 - 30 - 32.ﬂ ﬁOh my God  you old.
They were still grabbing people and whoever they could  they came in with a gun  and whoever couldn't make it  they shot him on the spot  which before  like I said  a German never came into the camp.
In this camp which was called Peterswaldau 1 and the factory if I can still remember is called Diehl  I think  D-I-E-H-L. And this is where these parts of the bombs and ammunition were being made by us  the inmates.
The Russians came in but -- the Russians came in and I went to my town.
We had we were given a couple of tents  and then the ladies from Alexandria  as there are always ladies who want to do good  came to the camp with shoes  and most of these children hadnt worn shoes in their life  a nd they were afraid of these things.
And do you know the day she died  which was the day when her camp was liberated?
And befriended me and helped me immensely  with especially a man by the name of Fridtjof Nan Odd Nansen the son of Fridtjof Nansen16 who was in the camp helped me with both with food  and also I think with giving food to the people in the ward to  to protect me.
It was a kind of a festival situation when I came into a camp  and I came in one day and there was a tall figure  angry looking like a prophet  and he shouted out to me and he said Chaplain  we need a newspaper  and my response of course was always positive.
And uh  arranged w-to  I should be at a certain time behind a certain block  that he'll be on the other side in his camp  through the electric wires we had a meeting. (
And they told me that they all were sent to Auschwitz.
And so how long were you in this newly constructed-- Camp?
And of c ourse  then they took us to the ghetto.
THe old partisans would be -- concentration camp survivors  anybody survived by any other way and all that  so we get together.
But to get back to the Leipzig area  shortly after we got there  we discovered what had been a camp for slave labor.
They had the...uh..men's camp a nd next to a woman's camp  and then they have the sick bay...sick...sick bay camp.
And anything we found we would 108 carry back to the camp and divide it between th e six of us  we would never eat it alone.
And many times the SS man  when he was in the office -- because he was a supply man  he was traveling all over Europe getting supplies for the camp.
So we  we stayed in the camp  get our ration of bread and cabbage soup and whatever they feed us.
And she went to visit my mother everymy parents every single week before th ey went to concentration camp.
It took about 10 days after the cam p was emptied before the Russian soldiers actually did arrive into the camp.
There came different doctors  because only that  only one at the selection  and naturally  Mengele was  I recall about 5 to 6 times  during the time when the selections were made   and uh before the selections  I was already transferred from the  from the camp  from the hos pital to the reeducation camp.
Interview with Al fred Lakritz April 3  2008 67And we stayed with these  some of the Jewish -- for l ack of another term  I mean they were adult supervisor  guardians  whatever you want to call them  in this camp.
And do you have any idea -- was Tr autenau the name of the camp or was it in a specific town or city?
But anyway -- I'm -- I'm sorry -- on that train  they were traveling w -- in the open wagons  in the open cattle trains  for many days and -- and Joe went completely out of his mind and he wanted  h-he thought he s -- that he has wings  that he wants to fly and he wanted  you know  like to jump out  but he had a very good friend in the camp.
They got caught and they put first 11  and then another 11  at very close range they shot them dead  and the whole camp had to watch it.
05:13:03 I should add  unrelated to me and unrelated to Fohrenwald  on about May the ninth  there's riot in the camp at Landsberg.
So my uncle who was already here -- >> Bill Benson: The one you told us about earlier.
Not as a translator  I was working -- working at the b -- at th e administration of the camp  and occasionally because they were all Greeks  I used to translate for them  but my main function was in the office.
We did not go to a Displaced Person camp   no.
He told us  and again  all the camp staff was there  all the woman SS  and the men SS  and the head  the Commandant  the the Commandant of the camp  the new one.
The biggest prot est what we had  that we had a camp right next door to us  housing former Nazis  in there -- which it was some SS with them  and so on.
This was apparently the main road coming out of the city right straight into the main  uh  gate of the camp.
I'll tell you that  entering in this...in this camp  I said to myself  \ Hey.
So  when they were going to be discha rged to a regular camp  or to wherever they could go  they didnt want it  they didnt like it.
What happened in that particular area  or in this particular camp was mainly instructions--how to circulate with our papers without being detected.
No  I find the death of my mother affected me tremen dously and since then  I've found that things relating to the camp are much harder for me to take than they were before.
So  its while youre at this camp th at you begin working as a translator?
And in Pennsylvania  in this small town  one of the things that kept me from staying there wa s that the children  or the young people that were my ag e were not Jewish and so I had  again  nothing in common with them because and especially no t just that they were not Jewish but they were not in a concentrat ion camp  they were not living in DP camps  their life was completely different.
So  days in the ghetto  look  it was different in the ghetto than it was in the concentration camp  (a) Because we were still stronger.
A kapo was there who was the manager  I dont know what was there before  but we knew that before that it just -- it was a collecting camp.
There were no crematoriums  uh crematoriums  and uh  so  uh the camp itself was very  very bad.
Another thing that was unreasonable  winter was coming  and it was a problem of how do you heat the camp.
I was not a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 participant in that.
Do you recall any of the details of how the Russians came to liberate the camp where you were  the ammunition factory?
About tw o oclock at night they said you have to put on your clothes  and we are evacuating the camp.
Men were in a different camp than than women  but they were usually once a week allowed to to visit each other and and  of course  we got their letters then and we wrote to them.
In the same day  a German  an SS man  but I worked for him  he was -- I worked in an logger  that means a camp and we were going there for there for the day and working and coming home and you know.
And then they took us from the small camp to -- again  was a march  yeah  and then they marched in -- we -- we came to a barn  yeah.
N o. The Sonderkommando  not Jewish but from the camp  who were working at the crematoriums.
Had 6 my basic there and then was plucked out one day by special orders to join the Military Intelligence training camp at Camp Ritchie  Maryland.
I know in camp  they used to say  \ Sam is like steel.
He came in and out of that concentration camp like he owned it.
We were  they were uh you know  they belonged to the Camp Plaushow  so the administration of the Camp Plashow started preparing the list.
A. No  when we were sent out  we didn't know either that we went to Auschwitz.
So  of course  I was very happy to see him  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 7 its just like seeing somebody from the previous life  and he was -- he was liberated from Camp Arlen  as I mentioned before  and he wa s living in Hanover.
I didn't know anything about it except that when I would come to the window at the transit camp  a nd my father would be passing by  he motioned to me that he was doing something.
So he said ﬁNo  this I'm not going to do.ﬂ We started from over there and we went to a camp by the name Rodhausen (481).
Interview with Dino Brugioni November 13  2014 67 No  not Auschwitz  the one Of any of any camp.
So  one by one  it was very dark  and you know they closed the camp.
He eventually ended up in BergenBelsen but Belsen was not an extermination camp and because he was a British citizen they didnt kill him.
And I got tran sported out to another camp  and that camp was...was hell on earth because it was a...a old...uh...mill which was a building...uh...four floors up and...uh...we had to get up at about 4:30 in the morning because we walk...we walked to work which was about a 10  12 kilometer stretch.
Once they shipped him to Sachsenhaus en  Oranienburg  and Dachau  then we began to realize that there is a concentration camp.
So I went to [indecipherable] in San Raphael in the in the I forgot the name of the of the camp in San Raphael .
So my two Uncles were taken to the concentration camp and that was in November 1938.
They were Russian prisoners who were captured by the Germans and placed in the camp  also in Brasov.
I went as I was to the camp  the recruitment camps.
There were three of them there and they were full of clay filters and the petrol used to go in through the top and down through the filters but we used to move err machinery and rails and  fair play for Beaver  he used to say ﬁGet this done  get that done and you can go back to the camp.ﬂ So  occasionally  instead of going back to the camp at six oclock  we went back at three oclock in the afternoon.
So they was treated here now like everyone else  not like prisoner of war but like a prisoner in a camp.
He didn't have it so good either because this was in a camp.
And uh  in that uh  uh  uh fall of 1944  3 of our  of our  uh old timers  uh  who had spent years and years in camp  they had decided that uh  they tried to escape because they were not  they were not sure if uh  the uh  if we would live to see the day of liberation  if the SS would not dynamite all these camps and put us to death like  like the others  w ho have gone before us.
I still had all my uh spots on me  and I had uh  I guess  was still running a fever  but she discharged me  and uh  the procedure was that you left the hospital  which was at one end of the camp  and that was in the winter  and you would go down the center of the uh  uh camp  and they would let off whichever uh block you came out of to go into the uh  hospital.
IRVING HEYMONT: The camp  when  by the time I left  the sanitation problem had not been completely solved by any means but the camp was cleaner.
There was another detail inside the camp that was chopping them up into firewood.
I say to myself  ﬁIf I can do that  I can do something else.ﬂ I thought you said there was a ghetto up at the camp also.
It was unforgettable because there were some of the old people with us  old ladies  old men  you know  who had not been in the camp before who were now being imprisoned.
The camp  the camp we came to um was a small town called Bolknehein  I remember.
And I -- but I had -- I wont bore you with these stories  I had the most dramatic and memorable reunion with my family whom I had last seen when I was eight years old in DP camp.
We got to the camp which  of course  was surrounded by barbed wire.
Now  everybody in that camp knew that there were two words which you never want to hear again.
Sent to les Milles   which was a camp near Marseilles   in Aixen -Provence  which is near Marseilles.
Now it's difficult to give you other highlights if there are other highlights in the life of the camp  but I must say  our enemies were the SS  hunger... even so we were much better fed than the County Vernet.
Now  let me emphasize  the German didnt know what was going on  so if the fa -- if the factory worker worked in the sugar mill  he saw the camp is being built  and they saw wh-what was going on.
If I see the Obersturmfuhrerﬂ -- and I forgot his name ﬁI would go to him and I'll ask him if he can bring my parents into the camp  provided they are still living.ﬂ So as I walked on the street in Auschwitz  I see this Obersturmfuhrer walking  and I went over to him.
Uh  the uh  the Germans came and took the Prior and every tenth priest  and took them to Auschwitz  and then uh uh  Father Kuhar was transferred to another uh concentration camp.
In the DP camp   actually  you probably know about it  wa s formed in a place called Bergen  not Bergen-Belsen.
But they gave me a job at Camp Home Run  in the  in the camp  to be in charge of the officers' laundry and dry cleaning.
The next thing she decided that she would like to work for something like a German military camp.
I mean  there were other people around with whom you were friends  but you indi cated that your relationship with your father changed somewhat in the context of th at camp  that in some way you got closer to him then you had before.
After  when the camp was built  so we went in certain group.
And this was an application  because they wanted to help the Jews that came from the concentration camp.
We use to march--go by everyday a prisoner of war camp or Russian prisoners were there.
Maritz Trompettor  who was my fathers brother  had been in the same camp for half a year by th en.
A friend of mine in the camp befriended me in this month  you know.
He said  ﬁLet me in  I am very cold  and I want to go in with you tomorrow to work.ﬂ So I took him in  I gave him something to eat  he warmed up  and I gave him some clothing  and in the morning he blended in with the group  and went to camp.
It was bring them -- and a camp was started with POWs.
And at the office  lets say  I and maybe another tw o or three girls to help were giving out the clean stuff for the people  like because  you know  and they were responsible for the inside of the camp.
And so one day they asked us to go out of the camp and to go pick up some potatoes in the fields because – Ther e was no more food.
And from distance  we see the truck where on this truck  the children who will be taken to their own camp.
And when the war ended  somehow we were -- this camp was close to the Austrian border  and a lot of people were brought in  including some who had been in Maut hausen as prisoners of -- as prisoners in the German camp.
Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 19 Well  I think to begi n with  things were so -- when we first got there things were so unsettled in the camp.
SWB: We need to reload... [CAMERA RELOAD] [CR#3] SWB: When we start  just back up and restate that you had a choice between repatriation... HELEN FAGIN: Well in the displaced persons camp of Badgastein  we were given two choices.
And but with at with it you couldnt go anyplace  and we just found out that oh yeah  and of course this this man whom we call Opa  next across the street from that camp  those barracks  there was a not a restaurant  but kind of joint and he said  will you be coming by?
Then he was  the Polish army was nothing for them  so the Germans  the Germans took him to Germany to our concentration camp and he was there  we was survived  he was liberated by the English army.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 24 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: reality.
Um  Germans  um  doing um a lot of office work  because that was their office of running the uh  the camp  so that's the people that were in the o ffice.
But we had relatives in Israel  and they told them to come.
I saw Goeth many tim es and as soon as we heard he was walking in the camp  I was running away because we knew he was target shooting  he didnt care what you looked like  he was just target shooting  he wanted to see how close he could shoot or how far he could shoot.
It did enter my mi nd that possibly my fam ily  brothers  sisters  parents were among those that were buried in that camp but it was also rumored that some people survived by being shipped to other camps.
So then we went to Vienna first and then [indecipherable] I was to get to a displaced camp  and we knew about two displaced camps in Linz  Linz on the Danube.
But -- and then there were aktions when they were really just killing people on the spot and when they were taking people to the extermination camp.
Within a month  they were transported by the Nazis to the Bergen -Belsen concentration camp near Hannover  Germany  in preparation for the eventual departure from Europe.
I' ve been back to the camp -- I went back there about five years ago.
And they sent the camp doctor  and he kicked the bed  he said  ﬁTheres nothing wrong with you.ﬂ But I was so weak that then they dont me -- me -- they didnt make me do the laundry any more  they gave me a broomstick  and I had to sweep.
And  you know  you experience what we i.e. what Israel is now Lebanon and most of the world does not understand the complexity of that are at work here  in terms of but I also  while I'm on that  let me before we were on camera  about Lustig saying to me  in an interview 15 years ago  ﬁYou know  Jews live in a camp.
That was their first transport to Auschwitz  to the concentration camp  first transport.
Were most of the other men that you came to the camp with young like you?
In camp  because a transport in 44 came from Auschwitz to our camp  and it was a and it was one from our city [indecipherable] Levenstein .
So that -- and I think in some ways -- in some ways I think he held it against me that I was free that much longer  while he was already in camp.
She got into the camp  frequented  before there was any kind of relaxation of the rules she got into the camp becaus e she was  obviously  terribly motivated to see exactly what was happening to her people in the camp.
And so lot of people who had been in there  01:30: we moved up into the main camp and particularly when the hospital units came in  transferred them out of there.
All of these issues -- I cant think at the moment of another defendant that  given the hope of prosecutorial ignorance  had a better defense in that he could rely on half-truths  rather than simply claiming to be in another place other than he was  or claiming to have been a combat soldier when he really was a concentration camp guard  or simply denying ever having served with the Germans  or in the Hajda case  as you saw  rather unwisely claiming that the information  though accurate as to his person  wasnt him  that somebody else was using his birth data  for reasons that no one could ever explain.
On the way back  we had to everyone carry one big rock on our shoulders to the camp because coming home  I mean to the barracks through the camp after the report  counting how many people are left  or how many the  the same amount of people is coming back who went out of the camp  they said  \ All go back to the camp  to the barracks  but the Jews remain.\
So when we arrived finally at night in the camp  it was already dark.
It was much bigger and we weren't allowed to go out from the camp.
But in camp - Then they took you where in the beginning?
This camp was about the worst bit of hell on this God's earth.
My father  my parents were separated in Auschwitz  and my father was sent on  first to Mauthausen  a very infamous camp  you will see a very part of the exhibit upstairs  where they had these huge blocks of Jews  and the inmates were forced to carry.
Those who clearly were beyond any hope  or those who were dead or those who were clearly beyond any hope  were  were in one part of the camp.
So -- And where -- if you were in a DP camp in Germany  how do you get to a boat?
And by that point  were there a lot of German guards  or was it few and far between?
You see  when the president wants to relax  we whichever president  they dont go into politics  you went to Camp David because that was the summer  or the relaxation for the existing president.
On the front of the camp was a placard  Arbeit Macht Frei  work will free you.
And in that same DP camp  we were th ere till January 1947 in that DP camp  from 1945 till the beginning of 1947.
And there were we didnt have any beds  it was just the same wooden benches as in an any other concentration camp  or prisoner of war camp.
Did you say to the DP camp personnel  ﬁIn order to get this people out  train them as such and suchﬂ?
We were liberated and after was a camp outside of Pocking.
Were you still in a work camp or had you come into Budapest by that point?
I was drafted and I was at Camp Sibert in Gadsden Alabama in chemical warfare basic training.
And everybody had the story to tell  and thats how we found out from people that we met  who told us about that particular camp and we pursued to find out who  if any of th -- our friends or acquaintances from the camp were in the -- in that particular camp.
All of a sudden  I'm naked  tall guy  swastika  black hat  must be a big SS man in th e camp.
And they to ld us what a concentration camp is  because some of them were even relieved just under one condi tion to leave Germany  y eah.
Can you tell me a little bit more about the  concentration camp before you ?
So anyway I met this uncle that I met with my father in camp.
I uh  they liquidated that concen tration  that particular concentration camp  in Dachau  that part of it.
You're absolutely right  because if I think of some of the troubles I had with the dissertation  because of the gruesomeness of the German language  which then describes certain situations in a concentration camp  I mean the word  it's zertrummern I mean  I'm thinking of all the things where I tried to find -- you smash something.
I was taken one day out from the barrack and taken to the commander's  from the camp  house  and his wife told us to dig a garden  dig the ground for a garden.
A few days after transferring out of the sick bay  the old camp for men in Birkenau was evacuated and it became part of the enlarge d female camp.
So they took them out you know and then they took us out of the train and they marched us to this camp over there.
>> Bill Benson: After all you had been through  this is the end.
Each block -- now the camp had -- was divided by one main road on each side of the main road  where USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 12 wooden -- the wooden barracks subdivided into blocks.
There was a mass even that uh took place in one of the blocks in my time  which I didn't attend because  you know  in camp  you didn't believe th e people which you  whom you didn't not know  personally.
And so they put her on another boat  and I think they traveled for a whole week over the Mediterranean  I dont know why it took so damn long  but she finally wound up in a United Nations rehabilitation camp called Jeandark  which was located in Philipville  in Algiers  North Africa.
Uh  we heard--but we were not told  we heard-- this is in rumors  that the camp was destined for El Saff.
He was someone that one might remember in the context of a small group of people in a small camp  where the indi vidual who was a Polish prisoner was -- was there for two years  both in -- both prisoner and guard were there for two years.
The men and women who were the guards in Auschwitz concentration camp?
It was a common rumor which turned out to be true 23 after I read up on it that the order from the SS was that in case of  there wouldn't be no evacuation of the camp in case the Americans come.
I think we were in someŠ a few of us went to the CzechoslovakianŠa civilian camp where men were together with women.
And we became so close friends that he was asking me and my camp sister who was in the same room with me that we should go to be his sisters.
So Drancy -- by that time  we in the south had heard of Drancy but did not quite realize the immensity of the camp and the tragedy involved in that preparation toward deportation.
So  I said to my -- ﬁI rather go out somewhere  but have a apartment ﬂ because if you stay longer in -- in the camp ther e  then they send you to a steady camp for unemployed people  somewhere in the -- in the -- in the Negev  or where  yeah  and -- in a tent  and you can stay there  as the guest of the government.
And so that was a miserable camp and whatever whatever comfort there was  we found in each other.
My step father  that my mother married in 1945 he was in Sobibor  in the uprising of the Sobibor [camp].
And one day I remember -- oh  and my friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him  he once said I got a good job  he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a German army camp  army whatever  maybe we can get some food there because five guys maybe they feed you.
Uh  the 300 women were in another barrack and the next morning we were brought to the original Auschwitz camp which we hadn't seen  and we got some food for the day and we were in another cattle train.
And if anyone had caught them or seen them going into this building  they could have been taken to concentration camp.
So non-Jews  when they were selected  it was only inside th e camp  it wasn't on the ramp  it wasn't in coming in.
And he sa id  so the older man  the British officer  wanted to know whether he could take  re ally get me out of the camp.
The train was moving slow  and they pushed me into...to this concentration camp  was a death camp...pushed me in and I looked out.
I invite myself in  because when I got invited uh coming in I say she had a father but he survived the concentration camp.
And we were just taking the towns as they came  and as we came to Weimar  thats where we came close to Buchenwald and Buchenwald was very close to the -- to this large city and we were told that when we were on bivouac there that there was a camp here  and that it -- it was a camp of -- of political as well as Jewish prisoners.
And they found out that we were in this camp  and Oesterreicher wrote to us.
There was barracks for men and there were barracks for women  and then the following day  they separated the group  because the people who worked in the munition factories went to the camp at Strzelnica  which was much closer to the factory  while th e rest of us went to Majowka  which was a larger camp  and from there people were sent to many different places of employment  whether they needed in the steel mill  whet her they were needed in the brick factory where I was in the beginning or whether in the electric plant or wherever.
The head of the local military government  a Major Ryan  now deceased  of German descent  was  thought that all the black marketers had their origin in the Landsberg DP camp.
Uh kitchen...we have to have...people have to work uh by uh in order to to survive...do everything by themselves in the camp.
Uh what struck me about that camp was that it was relatively nice  meaning that it was not  the barracks were different.
What it was is that when they got to the camp they found out that there was an open grave with planks over it  and they were told to undress  lay down on the planks  and they were shot.
So  did you think these Jews were going to be killed in a camp?
But there was another woman that was a seamstress also at that camp.

>> Bill Benson: Did you even know where he was sent?
Just like in Auschwitz  we didnt know what it was  what -- it was another place  you know?
And the sick camp was that you had those German cuts that was like 30 inches wide.
There were people in the camp who were very clever with their hands.
Tell me more about the  how quickly most people married and how unusual is it for your marriage has lasted and been very happy but did that  were most of the marriages [talkover] Let me tell you  right after liberation and in the displaced person camp  everybody got married.
There had been the Camp David meeting between Eis enhower and then Khrushchev had been to the United States and so they thought that there may be a break and we had signed the first US  USSR cultural agreement in January of 1958.
That night  or maybe the night before  eighty lawyers were arrested and sent to the concentration camp.
A small town  small European town  very pretty  very nice  and as you went down to the area where we called the DP camp was  ah you still saw those beautiful villas  you saw the beautiful trees  the beautiful area.
Getting back to the to the the camp  and the concentration camp  so you continued to pursue the Germans out of the camp?
Right  but the camp you were part of at that time was which one?
They just run away  the Wehrmacht army never came to th e camp who were fighting back.
We lived in Brooklyn -- we meaning Miles  Kris and I  we lived in Brooklyn and in those days you had to be assigned  when you go -- went to high school  having come from the DP camp where the high school -- it wasnt a diploma  but a certificate that I was already of high school quality  so to say.
I didnt have that luck  so the same thing after the war  people stay in Germany  the -- right away there was organized camp  they got what to eat.
And this DP camp  we stayed there  I don't remember exactly ho w long  but it was Christmas night  no  Christmas night  that we were crossing the Alps on our way to Italy.
When your daughter or your son was your age when you were working in the labor camp and all that  did that bring back the memories even more so?
And this had been men who had been working on the Majdanek Camp?
So  I came out when a new transport came in and I looked who was there and I saw who is from our girls who is from the camp and said Ruzia it's me and so I said it's good to see you and we hugged and I said who is with you and she said Sarah is with me and others.
I guess we knew that we...one group was going to go to Braunschweig and another group was being sent to a camp outside of Bremen .
It was a bloody battle in the camp  but there wasn't much we had to fight with.
And the only difference between concentration camp and and a prison camp was that they tried to kill you with by not feeding you.
Because we had  in my prison  in one of my prisons somewhere in Germany  we had one Jewish person who by error  by simply error  had landed in a prison instead of the concentration camp.
Maria  you said that people didn t talk about their camp experiences.
It was then a civilian camp -- was internment camp with barracks  but it was a civilian camp.
He went to the co lonel  the company the the th-the the the camp commander and he told him the story  so I didnt have to re-sign.
As a matter of fact there was in the camp a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke German.
So  it wasn't a tremendously successful thing for me  and besides which  I didn't work there very long because I got sick again  and I came down with Para-typhoid  and this was the last  these were the last weeks of the camp  and  if anybody ever tells you that you cannot survive without food for a long time  I don't think that we were given any food in that camp towards the end of the  the  the occupation.
We find out that they took us we went to Buchenwald in the concentration camp.
We heard later  when we were in the concentration camp  we -- when we were liberated  that was the first time that we heard about Tito and the partisans.
The column wa s a long column of the prisoners from the camp on the Czech border.
So as a assistant  they did not part him with the doctor and it was asset to have the doctor in this camp over there.
The political department was  you know  chief of the political was and -- but in the political department  you know  the clerical work was done by the prisoners and the camp itself  the compound itself  all the evidence  all the registration was done  everything was done by prisoners  by prisoners.
And  so  in a DP camp  the director has to make difficult  impossible choices.
The Germans said evacuation ; take what you can and let s go.
was taken Everybody would everyone had gone my to the contra concentration camp.
And lo and behold  she was sent to a labor camp  to Sudetenlat  which is in Czechoslovakia  and uh... Um.
Were very proud because only two organization what I told you  Zegota  which take care about ba -- kids -- babies  you know  and the ‚nother organization is Zoska which get the Yad Vashem medal after a long time  because the guy who take care ba -- from our organization  they -- in the be ginning they -- Yad Vashem organization told that we have to liberated this concentration camp because was on our way  and t-then we explain  no  we dont have to  because we have two different ways.
And then we used to come back to the concentration camp and be counted again and then they took us and then they gave us some coffee and bread again and we used to retire to our barracks.
Now we saw we would have to leave our hiding place  but we were in the middle of the camp and the fire died down.
And on the other side of that was barbed wires  and then the entrance from the back was guarded by two guardhouses on each side of the road so that -- separating it from the camp proper.
So we was walking the whole night until a certain camp  Gleiwitz.
The nicest part was also we could get permission from the headquarters  inside the camp  to send out  let's see  a group of two or three men  to go near the store which was located in the vicinity.
Anyhow I...the news was that they arrived in some camp  and were taken out and sent to Chem to work.
There were rows and rows of barracks  and we were marched into the camp and were allocated into a wooden structure of a barrack.
Well I guess one thing I was -- Im -- I was al so asking is that how -- how were the small ways -- what were the smaller things that you did on a day to day basis in the camp that kept you going?
So the camp allowed us children to go outside the camp  or ma -- or the police  the milizia was there  the soldiers  they had booths in front of the camp in a few places.
And she found some people from home who were not Jewish  but they were also transported to this camp.
He was in a concentration camp  as was Lillian   my sister  but she came back to Poland and got a tuberculosis  and she died from that.
And then you eventually got to the vicinity of the Ohrdruf camp  and you said you were staying in a village and that a man told you there's a camp 3 miles down the road.
We had Hungarian Jews  Rumanian Jews  Czech Jews  and also Greek Jews in this camp.
They knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews  you know?
Then they gave us the con centration camp clothing and I was tattooed.
I think they had a connection in Philadelphia with Brith Shalom was the brotherhood that the Krauses were part of  and that ran the camp  and I think they had  at one time had a connection with that  because I think they were originally from Philadelphia before they moved to Texas.
And so we lived with in the in the camp with this and we were taken to a labor camp  to a labor to a factory to work.
But while I was in this camp  there were some Slovak girls who worked in a munitions factory and there were some who worked in the commando  in the crematoria commandos  who wanted to bomb those crematoria  but they needed the material for it.
It was quite a coup  actually  I was the only officer in the camp.
As the Germans got...got...as...the Russians performed their attacks against the Germans pushing them from east to west  so the labor camp people...the labor camp laborers  Jews  were always pushed together with them.
Tell me what kind of a camp Treblinka was  and how it differed from other concentration camps.
Yiddish is our language  concentration camp is our passport and that's that.
My mother in the camp  she wa s sterilized so she would never have they way they put it to her -- so there would be no more Polish bastards born in the world.
To concentrate all the Jews in one camp on the island of Arbe [ Croatian: Rab].
In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the camp because I was postmaster  it would have been considerably possible  like in Auschwitz later.
So  I was se nt to one camp for tw o weeks and one of my sisters was sent to another camp.
They came from camp too but they were more mature women than I was and they knew exactly where they were going.
I went to the shelter and when I sought my release from camp they said for people like you we dont have a space in the shelter. [
By that time I already knew -- knew about th at theres a -- there was a concentration camp in Auschwitz.
So we wanted to see if we could find -- see him  just to know that he was alive  but -- and so we went outside and whomever we spoke -- and we tried to attract attention with -- in the mans camp  which was separated by a road and he -- we couldnt get them.
The problem was that wed had no means of br inging those potatoes to the camp.
What was the rhythm about that camp which sounds like it was some sort of small town?
And like lunchtime  the American came into the camp  and they start to people was hungry  you know  they wou they we went to the to the military  says  give us food.
They had part of the camp where they had Gypsies collected from Europe .
28 Yes  that was '43  I think it was '43 because we didn't stay too long in the camp  I think that was all '43  this was the most dangerous time '43  to be caught.
She came to us from Bergen-Belsen  a concentration camp up north  I thi nk on a British.
So my mother decided to apply to the German military camp to get this ID that she felt would be a little safer.
Q. Can I go back to the camp a minute firs t?
But in the meantime the Germans sent in more prisoners from Terezin to day to be at th at familial camp to fill it up and then what we didnt know was the invasion of Europe  you know in 1944 when British and went to Dunkirk and the Canadians and so on  they started invading Europe.
So  I asked around  and I was told that not far from a little town by the name of they had some kind of camp like that was a Hunga rian refugees.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 17 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: other working places.
07:16:22 Now  at this time  in this camp that you were at  where you were doing the tunnel drilling  were people being taken away and executed or gassed at this camp?
But after half a year  they had decided the whole camp to anihilate.
We had a normal childhood  my father was always off to a YMCA camp.
Tell me a -- so you -- you marched for three or four hours to the camp?
This was already in the displaced camp s  after  after the war  the displaced concentration camp.
Flip Tape] Irving: Sometime in 1943 we–they brought in the pe ople from the small ghetto and combined the two camps into the camp of the–from the factory  from the weapons factory  combined the two camps and shortly afterwards it became a c oncentration camp.
There would be  instead of a hundred  there would be two hundred  three hundred  four hundred  and the Germans would allow this to happened because um  at any given time they would come with a truck  and just load up whoever they could find in camp that particul ar day  and ship them out to Treblinka if they didn't have an  a full transport or anywhere else.
So even there  after that happened  they were charming to us  I mean I was a Miss  but the Jews could not live in that camp with the Poles.
>> Manny Mandel: My father was in labor camp  I described before.
By the number  we could identify which transport or which camp that person was  and I saw this number and I knew that he was in one of the camps where I was  which is Buna  and my brother was there.
But I kept to myself in the camp and I...uh...keep myself as clean as possible which was pretty tough task in itself and I managed to...to kept myself always on the upper echelon because I...I associated myself with...with people and...uh...you know  12 and...uh...we managed to...to overcome.
When you ge t into the camp  are you separated from your brother and your mother?
You know  youre a young girl  you come out of a camp and you gain a little bit of weight and -- and you think the world is all yours and here Im -- I may not have had much  but I dont really want to wear those ugly shoes.
I don't remember  there's so many de-- so many accidents -- incidents that happened in camp what so horrible I really don't come to fresh in my mind to tell what it is  but stories like that happened almost every othe r day.
Did you hear rumors and know what was going on outside  outside of your camp?
We would be able to bring that news back to the camp.
So our plea to them was please get these kids out and let them be situated in a separate camp.
we just came and I think they waited for the visas for something  they kept you in sort of isolation for a short while and there 06:30:30 was space maybe for 100 people in this camp  we were 400 in this building.
We very sociable in camp  you know  because we wants to share.
However  after the 9th of November  Kristallnacht  he was arrested and sent to the concentration camp.
First I went to Camp Kilmer  and from Camp Kilmer I had another incident when they said th e Jewish Jews are leaving and I told Mm-hm.
But in this camp I have the absolute conviction that these Jews had a sense of impending doom.
My girlfriends says the next morning  ﬁI want to go to camp.
We were all on our own  and then we heard that the Russians were going to come  that the Russians were going to come  so they had to take Schindler away  because people were afraid that the Russians may not be so happy about him  so they got him out of the camp.
Came the Jewish doctor  and as you probably know  the curfew was 8 o clock  nobody could even was even allowed to open up the door of the barracks  not step out  or anybody allowed in the  the camp.
Because when we got back to France  we came to a camp called Camp Lucky Strike.
And this day--was one day in 1940  must have been in October  was already after the Jewish holidays--they came with trucks  and liquidate a half of this camp.
At that time  Russia held about a quarter of a million Polish soldiers in it prison of war camp s. Russians wanted to use those men to defend Russia .
And we ran outside and in a distance ..sniff..we saw a tank  a single tank  American tank and they did not they did not ride into the camp or close to the camp.
Carol: Yes  thats right that was in camp and so they quickly hustled Marc out of there and then of course the guards picked out whoever they wanted.
Interview with Helena Knapczyk May 10  2013 137 Is that where the camp was?
But we still have not faced reality then because in concentration camp  in Auschwitz  I was with other people.
And so in this particular case it was made easy for us because the defendant stipulated to all of the horrors in the Treblinka one camp.
Let me ask you a little bit about how the hospital  in so far as you know  how the hospital was run in the womens camp.
And nobody took me  so they all left the camp  and I had my little doll that Bronka made me  which at that time I think that was leg missing  hand missing  whatever.
>> Bill Benson: And you would continue in these circumstances until 1944.
Well  my sister-in-law and her aunt  bot h Auschwitz survivors  and they were in Germany  my brothers wife and her aunt who ju st died lately.
Before we were deported a relative had given me ski boats and I was wearing these ski boats all through my time in concentration camp.
I come to the camp and who do I see through the fence he is in that camp but I didnt approach him or anything.
We honestly believed that they were taken to another camp where they have children.
So and so -- I know so and so participated in the murder of 350 prisoners on the day that the camp was evacu ated.
>> Bill Benson: Your family wouldn't have known  even if they offered them the bribes  that  in fact  they would have done that but in this case they did.
And met my first -- I was a refugee of -- myself at that time  really in the camp.
They did make a tunnel under the barbed wire fence so that they could crawl out into an area that was close to the woods and make a run for it.
Pause) [They're going to change the reels so when we resume we're going to go back to the camp again.] [
Well  let me ask you something  be -- betw een Gurs and Labenne Oceane  did you go to Camp Albi?
Being that our names were known  because of our passports and our ci -- citizenship and everything  we were selected as the ones to be taken out of the camp.
A. I didn't know what I'd do with my life  but I knew I was not going to carry my education from concentration outside concentration camp.
I ha d been sent to the summer camp as did  my second sister was sent.
And then he said  \ Well  be aware  you have just come in to the concentration  concentration camp of Auschwitz.
We were already covered with lice cause that transit camp already was filthy.
Now there was a camp that  there was a working camp.
Before -- the Russians were very close so they wanted to send everyone who was in camp away.
Do you remember being afraid on that train  as you were going to the camp?
And they brought him on a stretcher into the gh -- into down there -- to the camp.
Just all sorts of  maybe some in fetal positions  lying in the camp.
First of all  the food always the same is  on the camp.
And I'm at a fact when we are so far we knew we go to run away  we put us up a --------------money on my leg and uh  in my belt things like that  and uh  and we took this with us  what happened to be also helped us when we got out of the camp.
Well about three weeks later we all got moved out of the camp to nearer the factory that was  what was being built.
One of the places was to go to the deport camp  sometime s for whatever problems.
So -- And what about -- Id heard that there were people in that camp who had been experimented on surgically by the Germans.
Who came to remove it  but the Jewish boys 42 from Janowska street  from the concentrati on camp  being supervised by Germans and Ukrainians -- being beaten there  cussed  yelled  and you name it.
Of course someone was near me trying to put a hand on my mount to prevent me from yelling  and then everything around the camp was talked about and known.
When we arrived in that....that camp  by the name of Meuselwitz .
So  even so it was all lies  but you read a paper  you know what this meant in  in camp to see a piece of paper.
So we brought him back to the camp and they says  \ You got a live one?\
After the liberation  I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to America  why did they have to put us into the DP camp.
But when we went back to Poland  I tried to find out what  whether it was a camp or a factory  what happened to those people in Czesto chowa and I just couldn't find it.
But eventually he got permission for me to  to get out of that labor camp.
We got here in the spring of 47  and I went to a very fancy girls camp in Maine  that my daughter subsequently went to  thats still there  and if I had granddaughters  theyd be going there.
.and you said you were taken in... you were taken into the gas chambers.
And when I was sleeping in  in the woods one time  I was thinking  when the Germans come in  I will kill me  I don't know if had the courage to kill me  but I thought  I'm going to cut my veins  just not to come in a camp.
While we were in camp  I tried to take care of him as much as I could.
But I wanted to know what their first name  their s econd name  what they want to do in America and all these things but we  where  what camp were they but the camp was a name and nothing else.
And across from us was a camp with English prisoners  and they looked just as bad as we did.
Werent really afraid  we were very uneasy  bu t we didnt realize  until my father came back from the concentration camp  from Dachau.
Tsippy  you once said to me that before the family camp came  you knew what was going to happen to them  how?
The first thing  I was very unhapp y  I came to a country -- see aft -- would I come straight from a concentration camp  I would be very happy because I would have to eat  I wouldnt be chased.
At the time  the camp  the N azi commandants who were in charge of the camps  were changing all the time.
And then during one night  the Hagenah they came and they took  no they came out of the camp and they were hidden in the darkness  in a certain place.
Over there in the...in the bunker camp because we had enough water over there.
It was -- it used to be POW camp for Russian POWs  and they already evacuated too.
And then he was hung in Auschwitz itself in the camp  facing the camp.
We had that and there was nobody was going to object to taking the women camp now that the Americans were all there.
I said: Please tell him again that we are responsible for this camp and that I am personally in command.
And I don't know  is it because the type of camp they were running at that time was a  sort of a holding camp for people that they wanted to use for some other purposes or whatever.
Also  when it was finishing we had also a big epidemic of typhus.
Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8  1993 50 To Niederbayern  to Bavaria in German  and there it was a DP camp which were never worry in the DP camp because we rented a r oom with a German family.
So So in other words  it was a show camp only sometimes.
There  they were restoring the facilities and cleaning up and they were doing the buggy-lugging when they burnt the camp.
And he was in the hospital from th e labor camp  because he had very high fever and they put him in the hospital.
They found out about your attempt to break out  and eventually you were sent to -- to the concentration camp Flossenburg.
If somebody escaped or so mebody did someth ing or something happen in camp  if somebody escaped they found them.
So that when you were in Auschwitz one -- Yeah. --
Did the camp office workers have to go on roll call?
Walking to the outskirts of the camp  where there were craters from bombs that unexpl -- finding unexploded bombs  or going to -- I remember there was -- there were like warehouses  huge warehouses on the outskirts which had been bombed out  it was dangerous to even walk in there.
And when we came there and we saw the trucks lined up  German trucks.
She took him to Vichy  they call  and she was hiding po the war  th-they because th ey when the Germ an came in to France they took all the all the Jews to the to the camp.
You have to be kept in a concentration camp  in a work camp  until the war is over.
And they had -- also they had Russian prisoners there  pr-prisoners of war  I suppose.
And at that time  we really didn't know what Auschwitz was except that they were sending people there.
So  yes  again  I was fortunate to get out of and get to   which really was not a concentration camp.
And if somebody died when we were at work or was killed  we had to carry them back to the concentr ation camp to be counted  because we knew we are accountable.
And I was very active in Jewish causes  going from displaced persons cam p to DP camp.
So -- About how long were you in Frankfort [indecipherable] Well  we were -- in the fall of 1945  when we couldnt stay in that tent camp any more  they asked us where we could go.
Were you aware of any dissention among the survivors in the camp within each nationality?
Thats this camp that I mentioned earlier  and never heard from them aft -- after that.
And after several days were sent to a Aufangslager reception camp at Ayresfield  Berner Oberland.
As a matter of fact  most of the time when I was in camp  I went to church on Sundays.
CE: [indecipherable] started shooting way ahead time  because there were some rifles  some of the people from the camp  they were -- already had some rifles.
And then a the new people was always in the front of this leader from the camp  you know  he was the So youre talking ex cuse me  now youre talking about your hometown  about Chzanow ?
Because every four weeks  two big  burly SS people would bundle me up  take me on the train  we would go to Mauthausen  120 kilometers in the train and I would be taken out to 47 the Politische Abteilung74  Gestapo office outside of camp.
They have houses.... A lot of people were in that camp what I told you  Natania  where I lived - were living two or three years over there.
The period you were on the run  fr om when you escaped from the Polish detention camp until the time the Russians caught you.
So  you know  it took days  when we were sitting down for dinner or for breakfast or something like this  you know  and we memorized it  you know  wh-when -- last time I had breakfast in -- in this and this camp  you know  and it was like this  it was like that  you know  and then we had to go to work outside  in March and it was raining and it was snowing  it was cold  it was freezing.
And he was telling me  look  first of all  it was a labor camp  physical exertion; a lot of people are not used to that  physical effort.
So take care because in the forests around the last night went many transports from France and from Greece to the camp  to . . . \
I dont know whether I shou ld go into  she was killed in the last days of the ghetto and her husband was transported to the Belzec Extermination Camp in 1942.
So I went to my Commanding Officer and I said to him  \ Colonel  is it true that all camp commanders and post comma nders are notaries.\  \
She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp.
They were liberated by the Americans  and -- Were -- you s -- you said that your cousins were in your -- in the same camp?
You had mi where was this Well  they were they all wanted to get out of it  out of the camp as quickly as they could  yeah.
We have -- those guys something in common with me  they were not the camp  eith er.
If you knew him yourself  in a camp  or so mething  I think.
So what -- do you have friends there  in the camp?
Serbian is not that different from Polish  and in the camp you learn to volunteer all kinds of things that you never thought you ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 would volunteer  so I volunteered and I became an interpreter there.
I don't know whether the whole camp or not because I don't know  what the case was.
Oh  th -- we were talking about Auschwitz and how the evacuation -- Yeah. --
In Tabora  those members of the evacuation who were to stay in a camp left.
That was the extent we knew exactly what's going on in the war to this point  that people are killing Jews.
Percy said  work camp  what the hell is a work camp?
Just after I think two or three days  Im not exact -- so sure now  I got a phone call from the camps commandanten  from Krakow military camp.
Okay  okay  so And then we come to Rhodesia  and we come to the camp.
And  you know  being that Co rnelius was with the Joint  and part director of the Joint Dist ribution Committee  I got an apartment in the displaced camp that they had a telephone.
Is there anything else that comes to your mind about this camp  before we leave?
But this group was very religious and every holiday  the camp  they show--they tell us that this is Rosh Hashonah  Yom Kippur  something--holiday  you know.
Very much so  cause the Spaniards had been there for about three years  three or four years  since the end of the Spanish revolution  and theyd pretty much settled in and made their own position there in the camp.
I mean  I didnt me -- y-you know  they weren't always -- they were - weren't even treated as -- as -- as pris -- as prisoners or anything.
Sounds good after carrot shavings and -- Yeah  yeah So  so where did you liv e  was it like a DP camp?
And after two days  I am going because we have a a a washing you know  the one room for all camp  you know  that you go to  you know  wash yourself and all this.
There was no need to conceal our arrival uh and they were aware of the possibility that they wouldn't fare very well if they were still in the camp uh when we arrived...from two sources  from from from from us  from the soldiers and also the uh inmates.
Tell me how you -- how it came about that you left the camp.
They caught a lot of people and they send us to Ard-ju-los-so-mia   a camp.
I never considered myself a surviv or  not having been in the concentration camp.
Then after all this  waking up from this anaesthetic  we walked back for almost close to two miles to that train to take us back to the camp.
But  yes  the guards; every camp that we set up used to have certain guard posts.
>> Bill Be nson: So it was what they called a transit camp.
And uh  there were cases  for instance  one day uh I'm in the camp and I look around  a big Commandant passes  going into the main camp  and he stops me  calls me to the gate  he says uh  \ Campoldest  what's happened  how come those  those people ar e around here?\
You was in a camp  you got a good time?ﬂ They didnt know it was a concentration camp.
Anyway I ended up in prison in Amsterdam and then a Dutch concentration camp which was worse than anything else.
And he only wind up in camp for the reas on is this: he was against Hitler making a pact with Stalin.
So he came out with an order  if they come back you can search them  you know  when they come back from work  but during the time that they are in their surroundings  in their camp  you are not to enter there.
Because of his great services which he rendered to the German camp he was not executed or anything but he was sent to fight the Partisans in Yugoslavia and he was killed.
As you know  about 85% right away went to the gas ch ambers; about 15% they went to the camp.
When you got taken out of the ghetto and went to the forest  when was that?
Somebody in the camp  I don't know whic h camp this was  but I think it might have been the one in Quebec  took--smuggled th e camera and put it in a shoe box and took pictures.
I went into the shop  in the camp ashlasser and -- and -- but not to have -- to have flight  because of -- when we have li -- been living 20 years in the same house  it was too da ngerous.
On the way we stopped by in Poland  in Lodz  and there where we found that my mother has uh  right before the liberation she di ed in concentration camp.
Which was much better than we had in Auschwitz  or any other camp.
My father was drafted first t-to the ar to the labor army  labor camp  to to labor work.
We were taken off and landed in a camp  in a tent camp which from the air looks like -- like enemy Army camp of course except there was barbed wire around it.
Then we marched on foot a few miles  about five miles to the Gusen camp.
There was an dist inction between an extermination camp and slave labo r camp.. An extermination camp was a factory of killing people.
There sponsored us again  the camp  but we didnt know that.
There was a Jewish guy who had worn a British uniform  who went around -- it was an officers camp  actually.
Well anyway  so we went on the train  and w-we passed through Plaszow  and we saw the people on the -- in th e -- in the camp uniforms  in the depression and the -- it -- it was very hard to watch that  very  very hard.
So I kind of sneak out from that camp  you know?

I resumed work in the camp  but not for long  because if we arrived in February  on May 5  1945  the Soviet Army came and liberated the camp.
In a camp  there were a husband and wife  and as most camps  as -- especially concentration camps  there was absolutely nothing to eat.
There was something in the beginning where he said the veterans wouldn't be sent to the camp  but you know that wasn't -- he didn't hold to that.
So they grabbed them out and shoot them and shot them and...and then they went to liberate the Russian camp.
In between  he did forced labor  when he came home from Buchenwald .
And summers wed join him in the camp  so we spent a very pleasant time in Seattle.
But when they took the people from the camp  and we know where theyre going  that wasnt -- that was very sad.
And before I knew it  all of a sudden I was yanked out from the work group and put with... We were about 13 in the camp who were still...uh mana ged to hide until now.
Arriving at Dachau  the people who you had lists of names -- first of all  you knew immediately who was in the camp when you took over.
So that's in general what I went thr ough in the concentration camp.
So in the Kassa  in the when I was in the slave labor camp  they didn't do much and but I heard that they got they I find out where's theyre from the ghetto actually they took the Jews into a brick factory about 30 000 of them from Kassa  from the area of Kassa  Koıice.
And he took us from -- from Haifa  from that absorption camp to the home that he lived  and he lived in a Arab home  which was left by the Arabs that left the area.

RJ] About the second week of January 45 and we were hoping that the Russians would release us because we could hear them fighting up the road  several miles away of course  Jerry walked into the camp and told us to pick up what gear we could carry as ﬁwe are ma rching you out.ﬂ They stuck us on the road and  apparently  it was one of the worst winters they had had for fifty years.
So I think that it became very -- then  it also became clear to us that my grandmother  when -- when she went to concentration camp was already some 75.
We heard there were these camps where they were concentrating Jews and torturing them and using them as slave labor  but the story that we would get was that a Jew escaped from a camp  went back to his hometown  and told the people about what was going on in this camp--that the Jews were being tortured and used as slave labor.
Next to the gas chamber  which was in Camp number 3  where we could never enter.
And I was the only one of the entire camp that was allowed at night to remain un -- with the steamroller  because I had to protect it.
And the lives of  of people who survived in that camp un til April 20  most of them were extinguished on May third by the British by mistake.
And then in that particular town  there was a camp in the forest  a camp.
In that Latvian concentration camp we had a lot of Christian prisoners.
Then I went into the camp headquarters where I met with that Brigadier General.
And so he said  this camp here  is is the west part he said  20 the main gate is over there.
So we we were was a terrible terrible time to was eh the the condition was just brutal in that camp.
They were always uh  uh  uh  uh making us uh believe that one day they will uh  uh come to the camp  a nd destroy every all the guards  all  all the defenses  and  and free us.
Never came back from it because when I went up there  I went to see him in Plaszow  in that concentration camp where it all ha ppened.

SL: No  that wasnt in the camp  that was in 1963.
Were you just in the Landsberg camp  or where did you go?
All I know is I was told that this is a prisoner of war camp.
At first I was able to keep them  at the first camp  but later on and on the death march I had concealed them there.
And your camp was in your country  or were you -- Germany.
When I asked her once why she did it  she told me  ﬁIn ev erything  I went in the concentration camp  I tried to keep my dignity.
Our faces were black from dirt and in 1944  at the end  it was in December  end of December  right before Christmas  they decided to liquidate this concentration camp I guess and because the war was going on...getting bad and they told us and the next day they took us out of the concentration camp  but this time we had to walk.
Then I volunteer to go to another camp b ecause too much was executions in Auschwitz  too much executions and diseases.
Many Hungarian  the Christian went to the army and the Jewish people went to the forced labor camp.
When you wrote these letters to your relatives  were you mainly at the Cohens or were you -- No  these were done -- these were written in -- in the camp  in the -- 125 But this -- this one  if this is -- The one that Im talking about  the one with the rosebud -- Right. --
And subsequently  because they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners  they housed us underneath the office  so that we would not be mixed with the population of the camp  however big or small it was  for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice  or whatever  we would be clean to serve them.
But Agde then had just been a sort of a holding camp to send to Rivesaltes out again.
I was already in the camp in it was   no Jews.
Now  my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen  the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the time...I was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said  \ Though (that's my Hungarian name) isn't home  we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son  Emmy  and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into labor camp.
We got out of the camp  we looked around just once more  on to the camp  and the bodies that we left there  that died there  and we just said goodbye to the camp  got on to the tr ucks  and they took us into the hospital  to the 96th General Hospital in Maison Carre.
Now we had  always was a fire  or smell from bones and meat  things that smell from  till all the  till all the camp even  and uh  but there was  in the summer was about a short period when was no transports.
And from there  from Steuthauf (ck)  they took us to labor camp.
He say  I only know that you are going to be in a different concentration camp.
And I was the one who was taken into camp  sent into concentration camp.
And in the very place where my father had been in a camp  in Teeveeai blast  my father had been in a camp for a brief period.
Next  this Russian   red army people  security  comes over to us and says who are you and we said we are Jews from a concentration camp.
So he would take the telegram out and tell us what was the latest stuff going on in Europe in this camp or that camp  or this ghetto or another.
He never came back  and probably afterwards was sent to concentration camp.
And this was a huge mess hall cona -- called a consolidated me ss hall at Camp Killmer  New Jersey.
I think the brother might have had three children  and that they - there was somebody in the concentration camp where they were  who had typhoid or typhus  one -- one of those two bad diseases  and that a lot of people in the camp were snuggling up to these people  so that they would c-contract the disease and be able to die of a disease  rather than what was obviously going to happen.
And they said  ﬁYou go over there  its a sanitorium.ﬂ And over there where Jewish people go  you know  come from the concentration camp.
But they chose them  and -- and they were allowed to live for a while  working the camp.
End of Tape One  Side B 49 Beginning Tape Two  Side A This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Leonard Gordon.
51 camp  nobody was there telling me  ﬁyes go  no don't go ﬂ and I went and there was this kitchen outside.
They thought thats to a camp  but as we find out later they were shot right away  and kids were -- be left without the -- without parents and s -- parents without kids and husbands without wives.
Because I dont want to know if they suffered a lot  and when I know what camp they went  it suffered more; and I hope that they went to a camp like Sobibor that they went right away to the gas chamber.
And then we got to this place  and there were more trucks.
And then we heard that they are evacuate -- ready to evacuate the whole concentration camp.
And I said  \ Are you Lager um Fuhrer of this camp?\
Interview with Tracy Strong June 11  2009 48 No  I they more or less transfer one camp to the other  and the camps are all different.
She was in a camp and she saw some horrible fate of children.
So  before  they did the same thi ng  they put them in a camp and ask questions.
We nev -- we didnt know that there was a camp -- we dont know what all this talk about Belsen is.
But it wasnt - in concentration camp we had metal kind of manashki   we called it  and with the handles so we could put it on a string and carry it all the time.
Now  in Feldafing there were already established camp -- DP camp for the survivors  and there was a lot of survivors from -- from my town  from Pruzana  who went through the Auschwitz.
But all these who were selected were later put on a transport to Stutthof camp  and there my wife died in Germany in 1945 on typhoid.
German) 3 Joachim von Ribbentrop 4 Vyacheslav Molotov 5 Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death.
Sometime in early August  my father came to visit me at the summer camp and he made a very long trip on a bicycle  thirty miles.
Now  could you tell  that the conditions in this camp were any different from other places you had seen?
In the country  there were people still--late arrivals--who petitioned the Italian authorities to send them to the camp  because it was the only safe place to be--for Jews. (
So we lived in  again  in...what they called the displaced persons camp.
But since camp  especially in the winter  was rather damp place - Auschwitz was a damp place  so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth  black cloth  you know  piece of cloth so that you couldnt see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not.
15 On August 6  1942  Korczak  the orphanage staff  and some 200 children were sent to Treblinka concentration camp in Poland.
I want to hear  still in -- about the details of your -- how you -- how you -- what you tra -- how you traveled from -- from Poland and what you did and I know you were in a displaced persons camp in Germany and -- Yeah.
So when our camp  it was time to march  my three sisters were able to march but I wasn't able with the other 26 people who couldn't walk.
The ones who were in that camp within the camp in Westerbork  they had separate boxcars again for reasons that only the Germans will know.
He was giving the order to the camp  a representa tive of his command of work det -- work work  like an department of work  an office where you -- where you apply for work  yeah?
A lot of friendship used to form that even todays survivors  that because they were in th e same room  in the same concentration camp: they were in the same truck  they are life-long friends because of a lot of survivors dont have families  they say that she is my step-sister  she is my sister  she is my ghetto sister; so a lot of friendship  we used to help each other a lot.
So thi by the time and it was I even met in January  or in February  two Russian guys who escaped from a concentration camp in Poland.
And about three or four -- three weeks later when we were in the - when the camp was emptied eventually and it was burned down and all the people that were in the cam p were now in this new -- in this new establishment  this young lady ca me up to me and said  oh  yo u are the man who saved my mother's life.
So in that way  many of the Jews that were spared from hangings and killings and beatings were simply spared by Oskar Schindler appearing in this killing camp.
Because also luck was that we were the only ones who were in camp.
And that British camp was a part of the United Nation camps  and they are going to separate us  so prepare yourself.
And I had the nerve  I asked for an audience with the camp commandant.
In France we have resisted itﬂ. We all  they called us all in   in the camp  house had the biggest bonfire of their life when that happened [LAUGHS] [DL] And this was just in the hospital where the music was played? [
After 18 hours we arrived in a brand new camp  newly built.
So we found out that there was a German POW camp outside of Linz  Austria.
And is that the Germans by the time they got to where thats why we were lucky we didnt end up in a concentration camp cause it was close to Russia.
That was going on for 2 and a half years in...in the camp.
I made some money in the all th ose places where I stood  I always look for a sometimes I worked in the camp  they paid  be cause the Italian government paid for that.
And we were ended up in Po cking  which I was told is -- the biggest camp was there.
He told me what happened in Auschwitz  that they burned people.
So they got all the non-Jewish Germans out of this camp and took the Jews to Drancy.
I mean I guess I just would say whoever  if you think back on the fact that I was born into a Germany– I think that my father was in a concentration camp.
So  there was a group of yo ung men  and one of them came with typhoid from but he didnt come with hi s group of soldiers  he came from another camp  but that was a political camp  that was not a Jewish camp.
So when you were saying that your father was never sent to a concentration camp  i-it was it was that he went into hiding  so that Well  fir we just learned that first  when Kurt [indecipherable] Wrote that  y eah.
One of our man his name was Finkel 25 went back to the camp where I was working and there was another hospital too  and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were what's the name other things  what do you need?
But they never got married  because he died in– they took him to Russia  that transport labor camp.
No   you have to get a -- you can't -- first of all I've never -- there are some people who so rt of live with their concentration camp experience; it's become an ob session.
And we -- the houses -- this was the city of where the camp is  Sachsenhausen  is Oranienberg  and we must have been in the area of that   moving away from Berlin.
There was nobody there  and they took  I don't remember how many  it was not as big as Auschwitz or Ravensbruck  it was a small camp.
01:21:18 As I crossed into France  I went to that camp and it was a preparatory camp  hakhsharah  4 where  where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyah5 to Palestine.
And do you know if any of the civilians were brought into the camp to see it?
But the next time the whole town did know  that there's a death camp  Belzec  35 miles from Izbica  and they're killing people over there.
The only way you could possibly escape would be from some kind of outside work outside the camp William Loew 4 that you could probably sneak out  but I don't know of any cases.
And  he  he was picked up  taken prisoner  he was an  an officer uh of ----------  I mean  the prisoner of war camp.
And this I made  to send it through one of the workers and guards in that camp [to my family].
But  as the time went by  eh eh we were getting a strange messages for the camp of Poles eh eh were contacted by the government in exile  the guy in London  and they eh agents who use to come and talk to us.
And I asked what it was  and those were the fires  not the...uh...crematorium fires  but the fires at the Buchenwald concentration camp where there were still people.
I said  ﬁIm going.ﬂ Like in German concentration camp  in those little camps  if they needed somebody to go to threshing  f -- harvesting or something  people were sent to s -- Auschwitz.
The next morning during the Appell...and Appell means the counting  they had the whole camp lined up.
And we have heard about it  and Mandel should have become the biggest sh ot -- big shot of the biggest concentration camp on earth.
There were nothing -- we met the American commander  who was over that camp at the time  Mr. mi -- Meyerhoffer.
All the Jews in Holland Š had to go  were made Šthey had to go to a work camp; weekends  sometimes home.
And the ghetto 01:28:00 population will be transferred to a concentration camp on the outskirts of Riga called Kaiserwald.
We went to conference  I will never forget  the guy wasnt aware that I was in camp.
You know  somebody could bring a paper back to camp or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had  but uh  we were able to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away and so we were sort of informed.
>> Al Munzer: They knew that meant being sent to a camp  in Holland  a labor camp.
And last time I was up there I saw– and I now have  or I came across my fathe rs  the certificate that released him from the concentration camp  which youve seen copies of  Im sure  other copies of.
I then got in t ouch with people in the camp.
Now the military camp...these kids were actually put into the camp and trained uh  as soldiers.
His mother and his He did not even know where his father his mother got killed in concentration camp.
And I said  \ I did to everything to the best of the camp and the people.\  \
Soon soon you went out of the camps  when we went out of the concentration camp and you see the Jewish people there.
So and this also is a recommendation from England  from the Polish hostel in Lothian Park  Pendred Cumberland  that my mother has left the camp to go to a hostel in Liverpool   and was due to sail for USA on the following day.
We have -- the family showed that they have intentions of leaving  they got out of the concentration camp.
So  how did you find out that the camp was going to be evacuated?
Not very long  maybe 4 weeks or 6 weeks I forgot  uh  where I used to clean the barracks so this was visible within the camp.
And one of my friends  she -- she wanted to -- to just walk out  and sort of a last farewell look at the camp  and came back and told us that was funny things going on out there.
Uh  this camp at Landshut  uh  contained  uh  I believe  almost all English and Canadian  uh  troops.
And one hid by himself in a cellar which he had built and he was discovered  but he was discovered after they took away all the Jews already  so as far as I know they took him to an interment camp in Budapest  but I'm not sure about it.
We were still on the refugee ship  but they send us to Milano   and from Milano they ca the English command the camp commander it was refugee camp  he called Genoa  he booked us a cheap hotel in Genoa   and on [indecipherable] ship Italian ship  he booked us a passage  and we had enough money we came to America with 30 dollars.
Well  uh change uh dramatically because uh I want to go to school and I couldn't go to school  so uh I study at home and I study uh with uh professor uh private privately because uh German uh take out  uh throw out professor from university  from Krackow  from and uh send some to concentration camp and some sent to our place and uh we have to uh take care of them.
And on this way going back to -- to this camp in Zazel  where we were once marching back from work to -- to the camp  we saw houses  lit  with people living their normal life.
My brother Haim  he was a dentist and he was first in a labor camp.
If you want to build the conce -- any concentration camp as a subcamp of the Stutthof  you have to organize  yes?
And then my father  they used to take the men for hard labor.
Oh  it was...Stutthof labor camp was a camp...a camp that we really worked very  very hard because facilities were miserable.
And uh  and I wind up  like I say  I wind up in Flossenburg  then in Buchenwald.
And when we got in the camp we stood there for hours.
But otherwise  if one can -- I mean  even when I was in concentration camp  the roll call there  to count up 150 men  sometimes they take two hours because they were so wicked in arithmetic  they never came out [indecipherable] didnt know.
But I never heard the name after I left until I began to ask people and try to research and find out whether there was a camp like that.
No  not that That being in a labor camp  you could do it.
Thats what I marked  I marked what I think is the womens camp.
The circumstances under which I left  I left Gurs was that a social worker from the OSE 5 came to see my mother and explained that there was a village Le Chambon  who was looking to help young people to take them out of the camp and would she agree to let me go.
Conductor  yeah  but its not like a conduc -- okay  the conductor was a young Polish guy  and my brother wrote a note that I am taking to a concentration camp to Estonia  and please save Rachel.
Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav Lachman  who was chairman of the camp committee  a wonderful man.
Frenzel was one of the worst SS's in camp; and he came to the camp  Camp One  and he went  with the whip he went in the barrack in and everybody was sick  had to go out and had to stay on the middle and I remember so vividly  was also a boy that I know from Assen  from another tow n  from the Zionist organization  and he was standing there and  and they all was standing on a long time in the middle on the camp and they all got shot  right away.
And then they sent a young  about 450 young men to Terezin to prepare the camp you know to make bunks and the kitchen had to be because it was a  it was a military time and so they prepared it and then the first transport to Terezin went in December 41.
But it was yeah  the Americans brought the the engineers brought a bulldozer from some other camp somewhere  and we just dug a big hole and pushed them in.
Inside the camp when they knew we were close  the French particularly led a -- well what would have been a mutiny  headed by a French captain who later became a general and a friend of mine  he just died.
Erwin Baum 5 December 5  1995 Page 5 At the liberation  I was liberated in a concentration camp called Allach near Dachau  near  near Munich.
But they may have had friends or so mebody  maybe they knew somebody  or they theyd just walk into houses and throw the people out  you know  take over the house  you know  they were pardon me  prisoners for of the Germans for a while  and they just wanted to get out of the camp  just get out of there quickly as they could.
Uh...Then...uh...also there was a horrible incident during my time in this camp and there was a group of people that was really very sick and delirious with fever of the typhus.
Now  a lot of people do not understand the concept of a DP camp and they say  ﬁWell ﬂ that you were in concentration camp and with barbed wires and  ﬁWas this another one like it?ﬂ Well  obviously a DP camp was not a camp surrounded by barbed wire.
That was the official date  but we left in September  because we were in Camp Polk  Louisiana and we were discharged there.
The uh British soldiers and I  I was able to befriend them  and luckily I wa s able to communicate in English with them  my school English was good enough  and they had uh  uh  uh radio set even in their camp  which was not far from our camp  by the wa y  which was not under the SS  but under the German army.
Although they did  the Army  I remember  did one day while we were there bring the mayors and the senior citizens of the -- fr om around Belson and make them walk through the camp  walk through all these dead bodies  et cetera.
Okay  so you were Yeah  they have in Teheran camp like for Polish people.
Another cousin from mothers side died also on the Soviet front  in a labor camp; I told you that the husband of my sister  they lived seven months t ogether; he was taken to the Soviet front  he has died.
03:06:33 In Munchen  out of the cam p. I didn't like that camp life.
Would they dynamite the camp and then blow us up or whatever it is...so we spent that day uh more or less in in tension.
And the people  bedraggled  and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet  would return back into Germany  and back  as it were  behind barbed wire  behind the camp.
There was a guy  he was in my DP camp for a brief time  and he went off to Paris.
Yeah  the uh  we would  we had all kinds of different work that was still in Auschwitz  but  yeah  I think so.
2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST Page 6 driver with a jeep and uh so we approached the camp in the jeep and the camp was uh had uh barracks buildings that looked like an ordinary army camp.
And how do -- First of all  I didnt -- I didnt know whet her he was coming back  given his age  and -- and -- and -- and seeing that at the time of the arrival  the very young  the very old  or women with very young  regardless of their own ability to work or not  the freakle finger deter -- I mean  who do you expe -- how do you e xpect that -- wha -- what expectation do you have that a 14 year boy will appear capable of concentration camp labor?
Anyone in relatively good health was taken -- loaded into trucks  taken to the cattle cars  -- you know  trains  and taken to the concentration camp  Treblinka concentration camp was -- I call the destructi on camp  was about 80 or 90 miles away from Warsaw.
So it was perfectly lawful to ha ve the camp condemned as a criminal operation in its entirety.
I just knew she...I said goodbye to her and that was it  so then  like I say  we were transferred to the  to another concentration camp by the name of Rivesaltes and there it was much the same.
Uh...By that time  my brother was already transferred to the camp because evidently they had no use  the Germans who employed these two young boys had no use for them  so they put them in the camp.
Essentially what it was  was a military barracks that was used.
So we are going to send you to a different camp.
I knew they were from the city of Radom and I onl y discovered recently th at the camp in which they worked was close to Stuttgart  so I got them all from Radom for some r eason.
She was saying how people were collected to a camp in Zagreb and they were released to go home and get their clothes or something  and it seems that while they were extremely cruel  within Jasenovac  that they were also very disorganized  and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one place to another.
But the Jews that were left out of the camp and I've checked this with other friends  so-called colleagues  that when they came out of the camps they did not kill Ge rman civilians.
And here I am after all of that  and not only the food we had gotten in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 camp  but they put some powder  either the tea or the soup which was more water than soup  they put powder.
And they started marching us to outside of the camp to a building.
And they were chasing us off that train  and bringing us to that real big concentration camp  which was   .
---I would like to take a minute or two and talk about some of the older people who were in the camp because  you know  I had uh .. I was young.

Landsberg was a prison camp  what Hitler wrote Mein Kampf .
And what they wanted -- they staffed  they used us f -- to staff -- as -- as staff for this camp.
And so theres a question of definition  what is a concentration camp  because its not always clear.
Mauthausen was considered one of the most severe German camps where first prisoners and the camp was set already after the  on the .
Uh we would get a a soldier...a German soldiers  not high in rank  about our age and uh as you bored in your interrogation  he would admit that at one time he had been a concentration camp guard  particularly a guard in the early stages of the concentration camp  before the extermination camps set in.
Medical facilities were in...in the camp were primitive  but all serious cases--and there were many- were taken outside the camp into the Italian military hospital.
And I took the wire  [indecipherable] wrapped around all the wires and brought it to the camp.
He had -- they had meetings  you know  and they make lots of changes there in a concentration camp.
The day before  I would say one day before the liberation of this camp  they managed  they managed us; thousands were driven out from the camp by our so -called tormentor s. I never ending that much from Poland to the vicinity of Salesea (c.171) to lower Germany  into Germany again.
The camp was practically led by communist prisoners  German communists  who had been there  the first ones in the camp.

Sometimes friends would come in and I would show them my my concentration camp jacket  and they would look at it and I would explain to them that this is not an ordi nary jacket.
I ga -- the pictures which I have  and there ar e only about two or three  I can see a cor -- wh-whe -- when -- when people were taken to Buchenwald  s -- as I understand it  you know  it was like a -- you know  it was already -- it wasnt a death camp as they subsequent became  but it was already a death camp  so everybody got shaved.

For instance  when we walked into our camp in the evenings  we always walked in with our hands up stretched.
Then later on the after th-the because of the police police and what they did  they wo uldnt come back no more to our camp  so we had to organ they had to orga nize our own police force.

After three 31 Oatmeal (German) 32 Camp (German) 33 Allowance (German) 24 years  because they didn't allow too man too many refugees to go to United States I wanted to come to America because I had two brothers in America.
Yeah  I did work -- since my first love always has been nursing  and I had a little training in Germany in Berlin  while I was in camp I had been sick quite often.
This was the Germans  or the ger -- Nazis  yeah  those were the Germans.
So that was Berlin and that was the camp at Schlattensee and that was the camp at Templehof  and then the trick always was to organize trainloads to go out of Berlin southward through the Russian zone and come down to Frankfurt which was in the American zone  and go into one of the 64 permanent camps that were in the American zone and there catch your breath and sort out whom you wanted to send further south to the Mediterranean to the French and Italian Riviera  both of them  where the Haganah ships came in to take the people who were willing to run the risk of the British gauntlet and most of whom were caught out on the high seas in contravention of international law  it didn't make any difference.
We couldnt figure out why  a nd another few days passed and then on April 15th  the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the Russians  and they managed  but they found us  as well  and they were not prepared for what 121 they found.
No  the is mostly  it's mostly learning to build fires  things just like the Boy Scouts  go out to camp and having some instructions and a lot of physical education  getting tough and some  within the group  wresting matches and things like that.
And one day  I was told to go outside  the outsid e commando  because they were always building tank traps because the H itler youth comes always with the ta nks over there were shooting against the Russian over our camp.
So if Americans know anything about the camp system  they know of Auschwitz.
So we line all up and we went to the main camp to Buchenwald.
Because I was in a in a camp when when the war started and the Germans took over.
And nobody was allowed to go from the camp  and nobody was allowed to go in.
So until they found him or dead or alive or you know  the rest of the camp has to sta nd at still stand and wait for that to happen.

But your DP camp was... The next  then we crossed the bo rder and we went to Italy.
I was the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my c ountry  in my profession  and when they were looking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material  and produce those red stripes on the clothing  which I explained in prior interviews with you  they preferred me  because I was a woman who worked with -- perform in the womans camp.
And so for six -- five days after we arrived in the camp  we were taken on HMT Dunera which was a ship that provided facilities for 1 500 soldiers.
It was like   you know  as if they were going to Israel  like it was going to be a -- a summer camp or  you know  a holiday camp or something.
And  uh we heard another of the men who became the head of our camp  and but he was a lower rank than Liepold  and he was not too bad  because the Germans at that time realized the end of the war was near  and they knew they will be  have  they will have to account for their deeds.
And they knew already that I going be transferred in that camp.
And they took us to the gypsy camp where all the gypsies were living.
They were too far gone and they died in the hands of their American rescuers  but doctors  surgeons  nurses worked 24 hours a day after their units had captured a concentration camp in order to help save the Jews whom they could possibly save.
We finished digging  they took us to another camp in Poland.
Howd it ever go back to us -- but anyway  this is just a reminder as to what happened to me  while we were in -- in -- in Berlin -- in the Displaced Person camp in Berlin  after we arrived from Poland  and after we cross the border to Germany.
Like I say  we were thousand  eleven hundred woman in this concentration camp.
And uh ...and I was allowed to stay in the camp; and uh  I escaped again the catastrophe.
So I knew Russians at the time  so I said I was from Minsk  cause I didnt want to go back to Poland.
We were picked up by German trucks that were coming back from the front.
We went to the camp Poroskov where my brother was and we walked through the fi elds and looked at the monuments.

After we -- so  we got concentration Bergen-Belsen  a city Bergen-Belsen  a military camp Bergen-Belsen.
Nobody believed it that they are doing things like that in camp.
Well there I found one of the girlfriends  I'm sorry  two girlfriends  my two best friends from the concentration camp I ran into in this same camp  in the displaced person's camp.
Probably  it was advertised or was called up on the people on this labor camp people relatives can come.
All right with -- you got that and now I speak af -- about my life after -- after the concentration camp.
She might have a niece or some  so she was very  very dow n with the idea of that she had enough already during concentration camp.
And then so mebody told him  in that camp may be somebody with that name.
It was not far from Dauchau  camp number three  I was.

Interview with Norman Coulson October 4  2013 42 But  for example  when you were making drawings in the office  since it was no longer a concentration camp  and people were being let go  what were you making drawings of?
I don't remember   but somewhere I found out there was a concentration camp in Austria and I never knew the name  and even now I don't know the name of it.
And I felt (you know) free in a sense that I did not have to fear for my life.
What happened to your family during Kristallnacht which led to him going into the concentration camp?
He 32 went to Ostrowiec  which was a camp not far from us  and they tell me that he was horrible there.
Those were during that particular march from the camp proper to the marshes  where we were to clear the marshes and the underbrush alongside the river.
They brought us into the woods and there were barracks prepared.
So then we were in the camp and we heard some rumors that the war is coming closer.
This was issued to me in January of 1947  when I was leaving DP camp for the United States.
This was like -- the ghetto was already -- no  the ghetto was not.
It was due to that lady that I survived Auschwitz concentration camp.
So  we must have just come out  because the area was right  and it was a fairly large women's camp.
Not -- of -- in any case  thats the stor y of my -- my entrance to the camp office  and it was relatively an im portant job  and we could do a lot  yeah  and we were helping a lot.
And nobody in our family -- some concentration camp s. It was a little girl  Marion   [Inaudible] so nobody.
It was a transit camp  transit to what...Transit forward  backwards  back home.
If you had a sp ecial thing that you needed  like some fruit and stuff for my mom  otherwise  you dont get out of the camp.
So I says  I didnt come to the United States and live like this  worse than even a camp  near a shoemaker with the smell and everything.
What wa wha-what is your most vivid memory of the camp?
And one of -- no  a few groups  you know  went together  especially was working for me at the slave labor camp  were three of us  very close  you know  we were helping each other in every way.
So  in January  they were closing the camp and everybody had to leave  so we were taken or shipped to New York  and we stayed at the place which was run by an organization called HIAS.
I imagine that there may have been some food because that was a different proposition th an later on in the camp  but I can't explain how we did it and what we did.
Yes  well  I was going to come to that  you know  where we were still in France and it was actually after the liberation  that a gentile friend of ours who had remained in Vienna  somehow got word that my father's mother had been deported  that they had the Nazis  the Gestapo had come to our house in Vienna looking for my father and when they realized that we had already fled  as a reprisal I suppose  they went to his parents house in  on the outskirts of Vienna and took my grandmother away  she was 76 years old and they took her to the camp of Theresienstadt where  we were told  that she had died and when they came  my  my  when they came to take Eva Edmands 16 [Date not labeled] Page 16 her  my grandfather  who was about the same age  had a stroke and he eventually died.
And then I was told two or three hours later he collapsed  and he was taken to the camp to the mislaifa  and he was burned together with the bletl.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: And sooner or later you wound up in a D.P. camp with your mom.
And I went ...there was a group in this detention camp.
We were doing a midnight check and let's say  we found 2 500 people in the camp.
I was in the camp in the beginning  near our hometown.
What actually happened to him  toward the end of the war  is that he and a number of other people broke out of the camp.
If I would go in a labor camp  or if someone  for example to Novaky or to some people they took there  and they were working  they were standing there  they were staying in no Novaky   they were working there for weeks and months.
They could 85 retain their clothes  they could retain their luggage  and they went into a camp which was from then on called the family camp.
In the meanwhile  the Germans came and told us to get out.
But the destination that we evacuated our camp  we came to a camp and it was called Auschwitz.
AG] Yeah well that was funny  I was there one day  and I got myself  found a spade  find out what the soil was like you know  so I made a little garden between us and er  I asked permission from Charlie Coward  the camp  camp officer  and he said yeah  and then I got some tomato plants  he got me some tomato plants cause he was  what they called a man of confidence  he was allowed to go to Auschwitz to  and pick up the mail and things like that  and er  I give him a bar of chocolate  and he gives us a dozen tomato plans  quite lovely.
One day I had a friend who just came from the same concentration camp with me.
She was sent on to another camp where she was assigned to slave labor for the Telefunken factory  electronics fac tory  doing the same kind of work  assembling radio tubes.
He opened up  or didnt did not forbid it  the concentration camp of Dachau   yes?
The bosses went to camp  but now they were taking them out to [?]
They were called kapos and these were German criminals who were told that in order to avoid jail or execution they would have to be guards at the camp.
We come to some place where the train--I am not familiar with the area--and we were loaded in the freight trains.
I couldn't do a lot of things that they did  but it was still better than being in a concentration camp  but I was very scared.
We were always on this sickly diet  what we had in the camp  you know  no fat and no nothing  and here all of the sudden we get this  got all sick  we almost regret it.
Yeah  at when when my mother and sister were escaped from the labor camp  they made their way down the Volga .
They had -- I got sick when I -- in -- I think two or three weeks into -- into the camp life  I got -- I think pneumonia and they -- they put me in the hospital barracks  that they had a hel -- hospital barracks  where they took care of you with m -- with medication and then from the hospital barracks  they took them to Bergen-Belsen  on the transport  to -- to put them in -- in gas chambers  so if that can explain anything  its organized disorganization  its impossible to -- to -- to get an answer.
And Annie was in France  Annie escaped to France and was in an internment camp  interned in Nice France.
The will to live  I was not ready to die  and I am the only one who survived of my whole family who went into concentration camp.
We kept company with him throughout   because from there we were ordered to go to Modena  and we were housed in the military academy  thats where they made a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 35 camp.
I was in Windsheim in a camp  and then I went to to the [indecipherable] and from there I went to America.
Stay with me for just a minute in the DP camp.
2 escaped escaped the camp 2  2  people  we don't know who.
They went to a place in Holland  like a camp  but a Catholic organization was taking care of them  too.
It was my decision to decide where  which camp to go to  whom to interview  which American officers to ask for cooperation.
That means that they are in that camp  that everything is all right and then something happens to them and because they die  they go to the oven.
After three weeks we were tattooed  counted off  and told t hat you will now be marched off to work in another section of the camp.
If it was a feeling against them  it was among people -- in other words  between camp leaderships and so on.
There are different -- I me -- is seet -- not a single group  but together this is the group -- summ er camp shortly before the war.
So  Maidonik I shoul d say was a very  very bad camp.
So they in the summer they send us to a camp where we could help  you know  with the harvest or whatever  to work there  or do something.
Did you see -- but you saw -- you saw -- you saw former concentration camp inmates as well?
But Gurs was near the Pyrenees which meant it was near the Spanish border.
Let's stop for a minute------------------- beep Okay  sometimes during this time  our camp was cha nged from what they called a labor camp to a concentration camp.
There was a small satellite camp for men and uh we were kept there for two weeks  really doing nothing.
I felt -- well  maybe someday if I come out alive of here out of the camp  I'll have it take n off.
This is one of the few cases where Ive heard that the Germans let a person leave the concentration camp to come to America.
Yes  but -- Or -- of -- of -- 18 -- I had the -- I dont know how I -- it was very se -- very special in Sweden  if you left the camp  you would be arrested  but I was lucky  so I was -- I was wanted in Sweden very early.
And...uh...the camp was divided into two sections for...one for men and one for women.
And they also were going to shoot my father -- father  with them  but my father was a foxy old man  so before he we nt there  he went into a closet  he pulled ours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans gave him in the first World War  pinned it up on his jacket and dug the hole.

When we a rrived in the camp we were assigned to certain barracks and there the barracks were much narrower  much higher  many more  more bunks closer together and instead of one person to a bunk  we were assigned two persons to one bunk.
When I went to the right  they took me into the uh...uh..the camp  they to ok us to a barrack  to undress  leave everything  completly naked.

And we were put on guard shifts -- I don't remember -- several hours at a time inside of the camp and around the camp was -- orders for no one to go in or ou t. There was a lot of typhus in the camp.
And when we came here  gosh  we were so happy  we sold that camp  even we dont need the camp.
So they had to package everything and ma iled everything to this camp.
So we spent some time in Sarafan ...the camp  and then we were moved to the Jewish Brigade group...uh...training camp in...uh...Ismailia in Egypt.
And I jumped from the run-- running train that goes to the concentration camp.
Was very hard winter and the Germans allowed the people from the barrack  they should volunteer to go into the woods - it was a forest actually behind the behind the camp and gather twigs for the stove in the - we had one stove  belly - how you call it - stove oven - and my mother volunteered.
And I was on a transport from -- fo -- after the Death March  we came into a camp which was close to the Russian border -- not Russian border  but Polish  Germany border and this cam p would have been liquidated in another week or so  and they started to liquidate  having transports going out there  which  it was wintertime and yes  wintertime in the eastern section of Europe is pretty strict  is temperatures below zero constantly.
The father had to have his nitrogl ycerin  which he didn't ha ve  and he died I think about two weeks after we arrived in camp  in Auschwitz.

laughs) And  uh  we were in an open truck to Leipzig where there was a very large DP camp  about 25 000  and there were maybe 25 Jews.
Is it... [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]  nobody wanted to believe any more because the information from the camp underground  or whoever was sending   Theresienstadt  the report what happened and then the predated letters  th e people in Theresienstadt and the world was confused.
But you know that the people whod been in -- liberated from camp one  when camp one was burned down  they were taken to the concrete blocks  where the German army had -- had been billeted.
And they came to our camp to talk to Jews about where they wished to go.
All the lawyers  engineers  and clergy was sent first to concentration camp  Auschwitz.
One day I took a ship and went there and the camp was already liberated  and I saw the barracks and all this  but until now I never really made an effort to find out the name of that particular camp.
Isolated  with the -- was a -- they were examin ing every day the stool  etcetera  and blood  so they know when people were well  and when they got well they were sent out back to the main camp.
Where people had to come from Holland  and from France  and I dont know -- know where from  to -- to be gassed in that crematorium  while the camp around -- They were not. --

Q. Three days before she had go ne to the camp  didn't they?
We were there in Stuthof  it was a big concentration camp; we were there for about six weeks.
Some people fr om  survivors  they went to towns  they went to business even there  they got married ther e. I mean  like in Minutehen   Deblin  and those big cities  so me of them got re-est ablished there too but my father was a  had a job and this was his profession and we went to this camp and we had it pretty good.
And all those builded up in me  such a anger  and the feeling of revenge  and I remember after a few days  I came to the camp with a pair of brown leather boots  which  not everybody had  probably nobody  and I said to the group that we slept together  I took my boots  wrapped them up nicely  and put them under the bunk bed  un -under my head  but they said  \ Why you put them??\
But the entire camp has to line up in a very empty field and they 21 are going to choose some people for work.
And then when we had the reception for examination at the doctor in this Lazarett  one of the guards  he say that just we're transferred from the Dachau camp.
So you felt that  at least I felt  you know  when you looked at these people and you thought  my gosh  some of them will probably be dead before the camp -- before the place is open in the morning.
When we had the right to visit  there were only French guards  and they were not nasty to the camp -- to the people in the camp.
So  I smacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back into the camp to the other side and there was a big hole.
In short  they had been rounding up people  and the following day they put us in trucks  they took us to a -- a c -- a mini camp  a detention camp with barbed wire  near the shore  Glif ada  which is a suburb of Athens  a s -- beautiful spa.
Now  when we came to this camp  Budzyn   they told us not to admit that you have a free professi on  except dentists and doctors.

The other one  the camp comma nder would come in every morning.
Did that experience  seeing the camp  s and seeing some th-the dead people who were who were stacked up  and also some of the live people who came and tried to to speak with you  did that ch ange at all  your understanding of the war  and why you were fighting it?

Like I said  we had these transports and they picked up the people who weren't productive anymore and I think those were sent to Auschwitz.
Zierice who was the commandant of the camp  told him: \ Well  you have 15 minutes to prepare yourself.ﬂ He said  \ Now  if this lieutenant lives  I will put you in the base hospital which is strictly for military personnel and you will be in charge of that  but if he dies  so do you.ﬂ And so Poloho operated and he was successful and the lieutenant lived and Poloho was then transferred to the base hospital which was a permanent building in the main compound.
Anyway  this camp was just recently set up  and most of the people who were infiltrees who came in from Poland  from eastern Europe.
We came back from the concentration camp  a matter of fact my winter coat was a German soldiers army coat that I shortened and somebody helped me to change the buttons that I should feel a little bit better.

Me and Julcia (Ester) Fiks who came at that time back from trying to rescue Chavka Folman from the Auschwitz concentration camp.
And this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didnt feed us the proper food.
In Buchenwald it was -- it was a big camp  it was over 80 000 people there.
Could be because we were not  unbeknown to us  we were not in the camp proper.
And we knew that a guy who escapes a Prisoner of War Camp is not 2 equipped with a map  and he's not equipped with a compass or anything like that because that would have been foolish to think.

They opened up our camp that was the bottom in Mauthausen .
I-I-I -- yeah  in -- in this camp  they divide it in half  half [indecipherable] for the -- were -- were liberated  and half were imprisoned.

So a  this neighbor of ours who send me packages to  to the camp  he also had gone up there a nd he brought home a pig and he slaughtered it.
I think -- I think it was in Westerbork  in the Dutch camp.
We met -- wh-when I say we  I mean we  all retired social workers -- not social worker -- all professional workers of the same vintage  w ithin a year or two  who had all worked for Ose during the war  either in the camp -- three of us -- four of us were from the camp and had worked in Rivesaltes.
And he was taking care on the sheeps  so he didnt went to camp.
We didnt get as much beating  but you still had guards with you  so you had to watch your [indecipherable] you couldnt talk to one anothe r. If we did  we -- hed -- in the evening -- they wouldnt bother you while you were ta lking  but before you left to go back to the camp  they would ca ll you into a certain area  you know  like an office where they were and they would ask you  why were you talking so much to this man?
When the ghetto changed into a concentration camp  do you remember that.
So my husband  who again  had a lot of freedom in Magdeburg and the camp  knew some Russian women who were wo rking in polter too.
So he had all these men  sent to German prison camp  including USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 75 my uncle  and he -- this -- the -- the German commander under him  Wehrmacht commander  the army commander  not -- not a [indecipherable] person  knew that his house was already full of people [indecipherable] anyway.

It was not probably a very long ti me because I think that it was already in May I was already in a DP camp.

But camp itself  and this is to me an amazing kind of thing to report  f olks -- instead of asking  I'm going to tell you.
01:12:00 And I think Jewish agencies  important Jewish agencies  like the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society)  and the Jewish Agency for Palestine became voluntary agencies under the supervision of UNRRA  who were to assign some of their people  welfare workers and others to our teams  to help the international personnel administer the camp and to provide services.
The one from the lager  from the concentration camp  Irma Hoffman.
But anyway  after some near the end of before this when they bombed Buchenwald in August  I was already working in inside in the ga in the camp  and I just watched thos e airplanes bombing with very big smile.
And there was a uh labor camp  and that is where they took us.
And we had a rabbi  a number of rabbis in the camp  but there were a number of rabbis around who would hold court on this.
Theyre still together and so they go in to the camp.

Plaszow  I just wanted to tell you  there were not only prisoners like us but it was a camp also of murder ers  burglars from the prisons.
When we arrived in Celle  they took us out of the wagons and they marched us for about two or three kilometers to the concentration camp.
We were in that camp for about two days  and one night we were told to get ready because pick-up time is going to be tonight.
So it wasnt just guards  and other POWs and local townsfolk  there were also concentration camp? [
Its will play another -- another role  not the Halleluia   but the Greek Grieg Solveigsorvike -- sorvike Solveig sung song in the concentration camp.
And I dont know if they ever found out who  because it was a chaos with the invasion  you know  the -- and then we were -- and there were big Dobermans  and we were pushed into the camp  and then we were in di -- There were Dobermans?
We were in that camp approximately between five and six hundred people.

He was an architect from Poland and he was now in the camp as an Architect Bureau and doing some kind of architectural work for the Nazis.
I was laying in this bunker for another two or three days and then finally the camp elder came and got me 9 and took me back to camp and it is something which I have never forgotten.
And my father was buried actually   in -- in a cemetery in the former concentration camp of Ebensee.
Then on September 19  on that farm where I was working  their name was Prosmueller  that was on either side of Linz between Linz and Vienna  just a -- oh  about four or five kilometer from the very well known concentration camp Mauthausen.
This was a camp  just a big grounds with holes where they were digging  some people were digging sand.
Im not suffering  Im happy  I dont need them  and -- but I did get myself examined  and they didnt pass th e law  whether you have something or not  you get the minimum  if you ha ve been one year in a camp  or more.
From then on I could do as I pleased and I went to live with a family of two doctors who had been at that camp in Barbizon.
That was what they called an internment camp  but don't believe it  that was a concentration camp.
I mean being a private in the army in Camp Ritchie  I was very impressed.
Now as I mentioned before  I was with my sister in law who was not really yet my sister in law  in the camp at that time together and she knew about this gold coin.
In concentration camp  somebody took a blanket--or what I say?--5 people took a blan- ket  tore it up and made Smata--you know what Smatas are eh?--to cover the feet--there were no socks--just to cover the feet in the winter.

Well  at -- at that time  to have people surviving from a concentration camp come to the United States  it was a rare situation  and the press ask us about our experiences in the camp and about the voyage and all that  because we were way overdue  on account of the storm that we had on the Atlantic.
And when I got to the camp finall y  [indecipherable] I lefting out some -- how I got there -- anyway  I find out that the people from Nyiregyhaza  my original city where I was born  all of them th -- one lager  in the same -- it was the C lager  in one barracks.

But then I got a letter from a doctor in   where the concentration camp was.
And uh we were there two years ago  and I asked what were...what were the camp s around there; and they told me there was a great many camps there.
So I was taken out of camp on July 25th  1942 and I was taken to a farm in Tareai  that is a village outside of Paris  where there was a farm operated by the Jewish boyscout s. Boyscouting in France was run along religious lines  so there were -- there was regular farm  which had about 50 or 60 young people  all foreign -- foreigners -- foreign Jews  who lived there in what -- End of Tape Three  Side A Beginning Tape Three  Side B This is tape three  side B  continuing the interview with Max Leibmann.

>> Bill Benson: And that's the same camp your parents were sent to?
Plus they had contact with the men outside of the camp.
The next lager was B. There was a family camp with the Czech...Czechoslovakia people...families  husband s  wife and children.
Those who were committed to the camp for religious purposes  like  for example  there were Jehovah Witnesses--were very -------- that were very spread out in Germany at that time.
And then was then th the problem was  it was German camp next to this  and I figure out they will see that somebodys running from this thing  they can run after us  you know.
And they emptied that  emptied that tent of all the shoes  and they started to bring in women and they established a separate womans camp.
Q. Did he come into the -- was he around the camp a lot?
We finally did arrive -- we finally did arrive at the destination in three days fa -- after three days Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 41you finally arrived in this camp  it was ve ry scary for me personally  with -- to see all these electric wires with the -- with the current would kill us  with seven foot tall  they had to be at least  or 10 foot tall.
Like one time I remember I was picked out to go with one of the SS and a couple of other prisoners to the nearest village of the camp.
So I told you that Sunday morning  on June 22nd  we were sent to the camp to...to Tirgu Jiu.
My brother-in-law found himself in a concentration camp for a short time on the very end.
Whole families came into the camp and these were all Jews  people  Jewish people who had taken refuge in France and who had managed to live outside camps  who had some even jobs.
When the war was finished  the day war was finished  we have to walk to the camp.
And we are in this summer camp  operated by some Jewish organization.

But I do remember that the friendships in the camp in dating  that you just mentioned as dating  friendships were very very deep and very sincere.
He and a little boy were walking in the concentration camp and  evidently  Goeth was walking towards him and my little cousin Janek had a hab it  he drove his mother crazy  when he was upset he would whistle.
Well  the fellow who was the head of the camp got hanged himself eventually  after the war.
And they then investigated in who he was and found out that he was active against the Nazis  so very soon after he landed in this merchant marine camp  he got an order signed by personally to be transferred to Auschwitz  and he came to Auschwit z in the uniform of the British merchant marine  and he was looking somehow to bring his message out.
And my father  from that camp went to Murnau  where is only for officers Okay.

But I would never be presumptuous enough to explain the horror of the camp  because I were not there.
Uh many tragedies  people trying to escape and being caught and and brought back and people executed but in the passage of time in spring of 1944 or maybe it was...yeah  it was late winter 1944 when...you understand that I was taken to this camp in July of '42 and about a year and a half later in spring of '44  the Russians were coming.
You have to try and imagine what it was like to be in Germany after the war when either you were a survivor of a camp and there werent too many remember you were somebody who had been encouraged to leave Poland  firstly because the Poles were still anti-Semitic.
And then  that time  I did go into Germany  because I wanted to see the displaced camp where we lived for so many years  after the war.
The the head of the camp  I mean  the the commander of the camp and and the the more important people were they they escaped.
So I measured out the whole camp  a nd everything  and made myself a line drawing with pencil  on the top of the desk  and put the number of the block in.
There were Jewish people from the ghetto who wanted to come to the forced labor camp because they believed there was a better chance to survive in the forced labor camp.
Whatever our possessions ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 were were under the bunk.
The SS didn't make any attempt to stop you as you ran out of the camp?
We were loaded mostly on open tr ucks and taken to the camp.
We did it ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 anyhow.
So they they came to to the camp  and they already knew that Polish army is being organized and where  all this.
It took Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 69me quite a while cause I didnt know where to look for the number of the camp.

A camp before this  we s -- as I said  we had to go -- board a transport to go to Sweden.
And in August of 1942 they were sent to Auschwitz and they were murdered as soon as they got to Auschwitz.
E-Everything was fine  until we got to about the middle of the distance to our camp.
The latrines were actually real buildings  wooden buildings  or brick buildings  147 behind the whole row in the -- in the womens camp.

And we went out from camp  maybe a hundred feet  maybe more  and he showed the four litvish gone.
Do you remember about how many people slept in that same area that you did in the barracks or whatever it was?
They pile it [indecipherable] behind the gate of the camp  and assigned us to different barracks.
It was the worst in Austri a. So  if it started in Germany  do you recall when you first -- when your company first came across a concentration camp survivor?
We are first we come to Marandellas  a camp for all refugees.
We heard a little  but in the second camp we didn't hear nothing  we didn't know anything.
And  of course  I was there when Roosevelt died  and that had a terrific effect on the camp population.
No  I was until 1945 but 1944  on the outside of our camp  on the outside of the wires  they started putting up barracks.
I found out since that somebody in the division has deleted every single word of every camp all over Germany that we had entered.
And my friend went to him  he went to the uh camp oldest  he was a German  a criminal  and he told him about what's happened.
So  in general to say that really what  what was the situation in camp.

You...you used to have...uh...uh... rashes on your skin that...uh...looked... looked like an epidemic and they filled up the sick bays in the sick camp.
Because  in this hierarchy of ﬁsupermanﬂ that the Germans established  the Gypsies were just about one rank higher than the Jews and  of course  they had to be eliminated because they were a ﬁlower people.ﬂ And so we saw the Gypsies in the camp and they were first brought in the end of the middle of 1944  something like that.
And they didnt give y -- us too much  because they said -- they -- they spoke German  so they said not to eat too much because we going to get very sick  and we going to have to go to the -- to -- to the Riviera -- the Rivera -- the -- you know  the -- th-the hospital  because you going to get sick to our stomachs  and our stomachs are not used to those -- the food  and its different than -- than in the concentration camp.

You want to go to Israel  I went to a concentration camp  I had enough  I says.
There was a point in time the ghetto was liquidated al ready and now there were rumors that the concentration camp is being liquida ted.
And when they realized that this camp was really a repatriation camp  a camp that was sending people back east  when they realized they couldnt go back  then they wanted to get to Jewish camps.
And to be hon est  when people -- strange people  or friends even  who were not -- had those horrible experience from being in a concentration camp  I watched them constantly  and -- and most of the time  I dont know why  this is actually  its a si ckness  I hardly was moved by it.
I got along with them very well  and they were br inging me sandwiches  and I even enjoyed what I was doing  so as a result of that  I had absolutely no complaints about that period of time... and contrary to a lot of other people I looked like a very well nourished member of the camp.
While we were...at one camp  I think  Dresden-Bariza--oh  that's cam p I forgot--we came from the factory from work one night...one morning  and we were infest ated by louse.
The same story  when it came that typhus and everything  Trawniki  what I mentioned  there is Pl another camp like this.

And again he did  on his own  he contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in New York  and a-again  I dont re member how long it took  but I know in the meantime we went to Luneburg where we went to a recuperation camp sp onsored by the British military  who put us back into health.
That's the camp that I decided to take Ben Gurion to.
What must have -- What was it like to walk into that camp again?
In the camp there was so called political department you know which was the camps Gestapo  and you didnt know what they had in mind.
We were there and when it started more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they started little by little to liquidate that camp.
So in the meantime  after all the Dutch transports came in  and other transports  one evening --no  one afternoon --I walked to get something from Camp 2.
And then somebody came to the camp where they...where my father was; and they told me that he died over there.
The feeling requirements that some people have  you know  I I didnt I Well  it sounded like you were forced to be resourceful from the time you were at the camp in in in the Urals.

So they took us down to the camp uh...that's all I know is the name of the camp.
We heared went from the kitchen in second camp  and they brought back in our camp to see what's happen.

We lived for awhile in a Displaced Person camp  where Italian was of no use.
They would shoot us like we were dogs  and uh  we had no weapons  we were weak  and you  you couldn't fight  fight an army with bare hands  but I feel that every day that we lived in concentration camp and we survived it  to me was a heroism uh by itself  because we made it and we su rvived this terrible life we had there  and by resi--by this we resisted Hitler to show him that we are here to  to stay  and he could not finish the race of the  of the Jewish people  and I feel by that  we resisted.
What about  when you say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners took over  could you say that they liberated -- the German political prisoners liberated the camp  or was it another army that did it?
So here we were able  again  to see my father  but we never talk -- couldnt -- you know  here and there  we could maybe say something as we were passing  but we knew he was there  he knew we were there and the mens barracks were on the other side  but we still  there was a way of waving or seeing or -- not touching or whatever  but he knew we were there and -- and most families that ended up in the camp could one way or another communicate.

So I been recognized to not in Germany  for our camp.
Luckily when I arrived in  in the camp  I always looked a little bit older because I was tall  and I was developed  and evidently Dr. Mengele made a mistake with my age  because uh  he probably thought I was older otherwise I would have gone to the ovens too.

And I 38 remember a very moving discussion in which he s poke  and said -- and I was so touched that in the middle of Germany  in the middle of all this mess  a camp that was mud  you were up to your ankles in mud at the time -- or later  because it was snowing then  but he -- he spoke to the women and told them  you must preserve yourself.

Before I went home in the evening  he would give me a note for her and I would stick it somewhere  you know  and every night when I came to the camp I would have a big bowl of very thick soup and I would share it with my mother  with Bert's sister and another young girl was very sick -- heart condition  I would share it with her  too.
He had his camp  his own little factory  and on the premises  the workers were living.
So our total group in this se ction of the Bergen -Belsen camp were there all day long.
And people were just falling by the wayside because we had to walk da-day and night and people were shot and killed right along and groups were now totally -- you know  things were just getting mixed up because men and women  you know -- th -- th -- it was -- it -- people from different parts of the camp -- anyhow  the -- the most outstanding recollection for me of that period  is not what I remember  but what my sisters remember  is that I fell asleep on that march and I could not distinguish reality fr -- I was hallucinating and they were dragging me.
They grab us and bring us right to the camp  to -- you know.
I think that in te rms of loyalty and solidarity  the s ituation could have been a little bit better in the men's camp than in the women's.
A nd the kapos hated the Jews  he said good  get rid of you Jews.
So  we came one day to uh  uh  left th e camp  went through the Auschwitz  to a place called Starstave  on the outskirts of the camp  where uh  the underground were uh  prepared for us a  unifo--the civilian clothes  and weapons even  and also they had a car waiting for us on a road  and to take us to the mountains.
Just stand to be counted  until every single person in the particular camp was accounted for.
So after I found out that she was very brutally beaten up  she was thrown into concentration camp  but we didnt know whether she s-survived or not.
At the time that was in a DP camp in Italy.
was that camp  a tremendous pr isoner of war camp and against the rules and regulations of the Geneva Convention  they brought of these prisoners of war to Auschwitz  not to work like us  I mean like inmates  but in their uniform.
By that time  I was already in a labor camp  April 25  that you find in my register.
And there is a beautiful book written by her about the Wildeflecken camp.
I use to be in a concentration camp with him  I met his family.
And he happened to know where my father was hidden because one of my fath ers friends  who had happened to be a Ukrainian  had some contacts [indecipherable] in the camp  you know  and he was -- communicated with him  so he knew where my father was.
Im running the camp along with Peter  and I think I have one child at that time.
Technical conversation] [Displaying photograph] The lady on my right is my mother's youngest sister  she went through Auschwitz concentration camp with me.
indecipherable] So I bet it was an occasion for everybody -- Oh  sure  it was a -- -- because that was such a happy -- -- everybody came to the -- I didnt en -- send any invitati ons  but everybody came to the wedding  the whole camp.
Two of his brothers were taken to forced labor camp and they died there.
You see there a a...what is that...a stamp  not a round one but just the words which means that this was checked by the...in the labor camp  whatever he writes can go out from the camp.
Uh in fact there the only men  basically all we saw were were men in this camp.
Interview with Felix Nicinski March 6  2007 54 And again  when you -- were there any people with you  any young men with you who had come all of the -- i-in the different camps with you  the same person whether -- were -- were there a group of people that stayed with you through all the different camps  or was it every time you went to a different camp there were new people?
And then got my orders to go to Camp Polk where the 131st was being started.
But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi and the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me  I did it.
So  we knew that what happened because Belzec was a similar camp to ours  and they were the people like we what worked in the camp  so they   they knew the people what came from Belzec   they knew what's going on so they resisted and they didn't go just like lambs to the slaughterhouse  so they re sisted  they shot them all  in the trains they shot them  and uh  so we thought that happened  one day will happened to us because the transports are finished so they would do that and then came the idea which  uprising and doing something to get away from it.
And there was a secretary over first quarantine  there was a was a chief secretary of the whole Fuhrerschreiber 91 secretary of the whole camp.
I went to one work camp  they went to another work camp.
And we  so hugh camp  with these hundreds and hundreds of lights of electric bulbs on this wire  on this barbed wire fences.
I was in the ghetto  but I came to the ghetto a few times.
And of course  the concentration camp was co mpletely flattened  burned and everything.
And I don't know  if it was Ravensbruck or some other camp  just for overnight.
And that  I couldnt Id I was amazed  really  because Id I didnt realize that that the labor camp  what the heck they were doing with that many people for a labor camp  you know?
When she was um taken out of um to transport from Belgium to um the camp  she had slipped a postal card through...through the cracks of the cattle wagon.
They took us to another concentration camp called Birnbaumel  or that's the way I remember the name  in Eastern Germany.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 47 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: camp EL: This was yes  this was in the concen  concentra- tion camp.
Could you organize and find who is cabinet maker between people in the camp.
Germans in camp were always occupying some f unctions whether they were in charge of the barracks or in charge of your work commando or whatever.
But if you were in the camp  you were on the American side.
She says  no I'm not  I'm German  but I was here in camp and I married a Swede and I have two sons.
Her physical disabilities worsened as I grew up  and it was because her condition was becoming much more visible and apparent to the out side world that then I came to understand Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin March 15  2001 5that she had been born perfectly normal  but because of the beatings that she received in the camp  it was the cause of these physical abnormalities worsening.
But what I'm wondering is  was there eventu ally a camp administra tion set up  a Jewish administration?
And in camp we slept three or four in a bunk to -- Oh  you had to strip and then what?
Then when they had enough people in the column  somebody comes out  a functionary in the camp  not a guard  one of the prisoners too  but he already has a job in the camps.
She was sent to one camp  I was sent to another.
But the gates not too far away  wagon with a little truck which belonged to the German and good for they -- and this camp and this was for this one and there wasn't and we had to load it on.
He said  \ Oh no  I have to go to my ----- to the concentration camp and I have to help your mother.
So my mother finally decided to take the chance and apply to the German military camp  to work there.
And I remember I came to that prison camp  came at night  all the dogs and lights  and it was quite an experience coming first prison camp.
Eh I heard Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
And later  I just I decided to go to Israel  and I got stuck in a refugee camp.
And he helped me with little food there was in the underground  while I was in the camp  in the working camp  when I was going a I I came out every day to walk back because they counted the people when they came and when they left  make it sure that there is everybody Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 45there.
There was a lot  very unfortunate what I seen in the camp among prisoners.
They were taken by genuine guards and we gave them fictitious papers that they were wanted  these two prisoners were wanted in the political department  which was the camp Gestapo.
Also every couple of weeks they used to take from our work camp people who had to go to the dentist  problems with their teeth - the dentist was in Kaiserwald  and what he would do is when you used to come with a 8 toothache he just would pull your tooth  and when I heard about this I volunteered.
But most of them got killed in the concentrati on camp.
They would like to have as many  as much eyewitness testimony as possible about what -- things that you saw in the camp.
And with the help of the people that run the Displaced Persons Camp  came up with an address and we send a telegram off to my sister.
They had some crazy kinds of things that were done in that camp.
So then they repeated to the generals exactly what kind of a camp it was  what it was  and so on.
And we when there just to build this concentration camp  and we start to work there and we make the wire and the barracks  because every time when the camp was ready  they was coming always new prisoners from all the countries.
Did you get any information fro m irk the camp that your grandpa went to?
And the distance from wh ere you were to where yo u went  to the camp in Germany  how did you get?
Well  I was in a -- physically in a very bad state  and all I knew was I saw suddenly American soldiers in the camp -- Suddenly.
You know  coming from where I came from  ou-out of a Nazi concentration camp  and find ing these terrible things that people -- for example  the movie house in West Virginia  African-Americans had to sit on one side of the movie house  and -- and whites on the ot her  I mean that to me was shocking  I couldn't believe it.
I mean like -- and they had entertainment but I never did -- I didn't want to be a part of it -- I didn't want to be in a camp any more  I wanted to be on my own.
I said  well  I was painting at camp  in the ghetto.
Plus two additional guys that they told us they would be transferred to camp wh ere they have additional Jewish prisoners.
The Nazis came into the camps  into some of those camps  and there is data that I have just seen this spring  actually  at Hoover  indicating what the men were told  what the soldie rs were told  in order to dress up the camp so that the Red Cross could come in and be im pressed.
So when we were brought back almost the same place as we start  and crossing back the Bug  little as we know -- little as knew at that time that that was our chance to survive the Holocaust is because we did not -- we were not admitted in Giessen Camp  where we found out that nobody survived in those camps.
I dont -- I dont reme mber -- I dont think he detailed  except that my mothers parents were killed  but -- in a concentration camp  but I dont think he knew.
From there on we were sent in by train to Drancy  which is the big camp near Paris which was a collection camp for Jews from all over France.
He also had been taken into a concentration camp  had just returned and he called me and said uh uh...and he was rather emotional...uh there is something then very new development.
I called a meeting of all the people of the camp to explain to them that I was working with the military and will see that they will get whatever they need to make life more comfortable.
Their policy  the German policy  was  and that was general not particular but general policy of theirs was all the inmates...concentration 11 camp inmates  summer time was carried in...in closed wagons  in winter time open wagons.
My parents liked to go up in the Alps in what is now Slovenia and nearby was a camp that pr ovided facilities for -- for children with their governesses.
So it was the people  our friends  our Holocaust bunker -- I mean camp sisters affectionately called us the three monkeys.
But  uh  we  we were not that hungry as the people that worked in the woods  and then we had to eat sometimes and they just didn't let us eat  and sometimes we were hungry  Chaim always say  \ You have to finish the soup \  wh ich was just water  we give it away to them because they were much more hungry than we  but th ey got  the people what didn't work in the  in the  uh  assorting clothes  they died very quickly  especially the Dutch people  and  the intellec-the bo-boys that came straight from the university  when they came to the camp  somehow they get sick and died in a very short time.
We were then eh marched up eh a hill  it was quite a long hill  as I remember reach the gates of the camp.
And every day I got a paper which is written  \ Samuel Flor and his wife Gertrude Flor have the right to go this street and this street every morning and back every evening  the same street back to the hospital\  -- \ from the hospital to the camp.\
It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go out from the ghetto  you know  with the Germans to work.
As far as I know  my mother was the only mother in the entire camp  to the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 best of my knowledge.
Well  my father was sent uh to  after two weeks in Amersfoort  the prison uh detention camp  after two weeks ther e he was sent to Westerbork and there he made contact of course with this relative of ours  Dunio Kamerling and uh Mr. Kamerling uh used his best efforts to try to lighten my father's uh position in in Westerbork because my father was slated to be transported to Germ any or Poland directly as a special prisoner meriting special punishment.
Her husband also died in a concentration camp  and then my  her mother  her father and her youngest sister all went  in December 1943  which was pretty late  uh to the Dutch camp  concentration camp Restabourk.
Then  I completely recovered and was transferred to displaced person camp in Ashafenberg.
And [indecipherable] of the Germ an military camp  you know  you have the s-sip -- open doors somewhere  I see German soldiers and the German ladies.
So  af ter the camp I told you  we're in...in the local camp; and we  uh...we were sent to work to cl ear the street of snow  and the highways of snow.
And we stood in a...in a other army camp in Munich for  I think  4 weeks.
I wonder whether Imler was ever in a concentration camp  Gering  people who were accountable for them.
I looked out of my window and there is Bohovich sitting in this car  surrounded with pots and pans  came to tell he that he was on the way to the camp.
And I suceed  managed with a doctor th at he gave to my wife injection and he was as some signs of typhoid fever and they took them one  one night before the liquidation of the camp  to this block  to this infirmary  ep idemic block 32.
We had boot camp in Leon  France which la sted five weeks.
So sh-she selected some of the Auschwitz people which she wanted to take along with her  and nobody from the camp office  and nobody knew whats going to happen  whom shes going to take.
In Greece  we were two foreigners  there was the head of the Joint Distribution Committee and I  and some local workers  and in Egypt  they hadnt been in concentration camp  and no matter how much people had suffered  they hadnt suffered the brutality  the inhumanity of the Germans in the sense of the people who came back from concentration camps had.
One of the things is  crossing the threshold from the train station into the camp itself.
We were pos itive well never get alive from the camp  so we never gave it any other thought  whats going to be our future.
I-I think in -- in -- I didnt tell her in concentration camp for -- about it.
But '42...yeah...my son born '42...and uh in '42 began the...life began to be more serious and more pressed and uh my my husband begun to make the possibility through physicians to get some false uh uh paper that he is ill in this illness or other illness  not to 4 go in in the labor camp  but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to play this way  and he made some operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess and uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to find a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to speak with this physician or professor to pay something  give a longer time for for this illness to   but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military service so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their ID when he he can go in a in a mental hospital.
Let's get back a little to the camp  to the factory of of Oskar Schindler.
Then I went to my friend  Dr. Kronzon  where we spent whole...whole [time in] concentration camp.
And A2: You lived in the d you lived in the DP camp?
I want you to tell me the story once more of your  of when your father came into the camp  but I want you to give me a context  I don't want you to say  \ As I Said before \  I want you to say  \ I had been in camps for about 4 years when the transport for 4 years when the transport from Lodz came in  in 1944  my family was on it  and then I want you to tell me that story.
And that day I was supposed to go to a funeral  also from  one from concentration camp.
And I was in camp much longer  I was in camp 21 months  but one day I also was approached  ﬁWould you like to get out?ﬂ And my mother of course said  ﬁYes  let him go.ﬂ So  I was -- and we have the documentation for that -- I wa s let out of camp on July 25th  1942.
So did you have any interaction with kids who were not Jewish?
Maidonek was the worse concentration camp there ever was  and Maidonek is in history the worst concentration camp.
When they came up to the camp  they found an open grave with planks over it.
The camp had existed  by the time I got there  only about four months or five months  so it was a brand new camp so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these tunnels.
And of course some of them couldnt no  I dont think the camp was really bombed.
That was a -- he made a lot of money and -- but it has nothing -- it didnt hurt the -- he didnt hurt the -- The camp. --
Life was -- well  let 30 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD me put it this way  I did two things in camp  I did them both very well.
That was taken in Deggendorf  in the displaced person camp after liberation  and as you can see (16) I gained quite a big of weight.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 3 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: did and it so happens that a surgeon in the camp was somebody who knew me from childhood.
They also had -- Mauthausen  like I said  it was a huge camp.
Then the commander from the camp start to go around and cal ling the people said to go with him.
Just what I told you  that we heard through that one gentleman that they worked with the other camp that was in the city of Auschwitz  that they are going to demolish uh uh Tell me about the man  start right at the beginni ng because I don't understand it.
There were no cases that I know of to escape out of the Auschwitz camp.
After they ac cumulate those people  we start building   the first camp.
It wa s much different than mine because she was in camp from '39.
For instance  there was a hospital  which is a -- which was a barrack  of course  but in this hospital  he knew that the selection will start in the camp  and the next day in the hospital  and he told me  today you come to the hospital  you are sick  and tomorrow  I -- you are -- youll go out.
But more or less they let the Jewish community  there was a person that was like president of the camp  people that were in charge of  of the food  distribution of food  there were  at the very beginning  there were two kitchens.
My eyes got clear  I took a good look  I can read \ Concentration Camp Buchenwald.\
So that was first of about 12 concentration camp that my parents were to visit.
Wow So I learned it  and that saved my life later in the camp  that I -- all my false paper was in there  and that they let me do the laundry.
Is there anything else you reme mber that you want to share about this camp?
And Bergen was a was an SS camp  which it had 10 - 15 000 officers there  you know.
There were absolutely no Jewish D displaced persons because they were in a separate camp.
How did you get to the DP camp and -- and what was that -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 6 Well  we -- you know  its a funny thing nowadays  in 1999  I would say  things are more electronically and -- equipped.
So living with his depression and his misery over the death of his mother  and rest of his family in Majdanek concentration camp  I certainly nur sed my hatred of the German s for many years.
When you said you were on this march go ing to the different camps  different camp  what were the conditions of the march?
Then  he was taken and to -- there was a neighboring camp  actually a farm  and it was about 10 78 kilometers from the main Birkenau camp  called Budi  which was a -- a farm  more a farm complex.
And that letter censor was mixed up the letters  sent a letter to me  one to the camp commander.
And he was for 8 years in concentration camp and the prison wardens tried to tease him the whole time by executing prisoners before his window.
But we lasted there in this camp Au schwitz about...I would say  beginning of August.
After we were addressed by the camp leader -- I-I dont remember anything about that  we were sitting there wi -- we were assigned five little girls with one older one  or four little girls with one older one  and assigned to a particular -- one of these little houses.
What about the -- the Nazis at the camp; do you recall?
>> Estelle Laughlin: So in the morning we arrived in Majdanek  which is an extermination camp -- t here is a slight distinction between extermination camps and slave labor camps.
There were people  we just pi cked a house  I remember  it was house and we went in and took as much clothes as we needed and  four of us  because we had found next to us in the camp  another small camp with about 40 so me odd women  young girls  Jewish women  who were from Lithuania and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary .
Then I started taking hist ories which included the history  until then  he was born in Chop-kov and Pola nd and he went through the war  he was in a camp  he was in a war camp.
And of course my brother and my mo ther  we all knew that we are living from day to day and it could be at any time we could be arrested and put to a concentration camp.
He said  \ Well  I am the Director of the Polish Camp.\
They created a committee of Jewish leaders there to be able to demand groups and whatever they needed.
So he says  ﬁDo you know more people in the same situ ation that came before 1936 in the camp?ﬂ Off the top of his head my father had met peopl e already in the camp  in the barrack  and he remembered -- thought of 36 people including us five.
Uh  while we were building the airforce  the runways for the German airforce day and night  5 000 people on one shift  5 000 people on the night shift  we got back to the camp on October the 27th and then there were already loudspeakers and also posters all over the camp that Helmut Rauke  who was at that time in charge of the camp  was demanding the entire popula- tion of the camp to be at a certain place in order to be counted.
Then they organized because they killed one of the the Germans in Wolfratshausen killed one of the butchers who brought in illegally meat in the Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 90camp  and they killed him  so that we they went ahead  theyre the other the the survivors in the camp ran down went to that Wolfratshausen village and knocked out everything they could find.
And then this time  all Jews out  stay on the place and you're not going back to the barracks and suddenly we are surrounded by what I call the beaters  these were the way some people earn their living by being barbers in the camp or being block chiefs  these are  earn their living by beating other prisoners and turned out that there was a huge pile or several huge piles of pre-fabricated barracks sections and we were supposed to take those sections and carry them on our shoulders to the back of the camp where a new barracks would be built.
And the reason the factory  because people say this camp  the Majdanek camp  was the worse one because I remember when we came in...in that camp  the commander for that camp made a speech to us.
And we ran in for five minutes to our father's home  and we said we're not going to stay in that camp.
An d they drove into the camp and stopped the trucks and people who could walk or run just swarmed th em the guys really had to protect themselves.
A long coat  and I think that coat may have been responsible for my going into the camp rather than to the crematory right away.
There was 5 000 people in this camp and maybe there is a couple thousand people.
This was not a regular -- there wa s already SSpeople there and he was working like work in a wo rk camp.
And Germany turned out to be a prison camp for you.
When Auschwitz was be ginning to be liquidated in the fall of 1944  we spent all our energies - whatever was left in our 40 to 50 pound hu man being that we each weighed  40  50  60 pounds  and I had typhus throughout the nine months that I was in the camps  whatever energy we had we spent it on only one thing - to run away from Me ngele's selections  because if Mengele will select the four of us  one would go to another camp  one would go to the crematorium  one would go yet to another camp  one would stay here.
When they were brought back  they took out the whole camp to watch the hanging.
We were not allowed to walk  and I was  I didn't have my period all these months; not  also not in camp  not at all  and I was  when I came to camp  very heavy from all the water retains in your body.
Those people who were in the in the they were mostly of the Germans German people  not any others  so they had some food  and they shared some of us until we arrived in the place and destination where we wanted to be.
So I don't think that if we had 86 000  I don't think that they only had 86 000 people in that camp because it looked to me like th ere were many more than that  but  you know  you can't te ll out of the mass of people ho w many actually there are.
We were sent to the sauna  and in the sauna -- they cut our hair before that.
They said to my father  you and your son come to the police station at uh five o'clock or whatever time it was in th e afternoon and told my mother you'll be interned in a camp and they told my moth er here is your...here are your papers.
This was a group of us gymnasium kids in the Polish dp camp in Altenstadt  summer of 1946 I was well 18 I think and myself on the extreme right .
I have all your documents  your decrees   I have the requisitions  I have the reports from the concentration camp commanders.
But anyway he...he suggested that to the camp commander and the camp commander says  \ Yeah.
So  she asked that uh  I have  whether I have any poems  and I  I  I knew all my poems uh by heart  I didn't uh  because we had no pencil and paper in there  so I told her \ Yes  in fact I uh  I  I had some composed already since I am here even  in German  and so she told the Blockelders about me   so she called me and she wanted me to recite the poem  and I recited a poem  and she said  um \ All right \  she said I  \ If you want you can come and stay in my block.\
But after the war  when we were liberated by the Russians in January of '45 and the war was still going on  so we figured that we--so then we were from the whole camp  when were about 700 women.
I used to take my friends until we got back to camp  and that's how I survived.
>> Bill Benson: Did you all go together to the displaced persons camp?
It wasnt like a lifeline or anything like that  but you know  you couldnt think about the camp all the time and death and dying and Auschwitz and the gas chambers.
Lagerstrasse\  30 and number--it is a street  a camp street; this hous e number  and this and this.
End of July  I went down to Gurs from Le Chambon see my mother who had been very ill and the camp had given me permission that I could enter for a week to visit my sick mother and they would let me out again.
And there is a place on the Isle of Man  there's a holiday camp.
So there were the anti-Defamation League of Bnai Brith  the American Council of Polish Cultural Clubs  the American Federation of Jewish Fi ghters  Camp inmates and Nazi victims  Federation of Polish Jews in the United States Holocaust Library.
In the meanwhile  OSE proceeded to get the liberation from the camp of the children under 16.
This was not a concentration camp  this was a work camp.
And there it was like a displa ced camp which you have a lluded to although we did not see it as a camp.
This was -- you see we were the last ones to be taken out of eastern Europe  so basically Stutthof was the political concentration camp.
Concentration camp histor y. History of concentrati on -- some prints from Kaita Kolbitz  a lot of prints  and matter of fact  I wrote a book.
The camp office seemed to -- is the largest -- Right. --
They thought that they will get rid of us in Mauthausen  but the Mauthausen camp was already  it was a horrible camp.
A day later and two days later and three days later  we were still walking around [indecipherable]   but the Americans came with their Jeeps and grabbed us  put us in in the Jeep and brought us to Wels  because Wels had room for thousands of people because it was an SS camp  officers camp.
And I didnt realize it until this year  when we were in Weimar and was talking to fellows that were in the camp  that the backside of Buchenwald was called the death camp.
He was -- the school -- he was arrested and put in a concentration camp.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Bill Benson: They were doing what you were doing?
We were there for the liberation  we were there for -- well  they liberated the camp and -- and thats when our colonel said that we could go.
It is not so paradise in this place either  but still was better than in the concentration camp  and we had nightmares.
Oh  so you ran away from from the camp in winter?
Last week one lady call me and says you wa s in a concentration camp.
The 20 only person there was a director of the camp who had -- with his wife and his small child at the time  who not that small -- the daughter was maybe 12 or 13.
Go to United States  so I write...the next time  next letter there was  have address and next third letter was another have address to uh Derby  Connecticut  so I have a full address and I wrote to uh to my aunt in Derby  Connecticut and an uncle and also my mother write to them in United States to ask them to uh help me  to bring me to United States but uh uh my mother  she was suggest uh I finish school so that was not so easy for them  my uncle and aunt to supply me for for college education  so so I was waiting for a visa five year  and during the five year I was teaching in a displaced person camp in Polish school and Polish Boy Scouts.
From there we were transported to the coast of Italy  and from there we were supposed to go to a camp in Africa  a holding camp.
This was when the  it was not a concentration camp at that time.
She also completed translation of a huge collection of correspondence by a family in which th e husband perished at the hands of the Nazis but his wife and two young children were rescued from a train leaving the Bergen -Belsen concentration camp.
Well  I worked only in the DP camp -- in th e TB centers.
Now  I find out 86 that this constant moving from one camp to th e other was for the Nazis to save their own skin  because if they wouldnt ha ve had the prisoners to move them around  they would have been compelled to go to the front  and they wanted to save their lives.

What did -- what -- 36 I mean we had -- they had celebrations throughout  its not like -- the ki -- the camps -- It wasnt a specific -- -- the camps  it -- the camps developed  and this is the -- the -- the -- the beauty about the Jewish people is the ability to bounce back from utter despair and -- and grief is -- is amazing  because di -- dont forget -- I mean  I was in the first camp a year or half a year after the end of the war.

And then you went to Bergen -Belsen death camp  in Germany?
Also  at that time we were all taken to a camp which was not a concentration camp  it was called Krushkupf   i t was near Warsaw  and that was a gigantic camp and that's where all the population of Warsaw was taken.

My very first contact with somebody whom I have nt known before  and somehow drove -- drove us close to each other  was Katya  who became then the to p administrative inmate of the womens camp.
Did you have any other encounters with other German soldiers and were they friendly or not?
It was very cold and there was no food at all  so one day I walked by and I have seen some Russian carrying big kettles with food and I saw them going outside the camp carrying to somebody  so next morning I got up real early  like three o'clock  and I followed them.
So I ask [indecipherable] they said she died in the camp of of-of typhus  something.
Well  if for instance  wed go to a farm and they would need a cow  they put boots on a cow legs and lead the cow to the camp and lead the cow to the fourth floor to the attic and slaughter it and have a lot of meat to sell.

And it was a very we came there and started uniforms and for a camp life- style  some thing like that.
But be by the time we were leaving camp  she was our best friend.
Meanwhile  April 11th I was going from Birkenau from the back from the parameters I saw a tank coming down the camp and the time was about quarter after three  and sure enough the Americans came and liberated us.

When you got when we arrived to Auschwitz and got off the train  thats the last time we see them.
Martin  if we could come back now to the time when you were still in the camp (Yes) approaching a time when there would be other actions in the camp.
It must have been...uh...a reason  either he transported somebody into our camp or...or vice versa  but he came and came running through the barrack.
We didn't know what people would do in concentration camp let alone the establishm ent and how do you so things people ignored that part.

It will be possible to make a...to exist  rather than in the camp.
So here you have the story of the American airmen  the German airmen  how they trained  and the story in the camp.
I n 1944  the Soviet Army approached  and Nesse was deported to Stutthof concentration camp  near the city of Gdansk in Poland.
In other words  uh  uh since the Nazis were so eager on security  uh  especially when I came to uh to uh  uh Auschwitz   we had at least twice uh  a roll when the morning before we went out to work  in the ev ening when we came back  and uh  uh  so technically what happened  uh so happened that each com  each block  each uh  uh barrack  uh had its own place where there  where people were counted  and uh  after they were counted  then the whole camp was called to attention  and the number uh in mates was reported to uh or to the commandant.
I wanted to ask you about the man you were just describing  who sort of had a position at the camp and who was giving you advice on your situation.
Well  one of the things  when we first arrived there  the aut horities would not allow the girls  the female members of the team to enter the concentrat ion camp.
We didn't know when it's going to be over until the moment it was over  because here we were in this working camp.
I took a can aand filled up with potatoes from outside the camp.
Okay  I needed help because I was in charge of the ambulance in this special camp in the reeducational camp  but the other doctor friend of mines took my place and I was in charge of this camp.
And they came back to a camp they called to a special camp where they make a quarantine of them.
And of course there were Jews from all over Europe and every language was spoken in the camp except English.
And now um coming back  um... So that was the Russians.
So I told that guy what happened to my apartment  that the refugees won't get out and I needed a place for my mother and stepfather when I get them out of the camp.
>> Bill Benson: What do you know about your uncle's time while he was there?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 >> Bill Benson: But either way  something was up with him.
I was trying to hide and figure out when the action will be over  I can go to my frie nds in the city  and stay outside  and eventually this way I can help my wife who will be in the camp.
I want to go back a little bit  to the training camp.
But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age wouldnt do.
When you said a little earlier -- you were talking about your father and -- and how h -- how he had been burned alive at this camp  did you -- when did you learn about this?
And they had to  Memorial Day they went to a camp at P rince William county  forest.
If you were foreign worker  you -- they would sent you to concentration camp or have you hunged.
So  I sort of said  uh  \ Well  I eat in camp \  which I felt  you know  was  was stating the truth without accusing them that they're not giving us enough to eat  but  but not saying anything  and so I uh  I gathered that he had maybe a certain designs on me  or maybe just wanting to test me  I don't know  you know  they were  well  that  incidentally  in our camp was not much of a problem.
And at that time  you know  to have people surv ive the concentration camp  it was a novelty  not -- not like today.
They were liberated or so me maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed marriages and maybe the Germans didnt touch th em.
Well  the camp  the doctors started coming in and they had already had  uh  uh  experience April 15th  uh  out in  uh  Dachau.
So...uh...we told hi m  you know  where...what camp we came out from and where there are people yet still bei ng hold  and so he went on his radio and he spoke to the commander what should he do with us.
You know  I -- I -- I would have gone absolu tely -- I think I would have been in [indecipherable] in an institution if I [indecipherable] 44 If you didnt have the -- Because later  in that concentrati on camp [indecipherable] it was impossible.
I had a couple of questions about your time in the camp  at least one question.
And we were told we were going to a labor camp  which we did  and we were all taken to Berlin.
While eh for instance when I was in co--concentration camp  I wouldn't trust the coppers.
Well  to end the story of Pocking  I might say that Pocking grew to a camp with about 6 or 8 thousand Je ws.
They were doing some new barracks  a new section wh en I got into that side  between each camp was two rows of electric wires--not one  but two rows  like this  between the men's camp...between the new camp and the old camp.
But -- but it was a s -- just horrible in a sense that there was  you know  there was never enough  you know  there was constantly -- and what I think what the Germans tried to do is to get as mu ch as they could before they -- before herding everybody into the ghetto  you know  because that wa s a time where they could actually grab things and you were not allowed to bring anything to the ghetto than what you can carry.
I think on the phone once  you told me some of it  but I -- Yeah  she brought me s -- always a custom tailored aprons  of -- so I accepted that  because we were -- that was very fashionable in the camp office  to have over your dress a nice apron  yeah.
So that you wouldn' t have -- that was the great pr oblem that when -- to begin with everybody was afraid of  but this camp was a  a hive of illness  tuberculosis  typhus and everything you can think of.
And it was at Camp Ashby  or Thalia  it's original name.
Some Germans even put on uniforms  concentration camp uniforms  and throw away their military uniform to survive because the Russians were very fast and swift.
Two of them I think written to the director of the camp  and one of them is dated August 30  1942  its written in German.
I said Polish  and then there was some Czechs  and no Italians  no Norwegians that I know of  they were in another camp.

Because  as a matter of fact  this was the end  this was the  the  the  the  the common thing in every camp  the proceeding.
And they claimed the people of the camp were insulting them.
My mother and I for some reason were put in a camp.
Will we ever be able to convey what these camp years have meant for us when we talk with someone who has not actually lived through a similar experience himself.
I...it all melds into one...uh  uh  I didn't know it at the time but one was Camp Dora and the other was uh  was Nordhausen.
I know that my stepfather  since he came back  I was told  he ended up in a camp too.
He went  and his wife  and the and the two brothers  they went to a war not a working camp  they called Klettendorf.
After I come back from concentration camp and after 1947 I come back to Poland because we were hoping Poland be free country and never happened and after I was in Warsaw 1947 I intend to finish my Polytechnic engineering  Polytechnic Institute  engineering line.
It didn't have the Ukrainian supervisors  was an SS Kommando there  headquarters who took charge of the whole camp.
I was not in Dachau per se  in the main camp  but I was in a satellite camp  that we were transported in that particular train.
Anyway  I took a streetcar and I went and as I went I noticed that camp and I jumped off and I we nt into the camp and I told th em what happened to me and I don't know where they went and I don't know what I can do.
Now the only thing I can suspect is that somehow when we left the Krakow Plaszow concentration camp  someb ody submitted a list of names to some German authorities and the pin leisheit[?] (

Right now  every night you cry  you scream  because you are in the camp now.
They might report you  and youll go to a concentration camp  so you ask nothing.ﬂ You dont even take a close look.
If they didn't have on the outside  they took from the camp.
We got shelter in these houses that -- was like a camp  a soldiers camp.
And...uh...I remember then my father and...my brother wasn't with us because he was still in a camp.
They said they send them to another camp  but no  they were k illed.
But unbeknownst to us so we were in that camp for about a year  and finally  you know  our quota came through and I came to the United States on a boat called General Black   with my cousin  who was my bra you know  like my br other.
In other words  any Jew who had not been to a concentration camp can only be relegated to secondary or tertiary role 37 because they were the front line troops.

We didnt know where  but we were going to be taken someplace.
We stayed there two weeks in a camp with gypsies and all people that were that Hitler went after  what were survivors.... How did you get to Israel?
And how many from your barrack or your camp were transferred with you?
Did they know that -- they knew you were Jewish from your I.D.?

So they took me under their arms  and took me to their camp.
He just came from the concentration 20 camp and wasn't used to working I guess because in Romania the one guy they weren't toughened up like we were already.
So I spent Christmas 1942 with my cousin  who was married to a Gentile woman and then I started my career in the Swiss labor camp.
And I realized I was in the camp  I probably didnt even know what day it was.
And I stayed 2 years in the DP camp and it was...maybe I didn't know how to approach  but it was very hard to get a visa to come to the United States because there were too many applicants.
We are not in a camp any more  appeals any more  working conditions again and guards who are watching us all the time.
And la -- as I said  and -- and the schoolchildren we used to entertain  like once a week  we would have -- you know  for the parents and the whole DP camp would come and we would entertai n  singing and dancing and you name it and we did all these things.
And wa -- was the training camp allied with any of the underground movements?

In the meantime  periodically the Germans would come into our camp  line everybody up in front of a table where one of the Germans would sit.
It was not a camp to...that you could last very long.
And uh  there are many stories  too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst camp that I existed in  and was the least known camps because it was a secret project.
Yeah  they took us to the shower  take all you r clothes out and they give us the camp uniform and they divide in certain blocks.

I  my wife is many times surprised people much older than I  ten or fift een years older  know my father  knew him ghetto  knew him in concentration camp  he always tried to help somebody.
I hadn't seen my father  and he was my step father I must say  in perhaps 8 years  maybe 9 years  right after I was bar mitvahed  my parents separated for a specific reason  and I hadn't seen him in all these years  and I saw him  met him in that camp.
In the camp  you know you could have been safe in your work because you worked and the SS man in charge may have been quite decent you know treating you  but once you came back to the camp  you didnt know.
And she was deported in August of 1942 to -- I suppose  first Drancy  and then Auschwitz.
Within weeks they were all out and at home  but I'll never forget those uh  people in that that portion of the concentra...or of the uh  the uh  prisoner of war camp.
So Russian prisoners were there   cut the barbed wire and we went and I went with them.

But my father decided to organize a school for the children in the camp and he did that.
When we came back from the concentration camp and my mother was working in the city hall  she met a young man.
I received that letter  sent it on to the Holocaust Memorial Museum  and ten days ago driving from Ottawa to Washington  my wife and I get these reading tapes - you put them in your car and a book is read to you - and this particular book was about a woman who had been in Auschwitz  Dachau and a third concentration camp.
And we got a telegram to the unit  which -- which I -- it came to me  saying that -- that they were desp erate  that they had no 37 provisions  no means of support  th at -- that there was this camp  and there was nothing and they were desperate.
I was outside of the camp  there was really no place to go.
There was a lot of stealing of mate rial from the outside so we had washrooms  which is just not the usual feature of the concentration camp.
Of course  we didn't know where but the word already was spreading in Warsaw and in the prison that there was a camp  concentration camp by the name  Polish name  Oswiecim  in German Auschwitz.
So  we headed back I mean  he send us to that prison camp called Bad Orb   Stalag IX-B .

And he forced them to take him back 61 to the camp and he found me in the camp.
Wilhelm Gerke was a short SS man who knew exactly that once the ghetto are being liqui- dated that the Germans in charge of the ghettoes were being sent to the front to fight the Russian army  and having good connections in Berlin he got a new assign- ment and changed the name from ghetto to concentration camp.
That camp was weird in a way that there were ghosts there.
And they just got the guards out of the building  right  so one day  the they let the prisoners out of the out of the camp  out of they cut the wire  and so on  or the gates  and let them out.
So they bring us straight to the commandant of the camp  in other words to the camp commanding [indecipherable] director  whatever you want to call.

The boy and I arrived the following morning at a camp.
Sometimes men came to work into the camp and the meeting place was the latrines.
And at that time  we really didn't know what Auschwitz was except that they were sending people there.
So I...so this friend of mine   we got together...we were together in camp by the way with this friend  an old friend of mine...we got together and we made up our minds we're going to leave Budapest and we crossed the border at night  the Hungarian-Austrian border  that's right.
I had subsequently learned that the transport  that was  went to Auschwitz and they were in a way entered the camp as most of them of course did not.
Womens used to come out from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 5 outside and had a little -- put like a -- a kiosk in the camp.
Of course  we weren't allowed to stick our nose out of the camp after that - Of course. --
And they came in and gave us concentr ation camp clothing.
Did you see anybody in prison camp you concentration camp uniforms?
I finally wind up in a camp Flossenburg  and from there I get into Buchenwald  and I said  \ No more.
After I was out of the hospital  I went to the United Nations Restitution Action  I think that means UNRA camp.
How long did you stay outside of this camp area that you were in when you were liberated -- One day. --
Tape 2  Side A Anthony: So you're in Auschwitz working outside of the camp?
Some people remained behind  and there were other people in other camps that I read up after the war  that came to the camp.
And he asked me another question  \ Did you men during the war--after you left the camp  or after the war  or even at home--talk about these terrible camps and these horrors that you saw?\
That was in ‚41  and after a time they took us they put us in trains and they brought us to Gleiwitz and from Gleiwitz  they brought us to Lublin in a camp Lipowa Seven.
That was a locked up camp with  I think  guards all over the place.
The organization had about six fighting groups of three people and located in different places in the camp waiting for the Germans to be lured over there.
So  I took care of my father and  because he was working in the office  so his quarters  his living quarters  were with the head of the administration of the camp and the barber in the camp  and my fa ther and the man who was in charge of the kitchen  I think  there were four or five beds in that smaller room.
The place to kill them  they put them in concentration camp and it was the chief of the Jew  from the Jewish Haftlinger24.
We associated with the Jews who managed to live in a city  rather than stay in a camp  so -- and -- But you must have passed -- you know  pa ssed you on the street  or youre in a -- Well  we had no -- -- [indecipherable] or -- -- yeah  well we had not known or we had absolutely nothing to do with them.
Now go back to when you were in the camp  and te ll me about any sabotage that you did or that other prisoners did.
In the meantime everybody who could walk was lined up and marched out of the camp.
About my friend from Holland  who was in concentration camp  and I was working with him  later they send us to -- to Ludwigstir  to the ammunition factory.
Immediately a riot started through the whole camp  and a wave rushed out of gates of the camp into town and started to break store windows  start buildings on fire  over-turned buses  attack and pummel any German passerby  quickly the town turned into an armed camp.
A week  10 days  in this childrens camp  in the snow  in the winter.
As I found out  the day after the liberation  from another prisoner who happened to be in the camp where he was  he was sent to a sub camp called Gusen  which was near Mauthausen and as you see  most of these are youngsters.
Religion manifested itself in terms of the behavior of the people as they related to the faith prior to their coming into the camp and uh  whatever the camp uh would uh allow them.
On the way I passed my boyfriend who was then just freshly liberated from the camp to a Jewish Boy Sc out farm and I went down to the camp.
And from Camp Wheeler I was lucky  I met another friend who was good to me  Freddy Strauss.
But I went to anothe r camp in Maine  that was a French camp.
>> Bill Benson: So you would end up at a camp called Neustadt -Glewe.
I had doctors with me who kept me very well posted and we deloused every prisoner in the camp with DDT powder  and those people  and we called in two clearing hospitals  big hospitals  army hospitals  and anybody who was ill they were confined to a hospital.
Well  that was...I assume that was a disp laced person camp.
When -- when you told people that yo u were out o -- that you were in camp  for instance  did they immediately assume you were Jewish   or did they understand that -- Yeah  many people -- many -- many people told me -- many people told me -- we talk  well  for instance in that coffee shop we meet   you know  and so we have conversation.
I didnt explain that part  but at any rate  he ended up in concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac  and they would take them either to camp and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in town  and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasnt supposed to see it.
Why -- Well  because they lived in a camp  but they had privileges of walking outside.
ML: Eventually  and Im sorry to say this  it became evident to the French su-supervisors that the so-called two block aldist of our camp were more corrupt than other block aldist.
They wanted to send us -- in that time there was a camp of the Iron Guar d  it was still -- there were some in the -- in -- in a camp.
We were talking about th e beginnings of the w -- the camp office.
I remember I came in  and we went after there to another concentration camp; and she was already together with the head of the concentration camp.
I was also tr aveling quite often to Merrano  where there was a camp.
We were in the -- in the last concentration camp was Ber-Bergen-Belsen was the last one.
The food was so so but compared to the previous camp it was a little better because they really needed us very badly there.
On the boat they caught us  and they-- in order to subtract affidavits for us b ecause there was a quota  they put us in a camp in Alit (484) near Haifa.
But this I say  in that particular camp he was wonderful  and he had witnesses that came  and they talked about him  that we didn't know  because we were never private to him.
We have general  general idea  but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one  because as I have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau  was only for two months  who had a secretary who was [speaks foreign language here].
So he asked the camp co mmander  captain -- the camp was actually surrounded by boy scouts  thats what I had -- in charge of the camp. [
And my brother was very upset when he but but he came back from prison  then he left.
>> Henry Greenbaum: Well  from the day that we carried over the dirt  filth  from the ghetto to the slave labor camp because they took away the soap.
I was not in the family camp  so -- so I can only tell you what some of my friends told me happened.
And you -- and you slept in the -- Slept in the bunks.
So I met him  and meanwhile it became known for some reason that I was gonna get out of the camp.
When I found out occasionally that somebody was  I would say hello  and Mr. Kernic probably is the only one  coincidenta lly  we met  found out we were in the same camp.
Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 178 No  the camp was separately.
A seasoned man  he was in the camp since the first week on and the Russian soldiers were somehow surprised in a captured village  this to happen  but he was not.
He spent a whole day interviewing the Jews in the camp.
Most of the people marched partly people who had taken on trains  on open freight trains  and driven to Germany and tried to put them into place them in into different camps  and I ended up by train ten days by train  only once we got food  and here again  I had my armband  that I'm the camp oldest of the see uh  we had a good office of uh  uh reeducational camp  and I took one car and put sick people on there  maybe 15 to 20  and I had uh blankets to cover th em  where  on all other cars  there were people standing because there were   they put in 100  120 people  there was no place to uh  to lay down.
We are bitten all over the place and why don't you let us have a shower and delouse us  our clothes  otherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to camp.\
As I said this camp had different things but you have to understand again  I wish I could be more descriptive to you as to what  how and when  but I really can't because I can only tell you from my memory what I did when.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON Page 15 for the Jewish people in that particular camp  and generally in camps in the English zone  was a time of waiting in a relatively hostile environment.
Now  to back go back to the death camp si de  though.
A nd thats the main reas on why I get out from Auschwitz  volunteer to go to differen t camp because of those executions.
And so here I am  still as excited at 78 as I was in earlier years as a girl scout  to find ways of doing things at a camp.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 40 What -- What happened when I came to my aunt  okay  is there is a -- a -- quite a community from Solotvona in Cleveland  and people came to see me  I was -- there was one guy  I dont know ho w he got here before me  becaus e he was a DP  he had been in the concentration camp  and he came to see me also.
At that time I was working out of Bari where the headquarters was and uh we cared for all the DP camp refugees.
So I ask him  is it possible you send me to a camp where my sister is  I dont have nobody from my family   just a sister.
You see the Jews are killing and taken to concentration camp.
Fortunately for me  in the course of the interrogation  he revealed that he was a guard at a concentration camp  which made him subject to automatic arrest.
Once a la -- I told the lady -- I dont know any more who it was  bu t I remember the event  that I was in a camp.
There was another one  a labor camp  they chopping woods there  th ey're making roads.
The situation was different there  for for whatever by whatever circumstance the Jews were in separate camp  which were Jewish displaced persons camps.
They took out the clothes from us  we have to leave the clothe s. And we went for a shower  they give us a shower  you know.
And we went to the camp  to the first ca mp  Camp One  and there were all the Jews  say already  \ Hurrah!\
Because of this air attack  we had to wait for hours until we were transported back to camp  and when I presented myself at the sick bay  the floor was litte red with people injured during the bombing of some facilities nearby.
And just to get us a little bit healthier after all the ordeal of being in concentration camp for so long.
See  the -- All the Holocaust survivors  right  that survived the concentration camp  and the -- and the how as they saw  that a human li -- a human life didnt have no value.
And as I looked up with envy  wishing that I was one of those planes  thinking [of] being free  all of a sudden I hear a shrill right in front of me that could be heard in front of the whole camp.
IRVING HEYMONT Page 16 the camp just watched to see  here are Germans being moved out  they way they had been moved out.
>> Sam Ponczak: Well  I guess my first self -awareness of myself wa s -- we were sen t to this labor camp.
And in the slave labor ca -- I -- slave labor camp  the fa -- half of the room was French political prisoners.
They were quite nice people  so they they told us we can lay down on on the bed and sleep  and that was quite nice of them  and uh then we uh then I got back again to the camp because we were told by by the by the British we had to go back again so we did  and uh I got uh a job with the British.
And afterwards  they changed my bandages in camp  then I could see what it looked like  my finger was like separated in half.
Well  anyway we were then led to march towards the camp  wh ich was a long march  and I remember it was through a beautiful birch forest and I kept looking at the birches and I thought  ﬁThis is so beautiful.
After just one night in an internment camp there  Henry and 12 other men were selected to return to England only to end up in Bombay  India.
But I have to cover it up  4 because if they ever found out  they would send me to the concentration camp \  because they already had concentration camps in 1933.
Hunger was probably the biggest cause of death–was to try to get outside the camp and get some food.
So lot of people there was and then was a group  they was assigned to different camps  but not conciation camp.
The other aunt and uncle  who were supposed to be taken as well  they for some reason left and they ended up in Auschwitz.
And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to Ohrdruf camp and when you saw Eisenhower.
And what the people to ld us  there were this concentration camp  this cencontra well  from the [indecipherable] from the concentration camp  they were sent to work in a factory.
When they unloaded us at Skarzysko-Kamienne  there were three camps al ready in existence: camp A  camp B and camp C. Camp C was considered  after a short time after they unloaded us from the train... we understood that camp C was the worst camp of all th e three of them.
Like one woman came and she brought a baby  and she kept it for two weeks in the camp and finally they...and they gave her a choice: \ Either you give up the baby and you can remain.\
We have our our visas and were going to come to the U.S. So we left that camp early  went back to Berlin and he drove us back to Berlin and I dont know if it was a private vehicle or U. S. Army vehicle  I dont remember.
But during the camp  they shore it  so people knew that you are from somewhere else.
W ho designs Block four and who allows her  who  who allows this building to be transformed so yo u have a camp office? [
It was somehow  the SS kitchen was the same in camp.
Some of them were brought to our camp  to our ghetto in the in the place of of our people who were executed.
So she g -- I don t know what she did with it  but this how we did that thing -- we did -- she found out where every division  or what division came from what -- where -- plus we had a lot of cape -- lot of concentration camp women sewing strof boots  for the Russian army to put over the shoes  because the winters were very severe.
You know  I I wasn't in the camp when it was liberated but there was this uh curious uh immediate heart-to-heart meeting.
Uh well  after the Harrison mission...but I had started before already...we concentrated mainly in our...first of all to to organize our committee  to our committee  uh uh in other words taking in whoever wanted to be represented of the of the camp in Belsen along certain call it party line...labor and and so on  I mean the old  the old trad ition from Poland had been carried on also in Belsen  but the other...beca use also to bring all these people outside of Belsen into the fold  into the committee which means comm unities uh uh which were which were organized in cities like Cologne   and and and   Dusseldorf and Hamburg and so on  and we...we then were able  interesting enough  to uh to have a united central committee of Jews originating from Germany  from Poland  from Hungar y  from Lithuania  from wherever it was  in one institution in order to try to work on whatever the problems of the da y were.
Do you remember there being any kind of qualitative change when the Ghetto became a concentration camp?
Being in that -- s -- you can call that a camp  in the military academys building that we were  that was a camp.
And I remember one night we were told that we had to leave.
We stayed in this camp  in the tents  I believe for about seven or eight months  and then from this cam p  we were taken with a convoy through Argeus  from Argeus to Italy  from Italy to Gaza in order to be repatriated to Greece.
The reason for that information being uh forthcoming was that the troops in the north were over beginning to get very close to and were beginning to overrun uh the concentration camps in their area  so before that occurred in some instances  prisoners were moved from places like Auschwitz uh to places like uh Dachau  which were further...we were further from that concentration camp than they were from their's  so this begins to give you a picture of how the information began to filter through and uh uh be become...we began to develop our own needs because of the information we were getting.
Had it not been for us serving su pplying gasoline as fast as we did to Patton  those ground troops that liberated the camp would not have been there yet.

He was not an old man  he was in his early sixties at that time a nd when he came out of the camp he died very soon afterwards of–actually it was a combination of a broken heart physically and mentally.
We condemn them  and there was a very sad story  in the camp.
And so we w ould toast it very  very hard and make little packages and sent it back to camp because our constant worry was what was going on in camp.
We were near a camp and there were two German planes that landed near us.
The camp office that -- if there are three off -- at one point there are three off -- theres the camp office  theres the work detail [indecipherable] Al-All in -- all in one -- in one -- we had one barrack  and that was block four.
Then young able bodied people because they told them these people are going for labor into Germany.

Instead of sending kids to camp  then your parents send you candy or whatever the kids may want  but if there was candy it was for everybody  not for one person.
So it would be very easy to know if there are 600 places  give us the 600 neediest people in camp A  or give us 100 people each from six different camps so you'll build a moral in six camps that indeed the ships are going and maybe someday they'd get on a ship.
And that was in a forest and it was a smaller camp  and we were building this railroad tracks for  for a narrow or a short distance train.
Maybe a lot of Germans  well they didnt like to do it either  but they had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner  you know?
And as we were marched in chains into that little tent  everybody was clapping their hands  all the people in the camp.
I knew it's a concentration camp and I saw a pile of dead people outside and I saw conditions and I heard screams but in the beginning I was kind of happy because I knew that tonight I can stay here  that I don't have to run through the woods because there's no one that extended a hand anymore like the nuns did.
Well  there were others who will come and ask for money and -- and other addresses where a -- where Jews live [indecipherable] you know  its -- its a -- its always a -- and it was also on the Poles side  if you find a Gestapo or SS or whatever  they find the house where Jews are hidden  they would shoot everybody or take everybody to a concentration camp.
You had to get your water from an outside spigot and the privies were all in a row on one side of the camp.
So everyone in the camp was waiting to come to the United States?
He didn't push me in and again I got out of this cro...out of the perimeter...of the peripheral of the crowd and I tried to find a place to hide and I found another uh man whom I knew from uh from Vernet who was al so out looking for a place to hide  and we came to the sick bay and the sick bay was separated from the camp.

And then  when we were at the headquarters  the people warmed up towards us and they took us to the POW camp  which was nearby  and they ask us whether we will -- would like to stay in the POW camp  wh -- or whether we would like to have some private accommodations  which we naturally choose to be -- to have the private accommodations  because there was more -- better than the POW accommodation -- How? --
And I the children didnt want to play with me  because I was always sad.

The second time  the camp was with cub scouts from other towns.

So  they went to another camp from there  you know  after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more west  but we were already free.

Q. When you went to a different camp  di d you get a new number you had to wear or something or did you always go by this first number?
They selected 500 people from that bigger camp  and then they sep -- shipped us to another camp  500.
And the way I escaped  a truck went back  I loaded  we loaded some equipment  and I went with the truck back into the camp  I jumped off and never got back.
My father was taken in 1941 or so to a transit camp called Pithiviers and deported to Auschwitz.
9 Not in preparation  but while I was in Nuremberg  I took time off to go to Dachau concentration camp  which was only a few m iles down from Nuremberg.
But where we went to the camp  it wasn't huge  no  it wasn't.
And there was exmilitary camp where they t -- converted to a resettlement camp.
Now you mentioned to me that when you first arri ved  it was clear that nobody knew how to organize this camp -- Nobody. --
Nobody  you know  people had he ard of Auschwitz and the death camp and so on.
And also turned out turned out that one day  while I was in the camp  I was told that I have to report to the colonel that was in charge of 22nd regiment.
Do you talk about the experiences much with  with other camp su–survivors?
I said  ﬁNo  Mother.ﬂ So we finally went to Camp Dix and got our leave papers.
And uh – we slept in the typical concentration camp arrangement where there were like – they werent beds – they were like big platforms  one on top of the other  three high or four high.
Do you remember some of the conditions of life in the camp that you remember especially  that were especially difficult?
I know she will be in a camp  he didn't know anything.
Three days they were buried in an empty camp in Birkenau called the Mexico Camp.
Maybe 50  maybe 60  I didnt count them; they took us to a labor camp.
And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a police station  he told me that the Germans had just left Buchenwald  a concentration camp that was based in Germany in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother's experience was just beyond description what she went through.
The Jews who formed about 80 percent of the camp when I arrived  had organized themselves into a city within a city.
Of course  they stopped  eh the advance of that eh SS eh eh division shortly before the Dachau and we could you know we eh eh eh stay in the camp until the next day.
As a matter of fact  this is the camp  you know  if you remember  you know  we were preparing an escape  and the elders of the camp called us  and asked us  ﬁWho gives you the right to buy your own freedom at the price of those that will be killed  who will not be able to escape?ﬂ This is the camp Viniki  this is where it transpired.
But that was at the Dachau camp  where I went in.
They put us on a train and we were sent to Skarzysko  which was a slave labor camp.
This was Ilsa Koch  when she was  she was the  the camp uh  the main person in that particular camp in Buchenwald.
Then they put us groups  and they give us one horse  and on e s-slide  and we have to walk 300 miles to the destiny [inde cipherable] to that camp.
In the camp  I kept asking as we walked through the slau---.
I shouldn't have to wait to see what I saw to be to to experience this kind of shock but I guess I was accustomed to seeing violence and death and sickness as a result of combat  not because people uh were housed in a concentration camp with no arms  no weapons uh and not as a result of their violence.
And eventually we moved  we went to my grandmothers house and stayed with them And why did while he was actually my father was not taken to concentration camp  because he had had a broken leg the summer before.
In Germany  Der Spiegel did an article of a doctor  who was a doctor in the camp Auschwitz.
There was not a con centration camp  but it was a camp.
And then he was transported to Auschwitz and Do you know when that was?
And he mark the number where I am in the camp.
He knew we were in Bergen -Belsen  then he knew we were out of Bergen -Belsen.
It was a labor camp  in which we had regular military training except for weapons.
When you were in tight s pots during the war  did you pray?
We  we brought her back to  to our camp and to  for to be buried.
And they put us I think there was a prison there Uh huh.
42 Well  yeah  its just its just you know  ha th-the the horrible feeling inside  you know  I mean here here is the country that destroyed your family  destroyed you know  so but there wasn t much discussion again  you know  and again  what happened is that we came out of Hallein by  I-I I think was trucks  an-and got to another camp close by.
It had been completed by the German army  and had been used for munitions storage  the Americans  we used to use it to store nuclear warheads  for the German Pershing missile unit  that had been in the  what was then the site of the DP camp.
To my surprise  it was a camp of former Anised members from Poland.
Then they made us turn around  like back towards Dachau  but there was a camp they name Allach.
You go tomorrow to the authorities of the Ge rmans and tell them that you are my wife  you survived in a camp and I didn't know where he is and he doesn't know where I am.
You know I dont know but he contacted my father that he cannot take care of my anymore but it was his responsibility to get me into the labor camp.
And for young kids away from home  you know  about to face something -- Now  there was one thing that I shou ld have brought up about Camp Sheldon  Mississippi.
So  in a certain sense in the camp  the \ we\  part was strengthened  as  as against the need for balance in the \ we/they\  phenomenon.
But then  I could see my cousin or whatever  come to camp  and knew what's going to happen to him.
Did you take any photographs when you were inside the camp?
And they have set up a whole place  you know  like a whole office in one of the barracks where  you know  where they were keeping the photographs  because they had a tremendo us amount of photographs  because everybody was taking photographs to the -- to -- to the -- to the camp with them.
They were in camps  of course in Switzerland as well   in a resettlement kind of camp for a while.
Uh there was a lot of confusion  uh  the uh camp  like all big camps seems almost to run itself.
The ghetto was surrounded by a high fence that was finished off with barbed wire and there were two gates  one in the front and one in the back.
They didnt take --they had connections in the camp but they were prisoners  you know what I mean?
So I became the one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio  and report it to my father and mother and I suppose through them  to the other people in the camp.
He was deported to Buna -Monowitz  the labor camp at Auschwitz  and later to the Flossenburg camp in Germany.
And then going down as far as the documentation permits the expert to make a judgmen t. For instance  if the expert sees a months worth of guard rotation assignments at a concentration camp  that expert can talk about those rotations  because hes seen enough evidence to convince him of how -- or -- or to define for him what the daily routine was like.
He loaded on that platform  he drove out of the gate  gate--in Ausc hwitz  the main gate was not guarded during the day because during the day  the guards were stationed around the large area of the camp uh where the pri-prisoners were performing uh doing uh work.
Obviously  somebody recognized him on the street  and he was arrested there and sent off to Dachau concentration camp.
02:53:16 And I looked for him where I had the late st news that he's in... uh...that...uh...town in Germany near...near that camp.
And that was my first camp ex -- no -- well  the other was a vacation camp  this was a camp with all the difficulties of a camp.
So one night  they told us to get up  pack our things and marched us out.
He knew this camp where the women were there in different barracks.
And I feel we go through the concentration camp  whole family  mother father  four kids  cook  and one cousin.
Oh yes  every time  you know  you saw -- even in that camp that we were in  which we -- we -- it was considerable better than it was in Auschwitz or Stutthof  when we saw a German officer come in now  is he going to take us away  you know?
It will be very good job and maybe it you will not go to Germany to the force camp.
>> Bill Benson: What led up to their finally being able to leave?
So What did the barracks look like that you were housed in?
That's where she was  and that wher e she got in the camp and also be deported to Auschwitz.
16 I see  so they we nt on to the camp.
By the way   in every camp you went in  you have to stay outside all day  rain or shine.
Were women able to be in contact with men in the camp?
So they said all the bodies we had to throw on  on this to take it to the Camp Three.
He locked us up at nighttime and we worked all morning near another  you know...we had to work one line   and sometimes two lines and three lines  and when we were finished  he...every evening we had regular meals what he cooked and he give us to eat and and after thirty days I uh...less than thirty days when he himself took us back to the camp.
In fact  they were trained to be concentration guards and all that–and we got concentration camp uniforms  hats and all that  and we were there until July 1944.
After the Berlin was divided  again our father being an American and being pretty much told that were going to come to go to Ameri ca some day  we went to a U.S. Army camp.
Af that was after base basic training at Camp Pickett  then it was Fort Benning.
The refugee house was a hugh camp with barbed wire around it  and we were not allowed out.
Now  I think were getting to the point where -- We go to camp.
As in one camp I could see with the children what happened too  which we're not supposed to look out  to open a window to open a door to see what the French commander did to the children.
So the Polish army units were feeding some They started they started these refugee camp centers.
Now  we were still not in the normal type of slave labor camp.

And a lot of them  including my friend Tunia  stopped in the Schlactensee camp so that these were -- not all of these kids that you see in the picture are not all camp survivors.
Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong  th e camp had a big bell in the middle of this field  and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell saying  ﬁYou're free.ﬂ Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28  1995 Page 10 In what language?
She takes my number down  now the blockaltester knew why she takes my number down  they wouldn't tell me  but there was a request of sending out of Birkenau a few hundred people to another camp  to Stutthof  and he puts me there.
Yes  it is 57 years ago  when my parents and sister were murdered in the gas chamber of camp Sobibor.
Uh  were you involved at all in helping to get the camp organized?
From Umschlagplatz was sent to concen -- to death camp  not concentration camp  death camp.
So you were all preparing reports about the administration of the camp?
The trains came in  we loaded them up on the trains and they sent us back to camp.
Before  in our camp  where we came from  the -- the Jewish population in that camp  the women wore the hair.
But once I was in the American zone in Feldafing  you know the Military Police  they came in a lot to the camp because they had connections with this local police  the survivors.
How long had you been in the camp at that point?
Now this even this resettlement for Holocaust survivors is easy to go from one displaced Nesse Godin 87 December 14  1995 Page 87 person camp to another?
Auschwitz was a half slave labor camp and a death camp.
And then somebody came and said to us  \ Ach  the Germans are gone.
They would have dragged me away  and I would have gone on the wagon out from the camp and into the oven.
Sort of getting a little...Well...three years in the camp became progressively worse as um  raw material was running out  and also as uh it seemed th at the war was taking a different turn.
But three days later the psychiatric hospital was emptied of all patients and staff and they were all deported and taken to a concentration camp.
And when you arrived  did they issu e you camp uniforms  or you stayed No.
You may be able to tell in talking to me or listening to me that I am troubled when I even reflect back on my secondhand experience in living in Camp Dachau.
Because Susan Levin who was born in the camp in about 1948 visited it about three years ago.
I think it was January January somethi ng  beginning of Janua ry  I think we left the camp.
And they made me a  like the camp translator  so they gave me a nice room with my two friends and my mother  and I found a doctor who told me the best thing for my mother is toast and tea.
I cannot forget how all these two thousand Hungarian women and the hundreds from our camp gathered on this big...big uh  23 This was evidently the Heereskraftfahrzeugpark subcamp  also known by its initials HKP  where repair work was done.
He was a friend of mine  we had shared offices together in the War Labor Board and so I -- he was as surprised to see me as I was to see his name and -- but I was looking for areas and I asked him t -- if he had any suggestions that could be used to set up a new displaced persons camp  to relieve the -- the overcrowding at Feldifing and I just dont remember how that worked out -- whether UNRA created another facility to relieve the overcrowding at Feldifing or whether people just left.
And they started moving us out into France  to a place called Camp Lucky Strike where we were interrogated by our forces and  you know  what it was li ke and what we did and who we were.
unintelligible] from Ausc hwitz  I was going on transport; whenever I went to camp  I was not ready to escape; ‚cause I knew when you escape  they gonna get caught.
Another two day travel without food  and we arrived at Kaufering  Upper Bavaria  which was a satellite camp of Dachau.
Many of them USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023 72 were kept in a -- in a camp jail for a few weeks  few months  but they were not sent to German prisons.
We had a m ilitary organization in the camp and it was formed.
At some point in time  they called us from the camp where we were and we had to go out and we had to be in line without clothes.

>> Manny Mandel: We were upgraded from cattle cars to military transport cars.
The guard was different SS  not in camp  the block -- we had more difficulty with our kapos  with the person from he prison area in the camp.
So  I was permitted to stay in th e camp  but not go out to work.
Well I came into camp  into the barrac k  and stayed a couple of days  and there was another selection  there was a selection for uh  they kept us very clean and very healthy  for a  a skin disease  it was called Schvierzba  in Polish  I really don't know what it is  it's some kind of enzyme  and they had a special block for that t oo.
And this was basically just a transit camp  a camp where people arrived  loaded in the cattle cars and sent on.
The camp the Germans lost the war before I was released from the hospital  or rather  they had to leave the  the camp.
But then it comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp  there were irregularities  they were using some  they couldn't  tools  all those by fo ot  they had no experts to perform  they  to perform a layout of the measurement instruments  they had no access to th e camp building office  they didn't even know then that it ever existed.
Ill tell you the truth  I meet sometimes some women in particular that were young girls  were children in camp  I dont remember them.
So the three of us arrived in Berlin  in the DP camp  which was located in the American sector.
But the chief in the camp  he doesnt want to let us in.
The Hungarian...the Hungarian of the hat and the yellow band and from there they took me to different labors...in Hungarian first and... Tell us  tell us  tell us what what...when you were in this labor camp  in the first labor camp...let's slow down a little bit and tell us what that labor camp was like and what did you do there.
I had 3 sisters  2 which perished in the concentration camp.
There were barracks  full of ba rracks  and we all got -- 04:16:00 this was an established concentration camp.
And it wasn't so strange  because there were people who attempted suicide in that jail because they had lost everything  they knew they were going to be sent to a concentration camp  back where they came from.
In 1956  after wed known each other as friends for a couple of years -- as I say in those days you didnt make phone calls every day  you -- occasionally a phone call  so metimes a visit  and some letters -- we met up again at the camp in the summertime  we both went there as adults  we were 20  to supervise a convention -- well  part of a convention.
Tell me how the whole camp was  how many buildi ngs there were  how big it was  where the gas chambers were  describe to me... The gas  the gas chambers was about --------------.
Uh  Greben was a la bor camp  so it wasn't terrible.
But these kids USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 37 did not know  you know what I mean  any be tter  they were not brought -- I says  ﬁSo therefore  Ill make my biggest request to you   lets take the kids out of the camp.ﬂ And before long  which again I have pictures to prove you -- that point  if at any time you interested  but since we are doing it just for -- on a tape like that  but if you would be interested  I will be more than happy to supply with copies of the pictures  where  at this particular time  the Palestine brigade  or the Jewish brigade  as it was called  which it was attached to the British fifth army  came in to help  not the Joint Distribution Committee  and with their trucks  which you will see on the pictures  Ill -- Ill show them to you afterwards  which with their trucks  we took the kids  and we shi-shipped them out to a separate camp to make a camp  where they could be tended to the needs those youngsters were needing  and they were the first ones to be shipped even illegally to Israel  by means that we were not even aware of how  but they shipped them out  a nd they gave them the treatment that needed.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 >> Bill Benson: And Jacqueline  around that time  your mother got a strange if not really bizarre c all from someone at the German E mbassy asking her to meet with them.
By the time they got to the concentration camp from the country they came from  they wou ld be stuck on this cattle car without food or water and by the time they got to the camp  40 or so people were already dead.
And  well  we didn't know where we were going but we arrived in Buchenwald.
Farben also manufactured the poison gas  the Zyklon B  and th e serum and the Sarin and the Tabun which were used to exterminate the co ncentration camp inmate s  knowing full well the purposes for which it was going to be used  because these were volatile gases and only I. G. Farben  only their technicians  could control the incidence of the gas  the volatility of it.
So we walked through that camp  and it was in a little building that was -- I think next to the hospital  but I didnt know  we came through a door.
Well  on the third day we arrived what which was a logging camp.
I probably went through this in concentration camp  not knowing even about.
42 Police station (German); according to interviewee  this term was used to refer to the camp infirmary.
We were sure...we didn't know when we were came there that it was Auschwitz but in our mind since we had heard that this camp existed  that we were punished...punished for our hiding and whatever  that that was the place where we were going.
But we always are afraid to go to the gate because the gates are what you call electrified and we are afraid that they put what you call it dynamite all around the camp.
I personally promised my Mom before they took her away to concentration camp that if I escaped from the ghetto  my town Lublin  she had asked me that I had to promise to her  if I ever survive.
You hardly mentioning  yes  it was children of women who were imprisoned in concentration camp.
We  and  we from there  we went to uh  Furcht  we were in a concentration camp in Holland 3 months  and uh  I was also very lucky  there comes a man to me  and he say  \ Are you not the daughter from the ho-from the Wei nberg-from the hotel in Zuola  and I say  \ yes.\
W e went to West Germany to a DP camp in Berlin .
And a part of  one wing of the hospital was turned over to the Gestapo to maintain the transit camp.
You know  my dad being having been in a concentration camp.
So what happened  they finally took us out by train and shipped us to Auschwitz.
After arrest of father  we were given 15 minutes to pack belongings and were taken out of our apartment and put in a concentration camp in Inowroclaw  where we were for about two weeks.
However hungry I was  as I said before  I was not that hungry.
And I have to say  Im very thankful to the Polish government  who ar e the most anti-Semitic people in this earth  to maintain the camp the way it is.
They took us  it wasnt from the ghetto  it was from the camp in Chantz.
But it was Nonyek whom was one day arrived to the camp office  straightforward to me  and said  ﬁSippy  I need the figures of French women  how many arrived up til now  and how many ar e still alive.ﬂ Now  I could have told him  ﬁWhy do you ask me  ask somebody else ﬂ yeah?
I remember only that only one man went uh  I mean I know that from the report that I heard about later on  it was a German--he was a LagerFeuhrer  he was the oldest in the camp  uh  uh it was a office of the  the eldest of the camp  you know .
Were there any guards or an ybody that worked at the camp  any of them that had little pockets of humanity?
They shaved our heads in case somebody will run away they should find [her]  they should know that we are the Jews from the concentration camp  recognize us.
But some of our people then later went to the camp.
And he beat me and shouted at me so that nobody ca -- he was very decent -- that nobody believed that I known about his plan to escap e. And about a year later we read in a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 44French paper -- you know  papers were smuggled into the camp.
From our camp and amongst th em her father and her brother.
So in May  one month before D -Day  the inmates in the camp where my father was  were transferred to the Straits of Dover where they started repairing the fortifications  under the fire  and all of that.
And during that six weeks  the camp would be run by  let us say  the Mapai socialist party  Ben-Gurions party  or Mapam  the more leftist.
I- [Ahem] see in this concentration camp thing  this was only one of my jobs  I had other  I was only there for about a day and a half  and uh then the [Ahem] then the army took over  I mean we turned it over to the Army and [Ahem] I had to go to all the  many different hospitals  and all the hospitals that were overrun I went into to find out if there were any American or British troops  and I told them  they told me to ignore the French troops  but uh  Americans or British.
The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth.
They recognized that they were both Jewish women  and they both proceeded to Lvov  and not far from Lvov  they were caught by a patrol  by a German patrol  who was out searching for escaped Jewish boys from  from  from Janowska street  from the concentration camp.
The DP camp in Munich was the former SS barracks but barracks is not quite appropriate because Kaserne actually means a center  a military center.
And at that time  we really didn't know what Auschwitz was except that they were sending people there.
And that we never regretted that we had  uh  spent such years in the concentration camp  or that so many died.
The first impression was freedom is trees and a camp is mud and a barrack.
SL: Listen  I know so many -- I know so many people that -- from the concentration camp.
They have some friends who are visiting them from the camp  there 29 may have been four or five people there  I don't know  remember.
After they were discovered  Estelle and her family were deported to the Majdanek concentration camp where Estelle's father was killed.
And what we did  when it was cold in the camp they made human ovens.
Because  if you know what Ausc hwitz is  you have better to die there from the bullet than to board that -- And people knew about Auschwitz already in the camp.
All I remember is that it took us three months to get to Germany  to Munich where we finally got to a DP camp.
So we are still struggling with the camp metaphor  from camp to camp to camp.
Like in a concentration camp you couldn't   but over there.
And so I smuggled myself into a refugee camp  even got food rations there  I remember.
there was a period in which people stayed in the camp.
There was a very loose  small camp  surrounded by the fences  barbed wire  and post towers.
And my husband was held back quite a few times  because he was a policeman in the displaced camp  and at that time  the sentiment against the Communists were very strong  and there was organiz -- Jewish organization called the Bundt  which was more left  you know.
Now  from England  how did he get into to this business  in th e concentration camp?
But I saw other children taking a pear or two hiding behind the clothes and I said I would like to bring back to the camp for my sister.
Now it begi ns we have to go to the camp.
End of Tape Four  Side A USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0037 87 Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0037 88
The stone wall is gone now that was in between  the electrified fences are long gone and shortly after we got most of the people into medical tents away from the camp even.
After a few days they were sent to another camp and then to Auschwitz.
You see    of course  knew that there were Jews up there.
What did -- what k -- how was the school set up in this camp?
And so the camp commander  Tassart  said  ﬁWe ll  Id like to send a delegation of the people to Rivesaltes to see how the conditions are  so they can convince the peop le in the camp that things are not that bad over there the way [indecipherable].ﬂ It was one of those  what do you call it?
>> Bill Benson: So they were interned but not -- >> Jill Pauly: But not in a concentration camp.
After three weeks being in that camp we were let out.
So there were rumors that they were taken to another camp in Poland  with no name.
It just said  \ I ﬂ then he filled in his name  ﬁHans Jurgen von Halle  born May 7th  1921  am in concentration camp Mauthausen as of such and such a date as prisoner num ber so and so in barrack number so and so   etcetera.ﬂ Now it was very unusual to receive a letter like this  but the reason why we received it because as I said before  it was still 1941.
Uh after about a month in that tent camp  the authorities realized that that was not a good place to leave us because people got sick.
I went into the city and I met some civilians that the English brought over to take over  to make a camp for all the people that were liberated.
But it was not a case that a command told us  \ Hey  why didn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can  or something else  to the family camp?\
She didn't -- she kne w would be transported to -- To a concentration camp?
So I got to that camp  which they cou on my orders Id even couldnt even say where Im going to.
Sh e was with the Russian girls in a labor camp.
Wh-What do you remember about the guards  and any contact you had with Germans?
While we were in camp -- I wi -- she was a real source of strength to everybody.
So  what they were trying to do is  people who are leaving the camp  they were trying to disperse them  so they wouldnt all go to New York  because they had the mechanism to take care of people  but not if th ey all go to the same place  because thats a big burden on one location.
IRVING HEYMONT: Looking back  not only of the uh  my experience with the DP camp  or fighting in two wars  seeing two others  living my life  I can only think of really  one good deed  what I'd consider a really good deed and it happened in Landsberg.
And therefore I I mentioned that in the in the article on the prayer in the camp  you know  that Yes.
And how long  you know  from wher e your unit was to where this camp was  was it a half hour drive  was it an hour drive  do you remember?
And in fact  I mentioned that my moth er was take the Gestapo arrested her and put her in a gave her to a Hungarian camp.
She said maybe people from that concentration camp ran away because the bombardment is like that  so I said to myself let me go out and look on the steps  so I opened the door and I went out on by the first floor and I see people that I was together in the camps.
She had the kids outside the uh...the...uh  outside the factory  uh  the lager...the concentration camp in Pionki.
So meanwhile  I met my husband into the end of June of 1947 and three months later we got married because he had had similar experiences that I had except that he had come to Amer ica just before the war  but he us never able to get his parents out and his parents and younger sister were also killed in concentration camp.
Do you remember the names of the people in charge in this camp?
The one was to approach the Allies and to take...to ask them to ask them that the Allies should offer to the German government to take the totality of Jews into the Allied camp  and to evacuate and the other camp would care for them .
I mean  did you meet people who had be en in that other camp?

Yeah  basically way tip was they didnt they didnt consider them as as real  they they should go to pr prisons  or they had kind of ba cu type of concentration camp  but not like German  but certain type  you know.
And we were not in touch with any eight kilometer from our camp was the what Russians call was baza   which is like a center  gog governments center  where they control all the activities in the neighborhood  for where were they just decided where the logging would be.
So we decided to get married and it was a big excitement  we were the only one  bride and groom  to get married and this and that.
But then they bombed the  the munitions factory and they bombed and they bombed our whole camp  so we didn't have where to be.
And while youre in camp  you do see a lot  you see people that are laying  you dont know if theyre alive or dead.
And whoever was sick had to go  that whole camp was nothing but women and ch ildren.
I wore them and I blessed them every single day because I wore them for the entire three years that I was in camp and in the in the lining I had hidden the pictures which are now in my book.
Okay  a -- and I know that I wrote what I called a national hymn for that camp  whic h we sang for [indecipherable].
Later that morning  we were asked to  we were ordered to leave the boxcars  line up in the areas in front of the boxcars right in front of the fence and the gate that led to the inner camps  where the camp was  with instructions that  with orders  I need to remember that  with orders barked  orders that all the Jews should step forward.
Dachau was only to work for the needs of the camp  industry stuff.
And my family  we were in -- sort of getting ready to go in line  and the camp commander must have signaled -- Interview with Pepi Schafler 20 signaled to my parents for -- there were tables over there and he was standing over here to -- to the right of the Nazis.
What I did  actually  when the camp was closed  I had to go back to my family because I was sick.

So in some strange way  you were fortunate to be in this work -- this gulag rather than Janofska [indecipherable] Well  I was fortunate because  you know  being there  you know  they -- they didnt -- this was the time where they didnt empty labor -- labor camp.
So how did did you eventua lly how long were you in the DP camp?
I used to think that a Holocaust survivor means someone who has gone through a concentration camp  which I was extr emely lucky not to have gone through.

We never found out where they were taken  what was done with them  where they supposedly were resettled  in what labor camp they might have been sent.
A. The Ghetto was very  very bad  and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything  if they heard about a good job that was outside  that the Germans took you away  they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were Sam Spiegal 12 May 3  1995 going to take you to a concentration camp or somewhere else.
But this time we were told  they got us all together  and we were told that we're going to be resettled to a fami ly camp where we are going to have better conditions.
And so they worked outside the camp somewhere and they were treated almost as badly as Jewish prisoners.
Some of the policemen were hurt simply by the physical strength of some of these guys  but eventually everybody was rounded up  beaten  and some of them even ended up being sent to the only concentration camp that was established in Bulgaria -- a real Nazi-style concentration camp.
As much as we fought them and we tried to keep our morale up  but there were times where it was so low that we couldn't bear anymore  and we would break down  and being that we stuck together with the Belgian girls  there was so many different nati onalities in the camp  it was a melting pot.
I came back -- when I left  the place  Warsaw  was engulfed in flames.

Went back to the camp  got scared of...of Canadians  wants to go back  doesn't want to stay in Canada because of this experience.
And they were Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 58circled day and night  and they said  light a building on fire  something  if anything they started to kill anybody or anything like that  and they would make an immediate attack on the camp.
There was an old Polish military camp where this was going to be done.

And mostly what I did in that camp where we received all the outsiders  the various origin people that needed direction and instruction  et cetera  somehow part of it.
This is why we were German-speaking  this was quite early  this was 1942 and 42  and um  and that transit camp  your names  your ages  and the places you hail from were registered.
There was–there are things I can–there are some things I can tell you about this camp  which I feel are interesting.
She did not want to survive by herself because they might sent her to a labor camp but she just did not want to do without the children.
So after Hi mmler came  they said that Beec and Treblinka they're gonna close up; because this is most s ecret and the most efficient camp from all the camps.
But during World War I  my father volunteered with the German Army.
So  we were in British zone in Gratz and then Britishers came over and said you are Jewish  do you want to go to Israel and put us in a 41 camp.
Being three  four years in the camp  without food  and they had to walk without clothing  in this cotton dress  wit hout underwear  without shoes  without food.
I should perhaps mention that I was moving very quickly from one camp to the next.
Not only were they in the camp  they were basically smuggled into the camp.
She played the mandolin there  Russian music and worked in the camp that the Russians had sent.
When we were brought to the concentration camp the last words that we were sent to each other  was in case we survived that hell  our meeting point should be back home in Lithuania.
She was liberated in Bergen Belsen  and on the train  on the repatriation train there was a group of Yugoslavia POW officers who had been in camp s ince 1941  and my sister maintained contact with one of them.
This is tape number two  side A  and we were talking about your life in the DP camp.
And finally we got in to something which we was called Auschwitz .
Now you people run around the Camp  tell the people to get together in the assembly hall.
No  it was just oo -- You just were in the hospital in the concentration camp?
When the German guard left the camp  they all took off in a cloud of dust when they heard all the commotion of the war coming on  artillery and sound of tanks and so on.
And also uh especially then came a little bit...got used to this...came to the realization that there was no way out because uh certainly the camp was was was surrounded by mo re than one fence of barbed wire  was electrically loaded  that to run away would be impossible and even if so  in a Polish area...it was still a Polish population where you don't know the language...was hopeless  so that the only hope which was there is to to live to to see uh th at Germany was militar ily defeated  and had surrendered.
coughs] People were stripped of any possessions they had and there was no way of carrying a prayer book into a camp and uh holding onto it  and I of course asked  how did you do it  and she told me that when they gave her her first Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
I wrote a letter to this guy what I gave him  in Kozienice  what I... He took my family to this place to...to the camp there  in Kozienice  what I give him a piece of gold.
Yes  I thought it was just a labor camp  and right away they took care of me  I didn't have to suffer any hunger  nobody was beating me up  you know  and we didn't have to work even  it was only Auschwitz was only a passing.
I didnt have no business in Auschwitz either  believe me -- Yeah  thats what I was -- -- figure that way  but Birkenau was actually a -- a womens camp.
But otherwise  you show me one camp -- sub-camp  where there were selections of those I have mentioned to you.
And after a time was the leader of the camp was a Jewish fellow was named Fiszer 12.
Then in April '43 I went on active duty  went through processing at Port Agra  and then ended up in basic training at Camp McQuaide in the Coast Guard Artillery.
Now we work with these clothes  so if  if we had a ripped jacket and we saw another one  we took another jacket and we didn't have special camp clothes.
At around 11 o'clock-ish they came that we have to go back fast into the camp.
I would go up  lets say  to Linz  and talk to the people in the office  and then Id go into a camp and talk to them.
And I do remember Auschwitz had this famous sign  Arbeit Macht Frei  work makes you free  I guess thats what the translation is.
So I think now is a great time to go back to your more recent past  and tell first  how did you get the opportunity or the in spiration to return to the camp?
So while we were in the displaced person camp  Jack and I had two children there  in the camp.
Yes  yeah  because I the sign we were wearing only when was concentration camp.
At that time  somehow  Lisa  this was the administrator  and the other one that was the scribe  somehow they were trying to do a little   and get my mother out  because they needed a dentist and they were bringing this man dentist  he was Dutch  from another camp.
DL] When was that when you went back to Auschwitz? [
And for a second reason is that the personnel material  and the administrative material of the organization that these people belonged to  whether it was a concentration camp  or a security police unit  or an auxiliary police unit  gave us a fairly 33 accurate  and fairly reliable picture of what the daily life of this defendant was  so that an expert witness could get up in front of a judge and say with complete conviction that on a daily basis  on a normal day  so and so rotated into these part icular guard assignments  and this was part of his daily duty.
It was a camp that was built for the men or the women who worked adjoining uh there was a very large factory where they I was told they manufacture the uh the missiles that eventually devastated London  and so that it was a much more relaxed camp.

He was sent to labor camp  shot in the with a child  and she was without.
The boys were usually abused by the SS guards  homosexuals and others  in exchange for favors in the cam p. And there were little children who were born in the camp and were somehow concealed by th e mothers in different places and  you know  in these slave labor camps surrounding -- there was a whole network right outside the main camp.
I don't recall whether we learned about the camp of Cyprus at that time or not  but we heard that some of the boats were returned  and we organized protests.
They were looking for men to work in another labor camp.
But then the Russian came every day closer and closer to the camp.
She went there  located her brother  located my brother in the Displaced Persons Camp in Poland and she told him I was alive and I was in a displaced person camp near Frankfurt  Germany.

It was very  very delicate operation and through some very distant relatives whom I -- until that point  never met  sent me an affidavit of support and lend me money for passage  because my savings went all for preparation of the papers  because everything had to be translated from Czech to English and from Hebrew into English and the Israelis had to pay some taxes  because -- which I -- Im not so certain that you know of that fact  that when you emigrate to Israel  the Israeli government  at its own expense  puts you through a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 34 language course and puts you through that refugee camp.
We have to talk to to to someone who was doing research in that camp.
All they cared ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 about -- >> Suzy Snyder: Not unusual because in a normal camp this would not have gone on.

They were eating and drinking and having...smoking cigars  and we were still in the camp.
He was in the same concentration camp where my family was killed.

Yeah  in the summer L: No  was not no summer camp.
There you were with a lot of these concentration camp survivors?
And Im sure I told you I finally wound up in a DP camp.
When we were   a  a week  or two weeks in camp  there were 72 Dutch men  and there was one German  what was a tra itor.
Hecker  Ros     80 % of the people from the camp  SS  they got death by hanging.
I want you to and so and we were then given our our beds  which means in this barracks there were rows of bunks  three tiers and there was...there was a thin blanket and the so-called mattress was a straw sack and uh and uh we were given to understand that this is our place where we can sleep.
And some of those families were in a camp  but in -- n-not of the same camp.
They said \ To a better camp  you are welcome to come and check it out\  and they put them on the trucks too.
One day ther e was news of a Republican victory in Spain  I don't k now how it got it  and there was an impromptu torchlight parade and we ran around the perime ter of the camp  was so happy  somebody was fighting for us  and they won.

He would see right away that the woman  you know  with my Polish  is not voluntary to go to work as a in labor camp.
There was a chief doctor SS doctor and there were chief engineers in the camp.
So they brought the boy out of his bunk and when he came  I almost...I almost fainted because he had just been released from a concentration camp.
It was the summer of 1941  and I stood in the camp 'til September 1941.
So  what happened - the conditi ons were worse and worse and  you know  when things were happening  a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and to liberate the camp.
Yes  they brought us into Ravensbruc k and...uh...they did not have barracks for us immediately so they put us along a road within the camp.
This was this  and after the camp  then our big place was yello w armbands.
We were herded outside of the camp to a place called Bauschewitz Kastle  the Bauschewitz Revine.
Did you go with her when she was No  I was in a camp  but Mother had two  quot e  jobs in order to gi ve me sustenance.
And in the concentration camp I didnt know that its holiday or not holiday  but the Polish people knew it.
>> [Laughter] >> Bill Benson: You knew you were about to leave.
I mean  even now  again  this book Ive just finished reading  which is about to come out in America  I mean again  I mean these places are -- Dachau is conc -- is -- is described as an extermin ation camp.
And uh  there  always the German doctor with white gloves and shiny boots  very proper uniform  alongs ide him was the Jewish camp doctor because if something had to be checked the German doctor would never touch a prisoner.
An d my older  my older brother  he came back from prison camp.
So --  but I would say anybody who survived for a long time was trusted  and thats how  for instance  we could arranged our escape from the camp because we knew all the prisoners and we trusted them and when they trusted us  and we more or less knew who the informers were.
And that was when we arrived in the concentration camp in Linz  outside of Linz  Austria.
And Hajda is also a concentration camp guard at the grunt level in a different system.
So they contact Jaros aw that from this camp just was just ammunition here  so you got somebody who carry out this ammunition to Polish underground.
The only contact with a person th at actually was in a concentration camp was Ye s-cho Mo-stof-ski wh o was the young man  the older brother of the two sons of Mo-stof-sk i .
And th e rest  they put outside and they told the people to run  and those who couldnt run were shot either shot on the spot or they were put on a truck and taken outside outside of the camp to the woods and they were shot there in the woods  and then buried in a ma ss grave.
These 224 boys that same day were sent from this local conc entration camp to proba bly one of the most infamous concentration camps of all called Maut hausen in Austria.
I know its a lot of help  even for the children to go to camp  to he lp them in school  which I appreciate those things  because this is a very -- extremely important.
And I don't know if they went to Birkenau or Auschwitz or wherever they went.
Uh  well they were less crowded because  uh  they still had the bunks but they had about three high and they still had about two people in in each one  but they weren't  they weren't as elaborate  hugh; the buildings weren't as big as the ones in the lower camp  the lower section of the camp.
Meran was a transit camp and Milano was a transit camp.
Uh  most of the stones were going for  uh  highways and for reinforcing underground bunkers and things like that and the people had to carry stones up the stairs  to the main camp because they built a hugh dividing wall between the quarters of the SS troopers and the  uh  kitchen and the infirmary or the hospital.
There was a British army camp not too far away from Asiv   that...uh... was...apparently  they were doing some sort of manuevers in the middle of the night unbeknown to the group.
So I went back to the DP camp very  very disappointed.
There was a certain aspect of that camp which was different from any other.
When I arrived  and the Jews who came into that camp were infiltrees (infiltrators?).
Uh and I would  I would listen to grown-up's conversation  and I knew where the man's camp was  and maybe because I listened uh I got it into my head that I want to visit my father  no matter what.
The fact that they had a camp like -- camp like Gurs right in the middle of their country without protest  is outrageous.
The only court appearance I remember was for these -- the camp committee guys  who had firearms and were arrested.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Yeah  you worked for a while in a camp where Jewish people came from Germany and then went to England.
Does this mean that the Jews that you knew in the DP camps were hard put to recognize that there were other victim groups like social democrats  like communists -- I think they probably -- those people had been in the DP  in the concentration camps  of course -- knew because they were cheek and jowl beside the people with the different markers on their concentration camp clothing.
>> Irene Weiss: Well  after a few weeks in this sort of holding camp  they began to send people off  counting people off and sending them out of Auschwitz for slave labor  various war work and other kind of labor.
And she was married for eight or nine years  and they wanted so much to have a baby  and in the camp sh e found out she was pregnant  so she fainted all the time.
We had...there was another camp near us  next to ours  which was the same as we had before.
They wished they would have food  because we...we were full of edemas and we were in bad shape  and that took two days  this transport...all those people to that town  into  into this camp and getting home again.

And people here  in the camp  in Mioufka camp or Shellneetsa camp  still had that little piece of bread from here or there  from the town Polish people  who -- who bought stuff and brought in and wa -- that.
So the day my father came back from the concentration camp and the smell  and the way he looked is a landmark impression  whether I was a child at the time  or whether it was when Kennedy was assassinated and I was a man  you know  we were I dont I dont think we should separate that into either childhood or adulthood.
They were told that they were being transferred to another camp.
And we had earl y Thanksgiving dinner at the camp or wherever we were.
There was -- there was -- some might have gone further to another camp and some might have gone to another factory.
We didn't know if she went straight or she went to a labor camp  but after the libera tion a girl came home to our town and we hoped that my father gonna come home  my mother gonna come home.
I'd pick up a couple of my DP police at the gate and I'd start driving around the camp  looking for lights in the basement.
And the transport go also west  because we know from our sources  and before go to France  turn right to concentration camp Bergen-Belsen.
Otherwise you will shot  maybe shot at sight  but uh if you were caught without guns and then you'll get a long term death penalty  be sent to concentration camp but OK  there was a very much better chance  and at that time uh we  the most of the Danish uh resistance movement caught would be sent uh to a camp just north of the German-Danish border where the conditions were some better  oh no  much 15 better than in a  the German concentration camps.

In this camp  most of the Jews  I would say like 97 percent of the Jews or 95 percent of the Jews were Polish Jews.
Uh  we ran across many people that were starved and uh  uh  I remember in in one place shortly after Nordhausen  we we came onto a uh  slave labor camp where the people were very hungry  and in this they had uh  uh  Russian prisoners of war as well as Polish and others.

And the camp had Interview with Romeo Fagiolo March 1  2010 4just opened  as a matter of fact  we slept in the motor pool  because the barracks werent ready for us.

I went back to the camp and I stayed there and I f finally they they were asking for as they were some Israeli came and fr to from a kibbutz to join he wanted to join Haganah.
He -- he was an -- his mother was a distant relative of my mother  who came from New York and he was working in Cincinnati and he got drafted and he was in Camp Wheeler a few months before me and he was graduate from New York Un iversity  he al -- he al-already was a sergeant and he worked in a regimental headquarters.
We never really - of course  in Auschwitz  we also knew about Auschwitz - but we had no idea about all these other places  where all this was happeni ng at the same time.
So once a month or so my father or my mother came to our camp to be deloused  and because I knew when they were coming  I always made sure that I had the opportunity to see them.
And they had friends there and they told the story USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 100 for Chaim -- that he went out of a camp and its a whole story and that hes unhappy there and this man who is a stranger  gives an affidavit.
In f act  they took a trans port  if I remember correctly  for about four or five thousand and put us on a ship and transported us all the way to the Baltic Sea to Stuthof (432) which was concentrati on camp.
And I think yeah  the training camp was actually maintained by the 82 nd division.
We don't have the exact detail  although we know it was Auschwitz.
So she was working in the camp  and right away Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 93they reinstituted the schooling system.
His name was Bart and he told me to look; he told me that there is reason my father and my brother surviv ed in there someplace  perhaps in the camp.
And I also met the president of Hadassah  because her son went to a summer camp to which I was invited.
He knew less English than I knew cause he was working already in the displaced person camp while I was going a little bit to school.
Explain to me how it was separate  and how diffe rent it was from other parts of the camp if you can.
Wed had -- Federenko was a Tr eblinka guard before that  wed had -- I dont think wed had another concentration camp case before that.
Well  we went  we [were] inducted in the Army  in the Armed Forces  in 1942  uh  late in '42  in November  and we maneuvered in Louisiana and Texas for approximately a year  uh  a little over a year  and  uh  we  uh  then went to Texas and the plains of dry  plains of Texas near Abilene  at Camp Barkley and then we went to the desert to get desert training at Patton's desert training center  which is now a national monument.
That was the only way that he could get out of the camp if he could show the Germans a visa to another country.
But  you know  it was strange but I mean  when you are in camp a nd you think that they could get anything  maybe just to look at it.
They're starving now  and um what are they going to  and no doubt many of them were hundreds of miles from their homeland  and yet this man said  I'm going home when we asked him where are you going  he said I'm going home  and yet  and  and then  as we went out of the camp  the roads were just packed with people  um  trying to get away from the camp as fast as they possibly could  to go anywhere but to be out of Dachau.
You see  that book that I showed you  the Theresienstadt  there are records of those that were shipped to concentration camp and records of those that survived.
But  the fact that somebody was shipped from Theresienstadt in a transport to a different camp  that does not mean that that person has actually died in that camp.
When the Red Cross came into the camp and saw these people  the condition of what these people looked like  they put them on ships and sent them to Sweden to Sanatoriums to recuperate.
Then they shipped us up to New Jersey  Fort ca -- Camp Kilmer  near New Brunswick.
They were f ixing the roof s of the houses and because they could go from one camp to the other  they were very knowledgeable.
Uh the Kamerlings having been arrested uh in the very early stages of the war and sent to Westerbork were in the nature of trustees in that camp and had uh quarters other than the barracks in which most of the inmates lived.
Then  the camp had closed  because all the people had been deported  so -- and they didnt let me come into Gerse and so I went to work in the childrens home outside of Limoge.
Well  anyone who is an SS person or an administrative personnel within the concentration camp  was automatically going to be tried because he was a member of a common design there.
1 MINUTE OF INTERVIEW MISSING Were you with Ben Gurion when he visited a DP camp?
And they made a hospital for us  and thats how we got out  I mean -- I remember the first day  that was the worst thing  I was practically in a coma  I was -- I didnt know what -- what -- I was imagining that I had killed the camp commander and had him hidden under my bed.
In the back of the room  sitting on the floor  when we came in from a blizzard  walked into this building– I dont know where we came from  I dont remember how we got there.
They were very frightening people to me even in...in peace time  but they were very rude and they were very bad and they pushed us and so we were very frightened and they hustled some people in a little room there and I...we didn't go to the camp.
In Plzen  we were told that the DP camp was being built  that we should look for it.
Normally  as a rule in every camp like a -- I mean  I can tell only where I was in Yavishavitz  that had they called it a ravia  it was like first aid.
And 13 is late to start camp  they had all been there before  they -- some of them had had friends  and -- but I didnt know about that til later  so -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 22 Why did your parents decide to send you to camp right away?
Also  when we Interview with George Pisik July 14  1993 14liberated the camp there were many  many bicycles lying around.
Now started the trip to Auschwitz  or not quite to Auschwitz as you will hear.
And of course the camp eh that eh we were put in was the worst one eh because well it had nothing else but because the barracks consisted of nothing else but four walls.
Interview with Helena Knapczyk May 10  2013 136 He was his his family was in the same camp when I was.
Well  as we speak of escape  perhaps you can recall how you left the camp  Buna.
And finally  one day  its happened that I met somebody  a man to whom I did give a pair of shoes  when we had some  there was -- had also [indeci pherable] from the conc entration camp.
Now  I am going to say something which...uh...you know  lot of people wouldn't understand the reason for it  but what I witnessed that day being in camp where they beat up the elderly people and make mush out of...out of them  you know  and the...the way they talk and the beat them and all that  I...I personally wouldn't be able to stand it  to see my father being treated that way and...and be...be there and not be able to do anything.
They needed German speaking people to be trained  so he bought all of us for a place called Bolkenhein which was a new weaving camp in .
For the longest time we thought that she had been -- we kne w that Stutthof camp had put all their still alive internees on barges and drowned them at sea when the Russians advanced.
And that was still when you were in Dachau   or out of Dachau ?
So she decided to apply for a job in this military camp  a German military camp.
Uh yes  we recognize you have been in the army and so we will send you to a better camp  and that happened...I was in say a month and at the beginning it raised my my hope and my morale and I didn't believe in in anymore  but I got indeed some privilege because of their alleged mistake.
The soldiers came and found -- whomever they found in the camp  they put you on the list.
I could go to the French camp an d talk with the guys.
And eventually one morning at about  must have been five  six oclock in the morning  the train stopped  and you know  we could see through the slats  you know  of the truck  something written up  Oswiecim  and then it said Auschwitz and I -- didnt mean anything to me  an-and the grown up people say oh  its a concentration camp  a nd I didnt know what a concentration camp was.
On the way there  this woman from -- this Polish woman that she -- that was in the camp  she went along  and she felt so sorry for me.
Because we were taken from the same factory and we were in the same camp.
And in this camp  were you able to inquire about your father and where he might be?
During the war  however  in addition to the regular boarding school  they added one of the wings of the  they took one of the wings of the convent rather   and turned it into a Fresh Air camp for poor children  children whose fathers we re prisoners of war  or whatever .
And Martin starts on the new path  slightly up  and I follow  and I see the sign  the place of execution of that horrible camp.
And when they ordered us in to this -- to this enclosure  their right penetrated  you know  in this -- this was my first encounter what a -- a camp looked like.
And one evening as we were walkin g home from the fact ory  it was already dark and I was walking on the outside  because we we re marching in rows of fives and I happen to be  at this point on the side of the sidewalk on the outside and as we were marching  sort of dark  I saw th is man passing by but I didn't pay much attention  I was much too hungry and much too tired  I was just dragging somehow to get back to the camp.
So I don't know who replaced her; but that was one of the things which I forgot about the camp.
And it was Muhldorf  it was the forest camp  or the Waldlager   for they called it.
And in the end they sent us on to DP camp in Italy.
I think they call it here  water in the legs  I think it was a heart related situation and of course  inadequate medical care and so forth and somewhere around 1940 or early 1941 his physical condition had deteriorated to such a point that the French authorities decided to send him home on a convalescent leave  figuring that within the next 30 days he'll die and he might as well die outside the camp instead of in the camp and save us the cost of burying him.
We also helped Jews -- they were hiding women and children that managed to escape from the small towns around the woods.
And was nice celebration  and I learn in my concentration camp  thats was small camp  wa s that 77 000 people  between the peop -- the 18 nation people  because was 18 nation people there  was -- most important was 28 000 Russian officers  army officers  17 000 Polish prisoners  3 200 French  3 200-something Czech  3 100 Jewish people  and many others.
People told us that there was a way of contact men  because there were always male inmates that were coming as electricians  as plumbers  to the camp.
end of Tape) .... no way  and uh to continue the stor y about that particular camp  -  when these rumors I started talking about came that people are transported to Germany  or to Poland maybe to labor camps  uh  my father felt we had to get out and the fact that uh we both spoke French pretty well there were occasionally French gendarmes - these were our guards who were at the uh the camp was surrounded by barbed wire and when these people did guard duty  some of them were sympathetic and every once in a while somebody would throw me a piece of bread.
At the time probably more so than his family  his father and his brothe r-in-law were killed in the camp  and I must tell this story because Mike Swab was his name  my be st friend  Mike  who unfortunately died in Holland two years ago of cancer  and we were the best of friends.
I got beaten on the... by the SS Wacht Stube  then come into the camp on the big appell.
You mentioned that you were working in an S  were you working in an SS camp?
Thats why we realized we gotta break the camp away from it  but the entire camp feeling  which you ask me  I did not know this.
First of all  they may strafe us as an Army camp.
And he still got the same -- my mother knitted me for Hanukkah there over in the camp; she knitted me a little outfit for him.
And when we came into the camp  what kept us together is  again  this type of older sister/younger sister closeness.
Then one of the families were s ent with transport to camp  so for couple of months we had one of the bedrooms.
We didnt leave the camp for awhile  but later on we took [indecipherable] part of camps  and we went in in the German and the SS barracks  and there start to get a little bit better in general.
And my birth date I obviously intended to give 16th -- April 16  1929  somehow it - two of the numbers got mangled  but clearly I -- I was use -- always using my sisters birth date when I -- whenever I needed a birth date in Buchenwald and throughout the concentration camp.
I become calmer  and I am now in a fortunate position to have retired with a pension  which is [where] Im very grateful for  that has eased my anxieties about n ot having anything  not knowing where the next meal comes from  which was the case in Germany  which definitely was the case in the concentration camp  that So to some degree  I am accepting the world today as an open opportunity  as something I can live with.
So he became a little too vocal against Hitler  because he was more of a Nazi that Hitler himself at that particular tim e. And that's the reason they put him in the concen...in this camp.
We did not know that in Auschwitz there is a camp  not at all.
We're faced with the problem of integrating these people into a camp  setting up a camp.
Because we went to Wa rsaw and built a camp within the ghetto.
And thats how -- I was there for about -- around December in that camp.
Our first meal -- some other people from the camp that met us told us down the street there was a pickle factory and there were windows broken so we climbed through the windows and our first meal was a dill pickle.
We did  uh  Auschwitz is a military camp  military pl ace.
I didn't want to be in a camp  I didn't want to be in a gh-ghetto  I don't want to be any place  I want to run.
And uh  in the camp  the people knew  you know  that I have to do it. (
And what else can you tell me about this camp Trautenau?
And they take us in a forest; some military camp was there somehow  because there were tents.
There was a camp -- there used to be a British POW's  but they were also evacuated already.
We went back to the camp which it was because we were working in .
So they  the police came  took away my brother-in-law to a forced labor camp; and my sister was arrested.
He was forbidden  he was let go on the basis that he is not going to talk about what he saw or what happened to him in the concentrat ion camp.
So  I went there by car  that was given to me by the leader of the concentration camp.
That's why they were able ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 35 to do it.
And we knew it  but very few in the camp office  maybe it was me and Katya  who knew what the real -- and that why we could help.
He was on one side of the camp and I was on the other.
We were talking a little while ago and I want to get back to where you -- you were -- a-after the war had ended and you were in Germany at this displaced persons camp  you met USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 92your m -- husband  you had gotten married.
This was the first time  the very first time  that we had ever heard of a concentration camp of Jews.
And then I did get in touch with some people with whom I was -- I wasnt in the same DP camp  but they were in a neighboring  there were so many of them.
And then  sh sh after they destroyed Warsaw   she she wound up in a in in a concentration camp.
What they meant by this of course was went to concentration camp.
I'm glad I wasn't in concentration camp with my wi fe.
But Himmler came there  and before Himmler came to Auschwitz  the camp had to be cleaned from  from top to bottom.
And but she gave it  and then my mother  there was no Mercedes left  just her cycle  and there was a camp for displaced persons.
We were  we had  for instance  in Sachsenhausen  in Auschwitz  on Sunday when we didn't go out to work  Saturday  they had to go  I never worked in Auschwitz because I was always in the hospital the  the  the re-re-reeducational camp.
It was not a Zionist organized  but culturally it was a Zionist camp.
They then went to the south of France to a camp whose name I cannot think of it right now  and from that camp they went to a camp called St. Cyprien which was on the Mediterranean coast.
And he had organized -- the children were in the camp.
Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30  2012 137 Di in Latvia and in in pioneer camp.
And it happened the case is  that she does not want to testify against that particular murderer  from that camp.
While you were in this camp  did you have any id ea of what was happening elsewhere in Poland?
Because to -- to -- in those -- at that time still  if you told them you were sick  I mean  there was always a danger they could transport you back to an extermination camp.
They went to a shelter and somebody turned them in  so they were deported to Auschwitz.
It was obviously much better than it was in camp but you know  I am not the one who is at ease in any farm.
So then all of them in mass graves near the camp.
It was  uh  situated on Ulmerstrasse in A ugsburg; and it was not a concentration camp in the regular sense  becau...we were locked up.
And because it was a model camp  it was actually a well set-up hospital.
I...She really did not have...what could have happened the worst to her was is if she would have to le ave the city maybe she will be taken to a concentration camp  but...uh...not...uh... I was afraid that if I will get out and they will recognize me that I am Jewish  I will be taken to the...to the....uh...not to the concentration camp  but probably killed or shot or taken to a death camp.
So it happened  people picked it up  but I -- you could read -- when you were in the camp  you were really in a -- a self contained community.
How  why it happened  it happened later in another camp too something like that.
She came to tell me that she was being put on a  she was put on a list that she is being transported out to another camp.
That was our diet every day in the slave labor camp  or even in the ghetto we had to scramble around to get extra f ood.
But then they took us on a truck after that and they took us to another camp called Buna  B-u-n-a  Buna-Monowice I think its called.
Uh...but...uh later when I...I must return...return to the point where I came to the other camp to help...uh...the sick people over there with typhus.
It was like a camp for the Poles that escaped from the German rules.
But i when I came to aux all right  Im coming soon ri to the next camp.
And they just have them all in camp  because there were whole bunch of them  and the only known camp was Ferramonti di Tarsia.
But th is was a very upscale camp  as far as camps go.
He was then put into a concentration camp  and he talked his way out of the concentration and this is all close to the end of the war.
She was a very dynamic person and she knew that she was going to do everything for us not to have to through a concentration camp because somehow people say they didn't know about the concentration camps.
I looked out and I found the whole camp festooned with toilet paper  rolled up like crepe  like crepe hangings.
Th at was my fathers sister  husband  daughter and then the young man that she fell in love wi th and they finally married  and my uncle Felix somehow went to Cuba  where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess they didnt feel like letting people out or couldnt get enough money out of them.
Well  at the time I was angry at my sister anyway  because the last couple of weeks that we were in -- before we were put in a concentration camp  she kind of stole my friend  and he was very  very impressed that an older girl was interested in him and he totally started ignoring me and I was not only jealous  but angry  hur t  and really wanted to have nothing to do with my sister.
And again  what was your reaction when you talked to these German soldiers?
Q. Was your work set in the camp taking car e -- or did you go on a work assignment  or your job was just in the -- A. My job was just in the block.
Now how long were you in this area  in this camp?
Not the way it functioned -- at -- and youre right  how would they know  but in spite of the fact of studying it for so long  I myself have not   until now  really understood that without that  you cant do anything in that camp  for good or ill.
Okay  so okay  the three weeks But is is from the point you lose your mother  not from the point you left the camp?
And during this -- during this time we find  you know  there was a concen tration camp and we released the -- it was be -- action was very  very quick  the Germans surprised that she didnt -- na -- even -- it was the [indecipherable] the lunchtime  they leave the -- the food in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 22-- leave on the table and run away  because fortunately was this way  they were at time -- this a whole story  but a -- very shortly I tell you we have a German tank and was prepare very good and the tank break the gate  Arbeit Macht Frei  you know  was break right away  and the German who supplied the German tank [indecipherable].
We heard it  but we never believed that it could be worse than Starachowice camp.
A small recollection  not particularly   but it happened while I am in camp.
When the time comes to go back to the camp  I just walked out of there like I did my day's work  she fed me  and I went back to the camp  I came home I told Fr--the guys you know  this little Herbie  and another friend of mine how lucky I am   what happened to me here.
When you moved to the concentration camp  you became a number.
13 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: Slave laborers there?
And I found out that my aunt and uncle are on Camp A  and that my aunt  my beautiful aunt was selected to be the housekeeper of Cuneman.
If we wanted to get some bread because we didnt have like what the Americans did on the American zone  a displaced pe rsons camp where they fed you.
They were from the from apparently also  they were former Russian prisoners.
J ust before they were sent to Auschwitz on the last train that got out there.
It was a nice boat  they were very nice  they brought us to Robb and this was a  actually it was a concentration camp and actually we had the same beds I have seen here  what they had in the concentrati on camp  we had the same beds  downstairs and upstairs  but they were nice to us  but we had very little to eat  like all the time  that's was our.
When we got onto the trains  none of us knew we were being taken to a concentration camp.
We entered in barracks that had been occupied by German guards.
Some of the things that even transpired within the camp  because under certain conditions  certain supplies and things were brought in by the people that lived in the town of Dachau  so they also saw the buildings.
The first job of the new crew  selected the evening before when the Birkenau camp was subject to a strict curfew  was to dispose of the bodies of their predecessors.
So they were with the mother  but somehow they got back to the camp  you know  where we were th-the barracks  where we were stationed. [
First of all  we building the camp because it was not camp.
the commandant of the camp  and Eichgruber  who is a Gauleiter of upper Austria.
I start tying everything togeth er  and then that building with the annex to it with the shelves and all of the Interview with Martin Gaudian 39 There's no sign that says Dachau Concentration Camp?
By the way  the SS kept four horses in the camp.
Well  I w -- I -- I think I was -- I was asking a question before the camp office is actually formulated.
Belgium  for inst ance  helped the people in in the cities around with   with with with religious people and so but the other work we were involved in was call it political work...to know that th is is a transitory existence  that living...tha t life in a camp is no normal life  that it has to come to an end  and that's the reas on why when and I were traveling very often 46 to London  and we had...with our friends of the World Jewish Congr ess...we had meetings with the politicians  with the head of gove rnment  not with a representative  interesting enough  of the British Army or the British Military Government in Germany  but we met very often with the with the...because we had a shorter lin e .
People who ha d survived concentration camp and who could think of nothing but to return to their home  returned to th eir home where some people lived  who maybe paid nothing for that ap artment of for that hous e  but considered it their own and had a powerful 23 weapon  that all they had to do is to say  \ These people are no good  they are enemy of the state.\
We have on every table in the -- in the camp  23 people  who in the morning they gave us a piece of bread with a little bit tea before we went to work.
We arrived in Ludlowe  which is pretty far from Birkenau - from - not Birkenau  from regime camp.
The whole group from the camp over there in Linz went to Regensburg.
Now  I was very fortunate that I got it while I was in that particular camp and not in Birkenau because typhoid  something that spreads is assured death sentence.
They took us in trucks  and drove us in  in that concentration camp.
We re -- were you ever allowed to sing when you were in camp?
01:48:02 [Dispaying documents and photographs] 01:49:20 This is the identification card that they gave us after we were this is a German identification with a British stamp on it  showing the name and which concentration camp the person came.
And when I came into that camp  so the first thing they asked me  \ What do you..What do you know what to do?\
Do you know how to spell the name of that camp?
These individuals would come in there  none of them ever put on any evidence to show that anybody was ever shot for disobeying an order given them in the concentration camp.
My uncle stayed in the city  lived in the city  he never left th e camp either.
When the time ca me that our camp had to leave  I couldn't walk .
Immediately once one of their people were arrested  we were going there  we freed them  you know  etcetera.
She wrote that the water faucets in the camp were wired with bombs.
So anyway  I t -- I took classes  and ma naged to als -- to move out of the DP camp  and to Munich  passed the exam and I was admitted to the university.
And I remember receiving into a camp  for an inspection  David Dubinsky came with his wife and deeply affected by what he learned there and what he saw.
So  what happened  so we lived in that area and in that DP camp  I dont know how many of us were -- but I do know that the museum has a picture of one of the barracks behind me and my sister.
that they were to register  but they were going to take them to concentration camp.
And of course  nobody was allowed to be armed in any UNRRA camp  you know.
So the Kapos later on and the block elders became  they were eighter Polish or Czech or - there were also some Jewish in the Jewish camp.
Thats what Im thinking of  the DP camp was in Leipzig.
And the other thing happened  once we were walking and doing some -- in the fields some work  and the airplanes came and we were all looking up  hoping that they will bomb the camp.
And he went inside  Mr. Niches  the oldest  camp oldest  got in and found it right away and he came out and (spoke in German) there is nothing inside.
I said it wasn't him that we were-- Starting with all the Jews were in concentration camp  they shouldn't draft them into the army.
There had been 4 000 people in the camp {Coughs} and now there were about 300.
No  I was during the day in a big camp called [indecipherable].
I -- I had no recollection of the Holocaust except after the war as a teenager by -- you know  I was 10 when the war ended  11 maybe  and b-by then of an age when all of this made sense to me  but -- and then Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 40of course my sister -- excuse me  my fathers sister  my aunt  who survived  Helene -- Helena  s-survived the -- the war in a Nazi work camp  what did they -- La-Labor -- Labor -- Labor camp.
And she was liberated and then I guess she was in a DP camp and then she went back to Holland a little bit and had difficulty living with my aunt and uncle who by then had returned from Switzerland because they had fled to Switz erland  I didnt tell you that story and so then she came here.
Every day was something happening in the camp  so when people were coming from outside  they said  \ What is this  how is today  what is th e mood?\  \
Then I got a call from a friend of mine and this time it was a call from Umberg and that was a name it was not camp but it was a major center for people -- for displaced persons who were trying to get to the United States.
And then -- I guess it was the tame -- time when Dad was in camp.
Some few only went to Kr akow Plaszow and only us  the ones that worked at the Oskar Schindler factory and held overnight  those were the only ones who survivedŠthat survived that camp.
But we were taken from there to Ac lite   which is a British concentration camp kind of thing  in Palestin e itself.
That camp was in Salzburg   in Reidenburg what they called the camp  that was mostly all Jewish people.
I and 19 other kids were sent to Heiden  a children's camp  a children's home  a boarding school if you will.
You know they took to - They 05:02 took them to the camp over there in - in Cypr us.
They let us stay in in front of the office on the camp.
Across the wall there are pictures of people coming off the train at the Auschwitz -Birkenau concentration camp.
Then on Friday night  Saturday nights and in the summer we used to go to   summer camp.
They had a canteen in a concentration camp  so after after a few weeks I pick up because friend of mine to ld me  look Julie  if you want to survive  you got to show them something what you can do and don't go down.
We came to America in early 1947  and my mother   when she was sent to Gross-Rosen  that is the rock quarry slave labor camp to work there.
So I passe d my jump  I passed my up and down and then  into the camp infirmar y. [speaks foreign language here] [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here].
I had no plans  and most of those who survived had no plans  because the impact of the concentration camp was overwhelming and it was very difficult to find your orientation under these new circumstances.
Unfortunately  and there were like another 40 people doing the same thing  which means we did not have to go back to camp every night and go back in the morning to the job... However  there was an accident  and the barn where the locomotives were stored caught fire... everybody started running and doing whatever they could.
The entrance to this underground resistance camp was by a very cicuitous road.
Uh  I remember seeing him in...with a group of the...the SS people who were in the camp constantly.
My father said that in Sandbostel they were Polish men were prepared that if we will be freed  they will try to go at any place to our camp  our Area.
That was another thing that I was able to save because when we left the camp to go to -- before they put us across the Swiss border  we were searched for all the papers.
And um  strangely enough  on  on that ride from Sosnovitz from the transit camp to concentration camp  um  there was a certain lightness which I remember   and uh  I can identify it now as um  the worst has happened  and as  as tragic as it was to be separated from my parents  in a way it was um almost you know  some of my fear left me there.
Did you pray at all when you were in the camp?
They had their own eh I guess commanders and what not within the camp.

We were not allowed to go out and a train arrived and there came some  some people came in this camp.
54 And and what did you think of him or people like that  who essentially were  I guess taking jobs  in a way  in the concentration camp?
But for some reason they couldnt get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then eventually  when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for labor  and we never heard from them again.
This camp was a camp  at that time   everybody came.
And in the camp there was no time or really there had to be everything done in seconds because you never knew when you're going to be interrupted.

And I had another sister and my brother-in-law who lived in Leads (ck)  which was in a different camp  but it was about half an hour ride from where I was.
At the end of the day  what was the atmosphere around the camp?
I mean  I understood from what you told me  that having been in the camp for x number of years -- Yeah. --
Ours was a   it was a not a camp  Birkenau was not a camp that they were sending you to work  it was an extermination camp.
And  sure enough  a few hours later  the troop carriers came  British  and they came to us around the camp and .
So we were suffering because we killed the horse  so when you want to know about the conditions I think the change was also that instead of of guys  special army  SS came in and they were in charge of the camp.
And now when I came -- they live in flor -- she lives in Florida  I found I have nothing in common with her except the fact that we were in the DP camp together  in the same DP camp.

In that huge complex of former camp there wasnt another human being in sight.
And after a year  I get much better  and he notice me  because he goes from one camp to another  we have 17 camps in Africa   and after a year he came again to ours camp  and he was ca going on the horse  and I was walking near the orphanage  and he recognize me  and he said  oh my goodness  you are so beautiful girl.

Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 52 Not n-not not at that time  not at th at time  but later on  when we decided to do get married in [indecipherable] in the displaced persons camp because you see  while were struggling around still in Poland  it was very hard to do that because we were constantly thinking that were not going to stay there  definitely  because if not [indecipherable] Sam definitely would have gotten killed  because we even heard that somebody was trying to do that.
There were tents of wood  not   they call it and we were obliged to build a new  big camp in Goldsberg  about two miles fr om there  because they were pl anning to arrest the Jews of Hungaria and Transylvania  which that time was under Hungarian occupation.
But th ree of these little kids that lived in camp  who went to Poland after  to Starachowice after the war  were killed in Starachowice  so you heard about that.
And we were all later set up in displaced persons camp.
Can you send me to this camp t o be with my sister ? [
Tell us a little bit more about who was there in this concentration camp  where it was a stone quarry  where you had to work very hard cutting stones.
>> Bill Benson: And this is the family that your father  as I recall  helped them out.
It seems to me that we were repairing things  ma ybe they were unifo rms  maybe they were just things from the camp.
After they counted us  they gave us black coffee and a piece of bread.
And some French company built up the little factory there  right in a concentration camp.
The -- it was just so plain that you couldnt keep them in -- Jews and non-Jews together in the camp.
At one time he was like a judge in the camp because if there were disputes among ourselves  among  in the Jewish community  it was taken care of by our own people.
But along with that I think was this constant planned reduction diet  which ended up in these people dying or getting weak enough so they couldn't work  and then they were put into these -- and this is my own impression I had when I left the camp -- they were eventually put into one of these three buildings there just to be there and die and be burned through the furnaces.
Interview with Felix Nicinski March 6  2007 55 That was the last camp  the third camp in Germany  that was Bergen-Belsen  and thats where we were -- we were liberated by the British at that -- the British liberated Bergen-Belsen.
My tattoo and the SS man took–ﬂoy-veyﬂ from the labor camp; they tattooed us.
I wanted to ask you if you could give me a sense of how conditions in this camp  in terms of the daily conditions wer how were those conditions different than in Auschwitz?
I think at the end...not at the 20 end...at the point which I am now talking about...there were some thirty children and Demera  the lageraltester  the head of the of the camp  the Jewish head of the camp  was afraid that his child and his children who were badly...who were well treated  they had enough to eat...the Germans gave them enough to eat  but that they would would be gassed  so he persuaded...uh he told the SS look...we have the children.
They took you into Camp 3  and there you were shot and that was the end of you.
When he gets to the camp  about what period ar e we talking about?
Our marriage was on the rocks  because I don't know  I said this already on the tape  but I'm saying it again  I don't know any marriage which survived the concentration camp if they both were there.
And I tur -- I turned out awhile later  that the director of the camp gave my bunk a speech on how to be nice to me  because I might be different  and may not speak English so well  I may not know everyt hing they know.
At a ny rate  I spent several hours in that transit camp and it was a horrible sight.
And then what was it like for you to go into the ghetto?
And what happened  in the Kristallnacht  my other uncle  one of my moms brothers  Willie  was arrested  and he went to the camp of -- starts with an R  I forget the name now.
My father had a factory half a mile away from the camp.
Oh  of course it was different  because ev -- first of all  we were -- well  i-i-in -- in that camp it was different because there was never a danger of being killed  you see?
So they put him into a POW camp for the German prisoners.
Thats my first reason back  I never was in a concentration camp.
When I was in the village with my grandparents  where I spend  as I said  all my summers until I was 10 - 11 and had outgrown that and I was with the girl scouts at camp.
This -- if sh -- if theyll find -- many cases  if they found a few dollars with you  you know  when you come in sometimes -- in the camp  I remember when we went in  they search you  they check you  the a -- MP.
They didn't want to give us water  and we arrived in Ravensbruck  another great gem of a camp  and they accepted us.
We came to to the Camp B. There was A  B werk arveg   bayvek  catsen  they were called.
But we only went to that school for about a month or two  an d then the British militar y  they inherited what used to be a a rest and cu recuperation camp outside of Berli n  about three or four hours drive out of Berlin in Luneburg  and where the German s had a rest and recuperation camp.
When they had us in camp where they make barbed wires already  and they change it from a regular camp to a concentration camp.
Not in the camp  not in the headquarter s of the SS.
We were eating grass  but at night fruit and (crying) bread was thrown over the fence by unknown people into the camp.
That quote  camp  thats a group of apartments in the -- pretty sure it was the Russian sector and they took care of people as they -- the Breecha brought them in at night from Poland.
They were on the outside  asking -- 35 They were -- yes  they were in the mens -- in the mens camp.
Soon the Americans arrive to open fire; and they had a lot of...we were surprised how much munition and  uh  armaments they had in that camp.
And then the next day or so  that time it was very big bombardment  they wiped ou t the camp  right  and my father and his friend Drogas   th-they both got killed.
That was  I was  most the camp was some people from Poland and a whole group of Hungarian women.
Now  Tomachek was the last commander in our camp  and he was just the opposite of Mikel Cromer  or Karl Rheinger who was a monster.
So th from the camp  we went I went first  then later on my mother my mother was a teacher at the school  but then they asked my mother to co me to the school to be guardian of the mother guardian of some of the girl of some classes  and then also to teach gymnastics.
That night they surrounded camp and they took out all the young people and they put them on a boat and they sent th em to Israel illegally.
The thing is here  all Jews who were arrested for deportation ultimately wound up in the transit camp.
There was in...there was in concentration camp a condition called mussulman and I don't know what it comes from  but these were people who was...whose...who were so physically and mentally deteriorated that they no longer cared about survival.
And  of course  later on like a week or two weeks later  ...uh... came the...uh...evacuation from this camp.
Of course the trouble was  we had to move out as the Russians had bombed our camp and had dropped Molotov cocktails on it and my building that I lived in got burnt to the ground and even then you could smell the oil in our clothes where it had splattered all over the place and of course then they rounded us up the next morning and marched us off and that was it. [
Then my mother  as I said  applied to the German military camp.
That was before the experimental camp  and the whole trainload of gypsies just killed.
We were all evacuated from Radom and we went to Pionki which was a  a labor camp.
Finally we came out to Auschwitz the middle of the night.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us how they did that and where they went.
So yes  it -- I alwa ys said this was my od erver to camp life.
The capacity of Auschwitz One where I was was probably 30 000  maybe over 30 000 prisoners but Birkenau camp was built to hold 200 000 prisoners  and Birkenau also had a womens camp and the barracks in Birkenau in the mens camp and the gypsies camp because there were gypsies  were all wooden barracks.
59 But how can you charge a membership to the kids who might be three days in the camp  or might be three weeks in the camp?
But And what happened after they registered you into the camp?
Pick up your belongings and follow us.ﬂ So they took us to the camp where we arrived.
This was Buchenwald... They send us into a area with a tremendous camp.
But that came a little bit later with the uh evacuation.
I well  when I went [indecipherable] Camp Roberts for basic  I was supposed to go into the th-the AFCP six weeks basic training.
And on it  I had to  uh  write in gothic  uh  characters all the data concerning that particular camp  and all the camps  you know.
Being starved in the camp  every crumb of bread and every piece of meal  is always in a -- a very important factor in my life.
And here comes this little Jewish guy  he was still in his concentration camp stripe s and still he out  and he sees Curt  he hugs Curt  and he says to me   ﬁThis man saved my life.
Now the camp was divided in  it was a part where the Germans lived  and there was a part where we lived  and there was the working group  where we worked  and there was the Lager Drei  what we called it  ---------  where the people got and  and burned  but that's the final stage  it was.
So when you talk about Dachau  do you mean the town of Dachau or do you mean The camp. --
This was a labor camp  this became a but it became a concentration camp really because the SS officers went.
Anybody from U.S. military afterwards or during talk with all of you guys who were there?
I went to army school  intelligence school and in Camp Ritchie.
They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the camp.
They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of the people in the camp.
But you -- so you came back when the job was done -- Well -- -- or they released you  or you escaped  or -- -- somehow  somehow  somehow I got back  I dont know what was [indecipherable] because we were then shipped to Stutthof  which is a concentration camp around Leipzig.

My aunt and uncle stayed with us only for one year  but then they -- they left  they went to a different camp.
They beat me with a wooden spoon that you cook fo r a whole army  which is very thick and very  very long  and only when it was broken  she threw it away in disgust and she let me go  but for weeks I could only sleep on  on my stomach  and  and I  I was in agony  and I this is how I had to go also to  to work  and I  I couldn't sit  I was  was always uh seated on the on the edge and uh  the bombs were falling uh constantly because uh they were trying to hit uh the barracks and uh  but what they hit  they never in the factories  they never hit the camp  but they hit the  the factories and they  and they hit the uh  the kitchen.
I guess the cant -- the time I spent in the c oncentration camp taught me that  too.
They did have some women in parts of the camp  some children in parts of the camp.
And both my daughters were counselors there and now my granddaughter Interview with Brigitte Freidin March 12  2001 30is going to Camp Louise because of the generosity of what the S-Strauss family did for poor children.
Not only was it very limite d  but it was also established later that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 63 a lot of the money which was assigned to the camp for provisions was stolen.

When the British came into the camp  and one of your friends came in and told you to take a look  and -- Yes. --
Nobody who visited us in the camp office from the ma in prisoners had an idea what we are doing  how we are function. [
It was a camp  Koozen #2 where we worked on Messerschmitt  airplanes for the German army.
which um  um  from um  from horses and army  an armory  and that's  that place they uh  they turned it into um  the detention place for the uh Jewish people th at they caught  and from there  it was in the early fall  we were transported to um the concen tration camp  and we went into cattle wagons  and we did not know where our destination was going to be.
And I wore those boots throughout the concentration camp and I believe that eh at least in one of the concentration camp help me survive.

They always made sure that we would write to our parents in the concentration camp.
My mother died actually of natural causes in that camp  from starvation.
Then  after that  when was had a few days at home before going to Camp Stoneman which is in California   near Oakland Army base.
And that was the issue that was ultimately de cided in Schellong  and that was the issue that -- that -- that form that pr -- precedent comes fr om Federenko that formed the precedent for the e -- every subsequent case that involved a concentration camp.

Th e Karlov camp was our salvation  but there were problems there too.
And I bent down  and picked it up an d put it in the jacket to take it to camp  because whatever either one of the three of us found  stole  or otherwise  we shared.
What was the camp like when it was so busy  as you put it?
But before we went in we had to strip again  naked  throw away the tattered concentration camp shift  and we got a bed.
Oh  a little piece of marg...of sausage or so...I don't know  but anyhow this first day was a day when when we were registered and and and also again people came and asked what was your profession and I stick...was sticking to my lie that all my life I have been nothing but a welder  because pe ople had told me who had been in in a camp 36 before in the action that the Nazis despised tremendously any people looking somewhat intellectually or or professional or so the worst were the were th e lawyers and and and when they found a lawyer they really...they they mistreated them very very badly.
Well  but if would be a struggle to become a decent human being again  after the experiences of concentration camp.
The camp was primitive  or rustic  as you would expect in basic training.
But maybe they didnt -- you know  when you have photographs from people th at were from different areas  and put in one camp  and how -- you cannot tell which city  whatever it is.
Uh and they had it at least twice a day  so we were all led to a big place  a big square and there we had to line up...our block...in in rows of five and had to wait until an SS man came  and there were...were the head of the camp  the SS that was ...the SS stormfurher which means captain.
And he said that he was in the same camp with them and he sa w them die  so he knows that they are not comi ng back.
I want to escape from that camp - you know  over there.
And it was funny incidents  there were people in Polish army under British command  and they stopped not close to our camp  and Germans ask  why do you stop here for the nigh t?
Yeah  we did get to the camp and we f Were you scared then?
But we were in that camp with a lot of more refugees like ourselves.

I think that shes captured  she been captured  because I know that sh later on later on she was in a labor camp.
Yes  and some who even died before because they were taken to labor camp.
And we ended up  because we went into the wrong car  we ended up in the camp where we were working on bullets.
And then  you know  then he ask me if I know that those ei ght people who survived not the camp  who survived  they have been hidden somewhere  whatever  that they all have been killed.
Uh  he had to go off to the forced labor camp  but  uh  we promised each other that if we both come back  we going to get married someday.
I kind of think is that th e German guards they were SS  they were volunteers to be there  I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was liberated April 29 th.
And you hope and look forward for the end of the day when you can go back into the camp and just fall down on your face and get a drink of water.
Its like at the big a -- concentration camp  and fi -- but it was given this  and of course everything was cancelled in our -- our walking  our letter  wa -- everything is this.
Well  they ask me an so then this tattoo number of my arms  that I was in concentration camp.
>> Bill Benson : What was the labor that you were forced to do?
On the first of September 19...well  after...after this excitement with having all the people there  these families  and...but they had enough to eat and uh everybody was  of course  preoccupied so again the the the wagons at the railroad station and we knew what they meant and on the 1st of September  we were led out from the camp to the station.
I think 15 either it was in October or November  the part of 9 blocks was separated again by barbwire and the gate was put on and on this gate they wrote that a prisoner of war camp and the Russian prisoners were brought there.
And my dad had already been told that he was going to be the school teacher either in Theresienstadt or in the camp that Anne Frank was sent to  the first  the concentration camp.
No  no  they were they were wi I would get [indecipherable] we brought we brought 4 000 German prisoners in to live in the camp after all the other people left.
You know  in -- in every o -- camp  you have to keep track of numbers  you have to keep -- for food rations  you have to do your own cooking in so-called field kitchens  whatever we got.
And because I was able to make a life for myself  and still be educated in this country  and still be a child in this country  because I still went to summer camp here  I went to high school.
In what camp he was  how long he was  what he did in camp and this  the whole histor y. And this was my job.
A. Initially  we stayed in Sachsenhausen a very short time  just like a passing through to the real camp  maybe two or three or four weeks  no longer.
This was not a labor camp  this  this was just   St. Cyprien was just an internment camp  there was no work being done there  it was uh on sand  on a sandy beach actually on the Mediterranean.
If the prisoners were coming back in the camp later in the afternoon  most of them would go out of the camp  walk around and come back.
And we got up --it rained at night  we were wet --and walked again in direction away from the camp.
I was told by people who got out of Majdanek in October  that theyd seen him in camp orchestra.
We probably at that time were maybe three  three miles  three and a half miles away from the camp  and once a siren went off we knew that we were discovered that we were missing and that the search would begin.
I mean  we -- I mean we had former -- former c oncentration camp guards in there  which -- who -- who -- in -- in a few cases were in fact identified by former prisoners.
On arrival the prosaic reality of being picked up from the ship and sent to transition military camp  which was horrendous  of course.
So I went to  from Czechoslovakia to Linz  Austria  and in Linz  Austria I was in a displaced persons camp for a while  and I heard that there's a Jewish brigade who fou...who fought with British and that they are in Italy and they are making arrangements to get you into Palestine.
And the people who were going to the Wilno Ghetto to bring products for that camp  was the name of the camp.
And they somehow found some shorts and some clothes fo r me and that was my first wonderful memory  was to be for three weeks at Camp Louise  which is the dearest thing to my heart.
And by dealing with the regulations of protective detention  which was imposed by the Gestapo outside the concentration camp  and ha d little to do with the individuals sojourn within the camp  except to bring him or her in  or bring him or her out if he or she managed to survive.
As you're runni ng the camp  but you're also  you're Jewish  and as you said  you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a place like Poland.
Now at this time uh starting in the summer of 1938  all Jews who who were holding a German passport had stamped...and irrespective of the Nazi laws  we were still considered German nationals...all 18 German passports had printed a J into their pa ssports  and when people came back  especially after the November events  to Germany they we re taken immediately into custody and shipped into a camp  in a concentration camp  so in orde r to protect our escorts  the uh Ministry of the Interior  the Nazi Ministry of the Interior  gave everyone who who was an escort  they call it protection letter which he could use for the border police to say and it said that so and so  in my case Norbert Israel Wolheim  you know that's my name  was was is is traveling in German interests and should be and so uh we had the first transport under those conditions ready in January.
But as I we nt around through the camp with the committee  the Jewish committee  I was appalled by what I ha d seen.
And we were brought into barracks  at first into the ﬁAﬂ camp and then later on into the ﬁBﬂ camp.
She took him to her  she took her children to her  to the camp where she works.
The United States   with the help of the Hebrew Sheltering Society  they set up this Displaced Persons Camp.
I think -- it wasnt a camp that I worked in day in and day out.
I guess -- there were beds there  bunks  and things like that.
Then they decided that my division was going to go to Europe  so they shipped me to to South Carolina for more training at Camp Buckner   and then shipped me through New England to to to France and to Germany.
But what only...what he supplied not only me...he gave me clothes because this was the time in May when the Jews  slave laborers came out from the concentration camp.
Once I did it  maybe they were transferred from one camp to another and I was in the back of a truck and I went from to   and it happened.
So I knew that there was a commonality of experience that my friends parents had been in camps  and my moth er had been in camp  but there was a difference.
When I was -- when the ghetto opened  everybody has to go into the ghetto.
You mean  overall  or just the being in the camp didnt happen again  or Overall.
We were going to take care of Jews in a camp  but the French at that time were having trouble in Lebanon  so I learned  and so the British wouldnt allow any women out of the country.
She bought a goat well  the the goat gave half a glass of milk  that was my And did other people in the camp know you had a goat?
Meanwhile  we were supposed to be thrown in the ditch or be cremated  but as I said  he  when we arrived in the back to the uh to the uh camp  they took me off of these bodies  and took me in to a French barrack  and then he changed the insignia of a Jew to a Frenchman  to a French orig in.
And next to this guy is an Israeli soldier who served with the British Fifth Army  who was the head of the group who came to take the kids out of camp to bring them to their own camp.
Now  in  in this  that camp they had about  about uh  I would say about 20 maybe 20 Germans who were there  and then there was a group of about 200 Ukrainian guards.
In the middle of that  the resistance...members of the resistance had dug out a camp.
Neuengamme was the head camp for the whole te rritory  for the -- all the a -- other.
And when I ever told that to people [indecipherable] said  there not such a thing  nobody came back from concentration camp.
This is a picture in Agnone when we were in the concentration camp or how you want to call it   a prisoner camp  and this is a picture -- most of the people on the picture was a group  we were together in this building  and then on the side -- on the right side you see my fath er and beside me.
But there was a general feeling that more or less they knew that they will go to some camp.
They send us off and we went to the camp where all the peoples.
And they could never come out  and they were sen -- then sent to Poland in the concentration camp  and killed.
When I got...when I left  I got to the other camp I was very miserable. (
And in Leipzig there was a whole bunc h of young women  mostly Russian  from a labor camp.
I was released from POW camp  made it to Vienna as fast as possible to go back to school  right  at the university because Id ha d my gymnasium  right?
So the parents that night were taken to the concentration camp.
They left the camp and the Germans  what you call the political Germans who were in the concentration camps  the ones what grab us and steal us.
Can you tell us from the time you got on 7 Anne Frank died in the \ Star Camp\  (Stern enlager) of Bergen Belsen  probably the same compound.
In February 1945  of course  you are evacuated from the camp and taken on deat h marches.
So  so you see that that was the un  then what prompted us also to escape was that we knew that the  the end of the camp was nearing because the front was you know we had good information because we had the r  radios.
But that  of course  wasn't to happen  because from there my parents were taken via Westerbork to Auschwitz  where they were separated and my mother was sent on to another camp where electronics were being assembled.
Nevertheless  it would pass  but one was keenly aware of the preciousness of life  and to hold on to it as long as possible  and to me  this was really the most important thing  and I would say that during that entire time that I was in the camp  was a little  I mean  except for the beginning of the war when I really did not know  and only heard that the family had chosen that path together.
By the way  thats one of my really vivid memories hi s daughter was at one point released from a concentration camp  and I remember her coming to my grandfathers house and being totally skin and bones  full of lice  and I remember that she looked weird  and they put tar on her head  and she just looked so crazy to me.
And I was in concentration camp in ‚45  so that was almost eight years after.
But meantime already I left the Auschwitz and I dont know what happened but I learn later that was a very big new camp over there.
Why were they sent there and the camp had deceived them?
At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a summer camp as a counselor up in Maine  up in Wa terville  Maine.
My father was assigned to working in a factory in Auschwitz where he remained I believe for about six months at least  maybe even longer.
How long after the -- Liberation of the camp did you go in?
And thats -- thats -- that was the last camp and then from -- from the train  she was transferred.
A couple days I stayed in the camp and then I went to work back  because you were afraid.
So  that is the  the  the really the difference between the work camp and  and uh  a death camp.
Uh on e bomb  interesting enough  also by mistake uh uh went down in our own camp  which is outside of the factory...which was outside of the factory.
One of the reasons I found out  many years later  why they urinated in the halls  defecated  is when I real Primo Levy's book  about the problem when you had to go out at night  and the last man had to carry the bucket  and they could tell by the sound  so to avoid going out with at night  they'd do it right in the camp in a corner  and that carried on.
So we were sent there  but they need -- there was a camp set up not far  three miles  maybe two miles  so we could walk every night home  and every night go back to -- and every day go back to work.
What -- what I was saying wa s that in some cases the children and -- and possibly even the spouse  particularly if the subject met the spouse after th e war  or met her here in the United States  they have no clue that subject X -- that husb and and father X was a concentration camp guard  or was a shooter in a -- in a police squad in the east.
And ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 many were.
So and -- and then we stayed together  we went to a concentration camp in Holland first and then we went to Westerbork  where all the Jews went through  then we went -- sent to Poland and we went in a freight train  it was the first freight train what went away from Westerbork.
But  when  when my husband came back from escaping from prisoner of war camp  we stayed in this town called St. Etienne  and uh he  he took over this uh  this uh store because he wanted to try to  to equip the underground that was in the mountain not far from there  and gave them every possible item that was in that store  socks and blankets and everything that was needed up in the mountains.
But all of a sudden we came to the camp of Dachau.
So you it took days to get to Camp de Gurs?
It was before they put him in our camp and when I was -- I was to make warm for him.
I didnt have nobody  just some boys  you know from the concentra tion camp  we used to be friends  this was all.
So in doing so  and unknown to me at the time  they invited a man who had been in a slave labor camp there in Magdeburg.
So they even put G.I.s   you know  watching the camp  and one day we had the uprising over there.
Bel -- its a co -- a concentration camp in Poland.
Maybe there were me n too but when they chas ed us out of the camp from the rest it was  I mostly sa w women.
And my sister became a runner for the offices there in the camp.
Uh  but fortunately that...that work  in...in that was finished in...in a very short time; and they decided again send us to a different camp  in a place called Wolfsberg.
Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 25 At -- at Dovercourt camp -- Im not sure where it was in England   but it was a big  very temporary camp for children who were first brought over to the country and kept there while homes were trying to -- were found for them.
It was on the way from um the transit camp in Sosnovitz to the first camp in Boltonheim when we were on the train  and uh  this is actually where I met Susie.
And in that camp they took all our clothes away  and the British were [indecipherable] they were burning shoes  wa ev erything that he had  blankets.
When we arrived  they were already  I think they were liberated in May  maybe I dont know exactly whether May or June that displaced camp was formed  but when we arrived in October  it was pretty much organized.
My mother had two br others who were in the camps and I found them in a camp in Holland   in Westerbork.
So  th ey had a little bit of sugar that they divided between the people as we were leaving the camp  and it is the combination of snow it was snowing  it was cold  it was terrible but it was the snow that kept us going because no matter how tir ed you were  you rubbed your face with the cold snow  you were more alert  and by mixing the snow with a little bi t of sugar  it gave you a little bit of energy  which was also very good.
All I had what my papers was that I was come from a concentration camp  Paragraph 58  that means Russianary...a man who can be a spy  everything the worse that exists.
He was one of the maintenance men in the camp  and one of the few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different camps  when if something was broken down he was the man who had to repair it.
And they would get into the New York papers and Leon  what's his name  the head of the camp  so this was going on different places.
Lived in the Bronx with a friend of mine who I knew from Transylvania who came here much later skipping the displaced persons camp  and being drafted during the Korean War in 1951.
They were around my age...I don't remember...they were one of the first ones to come back from the camp.
In other words  Trifa was a concentration camp prisoner  or was ca -- I take that back  Im going to withdraw that.
We were about the same height  and the same age  and we teamed up  became very good friends and since uh he came with a group of Dutch Jews that arrived at the camp  an d it is a sad experience to tell about the Dutch Jews.
And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp  from a prisoners of war camp.
And so I [ went to work on a railway building camp.
The forest  one piece was on the side  on one side of our settle Your settle your camp. [
And then when  at Pearl Harbor the family was evacuated back to the States  mother had a  was originally from Kansas  she was from Wichita and so my husband  my Eva Edmands 21 [Date not labeled] Page 21 future husband and his sister and mother came back to the United States while his father remained in the Philippines and then later the family got word that he had been made prisoner of war of the Japanese and he wound up dying in Japanese prison of war camp.
No camp you could talk to -- from one camp  if you belong to this camp   you stay with this camp.
you have to bring those people how -- how the camp has developed  and that you will find - I would not make now  or waste my time or yours  but they are working in Auschwitz now with a researching the development of the womens camp  and they will have the datas much -- very well defined  very soon.
Irving: One day– Anthony: This was a farm that was not far from the camp?
Who was a displaced person who would benefit from housing  food  clothing and all the rest under th e aegis of the American Arm y. The displaced person was defined as a survivor  in this case particularly a Jewish surviv or  liberated in a concentration camp on German soil.
Dinnerwork  it was a labor camp ran by the Toad organization.
It was in the summer of 1943 and they unloaded us on the main road in the camp where we saw across the road British and Russian prisoners still finishing the barracks.
And they had those big cat  cassels that they put the food whe re they made the food  I dont know exactly but there were altogether in the camp close to a thousand peo ple  maybe more.
And let them explain away having established that they were there at the camp  at each one of these four camps  any one of them.
And then was released because he had pneumonia  so he wouldnt die in a concentration camp  so they could count him as having released him  rather than having him die there.
Uh .. they burned down the camp because they thought that all the barracks had been so polluted and so full of excrement and bl ood and whatever -- there was just no way to preserve it and they moved us into a nearby um .. what had been German army camp  in fact  when I went back to Bergen-Belsen -- it is again a German army camp.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 23 23 What did you  was that time  wh at was that time in the hospital like?
And they send him to a stricter camp camp  with a solitary  with common criminals.
Then the people everyday coming in from from work detail and the prisoners would bring other dead prisoners every single day into the camp.
Because  number one  I wasnt in a concentration camp  and thats the highest  particularly if you were in Auschwitz.
In the camp...in the same city  but this is the camp where they were going to work for the...uh...steel factory.
And it was  I dont know  a month later  when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came into camp  round us up  took us and put into only about 30 - 40 in a boxcar and took us to Stalag Luft III over over over on the Polish border.
Got her out the camp and she was with the Jewish scouts and then in another -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 85 How -- how old was she  about?
We also had a relegazerampt we called it  a religious office  and some of these houses were reserved for synagogues in the camp.
In the camp there were some books because the camp was started before the Germans got there.
Camp was built by this time that we came in  and we stay overnight and sometime before we came to the barracks -- I skipped something.
He said he cannot stay in this prison camp  he is a Jew  and he is a danger to this country.
And they uh the orders that to come the ghettos what the remaining the ghetto was already small.
So more emotions may be evoked from that than describing th at they went on a train  and they open up a -- a suitcase in the camp.
But  of course  it couldnt be for a very long time in this tent camp  and I think some time in -- probably in September or so  maybe it was later  I cant remember exactly any more  every -- these -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of Mann  where they had fenced off whole districts of the town and some [indecipherable] were conv erted into -- into internment camps.
54 Yes  we were protected  we didnt even know how much  when we mo ved out of the camp.
No  ten  and then the camp commandant came in and told us a big speech that we are no more Walter or Johnny or some other name we all are numbers and the number is very easy to be erased and if you gonna behave you may see the freedom.
Next time when you come  we going to keep you here two weeks without the food or we're going to send you to the concentration camp  so they they scar ed the people.
And it didnt take long  the next day in the morning we saw th ese two guys  these same guys came back to our 118 -- our camp  where we camped  and -- and they sai d  we told our boss and he was very upset  he heard what happened with -- he -- he know the Gorkinsens  he know this -- what they are  and he says from now on Ill -- hell be taking care of that.
When they e xpelled us from over there  they put us all - there was a market  like every small city in Europe  and even the larger cities had marketplaces  and they -- you know  chased us all through the marketplace  put us in rows and so on  and a -- did something the same what they did later on in concentration camp  like making a selection.
69 Arrival (German); term used for newly arrived concentration camp prisoners.
It was right after Auschwitz  I was in this camp  Bomlitz  maybe you find Mm-hm.
Living essentially in the enemy camp was a major problem initially.
In -- I came to the kibbutz  I think  in about -- taking the refugee camp into -- I think in May of ‚49  we finally came to the kibbutz.
He said ﬁYes  I need some people  carpenters  mechanics  all the people that could repair stuff that goes wrong in some of those mines where you dig the coal.ﬂ He said  ﬁWe have a big camp  a number of camps in that area and we are all working for that mine.
Uh we were there and we were...in the morning we had to go to work.
The city from where we were tooken to A uschwitz because I  before going to the ghetto  and we knew we were already with the yellow star on us and we  we knew that going to be a ghetto somehow  they going to take us down there because was they talking about that they were going to take us to wor k in a camp  in a farm  so on.
And he was a British officer by this time  Jewish fellow.
They said  you know  considering what the Germans did  burning us  the least we can expect the Germans to do is to supply things for us to burn to keep warm.
You have to have somebody what covers up for you in a camp  if not you couldn't live.
So the greenhorns have first to be  have  cannot stay wher e they want to stay  they must go to their destination  because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take care of them and the gove rnment will not take care of them  the Canadian government did not want to take care of them  they just wanted them out as much as possible  because Canada was not so friendly to the greenhorns  beca use I know about internment camp s in Canada  where people from England were sent to and stayed there for many years.
And then here again I was a girl  sent to the labor  you know the labor camp  and my mother was sent towards the gas chambers.
We were then told that the very next morning we were to appear at eight ocl ock someplace  and we woul d be put on a truck and taken to -- to a transient camp from which we woul d then go to Germany.
But we didnt know its next to Auschwitz  we didnt know where it is.
If you were not in it  you know  when German -- I believe that the German  as overall  didnt know what was going in camp  to the extent that it happened.
And there were about a few trucks  maybe a column of 10 or 12 pulling out of the camps  taking those youngsters in to a children's camp where there were only children supervised by trained teachers until they were taken to Israel at a little later time.
The only thing we thought  well  maybe she went to another camp  maybe the war will be over next week  and we will see her again.
Did in part you  did in part that feeling like I survived the camp  I mean the first thought that comes to my mind is  you survived World War 2  you survived the camps  you didn't want to get TB at that point.
Digging  the same kind of work  but not in the camp  outside the camp.
So when they shut up the six girls went to the oven  they took from camp another six girls.
Im thinking of people who visited who were interested  lets say  in raising money in the United States  and they came through and they saw the camp.
Okay  in this camp at Landsburg one day a rumor spread through the camp that a Jewish child had been kidnapped and killed by the Germans.
And he says they told me that you are coming over here for Erholung  for recuperation from another camp.
After we were liberated  we were put into a holding camp  which was a 1 Although the policy of the USHMM is never to edit or alter oral history interviews in any way  the interview with Fritzie Fritshall does contain a 5 second black out at the beginning of the interview.

In fact  in the concentration camp  he kept people alive  really alive  the lots of them went and touched the barbed wire to end  they couldn't stand it any longer  and he used to say  \ No  no  you'll see  like God sent Moses to get the children of Israel out of Egypt  of our bondage  you'll see that he will send somebody to free us  and in fact  to take us back to Aris Israel.\
This was from 1941 to 1943  2 years in that camp.
you know) Eisenhower did an excellent job to bring a film cr ew over from Hollywood to film the things in .... concentration camp.
This man in the perhaps 6 months that he was in our camp  aged 25 years.
And we reached Paklevy  which is a port in on the Iranian  or Persian side  and they set us in a camp on the beach  with the you know  they gave us the blanket  and there were sticks  four stic ks  and covered the blanket as a roof  and they put they gave us some anothe r blanket or so  to lie down on it and wait until we have to g to be de-liced  and disinfected to go to the next place.
And that was really the first I ever heard about Jews.
And looking back  you know  then you hated it  but in the camp  and in the prison -- It helped.
But that each camp really -- so I dont belong there  you dont belong there.
In this camp  one time  it was September 1944  when the underground organization in Budapest approached us  few of us  and asked us if we wanted to join the underground fighters.
And it's a very interesting compila tion  of course  of all of the whole situation of the camp  and then reconstruction  transport by transport  accord ing to the numbers of -- two million  more than two million people.
What was interesting is that these people who were running the camp -- it was an Alsatian Jew and two Rabbis who - because they are still alive I won't mention their names -- German Rabbis  who were in Gurs who are mentioned by name in  in -- as being very helpful while they were in Gurs -- in a book by Schramm 20 about her experiences in Gurs and but there was no help for us.
And by the way  for example like I mentioned  what my father get a permission order to stay  they didnt take us immediately to concentration camp.
She found  in -- in -- not she  he found  in a camp farther away from Balti  the family of one of her brother -- brothers  Yosl  with two of his children and his wife.
Two other people--uh Otto [Kussel] and uh Januszewzki--they were uh the \ Arbeitsdienst\ ; they had to uh send out all the columns out of the camp.
We close with this portrait of Aunt Giza  Dora  and Zdravko that was taken to be sent to Ljudevit in the concentration camp where he had been sent.
Because they hit me in the--in the concentration camp  they hit me on the head  and I was fainting a lot from that.
When we came into Buchenwald we didnt know where we are until we were told that we are in Buchenwald.
>> Jill Pauly: Once the war began  all German nationals in Kenya were put in a camp.
And th -- and this -- this came up in this film about Dachau for example  what people said  th-the residents said  well this was not -- this was not an extermination camp.
And it was a red sheet of paper with the concentration camp logo.
Our group in our train moved very slowly west  and we were deposited in a camp called Pruschov which was a major uh execution camp outside of Krackow.
It was dark  still  and at night  when we came home  was dark.
Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 120 It was the the British organized it  but the we were in that second camp  and one once when I was in th e hospital out of the hospital going out of the hospital  the doctors sent me to the thir d camp  which was in the mountains.
You have to do  so it wasn't much to eat but discipline and not much terror from th e SS inside the camp.
It was healed  he wasnt in the hospital at camp  he was h ealed.
He did never knew him  because they said in the ghetto al they taking all the young  unmarrie d  in the concentr not concentration camp  he didnt know either.
Well  how was your mother and Maria able to get from Austria all the way over to this camp?
And the doctor brought us the information only a bout those who he fou -- he found in the camp  we -- at that time we didnt know about those who fought in the army.
There was a man -- the oldest one in the camp  of the men's camp.
CE: We had still a quarter of mile we had to clear  to the woods  because from the entrance to the camp  til there was still about a quarter of a mile and it was raining  I think  or something.
And did you spend some time how big was the camp and what did you see there and what did you piece together from seeing what was at the camp?
I was an atheis t when I came out of the camp.
And so Colonel Clark   he was a colonel major he was General Clark at Colorado Springs there  the air air academy there later on  but he was a colonel in our camp there at south compound.
Apparently  somebody betrayed them and they were publicly hanged in the camp  12 of them.
We didn't live together in the same barracks  but we lived in the same camp and the same camp you could go and visit them.
I mean  we ne-you will never believe that  but we never heard of Auschwitz  we never heard of any  any  any  any camp or gas chamber or cremator--we never heard of that.
She was taking to the concentration camp  and she was k-killed at that -- Do you know which one she was at?
And then they also divided the camp though they didnt put electric wires was just a fence with two gates and they made women.
We went and moved into the forest  dug in there; we made a tent  improvised from some trees.
And they didn't incinerate any of the clothing the clothing because  uh  it was bad enough burning up the bodies that they burned  and  uh  the German people were were  knew there was a camp.
Im sure that he couldnt obtain a single loaf if bread in Dachau for the camp was already at the point of disintegration at that time  or about t o be overrun by the U.S. Army.
I know the sun was shining high and the train station was right outside of the camp and they lo ading us in open boxcars  listen to that.
Started to go out  and they took all of us to the place where we were waiting for the train to Auschwitz.
I helped a French marquis  manage to get a contact to keep some Red Russians and to give them to another camp.
Yes  the only one that I encountered on the way through the in the campaign was Nordhausen  concentration camp Nordhausen   which we came upon not knowing where we that there was a concentration until we til we ran into it.
Shortly thereafter  I was ordered to Camp Poke  Louisiana  to a new division  the 11th Armored Division.
And I had a cousin who came back from concentration camp  too.
And what they decided to have a kind of a mutiny  kill their guards  but then turn the camp over to us.
If God forbid if history will re peat  if its gonna be another concentration camp  die in your house with your childrens  with your family.
And that when he was liberated by the Russians in his concentration camp  he was looking for me.
I didnt know when they took me fath they said work camp.
And as a matter of fact  he liked this fellow from concentration camp  this was a green triangle  said that they are they hate Jews and Hitler.
And people who wore their congressional medal honor which I called their concentration camp star  as a congressional me dal of honor.
And I went out to see the old camp once when I was in Hamburg.
But in general you worked from 6-6 but you got soup  proper soup at night and a slice of bread  and because the camp became smaller  it was bad enough.
There were an couple of -- of Norwegian prisoners in the camp  males.
I mean they didnt have to but they shared their rations with me.
In other words  other members -- parts of our Division were at Mauthausen taking care of the sick  burying th e dead  and because -- there's talk finding the camp  it was a surprise to the Division.
This I only find out later  but anyway  the camp was full of all kinds of nationalities  there were at that time when we arrived there  maybe 5500  there 44 were Russian POW's  Soviet Red Army POW's  there were Polish civilians  Russian civilians  there were Frenchmen.
In the DP camp  in this one and in any other camps also  but after the war  did you notice a different moral standard among the survivors after Yes.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 6 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AR: As I remember it  my mother  father  and myself plus two or more people got one room only and we had to make bunks in order to accommodate everybody.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044 21 We -- We met them while we were in Auschwitz standing in line  we were supposed to be forming lines of five  and we were sort of paired off with them  and from then on we kept on being together  until -- until we were going to the same camp  and by accident being put in the same barrack.
Yes  the experience getting into the first camp  the Gross-Rosen camp -- Thats not what Im asking  Im asking -- what Im -- Im saying is that -- you said the camps were almost easy after being in the underground  that the underground was so dangerous and hard.
After the two weeks were off  they took us...uh...to the regular camp what they had  for work.
You may search the historical records of those days  especially after the liberation  and you will find  do not find one case in which a liberated former concentration camp inmate had taken revenge against  uh  an SS guard  personally.
We sat with -- in -- in those barracks  then next day or next two days they took my roo -- my mother took out trees in that c -- c -- in that camp Volk camp in Orab.
At that point  we  we wrote to him  asking whether he knew that  who that Norwegian might be who helped me in the camp.
But in DP camp  people were coming and going so I didn't have close friends.
The first day  we were carrying so many dead people where they would mostly die from beatings and so on and when I got back into the prison camp  I ne...I was...I was going to school.
02:36:53 The only thing that was built was the Gypsy camp.
It was a Jewish camp called Wijk aan Zee   not too far from -- from Amsterdam and I was surrounded by very  very rowdy Je wish kids who had all been in hiding and who all had  in retrospect  tremendous difficulties  you know  they were very Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 42difficult to control.
Yeah  there was -- there wasnt a barracks yet  and it was like a -- like a -- like herrings  one on top  next to each other  th-the bunks  like  you know?
I dont believe it is related to the ho -- if anything  I was exposed during -- particularly during my camp experience  my early on -- as you recall  I was a volunteer internee social worker in one of the camps.
There she is in the store  and he-her cousins  she got two cousins what they was they wa they wasnt in camp  they was hiding out  you know?
I uh  there was uh  a rumor in that camp that we need some  so many men  and uh in another camp for work.
And there used to be a big camp from from Jews they call Pocking .
What was your sense of what was going on within the people in the camp?
Every month we went to a summer camp  which actually my brother was entitled to go for two months  but he gave one month to me.
But  one day  as we were standing  you could stand there for hours regardless of the weather  hours and hours until it didn't jive all the numbers in the camp.
T-i-n-f-i fin f-a So we we ended up in the same camp  which la to like one week or so  they moved somewhere else  and we dont know what happened to them.
Yeah  the Frenchman was - that was in the last camp.
The three of them looked and they found the names of me  that I was in a camp in Germany  a DP camp.
If I  within weeks they took us to a ghetto  within weeks and they put us into the ghetto.
I just said I didnt know where they are  what wa -- I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 17 know  because it happened in -- in my camp  in -- in -- yeah.
So after that you stayed in southern Germany and when did you ship out?
Then we were taken into barracks  into what was then Auschwitz -Birkenau.
Because Bergen-Belsen  yes  but either Dachau or one of the female camp  Ravensbruck -- I read up on all these concentration camp because of my diary preoccupation in the dissertation.
The sanitation of the camp was terrible back in the camps themselves  and that might not have been just at the very end stages.
When we were shipped to that death camp  like I told you before  we did not know when the end was going to come.
For example  one of the betrayers in the camp was found drow ned in the latrine upside-down.
Women were better when they came in concentration camp by theirselves.
So Lublin became a very viable place  and -- and since in particular this was a time when people came back from every camp  from every corner  you know  and they were looking to find out whether someone is alive or not.
Here we have a map of the major camps for Jewish D.P.'s   or displaced persons  with the arrow pointing to the Foehrenwald Displaced Persons Camp .
Because ha -- Elsinores Sewing Club is one  and -- but the Friends of the Sound was founded by t -- Mr. Thompson  he was an innkeeper and he died in concentration camp.
You were not going so well  some were out of the lines  and for that you have to march for an hour and an hour a half on the yard where the -- where the camp was for punishment.
Eventually  in 1945  Morris was liberated from the Theresienstadt camp in occupied Czechoslovakia by the Soviet A rmy.
Eventually my mother ended up at a -- a camp at the German-Danish border  and thats where she eventually was -- was liberated.
When you say that it was suggested that you make a connection to a certain group  what -- what were your leaders in the British training camp?
And they let us out of the trucks and said find yourself back to Camp Ritchie within the next three hours.
After coming back from all those years in the concentration camp  they were kille d by the Armia Krajowa.
I was asked to come to Germany to testify against two Nazi  former Nazi  guards.
And he was wa -- allowed somehow to come to Montpellier [indecipherable] camp and he went to our house even  but he had to go back to the camp.
Except that now  having been shifted so many times  you know  from the ghetto to a camp  to another camp  to another holding place  you know  this was just another place  you know.
Certain notation about the -- about our profession technically was for the special people who were looking for this  but this was not for the authorities of the -- of the camp.
Bestley and his wife  and of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 28course they had a family already  they have kids and they lived in Beverlywood  and oh  he had a big job with Mashas teet h  you know  Masha had a big problem  you know  after the concentration camp  and -- but as I say  we became very good friends  we went to movies together and everything .
In other words  I wasn't taken immediately to Germany  but to this transit camp which was still in our ghetto.
Interview with Norman Coulson October 4  2013 33 If well  if someone tried to escape somewhere I dont know how they ever get out  I dont think the I think there wa s a big wall around the whole round the whole camp  so cause the people in Dachau   which was only about a half a mile away Yeah.
BDM means   the association of German girls  so you had the male and the female version  but that was like going to camp  that was like having fun  that was like not having to go to church  so that was a pleasant thing.
When he saw us coming out from that house  he knew we are coming back to the camp.
In order to summarize what you just asked me: What is the difference between a life in a camp  the freedom  or how did it shape your personality between the two of this?
Were in the summer of 1945 when there is still a very chaotic situation in the camp everybodys thrown together and they havent been and the ones who could go home havent yet really gone . . .
I-I immediately walked out of one section of-of the camp where  into another  and I got a hold of some of the um  the survivors that were walking around and I said  we got to start listing the names of uh who has survived  and we-we established a formula  we would get the name  date and place of birth  and the fact that they are presently... [CAMERA RELOAD] [CR#2] SWB: Can you tell me about religious ceremonies for the survivors early on  do you remember any instances where people prayed.... RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: I uh  wasn't uh  aware of uh a religious uh factor playing a role in the sense of ritual or things of that sort uh.
I belonged to -- cant remember the name of it  but it was sort of a farm organization  I went to a camp  Jewish camp.
Incidentally  when I visited that camp in 1989 at the kacerne  the kacerne commander complained to me how crowded he was.
But when I was in camp there  I did not really I was not such a great electrician to be able to get a job any other place  you know.
I happened to be in the sanitarium when he visited the camp.
We lived  the place where we worked and there was Lager Three  or Camp Three  where the people went to the gas chambers and there  there were in the beginning was as burying and later–. Is that the right word?
So we thought theyre building perhaps for the Germans in camp.
56 So you could -- people could come and go fr om the camp  you werent concentrated there?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 22 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: brought there families in there and some families got there earlier than others and so on.
And that was outside the ghetto  or inside That was part of ghetto then  yeah.
And sometimes the hillsides would be covered with bodies of the Americans  or a hillside would be covered with the bodies of the Germans  and then later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in  concentration camp inmates or  uh  slaves on farms  they would  uh  march them ahead of 3 them trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these people apparently.
When you were in that camp near Munich  far -- Fernwald  Fernwald.
Uh  somebody who spoke German told the German man there that we are from a neighboring  uh  concentration camp and we were left on our own  and we were very hungry.
They raided camp and we had to leave to the other side.
As I think it's probable evident  there's -- not only has Rae had to skip over an awful lot of what she went through  there is a great more to be told about what happened in the immediate aftermath of the war  their attempts to get to Israel  ending up in a displaced persons camp in southern Italy  and eventually making it to the United States and beginning a new life.
This was a labor camp  it is a concentration camp  but not a death camp.
When the  at that time I was the   that meant chief of the camp a nd a doctor at the same time of th e camp.
I have no idea because when they threw us out  we went to another camp.
No  no  no  we in Ebensee Ebensee was the last camp that we didnt figure were gonna survive.
And she was in a camp by the name of Annaberg .
I know that my father was put in a camp much earlier  I dont remember the name.
For instance  in the labor camp  we had a German doctor who was a political refugee.
Now  I cant quite tell you where we were goi ng  but this is inside the DP camp  because you see the barrack in the back.
He [the barber] was transferred from the execution chamber of uh...to our camp.
Can you describe a little more before you go on to the interrogation  uh in addition to the people walking around  can you take us through the camp as you saw it?
Five more months in the camp  and died more and more and more in these five months.
At night they had to take us back  they brought another shift and they had to take us back to the camp there.
Feldafing was a displaced persons camp near Munich where the people that were liberated from Dachau were taken from Dachau  put there in the hospitals.
Of course there wasn't much I could do there with uh my Master's in Russian studies  so I figured if you can't fight them you join them and I decided to go back to school and I got a Ph.D. in  with a focus on child development/family relationship and I have - we've been there for the last 21 years uh and I teach at the University part-time and and I do some counseling part-time and it's amazing because my whole focus on family relationships/child development has made me so aware of the horrendous impact of the war years and all the things that ideally should have happened after the war that didn't happen  how much pain could have been prevented if people had been more aware of the horrendous impact of - even the  let me compare...our experiences are nothing compared to concentration camp experiences.
We never  I never heard Yiddish in my life until I went to the camp.
What happened in this camp in Treblinka  there were at least 900 or a thousand prisoners which were...didn't have more than that.
Youre in this ye for how youre in this camp for how long in total?
And...uh...the...uh...soldier took us back to the...uh...to the...uh...lieutenant there and...uh...he started to interrogate us  and we gave him all the information what we knew and...uh...he directed the unit to...uh...to take that camp  which...uh...after the report  it was abandoned already.
And when the Germans put us -- th -- told us we have to leave the camp  we knew that we had to -- we were going on a march.
So while you were in the transit camp outside Pozna Yes.
Tho -- this is just a casual snapshot  sitting on the lawn at the camp in one of those Adirondack chairs.
He organized a ca mp  a labor camp in Kollupzowa  and he brought back hundred young Jews and me he established in our house of prayers or synagogue.
And we came to this little camp in Colmar wh ich was a small camp  also prisoners.
Oh  by the way  I became a citi zen down in -- in -- forgot about that  in -- Camp Hood? --
It seems like we are the first ones to open up the camp and while we were standing over there waiting something to happen  something happened to me.
One time when  I dont know what happened but  I dont know where the Germans were  but there was quite a lot of them went berserk  tried to climb the wire  and the Germans just shot them down  that was up the other end of the camp  about half a mile away I suppose. [
Yes  in the -- in -- in the quarantine camp we were guarded by -- by Swiss troops.
And we had a staff  we had to find people among the Jews to staff the camp.
shakes head no) Were they allowed out of the camp at all? (
We were put in a camp  which was not a concentration camp  its named Atlit.
These soldiers that were on the other side of the camp had been the prisoners of war  and they were now being repatriated to Italy.
I went back to camp at -- yeah  and I went back to school.
Uh most of us were of course because of our linguistic skills  having had college background and the like and uh so I graduated from the eighth class of Military Intelligence Training Camp - it's not too far here from Washington.
After the bomb was dropped  I still had to report to Camp Roberts not Camp Rob  one of the camps in California.
In Sweden  the camp that we were assigned to  my mother knew a man who really liked her and he said  oh I know a dentist  we need a dentist here and there were 200 Jews and 400 Poles in the camp.
When we came  we have to start to build the camp  because was just the electric wiring all around half.
Q. How long were you in this DP 28 camp in northern Italy?
I was loaded up on a truck and we went to the city of Lodz and my parents were taken away to that city of Helno  that was an extermination camp.
As a matter of fact  at night they would drop flares around the camp  in order not to bomb it.
End of Tape Two  Side A Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 35 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 36
And how did you take care of that  when you were in the ghetto?
And so we put tents up  and we knew how to run a hospital under tents because that's what we'd been doing.
02:07:30 There was Foehrenwald itself  which had been a work camp for German labor.
I very quickly found Polish DPs  Polish false laborers  and -- who came because they heard the camp was there  and w -- had been established -- or was being established.
And when you work with the concentration camp literature  you get into situations.
So we were relieved of the luggage  and marched to the camp.
The only thing you could not do is leave Theresienstadt  the camp because we had Typhoid.
And so the last day -- last night when we were in the camp she said that it was first night of Pesach.
He then managed  when my sister got a pass of one day  after the de Lattre de Tassigny visit--the camp commande r was a little shook up by the criticism he had so he gave her and al so this other girl  Miss Levine  I think was her name--they got a pass and my cousin somehow must have known that there was a gentleman in the Montpellier prefecture by th e name of Ernst I think was his name  he was a Alsatian  who was one of the early resistance people.
It was  for a DP camp it was a pretty good life what we went through.
We were separated because of choice and that I had to accomplish this and not totally live in a displaced camp where I could not ac hieve that education as I did.
I step back and it was the girl who was my supervisorŠ she was from Pr agueŠin camp Tape 21 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 44 and she said to me  I saw Willy at the ?
They had the same factories that they had in the previous camp.
But later on  there was --the camp was getting a little bit disorganized.
You  you  you knew...you didn't know whether they stayed with the parents  maybe in a work camp  maybe...there were work camps  even in Holland you didn't know about.
We want you to come and take the...the Germans prisoner.ﬂ And they came down to meet us; so they took us right to the camp.
And we have the cemetery at the end of the camp  was -- the camp was maybe a mile long.
And we went there to concentration camp  Flossenburg and there was so nice sign ﬁArbeit Macht Freiﬂ mean during the work you can be free.
They liked to staff the camp with the doctor  a dentist.
It was easy  it was like another camp except that it was so called free camp  but it was also very limited.
And then we had a -- we had a very  very impressive concert in the new camp.
If you have to say to someone who doesnt know anything  what is the camp office supposed to be doing?
And then when the truck was full  we were driven to the concentration camp.
My parents  due to my volunteer work  survived the concentration camp.
Th ere was not a highly or ganized and orderly procedure because you had the terrible pressure of the fact that whil e we were evacuating the camp I think another 15 000 died.
And I went to the that barracks  which was the windows--that was the only wome n barrack in the men camp.
In the labor camp  I have -- I happened to have a mechanical mind.
We went through the whole camp together  we helped each other and we remained the closest of friends until now.
Maybe the person was a trouble maker in the camp or something like that.
They were put on trains and shipped not east  but to France  to the Gurs concentration camp  in the Pyrenees   in France .
And because my mothers English was not very good  the first time  I actually got sent to an all Catholic camp.
And he was a good looker--a tall  broad T P12PT Camp B3 was part of the Birkenau complex.
My my father  you know  worked and I I do remember  I think that that he took us on one of the he had to visit the camp where he was trai ning th-the kids  and and we did go with him to to visit that.
And brad  eh  eh  prior to our occupation  bread was the most the precious article of food that they had in the camp or ever had or ever will.
The labor camp experience he had throughout all of the 2 1/2  3 years was in Hungary itself.
In Germany there was other -- other problem to go to Palestine because you couldnt go officially  you had to go illegally  and you wind out in Cyprus in a camp and my wife didnt wa nt to go to a camp  so we came to America.
So we were liberated in the spring of 1945 by the Russians.
SWB: Do you remember ever having an election in the camp?
106*0143 50 get out of a concentration camp a nd also received this I.D. But as far as people that were living in hiding  at that time no  I ha did not meet anyone.
We decided to attack about dawn  while it was still dark  about maybe at the hours between 5 and 6 in the morning.
Like the time when I was alone going to Strzelnica camp.
And I  therefore  did not want to hear about family camp at all.
They were supposed to send her away to a concentration camp at that time.
The guys already in the camp  but I happened to be very good friends with one of the -- it was one of the older police inspectors in his -- must have been 40s or some like that.
Yes  in the in the beginning when we arrived there was uh check  camp course??
So and all of a sudden we  we heard  we heard the gate  by the gate  some noise and then they broke open our.... We  were locked  our...our camp was locked from outside with a.... They broke the  the lock  and there were Russian partisans.
And I remember when we heard over the radio that they liberated a camp not too far from Regensburg.
I got off the truck before truck g- entered the camp  waited until the unit was gone  and then I walked back into Dachau and said here I am.
And then for me  fortunately actually  that camp was dissolved for some reason and people were distributed partly to other camps and partly to a work camp in a suburb of Berlin and that's where I was put and that was in a southern suburb of Berlin and we were just a small group of boys  there wasn't more than 10  detailed to work in a forest which was managed by a forestry official to cut down certain trees th at were diseased.
I didnt know what happened to her because they didnt bring her to camp  but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records.
And he had any name but of the commander of the camp and of Sharfuhrer fr -- Wagner.
And do you see a in regarding concentration camp   probably you know how it looks  food  what we ate.
What were people talking about when they werent working at the camp [indecipherable] Well  they were -- they were worrying about their relatives -- friends and relatives back in Poland.
I seen him once more because in the...in the labor camps...so-called labor camps  because and that's the exact translation  is labor and tava is a camp  so it was a labor camp  where they did...I don't know what work.
Anyway  this time passed t oo and a lot of illnesses broke out already in this camp and I remember that I got jaundice and I was very sick.
And they -- he pulled me out and took me beyond the wires  you know  and pushed me in -- into a ca b -- small cabin where they ke -- had wood for fire and coal and so on.
We saw on the on the road adjacent to our camp  we saw already all these trucks  the German military trucks and tanks and so passing by  but in the direction towards the west  so they were fl eeing.
To give you an example of the kind of work he did  when a Polish young man whom I helped to become a director opened up a small camp in the middle of the forest where they took over the barracks where Hitler trained some of his toughest men for murder  a small camp was opened.
Interview with Hannah Kalman May 20  1999 37 In this camp did you witness any beatings or executions?
Neither could I speak Hebrew  but I speak no and finally I start...I got freed because immediately they told me you can go wherever you can find your wife  so I went in a camp.
They didn't say exactly where in a certain camp and then when we went down there we got a white band so that distinguished you from a full Jew  from a hundred percent Jew...the white band.
Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one - from the main e -- from the camp office  for ex ample  to an barrack  and convey an message or ask the blockelteste to come to the camp offi ce  or some similar orders were given from headquarters  from the t-top management to us  and we had to execute that through the runners  yeah.
The girls that lived in the apartment  we were then in the DP camp.
Then there were rumored that maybe they will allow us  they will make a camp on the Asian side of the Turkey and allow us to stay there  until somehow it will be resolved what to do with us.
Slept on the floor  and then they marched us in the -- the railroad was right next to it  not too far  and they put us into the -- into our train  into wagon  like a cattle cars.
Until the -- the -- what  the Americans came from one side -- right now the Americans only came fro m one side and they closed the camp and we had to march for at least five  six days.
Those are 23 the shoes from the people that perished  your people in this camp.\
And then I was transferred from that institution  that jail  in a camp to Germany.
Because  when she would go out to work  they would have right right away to take her to work camp.
A nd I was with her the en tire time  from the day we were  our heads were shaved until the day we left  I mean  un til I left Bergen-Belsen  the camp  with my cousin.
We came through the forest and we arrived at the real camp  Treblinka.
The only mail that we re ceived was  went into the main office  the headquarters of the camp and then once a day we would go there and if anybody got mail  they would read it out  you know.
You know  this is worse probably than the labor -- than the labor in the camp.
So  I couldnt get married  because he was al ready in labor camp  too  from 1941 on.
But then later but his mother was in German concentration camp.
When Professor Karski come and speak to the Roosevelt and tell him  Mr. President  in Warsaw  in Poland  the Jewish people are -- they are killed by Germans  they sent to the concentration camp.
They were taken to concentration camp fr om Lvov  they went to Lvov.
After a while  they had nobody there  and I found out the same friend we were 32 with in one concentration camp  he lives in Fohrenwald  so I went there.
>> Susan Snyder: So what happened to you and your mother then?
And anyway  they had to be kept in a transit camp before being shipped out because the cattle cars and freight cars that were used for deporting Jews  such a train was holding upward of six  seven hundred people  even up to a thousand and eleven hundred.
They sa id they gonna take us to a camp  but didnt say where.
To my utter consternation  I found there were American soldiers on guard at the entrance  the purpose to keep people in the camp from going out.
This was the women's camp  and again every morning they would open up the gates to get the women out into the fields  out in the working fields  and we three children were taken to a big shed which had a lot of carriages or not carriages but carts really  farming carts and such and we three girls were told to stay there and not to move from there the whole day until the women came back into the camp  and we did usually.
They will kill you if you don't come when the group goes back to camp.
The camp was situated on a  on a mountainside and our work was to carry these big wooden planks up on the steep mountain  that we we stood like three girls or five girls on there  one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the mountains.
My education started after concentration camp  I did not  at five years I was too young to have any of it  and it was during that period of time.
To get the water we ha d to go outside the camp. [
So  I was Krysia and Hania and Renia  and there must have been maybe twenty men and women working in the field  and this man from Kielce he was in charge of the working 87 group  and he says  ﬁOh  did you come from camp ?
There was Auschwitz I which was...which was the Auschwitz work camp which was a horrible camp.
So did Winnie then come a nd live with you in Camp Richie?
When you followed the games fr om the camp in Maine  did your campers follow them with you and did they know that you were in this world class– Yeah  they knew I was.
They brought me back in this...in this uh Jewish camp; and they said  \ Don't give her this room again.
So  Julius w ould come to with Wollheim  pick me up  take me to to the DP camp wher e I met Yosele for the first time  Yosele Rosensaft  Manachems father  for the firs t time.
So what they did is they housed us in tents  in regular tents  as you see here.
Because it was so near Ausch -- near the camp that you couldnt possibly have strangers.
We were not supposed to get out of the camp unless we had a work permit or whatever.
They were soon sent to a labor camp in Siberia  then to a town called Syktyvkar in the Autonomous R egion of Komi.
In the Shellneetsa camp  there was a little brook running through  so people would go and wash themselves  even in the winter.
And I already lived in this camp  and -- but they couldnt esta blish themself to -- to the point where they were useful to do anything  they didnt do anything  they were just in a camp  living there.
There was a DP  displaced person camp  and I remember the UNRRA  run by UNRRA Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 68503  I remember the number  I still got a picture of it  too.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 23 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: full concentration.
Now when we saw that the time passed and nothing had happened  we informed camp 1  if they will not do something  we will not wait any longer and start a breakout ourselves.
What underlined  which is of importance  and among othe rs  end result of my  of the beginning of my career was that any trait  professi on or activity  which had to be perf ormed  like repair of the roof  laying of the floor  of the wooden floor  repairing of any insi de work to be done  erecting some walls up between  between the  in the barracks to  to  to have some partiti ons erected actually  to have an room  you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities  so the camp office was erected by putting wall and  and  and dividing that into a certain size.
They all were marched to the small town  next town and taken to concentration camp.
And the camp commander did not  uh  destroyed any records; so the political prisoners took care to sort them out  that only political or religious  uh  persecuted prisoners would go free.
Uh  elderly  well  there was one camp in  in  in Czechoslovakia called Theresienstadt or Terezin  where uh elderly people uh  uh found their place  and also  uh people who had uh  uh received the decoration as veterans of WWI.
In the be -- in -- before you had the camp office  before it beca -- becomes more ordered.
So youre in this boxcar  and ther es a gentleman there from your camp  who sees you and says come on in  and he helps you.
And every once in a while  we had to raid the camp  when we knew that there were stills  and people told us  because  actually  it was it had become poisonous  a lot of the vodka that they made.
Auschwitz had a subcamp  a labor camp  where they made ammunition.
Under my cross examination he admitted  I wish I could think of his name right now  he admitted that he considered himself to be the father of the German concentration camp and the Gestapo.
Was there a place for all the refugees to live or did you stay with families?
At home my mother was scared and concerned to death and said  ﬁWhat will happen to Tata?ﬂ And what they believed  they are still very naive  is that they are rounding up the Jews to send them to labor camp as labor.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: What did you do for entertainment at the displaced persons camp?
I only remember when we were liberated by the Russians  some of th e Polish girls in the labor camp took her and shaved her hair  and gave her over to the Russians.
They th-they they they they I dont think it was any inside of the camp whenever we were there.
But luckily for us  I think its sixth or seventh or the Third Army  U.S. Army came in three days before the camp management and [indecipherable] us to come.
In 1942 in the summer  she again arranged for me to go to a summer camp during school vacation and this time I was 17 sent to a small town about thirty miles from Auch  a town called Condon and there was a chateau and there were about thirty some odd kids there at summer camp.
>> Bill Benson: Just Faige and you left in the camp.
So this y -- young lady from the OC came around and asked whether she would let me go to that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 16 village  that there was a minister there by the name of Trocme and they wanted to take some young people out of the camp.
They put us...they take us from the wagon  and they set us in lane on that camp.
But that was the feeling I had because they didn't -- even when I walked through the camp  they didn't even bother to look up to see who was coming.
And definitely Germans treated well  sometimes we  if they couldnt count correct nobody run away fro m the camp  I dont think so.
And so they came back and they hadn't gone through the rest of it and they were much better off financially because the father hadn't been in concentration camp and they didn't have to take in the entire family  they just took in my mother's friend's mother and so  they moved to a very nice place with hot water and a bathtub and I was extremely jealous.
They were digging ditches  they were going to blow up the camp.
You know here eh in DP camp were the people who were gathered eh eh eh from the farms from the German farms brought you know those who were forced laborers.
And I received the best training that anybody could ever have  in this camp.
RJ] Yes  yes  they took us into a camp called E711.
And we would bring it to our families  to our friends  those of us who had sisters and brothers in the camp or mothers in the women's camp.
And also some of the people and and in in the job  they were afraid that something is wrong with me because I went to a camp  or maybe I did some kind of a criminal activities I did  why di they put me in a camp  because they couldnt understand why I was  you know  in prison for something like this.
A nd...uh...what I like to point out here  again how rumor spread in...in such way that it's unima ginable  you know  that we...we had news from people that my father is still alive in...he is in a Polish zone  you know  that...uh...well  he's...uh...in that camp that I was...I was first in and I left it.
So he was called to the camp director and the camp director said  ﬁMr.
But in one of the letters to my mother and then she sent it to my father she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse that she's taking care of the little injuries  etc.
We were housed there and worked there so it was no big deal walking out of the concentration camp through a gate and walking into the factory which was totally adjoining.
But within 24 hours  rumors spre ad as a wildfire  that someone escaped from this transport and that Treblinka is really an extermination camp.
You mentioned you were involved in the camp -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 34 Yes. --
And there is underground in the camp who is going to raise from the inside so that we will revolt when the Russians come.
To my knowledge  after I was liberated  I tried to research  I could not find any other transport which came directly to the central  to the center of the camp.
Well  it wasnt a moment  but the things I got involved with  things I was doing  I wasnt necessary seeking out Jews from concentration camp or Jews period.
We arrived at this small camp in a village called Niederorschel.
A. The longest camp I should say I was in Bu chenwald  but I was lucky in Buchenwald.
They made schools there -- >> Bill Benson: In the displaced persons camp.
America was always the land of opportunit y. A lot of the Jewish  the survivors  the Holocaust  the concentration camp survivors  I think  went to Israel and certainly after the war  the children whose parents had been killed and  in Holland  if  if they had fled to Holland from eastern European countries to escape Nazism  and  and if those parents were killed  the children were put in hiding  those children were all sent to Israel.
We just  in the morning we get our soup  or whatever it was  and then we stayed in the open  and we made a big circle  one next to the other and moving around like this just to keep us warm  and we didn't do any wo rk  until after that week they put us in a row and said you and you and you  you can come  and uh  they were left for the other camp.
Its a mouthful: Haupstunshaufuhrer   and he had - there was a barrack  the German barrack where they worked  and it was this Haupstunshaufuhrer and then they were kapos  women  and then they were guards in the camp.
My father was dead in December  my brother survived him and my brot her died in March  three weeks before they could liberate his camp.
What I have learned about America even in the displaced person camp; the country of freedom  the songs of freedom  where no slavery and no this and no that.
So we were rely we had to rely on what was in the camp.
And  I don't know  I had a feeling when I was in camp with him that he was a big statue  big  heavy-built man.
This I find out  you know  when they took people from one camp to the other  you know.
But she was the first one who told me that this camp would be destroyed.
It was the most important function  the most important function of the whole camp  and it is just too bad that Laura Shelley did not understood what she did with the secretaries of that.
It was no  it was  I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time  but it wasn't so much the kosher because in the concentrat ion camp I ate not kosher  so  but it was that I felt I need to be with Jewish people.
It was a concentration camp and this was supposed to be a work camp.
Only from what my mother said that the Red Cross came in  and they spruced up the camp.
Q. When you were hiding for those few years before you went to the camp  were there certain aspects of that that you felt were really demanding on a teenage girl?
They decided they would put the 900 inmates on a train bound for Germany whether they were going to use them as slave labor in a factory or they were going to send them to a death camp  I have no idea.
He says  ﬁI want that camp disbanded  I don't want it in my province.ﬂ Instead of liberating the pe ople  he just sent them to Rivesaltes.
And in England we got new equipment and new things at a new camp.
There was no such thing as a summer camp for children or anything.
And that's why very quickly two months after the camp we were rushed off to England.
And you found him in the concen -- th-the soldier was in th e concentration camp?
Do you think that you got any implicit help from non-Jews at the camp  I mean  that maybe they looked the other way  or -- That's what we were waiting for.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 105 SL: I smoked from 1945 -- the American soldie rs gave me when they came in the concentration camp  til 1970 -- ‚78  okay?
And we kept going from from one office to another  where was the camp  etcetera  an-and and I nobody knew  you know.
The main thing was i-if -- when you made acquaintance with another survivor  the main questions was -- were  which camp did you go to?
One day they counted and counted  counted 400 women  took us from the camp  put us on the train and sent us to a place called Sophienwalde.
I had my  in Yiddish [indecipherable] letter from my uncle  telling me that my other uncle  you know  that I left  and he was in the concentration camp in Buchenwald was liberated.
Now  so they were set certain standards for the concentration camp population  a nd we have information of the caloric intake  and the caloric standards  or supplies for the civilian population  and for the working population in the -- and in the working -- in the camp population.
It wasn't saying  hey  let s walk to this transit camp.
And the other was the Leipheim  where I was regi stered in the DP camp from '45 from '45  I registered  and till '47  till I came to this country.
They came together in the same camp that I was  they brought them there.
But  was the same in in in in a prisoner of war camp later.
You had to wear a yellow star with the word \ Jew\  sewn onto your clothing  and the law says if you hide that thing or if you go without it you will be severely punished by going to a concentration camp.
The first trip to Israel they said they don't know of such a camp.
But later  my friend  Otto Kraus   who also ...who came with this tran sport to another camp and survived  so we were returned to Auschwitz  to Birkenau.
He could walk around the camp a little bit more than anybody else because he was there for a long time.
As soon as we went back to camp  I was called to to go and went and unload coal and that was the only time.
And he went through interim camp in Slovakia to Auschwitz and he survived Auschwitz.
and another sister-in-law of my mother in Brussels  whose husband got incarcerated and died in one of the con in Dachau no ca not in Dachau   in buch in forgotten which camp it was now.
Many of them knew that that meant ultimately being sent to a camp in Poland  which did not have a very good reputation  even then.
And she had also -- it wa s terrible  because she had this baby and she knew she couldn't bring him in  in the camp  so she found a Polish woman who took care of the baby.
And we were there for three years  and even though we had family here in the States  it was Im sure  you know  it took forever to get the papers  and What was life like in the DP camp?
And I know  for example  my father  you know ma I-I didnt say when  my father it happened when my fa ther they took to concentration camp from Nova Nestu like I told you  it was in October  and I met some guy from our city  who went with the same transport from Sered to Auschwitz with him  but he was a tall guy  he was much younger  he survived.
And Marta was working very hard to try to get me to go on one of these transport -- not transport  you know  this outing to the men's camp  with an excu se that I need to go to the hospital.
They tried to teach us French And who in the hope of we we make it out of the camp one of these da one days some days.
Margit found out that her mother was at the Gurs detention camp in Southern France  which is shown here in this photograph.
I wrote to his family after the war and his sister answered and she said  ﬁWell  my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because he argued with her  so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp.
And in this instance  the prisoner escaped and the camp commandant - not the camp commandant - the camp  what is the different?
And  then when the uh  uh  the  the  the surrounding areas uh were uh uh getting evacuated  the factories were empty  he took a fe w men with him  in a truck and they went (clears throat) to a neighboring town  and got some fabr ics from an empty factory  which he put in our warehouse  in our camp  and told the men who were in charge of the warehouse when the war is over  remember to distribute these fabrics evenly so the people will have something to start their lives with.
Oh  in every city  in the was the centers from Jews who came from the concentration camp  from Russia  from from partisans  th everybody wants to go to Israel.
The first prisoners were marched into saxen -- in -into Sachsenhausen concentration camp  only a stone throw away.
When you were at Camp Ritchie  did they talk about what was happening in Europe in the war  militarily and Hitler and so forth?
A cousin of mine with the same name sneaked in in the camp in Grudack.
The world was ove r  but in the square in Verea  I saw some men and women in concentration camp uniform s. Clearly!
And th -- after he heard my name  he told me that he had been with my father in a concentration camp in Lublin  and he knew my father very well and he confirmed the story  my father had to ld him the story which I heard from this former neighbor of ours.
that mother and father were there Yeah  but we never we were never actually  when we got to Beth Bialik   was the name of the d displaced persons camp.
You know  it was a privileged camp so to speak  this was the Red Cross camp  this is what they would show  this camp.
As I told you  with this un...when this wa s the evacuation  the liquidation of the Czech family camp  yes.
The non-Hungarian Hungaria n non-Jews were thrown into a camp  and we were there for three weeks.
Wh -- I mean  what did -- what -- what do you imagine when [indecipherable] The UNRRA -- once we got into the UNRRA camps  you know  it was -- I mean  I got in my -- my first camp was in -- in -- in a place called V ilshofen  which is a little village.
But then once my late mother and I got together  and we had been arrested  and we were taken to a place called Malines  which was a camp.
Then there was Birkenau or Auschwitz Two  which I would say a mile and a half away from Auschwitz One  and this was a huge camp.
We count how ma ny people were killed in the camp  and how many Germans was killed in the camp as a revenge.
Warren Marcus: For the sake of time and word gets out probably through hearing officers talk that the camp is going to be liquidated.
The other thi ng I remember is that there were all of a sudden in the camp  these kind of -- these kind of things.
Some of those people were working outside and the group were going out 6 o clock in the morning  returning 6 o clock in the evening back to the camp.
And I was happy that she was happy  and I went back into the labor camp  until one day I went to see her -- wanted to see her and it was closed.
He got the top people in the camp in whatever cases he tried.
We get on the train and we go to Olorons St. Marie and as we arrive at the railway station  the train is surrounding with French Gendarmes with machine guns and they take us off the train and put us on trucks and the next stop was a French concentration camp called Camp De Gurs and we found ourselves in the Gurs camp.
But my parents got scared enough so they sent me for the entire when I was about seven years old  fo r the entire winter to a kinderheim  which I guess translates best to a chi-childrens camp Yeah.
I only found out about it in Berlin when people came to live in the DP camp  havi ng come from Russia.
He got this one from his brother who was a priest who also perished in the same camp where my sisters perished.
What would I do  if as a Jewish doctor  put him in a camp.
And through a s -- a combination of those three types of sources  we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the Treblinka labor camp between March 1943  and its dissolution in July 1944  where they were.
>> Bill Benson: To spend a moment on the Velodrome roundup  you told me some 13 000 Jews were round up and then deported to transit camp and then off to places like Auschwitz.
If someone was working there around vaca concentr ation camp for one year  it dont they didnt care if survive or not survives.
So anyway  he survived and then was sent to I dont know if he was sent to another camp like Dachau  before Friedlander.
On A pril 1  1945  Steve was sent on a Death March to the Buchenwald C oncentration Camp.
I what I learned about him  he was we were someone [indecipherable] Paszow in the camp  i-in Krakow   in Paszow and pretty much through the wa r  another one who lost a wife  lost a child h-he did lose a wife and a child  by the way  a young baby.
Havent you her havent you heard of the camp in the current campaign  we dont want Sanders as president  because hell think that anything goes wrong  itll fall back  theyll accuse the Jews?
We were talked about it and there were...you see  there was not only Germans.
I just k now that  well actually it was more in Auschwitz than in Belsen-Bergen.
And that day they interconnected as ah-ha  this must be a concentration camp.
The camps were serviced by the British  but they employed Greek  Greeks for cleaning the camps  providing provisions to the camp  so there was a daily 13 There were five camps near Famagusta and seven outside of Larnaca.
So we had a brother who lived nearby in the Jewish area.
He wakes up and he thinks  in the middle of the night that hes in German concentration camp.
So  uh  from your  uh... After you left Dachau and went to the next camp  uh...which was... Moosburg.
Now they would send divisions home  they would send battalions home  and my orders came through  one person  Captain Joe Friedman  report to Camp Philip Morris.
MARIANNE ROBERTS April 11  2012 Gail Schwartz: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Marianne Roberts conducted by Gail Schwartz in Washington  DC on April 11 th  2012.
>> Bill Benson: Because your father is gone by this time?
Tiessta ck  T-I-E-S-S-T-A-C-K. And I was chosen to work right outside of camp.
Of course  the Gestapo presumably leased those vans  and inside the vans they had long benches where the Jews that were picked up were sort of lined up and then sitting until it was full and then the van would go to the transit camp.
Yeah  but I have learned later that she was apprehended  and she was taken to slave labor camp of Janofska.
Meanwhile  we had -- when I was assigned to the 16th armored division at Camp Chaffee  Arkans as  that was a brand new division  and I was a cavalry officer  in other words I -- we were training people for that division.
It reminded them of the barbed wire around the German concentration camp.
Right  in one camp  but later on when they put us together  my father worked with me.
So  well  I got typhus in the  back in Belsen  and Paul Lepitre  one of the Frenchmen  stole food and sent it to the camp  so by the time I got the food  there wasnt that much food left because she shared it with other people  but evidently it must have helped some.
When I came back from the camp  I -- Peppy had -- had the -- the pape r. I took the coat out and Mrs. Needelhile sold it for me.
He felt this was a work camp  some kind of a labor camp  and that it would not be the forest in Poland.
The oldest was killed in a concentration camp and the youngest was kill ed with his wife and his baby son.
And the rest  again  did not exist to us  because we almost hated the rest of the camp  because to us they were just interested in to go somewhere  and be make money  and become successful  and a-and they were boring to all of them.
If you come out of a concentration camp  if you come out of metastatic colon cancer  third degree  at an institute like Sloan-Kettering and you have a year of chemo and you can only take five months of this crap because the side effects are too bad.
In 2013 she traveled to her former home in Croatia where she accompanied the director of the Jasenovac archive to the site of the concentration camp to view their exhibit.
But otherwise we had no since we all ha d to have passes to leave the camp  you couldnt leave the camp without the pass and all that  and you have to prove why you have to go and all this so rt of thing.
But then one day  the camp was liquidated and we have we had to move to another camp.
And we lived not too far away from another friend of ours that is right now in San Francisco   and we had great time  because because we were the the camp in which actually the sc because the they kept liquidating the schools  and finally ne and and that was camp nu mber three.
Well  Leo was already Leo was taken to he it was [indecipherable] French  and he was taken to it was a Vichy youth camp in in Annecy.
She told me  we will maybe meet my -- my brot her in the concentration camp  she couldnt.
I have never been there  but you could see it from our camp because it was on a hill going up and you could observe it sometimes  as far as the activity that was going on there.
And that  too  sort of avoided him being called to the labor camp.
Now  through this uh  uh  by the same way  found the way to the camp  the medi cine  and an extra food  which  and the group of surveyors  I work with them very often  were very eager to do this.
And they were dragging the people in to uh  dragging the  the  the drag the people out from the camp from the big grave into another grave  on that side they  they were burning the bodies  and they empty out the big -------------.
I-Its -- at this time in 38  of course it wasnt as much loss around you as y-y -- No  but sti -- -- at that time  but -- -- no  tha -- youre right  at that time nobody wa s still concentration camp  but everyone felt miserable  of course.
I -- I didnt live -- I live only about two months in a camp like th at  you know  for the refugees  camp for the refu -- refugees  but I didnt like that.
We had a notic e that I had to report next day to the Judenrat to go to that camp.
and asked our friends who lived there how to go out to Dachau and he went to Dachau next morning.
And we came back  and a doctor came in Auschwitz  and we have been in Auschwitz  a doctor came and told us to take off our clothing  and everything  and examined us  our health  our -- and then he said  ﬁYou going to be sent to Yavishavitz ﬂ and Yavishavitz was a coal mine camp.
Then they started to gather all the prisoners into the main camp in Dachau  although we were probably no more than twenty  thirty miles to Dachau  everything wass bombed  and I wa s in transit for about four or five days.
Ferramonti was the camp  and they tried to keep the children busy with teaching  you know  and like a school.
And they took us...it's way way deep in a forest  that concentration camp and we got there.
But from time to time  someone like got a [indecipherable] problem  they got a problem with some medical issue  and sometimes they would just send them to the camp doctor doctor  but there was nothing else.
He was taken for transport  to go to another camp Sam   my husband Yes.
And what happened was  I was sent to Arkansas  Camp Chaffee for my for my basic training.
That was a little camp I wasn't long there  a couple of weeks.
They revealed many because they were also under law there that they had to  if they knew you were Jewish.
They put barbed wire around it and made a camp out of it.
But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and put into a bus in order that he be transported into a camp or we didnt know where of course.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what a transit camp -- what does that mean?
We didn't say we are Jewish  that we just escaped from concentr ation camp.
Like one very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the uniform  put on concentration camp uniform  shaved the head  and we had to speak to him.

Now in the case of Auschwitz  we got the commander of the concentration camp who was not captured until about April of 1946  and he wasn't there during the early part  but we got him  and the British sent him to Nuremberg  and the American's interrogated him.
The next day comes the jeep  Lieutenant and found me  talked to me and they took me to Ragensburg and Ragensburg I got rid of my camp uniform and get me some soldiers clothing and special strictly diet.
I was sent to concentration camp  and my brother was in prisoned of the war.

6 So now my sister was in Budapest in a in a prison; and my brother-in-law was in  somewhere took him to some forced labor camp.
I began working at S-Spudsyairna rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in September  41  and my work there prevented me from being taken to a forced labor camp in Germany.
In Auschwitz  I kept clean  very clean because we were able to shower as much as we knew that the same showers were giving gas to the people  but we were a little bit privileged because we worked in the kitchen  and the German people are very clea n  so they would order us to go every so often and shower in the showers  and we knew that we were going to be showered  so we were not scared  although you never knew what  what they had  kind of tricks they had up their sleeve  but we risked it.
I was in the ghetto  but I came to the ghetto a few times.
When the rumors were that we were moving out of this camp  Flosenberg  to Dachau and we would be traveling.
And they think I didnt have anybody and they knew me from concentration camp.
Oho  that is a -- you know  i-if I were younger and had the ambition  Id write another book and I -- I would just write about Camp Richie  because that was the most fascinating place.
So we all went to work and -- horror -- What -- do you remember the first time you went into the camp?
And we hear something about Flossenberg  that that's supposed to be t ough concentration camp.
After the Gestapo  after the tortures  and the concentration camp  and this situation was like sanitorium  you know.
Then we knew that a lot of people pe rished in Starachowice camp  and then they perished right along as we got along.
And from there they put them on trains and they took them to Auschwitz.
They didnt know what to do with us -- all the people from the la bor camp.
And now that we worked there in camp and the rations were terrible.
I wonder if -- how your mom handled the situation after the concentration camp.
Anyways  uh we were supposed to make it outside of the camp  uh outside of the ghetto and follow that Pole to the railroad station  and then... Let's stop because we just ran out.
Trencin was the last mountains -- mountain pass from the Carpathian mountains into the D-Danube [indecipherable] and the Romans were -- had their advance camp in there and on the castle  I will show the picture if youre interested in.
Bergen-Bel sen was inside a military training camp  similar to Fort Knox.
I ran trucks down  with the people of the camp  go see for yourself that we're not fooling them.

So  when he stayed in Agde  then he went to the camp commander  Tassart  who helped him out  sort out who was there before 1936 -- Right. --
If you survive there  we don't know  or you went to camp  you have a chance to survive.
Well that of course is a little shocking  I was in a concentration camp.
Even until they arrive in the camp  when they say  the SS was on  say  one side  ﬁYou go this way  you go this way.ﬂ No  it was nothing.
This camp was a killing camp and they were -- they were killed.
02:17:14 At the beginning  people who wanted  thought that they go in  the German said that they sending the people to labor camp.
They were -- they were just -- we were their priority  and if we -- they didn't give us food when we were in camp was because there was none.
Again  thats you kno w  they wer they they used to be there used to be a standing joke in Germany that where one man meets somebody who has just come back from concentration camp  and he said  how was his friend asks him how was it.
There was also a very big stench  you know  because there was this camp was was dev devastated  you know.
I remember once there was a camp outside of Frankfurt called Saosheim and Eleanor Roosevelt came to visit.
And there was a hospital in Ebensee that came... Howeve r  they knew that there was a concentration camp there.
Other camp  one vo one of the lager  two  during the night  we were in the barracks which different you know  digged out from in the ground and on the roof above  and not too ma ny guys  maybe 12 guys in on e of this.

Interview with Sol Kohn 68 In order to be in that camp you had to speak a language.
>> Anna Grosz: My father was sent in a camp .
Uh  their idea was that they run  we decided on what the structure of the camp administration would be  what would be elected  that there would be slates.
And Camp Lucky Strike was a camp for all the GI's that were on the way home.
He was very well liked by the commandant of the concentration camp.
Not enough doctors  and do you know  the German population from around  they were forced to come into the camp and see all this.
Well  as I said  the administration of the camp is  the administration of the camp  the top admi nistration was SS.
A report would come in to 3rd Army headquarters that so-and-so tank division is approaching an area in which they believe there is a concentration camp or has just overrun an area in which there is a concentration camp  and the conditions are horrible  et cetera  and that would come to me  the report would come to me  and I'd say I am going out into the field to investigate that.
And then  he took us girls  and we went to Camp One.
I forgot to say that in August we had a big bombardment for  by the U.S. Air Force on the Auschwitz camp  on the Igerfarben.
He was the most horrible killer that one  I mean  he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp  he wanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up.
One day a ye ar later I went to camp March 90 43 [1943] till the time I was in the ghetto working.
And now we had learned  uh... In fact  we had overrun the column that had gone out the back side of that camp.
When I came into the next camp  where Ive met Buschi and Zdena  I al so kept them on the bunkbed  or on my nose.
So  we ... Cut SWB: JOHN KOMSKI: Ym  really you know  we were not doing anything because the whole camp was in process of organization  you know of building up.
My father was forced into go in the concentration camp and be killed.
The only thing I thought is they were taking all these people  they're going to take them to another area of camp and -- because they're not going to be able to work.
Some who had and found a German girl I suppose consenting were taken to concentration camp or severely beaten by the Gestapo.
And one of the men was a friend of mine  and he knew my fa ther  too  he was in our transpor t. And he -- his wife was also in my camp  and he whispered to his wife  ﬁTe ll Uschi that Walter and O tto didnt make it.ﬂ And she told me that.
One uncle and my father were in the camp I was in.
So  he drove into th e camp with that platform and horses  and ordered people who were running around in that area to bring four uh  uh  uh  uh  oh uh  the cabins  you know  the four cabins from the uh lot 24  which is not far from the gate.
That place was called Hirschegg  by the way  the camp of the German soldiers.
And we came back -- we took the bus back to the camp  to Fort Belvoir and my God  everybody was packin g  everybody was ready to go.
My personal what you like know more  personal; expe rience in a concentration camp?
My mother  in the meantime  came Kristallnacht and my father was arrested  and he was sent to a concentration camp  Buchenwald.
I thought he was taking to a camp  I am taking on a camp  maybe hell survive  ma ybe Ill meet him  so it hold me to survive  to -- to -- to -- to -- to eat.
And he...she said  \ You will be the Lageraltest in the new camp where the arrivals are coming.\
The Romanowskys  19 I think they were in a different camp  but the two sisters  Anna Romanowsky; Genia Romanowsky; and the father  Barra Romanowsky.
Bob Behr: Yeah  my father got -- I think I told you  on Kristallnacht he wa s one of 11 the 30 000 Jews who got arrested  put in the concentration camp and he got out.
What would you have said in a camp  there was no doctor to go to.
They were in transferring the people to Slovakia and then transferring them back to towards Vienna where there was a transient camp and then toward Italy and then from Italy the boats  whatever boats can be arranged for the people to go to Israel.
And near th is displaced persons camp  there was a bakery and very nice Italian people.
At the same time  while I was in that concentration camp  my beginning in that concentration camp  trucks were still arriving from  what was then ru mored in the camp  as those that were killed in the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto.
Now we could -- people ran  ran all over  so the whole camp knew already what's going on by then  so some ran on the mines  got killed.
Because you see  they needed her in the in the camp.
We did not eat  in spite we get anyhow  almost nothing to eat  but we did not because we kept it for the evening  we went out to work  but we did not eat  but in the evening when we came back  the camp  the  the blockeldest kept the food for us because you know  we didn't eat  he gave us the food.
Then we marched  I mean we went when we we continued to Berlin and we also liberated a concentration camp of Sachsenhausen .
And start the problem like you know all concentration camp has.
So what you were ac tually fighting the Germans while inside the camp?
She came into my camp and begged me not to touch her trees.
That stopped the political problems that we were having with the people in the camp because they were fighting among themselves  and so we put a stop to that real quick.
Who will -- is it safe to be in the camp?
Only if a man what he was in concentration camp and he was in ghetto from 1939 til 1945  yes  this book you should read  this is true.
But we had to go through some gardens  and while we were passing the gardens  we were caught by the Germans.
All I know is that we arrived in Auschwitz in December  somewhere around July  I believe  and not very much later  the time of the Jewish holidays -- the Jewish New Year would fall som -- at about September  wh en  on the first or second day  rather  of the Jewish New Year  the selection was conducted i-in the mens section of the Auschwitz camp.
Anybody getting sick in a concentration camp  anybody claiming not being able to work was always sent to Auschwitz.
In the camp you was  you had a good job over there  you was secured in a way  you didn't know  you could vision another day and so on  so on  so on.
You see  people that go to see this camp  really  they took apart the camp.
One was to get in -- to get into hiding when the camp was evacuated because if they had caught us  they would have killed us.
So til this day nobody wants to own up and I went to the war museum in Ottawa and I spoke to an officer and I said Id like to know what happened to th at plane because the camp was gone and because the camp was gone  we were moved to Bergen Belsen.
I mean  incidentally  the film Schindler's List is an excelle nt example how Schindler  even in Auschwitz with a number of diamonds  gets his workers out of the concen tration camp again.
At that time we had to go hurriedly back to the work camp and go into the bunker because Siemens had in itself  only bunkers enough for their own employees.
So one dark night  my parents and I and my fathers brother Leopold   and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt  who was a year and a half older than me  we all headed to the back of the camp  and my father gave the French the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back.
Unbeknown to us they are building already a concentration camp  Majdanek  which was only three or four kilometers away from this area.
But anyway  so that gave me also an incentive to live  so this is how it started  and then another concentration camp  which where I went  different melodies came to me.
A lot of people got sick and  of course  again  a lot of the people in the camp were elderly people and children and women with children and so forth.
And he got the idea to take the most beautiful German girl what he has in his camp  give her some gifts  Polish sausage  vodka  diam onds or --------- whatever  or rings or gold or something  and he sent her to Auschwitz to open the door for him so that he can come over and talk with the Commandant Hess  who was Commandant of Auschwitz  who was famous for killing 4 000 to 5 000 people a day  and the woman came in  sh e became a girlfriend  she was so beautiful  that he couldn't resist it probably and give him a  but when Schindler came i n  he told him  \ I don't know what ------------------.\
Well  what I know now  is that we were taken to Auschwitz.
A nd then they shipped me out to a different camp.
But then they put us on th e next next camp.
And that was -- dos -- th-that slip was for the concentration camp  that I got a -- they sent me to concen -- yeah  I will know it  you know  if they come with the pink slip  they know thats a concentration camp  and I was one of them  you know.
A few of the Polish people that joined us used to be cooks at the camp.
So going back to my father's story  he was taken to the forced labor camp.
I understand that th ey were functioning at full blast when the camp was captured  and that they were tryi ng to clear their -- their rooms in the crematorium  and there were some of -- of them that were still alive  and they were just pushing them into the -- into the furnaces wh ile they were still alive.
Of course  he -- he became -- he became much worse in the camp.
My brother who was in labor camp  forced labor  he escaped and came home.
Now when you go into the Holocaust Museum  here  the first photo that you see is Ordruff  my camp  the one that I went into.
In the beginning  was hard to just take the plate and with one -- that you would ask for an extra filling before you went to the table to eat  until -- it took time for you to adjust that if you ate that one portion  and if you were still hungry  you would -- you could go back and ask for the next portion.
And it was a camp to show off how the Germans treat Polish officers.
And first they sent him to a camp  a labor camp in Normandy  and again he was taken away.
That was part of my job  to tr avel from camp to camp and help set up the [indecipherable] or the bibliotheques   in the various camps.
Funny thing  our hist ory starts from birth to concentration camp  never at -- in concen tra -- never talk about concentration camp  with -- and after  where we found each other.
Anyway  we had one guy that was  on his own free will  went to another camp to work.
because I used to be in different before the liberation  and I used to smuggle pieces of ammunition into the  to the camp  putting in the soup  leftover soup  in the can  and I got caught  and they want to know who is  who is doing it  and I didn't do it  so I was tortured pretty severely.
They were worried about the health of the Germans in the camp  the SS and so on  not the prisoners.
This was taken over by the  this used to be Polish airplane factor y  taken over by the Germans and we got there was a small camp and this camp was  there were about 250 Polish Jews and women there.
7 A. Yes  in a camp here in Denmark but under comparatively good circumstances and nobody thought really that it should last for very long.
This was the only present I ever got in the camp from somebody was this whole bread.
In addition to that  the local farmers used to throw potatoes in the camp.
Then what happened was... we were about 2 or 3 months in that camp.
I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in 42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the labor camp  in the Jeneska Road labor camp or Poniyet Tovah  I forgot there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area which maybe his brother or one of his nephews b ecause if my fathers son was already twelve by that time then his older brothers kids could have been teenagers.
I just thought maybe that the British-run camp might have a different interest.
And they decided to inspect this camp and there was a delegation  the two of them  with their aides.
Now I don't know...I do not know the results of the 3 500 people  but I know that I was told that they had in Paris  I think it was Paris  a displaced camp for Jews  and all the Jews that were left in the camp were all sent to this displaced camp in I believe it was in Paris.
Your schooling at the DP camp  was th at in English  German  or Polish?
A transit camp was a camp that housed people that go to Germany as forced laborers.
And when I was closing the camp a young girl came up to me and said you must give me somethi ng for my mother.
And which camp did she -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 8 She -- we were separated.
Did they have the same rations as the rest of the people in the camp?
So I decided to I took the subway and went downtown and happened to be on 7th Avenue  which at that time  was where most of the photo studios were and photo labs and I went from place to place  not speaking English very well very little because I studied it in the DP camp actually.
So things were getting worse every day and the labor camp was  they were talking about not letting us go out in the evening  home they were  wanted us to start sleeping there too.
Nili Keren  ﬁThe Family Camp ﬂ in Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp   ed.
Uh tell me when you arrived into the camp  where were you taken and what did you do?
Well  after we left the -- after we left the DP camp -- not the D -- the interrogation  see  and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 7 not in the POW camp  he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some accommodation.
And so we...we had that  and then the...uh...the pasteur's wife figured out...she had heard about the children's camp ...uh...somewhere....I think there was...I'm not sure exactly....it was...maybe in the or somewhere  that I could go to.
It was only then that I became more interest in the gassing process  because I had to register the daily gassing of women in the camp.
Then we arrived in Auschwitz and we were told to gather up our belongings and get out and we had to carry them out.
So after when we would send food from one camp to another camp  I was maybe in 15 of them  but I don't know the locations because they used to send boys to build air strips.
And I cant tell you where it was  but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the Dutch frontier illegally and they were now being held  and had been held for many months in this camp.
We didnt where we were going  because I believed that we were going to another camp to work  like  to another labor camp to work  but that was me.
I -- I -- I -- two summers -- after the first summer I mentioned to you earlier  with the Quaker camp  I worked in the Poconos in a camp for boys and girls  as a waiter  to earn pocket money.
And...uh...the...the ...uh..order of the day was that we are marching out to another concentration camp and...uh..we will remain there or we will be shipped out by train to another camp.
So  I was very scared that any time now we were escorted by -- well  we stayed in -- iin bra -- in the -- in this camp for it -- I dont know if a week or two weeks or something like that.
At a certain point  the Ghetto was turned into a concentration camp?
ALAN ZIMM Page 13 which were liberated  they said: We don't have to wait for the British to bring food  there are Germans living outside the camp in their villages--we're going to take it.
And when they took away the black SS and gave us some different Germans  because they took away the black SS to fight for them at Danzig  whoever they can get    they had us in like in a camp.
I know one thing  while I was in Buna  while I was in Buna a whole outfit of German soldiers in German uniforms were marched into the camp  the clothes taken away and put in striped clothes just like us.
But  uh  we came to the first American DP camp built.
Now when we worked or in Lauerhutte   we had to march there from the camp in which we were  Lauerhutte.
There was and since I spoke Hebrew  so I was and there was none down there  I thi nk people knew Hebrew  so I was teaching Hebrew.
Well  at that point of course  we had near where we were  we had Ebensee   the camp.
We left out of Camp Kilmer  New York on a troop train -- troop -- on the troop ship.
From the 40 people we dont know how many came to the camp.
Then the other ma bro brother was born in 1924  he disap he died in concentr ation camp  he was 18 years old.
Leave your belongings  that will be shipped to your camp  why should you carry it?ﬂ Then there were some striped clothed men who were screaming also that ﬁgo fast  you have to line up five in a row.ﬂ And in between screaming to us they talked to us in Yiddish.
Thats USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 33 a camp near Haifa  very close to Haifa  all -- outskirts of Haifa.
They needed more people for uh working on looms in another camp called Landeshutz and this is how I got out of Matzdorf and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a truck and we went to Landeshutz which was the other  the sister camp.
You ask me a question  what did they have a business to go in the camp?
My grandfather  who had escaped from Janowska labor camp   found out from the man who had helped him that the Nazis were going to burn the ghetto in 1943.
I don t remember all of it  but I remember that very often there would be a kind of cabaret element to it  in which there would be songs in Yiddish  or Polish  or whatever  really making fun of  and poking the finger at the establishment of the British rule  the British command and the British z one  the attitude to the camp.
I had an ID  SS ID  that I could come to the camp and I left.
And later on you know it carri ed through into the concentration camp.
Birkenau  if I remember correctly  was mostly for the Jews  but Auschwitz as such the majority of the prisoners in Auschwitz were Poles  but things were changing all the time  but Birkenau  the prisoners from Auschwitz were working on the Birkenau camp.
As you walk to camp  to work  or back from work  you never know where the bullet will hit you.

From there they would take me to th e camp but once they were taken October to camp already  I didnt report af ter that  I just stayed home.
And one day  they came and they said they are looking for people and we had to go again for the selection  and again I told my sister to straight out herself and me and my sister   my aunt  and the two cousins were very lucky day  they took us to this labor camp called Denawerdkee.
And I never had no pictures  or no nothing  but when my parents   when they went in Berlin   later they put them in Fernwald   next to min Munich   there was a Jewish camp  a DP camp Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 104 [indecipherable] where the Jewish people lived  and my my mothers sister came  she brought some pictures and some stuff over there.

Were there guards or were you just able to walk out?
No  well you -- you could check out of the camp if -- provided you had an invitation to go someplace else.
And they immediately established -- they were doctors that came there from the States  and -- and from Canada  and they establish  you know  just like a little -- tiny  little complex -- living complex like -- it wasnt big enough to be a village  but it was like a camp  and they assisted the Jews  and there were all kind of newcomers that would come from concentration camps all over.
In fact  I recall when these barracks were be ing built  the barbed wire going around the camp  watchtowers being constructed  I remember one conversation with a group of inmates and Oskar Schindler in which Oskar Schindler described to us the need for the barbed wires and the watchtowers because it was going to be so good in this camp that some people from the outside would try to come into this camp.

And we had to go um  on that railroad station where th ey came from and make sure that they all get out  and there was straw on the bottom of the cars  and already dead people laying around dead that we had to carry out and the rest had to march to the camp.
later they found out it's more efficient for them to have the same people do always the same work  so they start to have permanent people doing the cleaning up  the separating all the kind of thing  and that what started to be a permanent group in this camp what worked there.
So  uh  this was a very important function  to  to organize  to make a contact between the families  and those who were in a  in the camp.

And then he got word that he would be transferred to a...uh...a camp  work camp in...uh... somewhere in south of France.
He did  they signed the papers  and they were allowed to stay in a detention camp in Holland.
And in order to save th is man from this from this experience  we came to the conclusion that there was only one way out...tha t means to hide him in these straw sacks which were also called mattresses  even if there was a danger that he would suffocate but at least it was 7 seen the only way to do it  and he was an an old uh camp man and he knew all the tricks and so he said yes  I I'm willing to undergo this risk  so that's what we did.
He was sent a postcard  near Budapest  in the camp .
I dont remember much about that camp except having a crush on an older girl.

And that is my story besides that...uh...when the war was over  the...uh... I was in the...uh...displaced person camp with my brother and my friend  in Feldafing.
We segregated the camp by nationality  and got all of the various nations nations living together rather than.... The Poles hated the Russians  and so they were locked up separately.
They had lice and hunger and typhus and typhoid  and people were dying in that camp like flies.
Then there came the leadership of Lublin  of that camp  Majdanek and took over.
They came...we had...uh...like about 300 people in...in our camp and they brought trucks covered with a canopy  and they put us on the trucks.
When you were in this rest camp  there were other Jewish children  did you talk and compare stories?
And sometimes I would see a colu mn of me -- of people  of Jews from the ghetto being marched out for -- obviously to be taken somewhere to a transport  to a concentration camp.
Matter of fact  there was another guy  a boss  he was of German descent  and that guy used to travel around too.
They were separated  but in this camp apparently  the commander was a drunk and one must have started a fire and his quarters were destroyed...part of it was destroyed.
And there we--suddenl y on November  I think in November  were told that we had to report to a camp in A gde  the next morning  just to take the bare essentials  leave everything el se and leave and go to Agde.
>> Bill Benson: And you would continue working  as you said  at the Gleiwitz camp in those conditions until January of 1945.

But the family camp was not close to us; it was close to the other people from her home town  or as we would call them in fighting groups of the trap.
And they unload us  again  new SS get on  pick us up  take over and march us a good distance into  up hill into another place  a camp.
And there was a lot of prisoner  Russian prisoners who were -- came home from the -- from the Germany.
One day  while we stood in formation while the SS came to take us away  he said  \ I take you all into Camp 3.\
They took him  and they put him in a concen tration camp  and after a half a year  they wrote his wife and said she could have the urn.
They didn't start sending the Jews to the camps until I think it was 1943  but they were held in a transit camp in a north suburb  northern suburb of Paris.
So it was  as I have to explain maybe  the camp was so as I say we lived apart where the Germans lived.
It it  we were free to walk around and we're free to communicate  and we free involve ourselves in whatever in whatever civil and civic things were organized in the camp  but again  I need to repeat  it was time for of waiting  waiting to Israel  waiting to go to America  waiting to to find the means to live outside.
And one night they came in in -- in this place and they took out all the Jews from this -- this part of the -- of the city and they drove them to a place  Ponari.
But that camp wasn't as bad so I won't even say anything about this camp.
They gave me some food  sandwiches and you go to a camp.
Laughter] There was no treatment available and my mother's major concern was I would be taken into the Nazi dispensary  which that had in the camp.
And in closing  I can tell you yes  that was -- we were evacuated from our concentration camp in problem February 1945.
And he came to ours camp  and that time I have a big  you know  over here  I still have  you know  cut.
Because on that time they did not really export anybody to concentration camp.
Maybe they ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 even didn't claim.
And it brought to mind  that here we were in this situation -- having been separated from our parents  forever probably  and being left alone  not knowing of our future  working under most horrendous conditions -- and here are people who are still living a normal life  airing their pillows  even in such close proximity to the camp where all these horrible things are happening.
The different craftsmen had to go to this camp if there repairs to be made.
Finally  within a few days  the camp was moved  with the SS  and we remained in that camp.
So  and the two uncles married  one married a Hungarian survivor  had come out of Holocaust  of a concentration camp  and they have three children and one  two of them live in Israel.
I wasŠ I guess like when I was growing up or most kids  when they're growing up  you know  they have these dreams of what they want to be  and in a way if you didn't have that chance -- how do you  you know -- I mean– Well  I was successful of doing what I wanted to do  you know  even  even though in the camp  even though in the camp–. When they put us to Auschwitz and there was Russian and there was hunger  so to me it was no big deal.
Most of the girls in the camp were from the same area  and communication stopped  so we knew that something had happened to the ghetto  and about a couple of months later  must have been around Yom Kippur  a transport of women came to our camp from Auschwitz.
Also sometime during the time when we were inmates at the concentration camp in theŠnow known as Anka F and Amalia (c. 835) somehow two factories combining and using the people  the 1 000 inmates as their workers.
With the different groups of individuals who were in the concentration camp  did you ever interact with any of the other groups or individ uals  not just the Jews  maybe some of the other ones?
Well  it got so ba d that they started to round up people and take them out to the concen tration camp  I had 15 people in that cellar including my mom and Gaynosh.
And no ma tter where we were  whether we were in this camp or whether we we re to be taken to another camp because up to this point for whenever we were when we were in Starachowice  whenever a group was brought from a different camp to us  they were to do exactly what we did  so we thought that this was the way  that if we are transferred to another camp  we will be taken out of the fa miliar environment where we had still some help from the outside  to a totally strange e nvironment  that things will definitely get worse  but it will be again a slave labor camp.
And as I say  at first we were sort of interned in Bergen-Belsen and then we were still treated as prisoners because the tr ansport was very small and of the things that happened when we arrived in the camp.
Because the Russians were came in  over over over maybe a couple days before he came in  so we all go free  all of a sudden.
He made a camp out of -- against -- for the Jews  and we come into that camp.
And what they did  they kept us in that camp and they relocated.
Then  when we arrived in Landsberg  all the lights were very bright in front of the camp.
I recall perhaps one or two who were quite elderly  and there were some -- three or four ladies  women  who were married  but whose husba nds werent -- and who husbands never got -- came out  and -- and were killed  unfortunately  in the death camp s. And as a result  they  to some degree  adopted me  if you -- if you follow what Im getting at.
Then they called me and said what we are getting here many Germans SS men coming here with the families as guard to the camp and there is no furniture for them so we want to open a small shop to build furniture for these Germans.
And you can send people because there are other people who -- who have exit rights  so they -- the food is being brought in -- into the camp.
You see there was so surround and with they were watching and in concentration camp there was also the electricity.
I woke up at six o'clock in the morning that my two girlfriends were thrown out of the camp because of the pass.
I had a cousin of mine in a camp next to us  not far from us  which we didnt know.
And when we were in the other camp  we heard that Erik was beaten because we thought they shot him because he would beg  let me live  I will work.
You see  our ca -the other camps were half slave labor camp  and half death camp.
We put you up and lets get out of the camp.
It was very surprising to us that that was a concentration camp and we were wearing our own clothes.
And I'm very conservative and apropos  the majority of survivors and I'm talk ing about camp survivors  now everybody thinks they're a survivor  bu t camp survivors  are Republicans  are conservative.
And so they really took a lot of chances and faced a lot of dangers helping us in the camp and taking children out of the camp  to place them in their childrens homes.
But was city  Kermine   and was about six miles from from that camp.
Do you remember whether the uprising in Ausc hwitz had taken place  or you went to this camp before?
So  I figured the Jews they go anyway to the concentration camp  why should they keep them for prisoners of war.
And I went to from Camp Grant I went to  I guess it was Texas Brownwood  Texas and Camp Campbell  Kentucky and Indio  Californi I spend a whole year out there.
Since in June  I was already in the labor camp so I could escape this experience.
I went in the camp at that time and I know that they overpowered some of the guards and many of them got out but many of them were killed.
The tr -- the trucks were -- were operated by the Spanish internees who were in the camp  who had many more privileges than we ever got.
So I dont know whether she delivered whether she delivered the baby in the boxcar  or when they arrived in the concentration camp.
However  in camp  I was questioning  where is that supreme being?
16 years old I was prisoner 54015 in the concentration camp of Stutthof.
At that time there were no trains; the tracks di d not go inside the camp.
But Tomachek brought three people from the camp of Pollkulla   which was another Rumanian jurisdiction camp near Brasov where the people were left to starve and die.
We had to supply the military with a Table of Organization for the camp for the purpose of salaries.
See  the woman [indecipherable] ammunition  and when the men came into work in the camp  they gave him the ammunition  you know  little.
But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave.
In 1944  Leon was taken to a forced labor camp in Kielce  Poland.
They used to they used to this time they used to could send to the camp  packages  you know.
Stutthof is the only camp that the original gas chamber -- the original crematorium is still standing.
And it was a children's camp for kind of displaced persons  displaced kids--Belgian  French.
Dachau was a concentration camp that the initial inhabitants were workers  leaders  communists  etc.
So they took us out of the main camp and put us alongside of the mountain.
So when somebody came into the camp with the food  I say you stay here today  I give them something and I took the food  and I wanted to see if she survived.
And a friend of mine from Czechoslovakia wh o was not in the camp  I think she came to th e United States before the war  no  maybe after the war  but I didn't ha ve the details really  but she was not imprisoned during the camps  and she said that there has been a law passed that all the former inmates and survivors and so on can get restitution.
They didn't give us any soap in the slave labor camp either.
He was not part of the prisons that inhabited the camp  but I was never able to find out all the details about it.
Uh  my mother is still not know of at the time and uh we lived in--in the Falofin DP camp for a while and then we had an apartment in Munich  afterwards.
And one day we saw a article there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can prove that they were in concentration camp  or in the army with th-the Russians always there  England .
I once visited th at camp to identify a certain man  and it was -- there were vi -- on -- they were sl eeping on the -- they didnt even have straw  was stone floors.
We were fed  and they ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 assigned us some bunks.
And he would see me on occasions until the time that they were going to evacuate his camp.
When they left me out of that solitary confinement  they were evacuating the camp.
Are you saying that you were in th e same camp as this this author?
When I became commander of the camp in Koburg   he started this same thing with me.
It's no longer possible to have these hundreds and hundreds of people in the camp without any decent medical facilities  food  and so forth.
The camp was sort of segregated into various groups of people.
Dont forget  we didnt have dates  that you come to my house and lets USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 17 spend five hours talking and I take you out to dinner or any -- it was a concentration camp.
This was not done  of course  during her work in labor camp  but after she would leave they would give her some extra work and in exchange they would give her some food that she was -- What -- what kind of work would she give your aunt?
I was unfortunately in the sanitarium then but my good friend who played p iano said  ﬁ I played for General Eisenhower when he visited our camp.
Some of them went to the camp  to other camps  the brothers  my brothers.
What was  before we get to this  to the part when the Gestapo came... Yeah.
Bombing was a terrible experience  but had very few ni ghtmares about the concentration camp.
But then he had a cust omer and he went in that store and the Germans came and said we need some Jews for the camp  in the store.
This was originally a prisoner of war camp  and they had some permanent buildings which were hospital buildings  and they moved first the camp and then they moved the hospital.
We were  after all -- probably 80 percent of that camp was still people from our hometown.
I know of a girl who just now survived concentration camp.
And...uh...they were with her all the way in the concentration camp  and she worked very hard and had typhus fever  and she died.
So he came to our commandant of our camp  which was a Jewish man from Krakow.
And so that whole area was free for the Germans to do what they want and they did and they made a concentration camp out of it.
You know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse  because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth.
And some of them you hadn't seen for a while in the camp  or you had all been together?
When they took my father  they said he goes to a work camp.
05:12:46 First of all  at the beginning  in the camp  a  a young girl was so excited  and we knew that the Russians are coming  the Russians are coming  and she run  and wanted to greet a Russian soldier in a tank  and she got killed.
And that was very important because in a concentration camp there were only two things  basically one thing that kept us aliv e. The main thing to get together again  to reunite with our families.
I like el ectronics  you know; and I went looking for a job in the camp.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 60 In Florida last year  they show nice thing  all of a sudden they start to show from the camp.
And indeed one day a social worker came to my mother and asked me whether she would let me go out of the camp to a village called Le Chambon.
From Poland I went next to Germany; and I went traveling and I went to Landsberg  to a DP camp  displaced person camp.
Were there other Jews in this town that you lived in?
BUD BRODECKI: Well we were put in rooms that was ex military camp  in Landsberg.
There was no time to think of things like that until we until we got to the camp of Buchenwald.
We were put on a train and shipped to Skarzysko  which was a slave labor camp.
But if so  I mean  the 26 mortality in the camp was well below what it should have been in a concentration camp in a period of seven or eight months.
Then  we had three of these wagons hit us  so we were alright for food then.
after part of your division -- liberati ng the camp  and cleaned part of it  you said other parts of your troop has passed through.
Actually  I remember one camp where I was where the head was actually a woman sports teacher and she was a very strong Zionist and she would have Friday evening Shabbat ceremonies and carry on othe r Jewish activities.
Maybe we were sleeping there six or seven in a bunk.
He remained in Auschwitz for about six months and then went on to another concentration camp in Austria called Mauthausen  a real hell hole of a camp.
Um  I  I can only surmise um I  I was cleaning some  some small component in the camp and  and he came up--he  he wasn't a lager fuehrer  he was  he was um  sort of a supervisor there.
In the meantime  the evacuation of the camp was continued and we were taken from this old part of this lager back to where I used to be  back to this relatively new part  this B2B where I have known all the physicians.
In Auschwitz  in the central lager  there were only women who were secretarie s but they did not live in this particular camp.
We made through so much  so that suddenly  you know -- and I went to the camp  an d I figured its no sense to talk to some employee.
And such fr iendship did develop I think much more in concentration camp than any place else.
But during the war --I now go far ahead --when the Germans in the camp asked us to send out mail into the neutral countries  so that they would have an alibi that the Jewish people are living in Poland  I wrote to [Mimi ] .
But it became personally close to me during my embassy days  40 years late r. In Luxembourg there is an Amicale de Buchenwald  and these are Luxembourgers  some Jewish  non-Jews  some were deserters of the army  some were the parents of Luxembourgers who had been forced into the German army  who deserted and then the parents were thrown into the concentration camp  so we had a -- a 34 mix.
I-I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 40 mean I eventually got to Budapest  but what happened is that when we were -- when we went back  already after the -- the camp  a-after we were already able to travel and we got some -- they gave us also some money to -- to have  you know  like if you want to buy yourself a drink or -- or  you know  something.
Did they appear in your lives at all  or No  th-there were they they had administration of the camp  was given to the Polish Okay.
And he escaped but his parents went to and died in concentration camp.
And Germans being so indit I mean outrigh Langsam aber Sicher  83 slow and great and just exactly that way  no other way took us back to the concentration camp.
Checkpoint start checking me and so I have so me sandwiches and sent me right away to Polish commissariat  mean the Polish prison and from there start not so bad because I was only one night there and I suppose to be sent to working camp in Germany and because my father was connected with underground and Polish police befo re the war was second was friendly with my father too.
That was new camp not fa r from the Auschwitz so the group was going over there and daytime was working and night wa s coming back.
The...we did not stay too long in that particular camp; because as work progressed  we were sent to a different camp called Larche.
And I thought by myself  you know  if the Russians are that close that they are almost in front of our concentration camp  which they may liberate   maybe I shouldn't die ; maybe I should try to live.
When you were in the labor camp and then in the later camp  did you have any connections with your mother?
Uh  we uh  after after we were in the Nordhausen area and Iceslaven area  from then on why uh  we heard a lot of stories but we had no no direct contact with any uh  any type of slave labor or concentration camp uh  camps.
He was put in a labor camp  my fathe3 rcause I know people that was with him.
>> Bill Benson: Your Aunt Giza and Uncle Ljudevit and other members learned your parents had been arrested and then sent to a concentration camp but that your brother had been saved from being deported to the camp.
I cannot say that somebody once said that it was a special camp or something.
And then he answered me  well everybody was in a concentration camp.
These people brought in food  as much as they could get from the farms around or wherever and then  of course sold it at tremendous prices in the camp.
We were the only family of three to the best my knowledge that lived in that camp.
And they yanked me and said  \ Tonight  uh you're going to a different camp.\
Some...uh six day  and after work they take us to uh to camp where we sleep.
Now the same truck who brought me from the camp  now it would be taking me back either to be thrown in the ditch or burned...cremated.
The fact is that he could stay in the camp in the infirmary to say his prayers.
We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp.
And we didn't know we were going -- we knew we were going to a camp somewhere in Germany.
But they told us U aO later that...uh...they were very surprised and happy that wewere the first ones let in  and we were in quarantine in i a...in a camp which was called A-lager  A-lager.
And when you read those -- you got those ledges  about 17 or 18 in the death valley  you go from one to the other one  then you see how many people di e  losted their life in that concentration camp in Flossenburg.
Then when the time came to deliver me back to the camp  he had my he agai n used his connections not to send me back to the camp  and he really saved my life.
Let me just ask you a few questions  you were near Essen  was there a name to this labor camp?
Although the -- the Polish girls  they were hanged in the -- in the camp  they had a little jail there  and they took them in there and hanged them all.
Before that death camp  when we were sent out to work  they made contact  somehow.
At that camp there were Gentiles and Jews and some Germans for political reasons.
Now the Jewish boy  I ga -- these are all men in the -- in Camp Richie  yes?
You did everything you could and you kept publicizing through the camp newspaper network every time a ship would go so that -- there was a dreadful thing called the Va'ad Aliya  the Committee on Immigration  I call it dreadful because it was operated according to the Zionist political key.
It was done in camp to protect you from the bombing so to protect you from this and they were throwing there too.
I still have that dagger but this gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this souvenir  he was murdered by other members of the camp.
Langenbielau was a camp what the Germans w here making air force parts  for the air  for the German air force.
She was like a message girl and they were sending her in from the front from the camp inside a messenger girl so she knew everything but in the meantime  she was working in the underground with another Polish guy and the men's camp and he was not Jewish  he was a Pollack and his name was   and they were working together.
We only knew that we ha d to go very fast - run  line up  and march out of the camp.
We had to stand up  and they said that young women will be taken to a labor camp.
>> Bill Benson: You don't know how long he was there?
I can't remember which one but he was murdered in a camp.
So Do you know the name of the camp he was in?
The theresien -- Theresienstadt family camp -- No  no  no  no  no  Im talking about the Birkenau camp.
And in the meantime  as we walked we come into Camp number 1 and he says  \ Spread it.\
And in the spring  we were transported to -- 120 people were transported to the other -- this other camp Capostiano  which is a village  and the people were Interview with Pepi Schafler 22 housed in  I don't know  houses or shacks that -- and they worked  I guess  the fields.
And so we found out that there was a prisoner of war camp where they had a lot of prisoners who were capable of doing special things.
So he says  well   they show me their documents  they are Greeks  they are going from the camp home  let's go in the town there is a Greek and we will come  we will bring him and he'll find out from them who they are.
Not far away was a French POW camp  and they motioned to us to come close to them .
What happened with his group  they were supposed to go to   too  his group  but to work for the Germans.
And we said  ﬁWell  Regina  maybe well -- we should write to your husband  maybe he know --ﬂ And sure enough  about a month later  my brother saw it on -- you know  he was like in a Displaced Persons camp in Italy and he saw it -- the -- He saw what?
The telephone was ringing in the in the office  I would pick it up and say  this is Camp Sosnowice  so and so  and take a message.
And we were approaching Camp Birkenau  they preferred it be called Auschwitz  and it had the famous inscription  which still I believed  until I got in  \ Arbeit Macht Frei\  which means \ Work Makes You Free.\
And it's...just like they brought us to the train station from one shtetlach  that camp was sort of a shul for all of the surrounding areas.
This camp was the largest of the three in Austria and the most primitive.
Now  in the forest  they go t in camp one of the troops  you know  there Joseph Elman 18 [date] Page 18 was some we call it Mecadizans   but it was already some Russians with them  came over and got in contact with us.
She was left with my father and they struggled  right  until -- together after they were released from the camp at Casanuri.
All of a sudden  two more boys  they are run away from the camp  and I met those two guys.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 Let's go back.
Yeah  yeah  yeah–they buried 50 people every day in the camp.
And every day  there's not a day that doesn't go by even now  to this day  that there is n't something that reminds me of concentration camp.
And after they were taking the groups in and out and everybody was working and  as I said  quietly   trying to be compliant  they asked for a larger group; they said to congregate in the main square and that they would go out -- a little bit out of town there was a old Polish Army camp.
All of a sudden one day we were  I was plowing I remember  and I had to have alwa ys a guard on my tractor with a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp  an Israeli POW camp  guarding Arabs during the War of Independence  so he learned some Arabic from them.
There were couple hundreds already  ci vilians  you know  not the we were from Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 161concentration camp they were those wh o escape from labor camps  you know  and some other.
How did you find out that he was sent to this camp?
Only because I was still able to work we transported  the Germans wanted to clean up that camp  and we had to transport the dead bodies  decomposed bodies  to the mass grave that day  and all of a sudden only and you couldnt get out of line  and my best friend Kurt Spitzkopf  with whom I went toge ther all the time from Minsk  a ll of a sudden  while we were  he said  Heinz  theres my mother.
At Feldifing  people were still coming in from the east  but eve -- but even by then they were no longer the emaciated concentration camp figures that we associate with that immediate post-war period.
And I hear one saying  she's coming from camp  how does she have a cold like this?
Orianienberg was a murder camp also  small enough known near Berlin which fell into the hands of the Allies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on Berlin and we started to march now to to...the death march  29th of January.
And everybody would help always those who had to leave the camp.
In Klettendorf  for me was a man's concentration camp and a woman's concentration camp.
There were many camps in wh ich be big resistance  Sobibor in Auschwitz  in Gross Rosen  in  in our little camp.
In that camp I was a non-active member because I was very young first of all.
So lets talk a bit about the DP camp you went to.
And I dont really rememb er very much about the camp.
Why I am saying 28 that  because there was a little camp across or across the road.
My mother and I escaped  and he stayed in a Dutch concentration camp for some time  and then was transported to Auschwitz  and died in Auschwitz.
Lienzingen was the first camp  and we worked  they took us several kil-kilomers  we had to walk to a place  a zoological garden.
So you would be outside the camp and you would have a mission to sneak in  steal something and sneak back out?
All the time I dream that Im with the camp  we going to hide it  we going to run.
36 Q. The first camp you were in  how long were you there?
So the day we had to register the kids were not put in camp  my father and my mother were put in a camp.
What else did you see that first time in the camp?
Part of the camp was burning...was still burning and now we discovered the the...the open...the open barracks but we discovered something else.
There was a self-designated camp committee consisting of some of the most brilliant men I've ever met.
While we were there  we heard about a labor camp  Jewish labor camp  in walking distance actually  in Prokocim .
When we came on in Camp One  I saw people from my home town.
Okay  in that case  let me turn this on again  and tell me about the women who were prisoners of the Germans in the camp Interview with Norman Coulson October 4  2013 69 Yeah.
A nd they were Russians who either escaped from labor camp  or escaped from the [indecipherable] some out from the army or so.
RG-50.030*0584 33 So  in the we moved to to the labor camp Plaszow and in the group of my friends were siblings  brother and sister  Lola and Henyik.
Because I was -- you know  I was in a concentration camp during the war  you know  when -- when I was in Europe.ﬂ ﬁOh  yes  I know all about it.ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  any time you want to know more about that  you ask me and Ill tell you.ﬂ In other words  I always leave the door open  you see.
They went through a series of harrowing experiences  being moved from one camp to another  especially as the Russians were advancing  but they managed to survive  ended up in Italy at the end of the war  and with my fathers help  started up a feather and down business and subsequently emigrated to the Unit ed States  and of the two brothers  one passed away a long time ago from cancer  and the other one  the youngest  Norman  is about 83 years old  still alive  and except for hard of hearing  is in good health.
And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he was going to an all-men's camp over in Paoting .
How long were you in Camp Kilmer  when you first arrived in the U.S.  in New Jersey?
But the older children -- I mean  we had -- we al ready  when we had them in our camp  because we would -- we had them in conditioning camps   you know  we opened special stolen children conditioning centers.
So the viewing general told the camp commander  so he said  ﬁThats kid is sick  why you make him march?ﬂ So he talked to my first sergeant.
Warren Marcus: The people in the camp  in addition to being worked so hard were probably suffering from disease and probably starvation too.
We had the cap  yeah -- what do you call it -- camp -- that they supplied you with the caps.
Well then  the head of the Swedish Red Cr oss  a fellow name -- name -- fe-fellow by the name of Bernadotte had made a deal with Himmler  that he would try to negotiate with the allied and get a peace going  and the price for that  Hitler had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that all Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- concentration camp inmates should be shipped to Sweden until the end of the war.
Although  with my mother  we discussed -- there was a lot of reminiscing about the camp  you know -- where was this  what happened.
Hirst de scribed him as the most reliable SS man in the camp  yeah?
And in other  we had schools  in some are -- in other  Bas hkimine  there was a big wi -- camp  very close  where they had very good causes  so we encouraged them to go down there.
But this was immoral and my brother was taken to the men's camp  and he managed to live through it somehow and of course he survived.
We come to some place where the train--I am not familiar with the area--and we were loaded in the freight trains.
She said by that time  a cat appeared in the camp.
He was an electrician  and him I engaged to put me in front of the entrance an little barb  electric barb like an -- like an -- what we had over there  and underneath I had the battery  and so when you touched the two things  the camp was illuminated  yeah.
And when you were in the ghetto  did you work in any way?
Are there other things that you remember about life in the camp ------------------?
I said \ Oh  my goodness  I hardly ever mention Bergen -Belsen \  because that was another camp that apparently when we came in they weren't yet ready for us.
The whole time  your operations were in the mens camp  in D?
So when we came to Buchenwald  my father was shipped elsewhere.
So I went in the army and  and I was  went to the infantry basic training which Where It was north Camp Hood Texas which now is Fort Hood and it was rough and there was no running  there was no plumbing and there were lister bags for water.
And there was one cousin  and one girl that my brother used to go out before th -the concentration camp  and before the Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 8ghetto.

LUCIE RAGIN July 23  2009 This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview conducted by Peggy Frankston  with Mrs. Lucie Ragin  on July 23rd  2009  in New York City  for the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial Museum.
>> Bill Benson: And in your first Displaced Persons Camp  I think that's where Bella met her husband.
The Spanish people who were in the camp for years had very little.
Before the escape attempt  had their been any deportations from the camp?
And Gusen Zwei was the worst camp you ever heard of.
We always talk the good stuff  like -- li -- like the concentration camp never happened to us.
Those warehouses that they opened we re those in the SS part of the camp?
Interview with Tracy Strong June 11  2009 56 And once you got those au thorizations  you could y ou could take them out of the camp.
We -- we trained them in everything  and we had regular German prisoners of war  the very first who had been taken in North Africa were brought to Camp Richie.
The Joint Distribution Agency  they were really supe they were really helping them in the displaced camp camps  you know  and [indecipherable] you were black market in th-the di-displaced camps  DP camps?
>> Bill Benson: Did you write any poems in the concentration camp?
Well  anyhow  we trespassed the law of the camp many a many times and finally we got kicked out of this ammu-ammunition factory  Schmidt and Kranz  with which was really working for the metal -- metalwerker which was making those V-1s and V-2s later on.
So when I heard there was a possibility to go to a satellite camp to work in a quarry  there I went.
To -- to Theresienstadt  which was in Czechos lovakia  a camp where a lot of German Jews were housed  and -- or -- or sent to Poland to -- to -- to the death camps.
We were the last ones  but the whole camp  everyone went to Czestochowa (?) (
And I tell you one thing  in concentr ation camp I never think people the prisoner was very friendly each other and never  never I sa w or (?)
And the one othe r uncle of mine  my mothers elder brother  half elder brother  whose name is Moise Leib was in a totally different camp  also coming from Balti  but they were driven  chased to another camp  and he died in Obadovka  this was the name of the camp.
One man was  I had taken care of and he was going to the DP camp.
In '41  in the beginning I think of '41  they came at night and they took my older brother away for work in a work camp.
And like I said  my brother give us a lot of information  what happen to the camp.
Then we went to Birkenau   which is the Auschwitz number two camp  and I showed them the crematorias.
And...uh...I remember that we went to...we were in a camp  a big camp that was guarded by the Swedish soldiers  and we could go freely.
Commenting on the pictures ) This was inside of one of the three barracks that I first saw and explained when I came into the camp.
I was allowe d to pick out a watch from the storehouse in the camp where they had items sorted by watche s  rings  pearls  jewelry  teeth gold teeth  and I picked out a little silver watch.
And the stories trickling out of the concentration camp -- not -- I me -- the ghettos  actually  because that wasnt then  were trickling down to central Europe and he beli -- ga -- he began to be lieve them and he discuss it with his siblings  and everybody laughed at him.
Well  what was the what what was the did they know by that point in the second camp  did they know that you were German?
In Lublin  on the outskirts of Lublin is Majdanek  and that's where my unit was stationed  in Majdanek.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 3 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: EL: I was in Kovno.
I was in Plaszow  I was in Plaszow  and we walked from Plaszow to Kabelwerk from Plaszow  and then they concentrated us in Kabelwerk for a short time.
But  anyway  she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living in  just north of Munich and the sister has a young daughter  I don't know  seven  eight  nine  10.
You kno w to – to get a sample  each rail road car had to be in the right – right assemble in the front of the car; and then they were marching them off right t o the camp through the gates.
But nobody would expect me whatsoever  I was such a quiet guy in camp  fixing everything in there.
Beside that  there was no other camp which was strictly Jewish people.
How did you maintain a courtship  though  in that situation like that  in the camp?
Do you recall anyone do you recall anybody visiting your training camp?
No  I never -- never run into anybody bi -- in the camps  because it was a small camp.
I wanted to escape from the labor camp to join my brother Jechiel  who at the time lived in Lvov  no more than about 100 km south from our camp.
Like once there was a Dachdeck-Kommando   which means a roof Kommando 33  and you had a chance to put a roof on the kitchen  work near the kitchen  so a piece of bread  little potatoes  or gone to the women's camp where you work in the women's camp  you know  and then there were girls  the hired girls  that had the little position like  ﬁHere boy  here is piece of bread ﬂ like playing little  little flirtation.
Interview with Sol Mackler December 28  2009 88 I took him I took him in to the cou to the concentration camp with the belt How old was he at the time?
And they took us with the rest of the men and women and they sent us to a camp.
Because there's not a day that does not go by that we don't think of camp or of death.
Lany was like we have here in the United States   Camp David .
So now I would like to tell  I have first been in the ghetto in resjur  then I was in the brick factory in mishkoltz  we were taken to Auschwitz  I was in the Birkenau lager  and the camp was named B3 which one was meant a camp of elimination.
In the audience were the Jews from Schwandorf  from Straubing  a few Jewi sh GIs  and Schwartz arranged a program which included music by the first musical group in the area  from Camp Deggendorf.
So when he when the identification list was made  he recognized that some of these people had been in this camp with him?
And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the camp and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up.
In -- In -- In the DP camp  there were Jewish doctors  but in the -- when I was learning  there were some Jewish  but majority were German doctors  but we didnt have any choice  we had to do it  if I wanted to -- to learn something.
We were living in this kind of bunk beds  three at a time.
NICK WHITE: Well  as I remember  they was  there was thousands of them just aimlessly walking around the camp.
My uncle knew a little bit that Stochland so he always begged him; written in camp  was like a Jewish shtetl lets say.
It doesnt sound like it was that much better than the camp.
So  when I got the suitcase  when they evacuate the all the city  so I they made a they new people came to the camp  and then I looked and my my two cousins So thats how you kne w about what was going on.
So  we had ups and downs in the camp  you know?
I never ordered to build up a concentration camp  but if I now look back what we have done  and my own diary is a witness against me.
He was worrying so much about that uh family of his  so that Kuczbara-who...you know  who knew almost everybody  uh...especially in in uh...in the area of...in the hospital area.... Because he also was a dentist--although he told me he never was a dentist--but he was pulling the teeth in...he  he he was acting as a dentist in...in the camp.
And I came not very often but once  two times a week  but in connection with a German and Polish administration of the camp.
Wh en you went to concentration camp to Funfteichen  you went a uniform.
I think maybe in '33 or ' 34  I may still have been in a mixed camp  but after that  such camps simply didn't exist a nymore.
You know  it comes to my mind  you probably know of this writer-doctor who wrote this book and this person there in camp had a nightmare and he told them not to wake him because a nightmare can't be as bad as the reality  you know  so  and I enjoyed so much closeness to my father so I was glad when he was able to come to Montreal  they couldn't come to America because immigration laws  but could come to Canada and at age 58 he got his state board and opened his office there in Montreal and was very successful and just as much liked as ever and lived until age 81.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: What kind of work did you do in the work camp?
SL: And the thing is  when I was ta -- I was looking -- I was looking out from the -- from the -- from the concentration camp and th ere was a ba -- there was woods there  uh?
Anyway I worked there until January of '45  and one day I went to the camp to change clothes  I went to the public rest room.
Well  they roughly told me what had happene d to them when they were in hiding  and how they had been -- how they were picked up  and they -- they went into this camp in Holland  in this concentration camp  and they had a chance to -- my mother absolutely refused to let herself be shipped out until she [indecipherable] forced to ship out.
So  in that concentration camp  did not mean as much as the word implies.
They did when they were closing the camps  because our camp was in the city What was the Bradenburg was in Salzburg but in the city.
All the debris strewn around on the streets  left over by the Germans  uh  the people at camp told me when I spoke to them about cleaning it up  they said  why should we  we didn't leave it.
And we went to that camp  we been so happy  my goodness  we have food  and you know  if somebodys sick  we have medicine  because you know  the they took care of us  the English government.
And uh we were in barracks  and oh there's a bed here and a bed here   all the way through  and we to sleep.
And  but the other dream that is more frequent than a ny dream about the concentration camp  is about the people hanging themselves.
And moving to the labor camp  the death train and then to Auschwitz and then the Death March and liberation.
The answer  one of the Germans that was in the camp he said you come down and you do it because the Americans were there then.
But it was a German officer that declared that we were not political prisoners  that we were prisoners of war and belonged in a POW camp.
And on this train we went  and I believe we went to a summer camp in the Creuse.
And the whole camp had to stay for 24 hours  til those five women died hanging.
You know a lot of people came from all kind liber ation camps and they put them in..in that camp.
And I was in the concentration camp for at least a month.
And we were left in a camp with Russians  Poles  Eastern Europeans of various descriptions  and at a later stage  those who wanted to go west  particularly the Poles could elect to do so  or if they wanted to return to their own country.
Laughter] >> Suzy Snyder: How was your mother in the camp?
The other political prisoners  in the other part of the camp?
And the...the...the whole camp was actually a state in itself  because the SS had their jurisdiction.
I gave him those earrings and he put them away because and then we worked and we went in the evenings we went to the camp.
So  in the camp  it doesnt matter if one person gets more from one thing and less from something else  so he kept me for two or three weeks in the sick bay  until was able -- until I was recovering and could back -- go back to work.
Well  I think  in terms of camp administrations  I imagine there was quite a disparity of manner  quality  interests  humanity; and adressed it very much with the individual commander how those things were done.
In concentration camp  which again I knew nothing about at all.
She and my grandfather met in a displaced person's camp after the war in Austri Oh my God  that is a story too.
AG] Well  I joined up with another column  and just marched [DL] And the other column  was that made up of other prisoners of war  or was the concentration camp victims... [AG] No  there was no concentration camps that I knew moved out  these were all prisoners [DL] And how were you treated during the course of your march? [
I have pictures also  I have photos from th e camp  which is unusual  a lot of people dont  of course  you know  yeah  but I was in the camp there with the commander  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 56with the sergeant and the whole thing  the whole group of people.
And I could see the camp  uh  which wasn't very far from us.
These were my people that gave their lives and this was written in my concentration camp  this book.
We as Canada people could go on any camp we wanted.
But what was--were you in a DP--or what was the name of the kibbutz or the DP camp?
We coul dnt explain to them we dont have death certificates  they died in a camp.
So  they were reaching out to different camps to let the people know what is happening and not to give in and if you have any way of survival  I mean  any way of escaping from camp  that this is something that you should do  and theres no doubt in my mind that there were people who knew what was going on because even the group from Krakow that I knew Vushka Liebeskind and her husband was one of those people that were involved with the underground activities and their main job was sending out messenger to still existing Jewish communities  whether it was in camps or in forced labor camps or even in Auschwitz  they were trying to make contact with those people and tell them to try to escape because this is the only way  and they were very instrumental in even sending false documents if you provided for them a photograph  they send a document for you.
Rheinfelden was a Swiss army camp  I think  not far from Bazen   where -- thats where we arrived in Switzerland.
That means they...they brought in people for further transport to Auschwitz.
I dont know whether the camp administration would buy them  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 54 or this was donated or whatever.
The school became a a separate island  where we had a dicono dichotomy where we shared both what we needed to share  su ch as you know  what you needed to talk about  you know  the great communist camp  and the [indecipherable] the imperialist camp and all this phraseology  which we had to also say  but then we talked about what was the Voice of America saying  you know?
So he said  the the leader from the camp  Burameister says [indecipherable] [phone ringing] We can stop  just for a second.
Later on we followed him and we saw him in the camp.
She said  yes  they took a little bit stronger women to another camp and she's right now in a little shelter in this-and-this small village near the border of Poland and Germany.
A. Well  we was  to an extent  we were quite scared because every camp we stopped  they didn't want us.
But if they didnt report  they -- all the youth  18 -- between 18 and 22  they would be fetched -- they would be taken by the police  would -- could be shot or put in a concentration camp.
>> Bill Benson: Irene  somehow you were able to survive that and you and your sister and ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 your aunts would end up at another camp  Neustadt -Glewe.
The only nice thing in this camp was that there were German war prisoners and other British were walking outside.
Yeah  I had been -- they took us from the camp in Germany  took us across the border to Denmark  put us in this camp down there just over the border.
The arrangement was that about three miles up the road from the camp  the concentration camp  there was a big German Army establishment which  of course   was empty and -- but it had big concrete buildings  you know  barracks and so on.
There were friends of mi ne amongst them and then we found out that 14 especially those men who had been taken into custody in Berlin had been shipped to the concentration camp of Saxonhausen-Orianenburg wh ich was the uh big camp in the north of Berlin.
After they murdered everybody  they dismantled the camp there should be no trace  except the three graves who remained down there for the people  where they killed off all the people.
Only the people that got married there in the camp after a while had children.
My uncle told me that my father was desperate in that camp.
Immediately  immediat ely in 1942  in April [indecipherable] and my brother was one of the first transport to an to a concentration camp.
And the reason we were leaving so hurr iedly was that morning we had received a notice from the Nazis to report to camp.
Maybe it would be better to stay in Vienna and they should put us in a -- in a camp  you know  for refugees  refugee camp.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 And she explained the situation.
And so even in that transit camp already  they must have lived under ve ry miserable circumstances.
This was definitely one of the worst times I passed in Germany when I was shipped out from that camp to get the barbed wire out of the west coast of Germany to the east coast.
We kept kosher at camp and we -- we cooked on -- we didnt have any of the equipments that you have today  we really roughed it out.
Then one day they took away their parents  and they said co -- and they took them to Trieste  to the only concentration camp that th-the Germans made in Trieste  the famous rice factory  you know  the risia -- Risiera where they -- well  they di -- I dont know wha-what they did to them  th ey burned them or the wa -- I had -- I had no idea what -- what was going on.
We asked ﬁarent we getting all off from the train?ﬂ The German soldiers said ﬁno no no  we are not yet in the place where your 16 working camp is  its taking a little bit longer.ﬂ Before they really closed the door they asked that  ﬁif you still have on you any jewelry please give it now  you will get it back but because we are going over a border its not good  it might get lostﬂ all kind of stories.
So she doesnt really know how he got to the labor camp.
It was kind of a temporary camp in outside of of the town town of Colmar where we were kept for a week.
Gostchok could get them quieted down enough to understand what they were talking about  he found out that there was a concentration camp out the road  ten or twelve  six or eight miles out  I don't know how far they were from it.
These tailors came back into the camp and organized an escape.
And eventually we got these young German prisoners of war to help us as ward men.
So  when we left the camp  we had to go somepl ace  because we were under the quota and Yugoslav quota was not very large  like maybe si x a year or something.
But in the beginning the -- all people  pole -- Polish people  doesnt matter what religion  what -- what viewpoint  has to go to the concentration camp.
Anyhow  Christian does not know  did not why she was caught  she was picked up in the street  and uh  she didn't know why she was in camp  and she came from France  so we spoke French always  and she was very um  she was helpless  and I was the strong one  supposed to be (laughs)  so I took care of Christian as much as I could  I watched over her.
But I remember they had kapos  which was a leader of the camp  and he said that he needs electricity for his bunk.
If you were surrounded by German SS  you had a fairly good chance to get back to work -- back to the camp in the evening.
The camp is  to go back  as you probably know but in  back in 33  it was German Protestants originally.
I was working in a...in Skarzysko  in a camp in a...in a machinery.
About how many people were in the camp  do you think?
And we stayed there a few days you know  til they took us working out the camp.
Well  I was just saying I think that Betty  Sa mmys wife  came out of the concentration camp alive.
My brothers  who would go and hang around there  to see those German prisoners there in the camp  and theyre looking through the gates  and one day they came  and there were no longer English USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 36 soldiers there  they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve.
And and so we been so happy  we coming home  you know  to that camp  and oh  we are going tomorrow  and we going have everything.
So we went to a Russian fellow  and officer  we told him we want the wagon to go away from the camp.
Okay  so tell me about how you le arned that you could leave the camp.
And we line up  so they took us out from the train.
So  they told them that they are from camp escapees and so on.
And then there was this large Schlacktenza camp  where the director was Harold Fishbein  a brother of the famous Morris Fishbein  of the American Medical Association.
He insisted on staying be though he had an opportunity to leave  until they finally arrested him  put him in a concentration camp  and because he had a visa or permit to leave Germany   he was eventually let go.
They didn't have any medications or...or bandages so what you have  but they were Jewish doctors  but they make themselves now all of a sudden that the word was out that the camps are going to be liquidated and they're gonna got to a different camps  they would not ha ve the position of a physician...as a doctor like they had in this camp  and they would be for ced to go out to work.
Were men and women essentially doing the same type of work in the camp?
I forgot the name right now  its a very famous camp  but I forgot the name.
They just They were The tanks and the soldiers they just ran out and closed the camp until they brought in the Red Cross or whatever.
But before  when we been taken in...in the camp  in these camps where there are concentrated uh people  they took away half our belongings.
One was called Gabruder Robeson and Gabruder Heft  but thats not important  and my brother  by the way  was taken in 1938 from that particular st ore to the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen in 38.
So one day they came  and they volun...and they said  \ There is a new camp opening up.
So we came there to Auschwitz -- What happened when the train stopped?
And the first camp that I went to was in Bamburg  Germany.
Because I -- what medication -- either it was in the food or then it was in the injection that they gave in the concentration camp for cleanliness  that they shouldn't appear in the woman.
An d you would be able to go away for about two weeks to a Fresh Air Camp to kind of be physically rehabilitated  ge t good food  get fresh air so that we'd stay healthy.
And they have Memorial there  too  to the 500 Dutch Jews who were either taken to Auschwitz from that little town or those who died in the conce ntration camp in Westerbork and there is my aunt and my uncle and my  and her  and its my  my cousins sister and her parents.
And so he grabbed me by my hand  pulled me out and the -- the area -- the camp was wired all around with  I think  electric wires  if Im not mistaken.
My father would di -- would -- became a -- I have a letter he re that states in detail that my father was last -- hed seen -- deported from Gurs  they liquidated that camp as -- that I had described as a hellhole because it -- you walked in mud.
It -- it may have been  but sometimes they said this camp is at an end  you gotta go elsewhere.
Did you take any photographs when you were inside of the camp?
And then got an assignment to go to England to be overseas into a intelligence replacement camp in Broadway in Worcestershire.
How did you come up  or why did you come up with the idea of making a model of ow -- of the womens camp?
But first job was again because I was enlisted as one of the camp commanders  a command in the recruiting camp  introduce newcomers with various language problems.
So there were three main camps that Gorbachev beside the first camp that the Germans discovered.
And it was a big camp that was built up for that purpose and there is 90 days tough training.
I came across German guards in Sudeten Deutschland  in Kalfaser  when I was in this camp.
And they began ringing the  the camp bell to say that we were free.
When I went out to see people  I got plenty there what they be en with me concentration camp.
I remember that camp because I remember seeing my father working as a lumberjack.
He gave me a little bit  but what I asked him then  most of the time when I went to him  I asked him  \ Can you get this person and this person \  I've got a few names of people from the Jewish congregation who were in 10 concentration camp  \ I want this person to get out   can you get him out  will you let him out?\
Well  that was a very poorly prepared camp  and Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 87 so he was in Saint Nicolas   this was June  end of June.
The first impression was  was not exactly summer camp and a bet -- but better than pris on  because you did not sleep  17 of you  in a two person cell  as I did in a prison before  during my interrogation and after my sentence.
My father everybody thought at til now that he was died in a concentration camp.
They took out the clothes from us  we have to leave the clothe s. And we went for a shower  they give us a shower  you know.
When I came out of the concentration camp  I had to report to the Gestapo.
So that they had different -- incidentally  Eisenhower dictated an order that every person in Weimar would be taken to the camp to see what the Germans had done there because they denied that they knew anything about it.
When we came back from the camp  she told us that she heard that he had been killed.
So we came there to Auschwitz -- What happened when the train stopped?
Its hard work but then the camp commandant a nd the doctor took all the teenagers and sent us to the trade shops and I end up in a cabinet shop.
No toothbrushes  no nothing because -- So anything you had taken with you from the old camp you no longer had?
and what I was laughing  the people told me that in the camp  no?
And this went on and on to the end in Auschwitz.
The man was in a transition camp from the war  from Berlin  he was the head of the transition camp.
And uh  so we were also digging up unexploded bombs which  and  and this I did tw ice during my concentration camp career  uh  which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far away in case something exploded.
So he returned apparently to Poland  and somebody mentioned that they saw him in the Warsaw ghetto.
From America she couldnt rema in because she arrived in America with a girlfri end who helped her a great deal in camp.
They put us in the prisoner - camp  military camp  with soldiers who walk prisoners.
He was in a camp  what they call a concentration camp  in Miranda.
And as we marche d to Schindler's camp  what we assumed will be Schindler's camp  we marched by fives  and I wa s walking  among other friends with a girl who came originally from Germany but she was deporte d from Germany to Poland and in Poland to camp in Plashow  and with us to Birkenau and to Schindler's camp.
But the -- and the ones who were -- the survivors were getting out of the camp.
The other thing which  in which we took great pride and joy was that when the bombing raids came  the  the German officers' families and influential Germans would hide in the camp from the bombing attack.
I say after all  going to a labor camp still leaves -- th ere is room for hope. (
You know also  the day when we got married  yes  I forgot to mention  he got a telegram that his sister survived from a concentration camp and she lives in Italy.
You were 13 when you were -- you were in a concentration camp when you turned 13  right?
So  we went to the American auth ority again to establish the refugee camp.
DL] And the cottage was within the perimeter of– [RJ] It was within in the perimeter of the erm–they encircled a village [DL] So it was within the perimeter of the Auschwitz camp [RJ] It was inside the perimeter of the electric fence [DL] And how did Master Beaver who was a civilian engineer  from what youre saying there he seems to have treated you quite reasonably [RJ] Yes he treated us very fair [DL] And how did he treat–. [RJ] We had no problem with him at all.
Had their been any Americans liberated from that camp  to your knowledge?
After checking what could I have been  if I had  unde r normal circumstance  not in a concentration camp  not having to go in the army to make a living  and to -- what could I have been today?
Below it is the place next to it  which was reserved for my grandfather -- for my grandmother  and its empty  and it will always be empty  because she hasnt got a grave  she was murdered in -- in Lodz  in a concentration camp.
They always said wed be relocating in a work camp or whatever.
Was ka I had no idea that Ill never get out of a camp  but I mean  it was a slave labor camp and you well  there was no way of [indecipherable] if we were but thats early on.
So they put us on the side of the mountain outside the camp.
And you know  the Jewish people whove been in camp  most of them were  what we call here blue-collar  simple people.
After we finished a day's work at Canada Kommando  you just couldn't go home  back to the camp  without being searched  first at the work site - lined up  stripped naked in most cases.
They said we couldn't go back any more to Budapest  and I was in the camp and from then on...that was...let's see...from '42 to '44  but uh we you know  we were moved from that area to another area which was near the Romanian border.
Because they stayed in a building just sout h of the village  maybe a few hundred feet south from there  which was supposed to be a camp fo r Chantiers de jeunesse.
We fi nished in concentration camp because I saw when they burned my--my parents  my brother.
Well  I was sent to Camp Croft  South Carolina  which was the infantry training center.
Did you come in contact uh  with refugees during this period?
Did so you were and there was no other selection while you were there at Auschwitz  you just they just took you to this work camp Oh yeah.
So I we nt to a camp  I -- a-at that time I -- I told you  I took somebodys shoes.
Had you dreamt -- do you remember dreams during this time?
So you could in one way it was very easy to get in and out of the camp  another way you never knew when they were gonna crack down and make it more difficult.
In Germany  they would have take...be taken immediately to concentration camp.
And then  one time  there was a Polish uprising in Warsaw  not Jewish  Polish uprising  and they caught all the people - Polish girls to - that they caught  that they thought that took part in this uprising  maybe men  too  but th ey came to Auschwitz  and they were Polish people  so they didnt go to crematorium and they didnt go to a barrack where they send them to hard labor  and what they did - wh atever they brought with them  the suitcases and everything  every piece of clothes had to be recorded  and when they - and they had red triangles - and when they finished their sentence  because they were not convicted for life or taken to camp like that  but when they finished the verdict fo r two months  half a year  a year  they were getting the clothes washed and ironed  and they went home.
I was in a DP camp for quite awhile and then I chose to go back home to my hometown  hoping that possibly my brothers or someone that had survived  had come back home and that we could reunite.
I -- The only thing I know  that we went into a prisoner of war camp.
And they start putting wires around us and they said they are making a camp.
So  afterwards  we were sold as I said to another camp  and this camp of course belonged to Gross Rosen.
Because we just kept on going until we hit the concentration camp.
So these were the two instances in the camp that I vividly remember  and how they ca ein schoner Mathilda.
And tried to tell them  they knew nothing until they hit the first concentration camp.
It was large  and most  most of the Christians  they thought I'm coming from the home from the prisoners of war camp or something.
About how many people  do you know  were in the camp when when you Close to 30 000.
So there I was at night time  in the daytime I was running around in the camp.

We did not have contact with them  but sometimes we walked on the way back to camp into the train we walked past prisoner of war camps and sometimes they would feel sorry for us and throw some food in between us to be picked up.
running all over in in in He was in a forced labor camp  which quite a few Jewish men were.
She was in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0028 42 camp of Bergen-Belsen  and sister the -- we call her Sister Hela  the one I spoke about before  the nurse  sister.
One thing I have to say that being that I knew English  I was [indecipherable] and hired by the United Nations to help the administration [inde cipherable] living constantly in the camp.
They brought her back and they put us all in an   a counting and they put us all in the middle of the camp  and they put her to be hanged.
I don't know if it kept it down enough  but after about 2 weeks I started to get better and started to come to myself...uh...and...uh... then I...I had to get up and...uh...be in a camp and ge t rid of the dead people and  you know  and...uh...clean the floor  attend to the sick people  whatever could be attended  you know  make them comfortable.
And then again was \ Aktion;\ 2 \ Aktion\  -- that called when they took the people to concentration camp.
But they must have been drunk because they were yelling  yelling  yelling  7 Amon Goeth (1908-46)  SS Officer  commande d the concentration camp at Plaszow from February 1943 to September 1944.
And were -- were your barracks in a big building  or -- what was the set-up of it?
He did tell me about Dachau that when the Amer icans were nearing Dachau that the Germans decided to vacate the camp  and they decided to ma rch them east.
So while the soldiers used to come to camp be from the MP and the others  and American boys  soldiers that had cameras  they were very curious about us.
I mean she didn't exactly hear the performance  you know  and and we would sing songs in which we would say  you know  would make probably sound like a summer camp there you know for her ears and and then we would throw in a few things in Polish  you know  which were exactly not meant for her ears  but but by and large uh that part in contrast of uh...of course you know we were fortunate  quote  unquote  that 18 we were taken early yet  you know  before Auschwitz was in its full aspect of the...because after that people didn't go to working camps anymore.
But what did harm me  they arrested 30 000 Jews all over Germany  eeny -meeny -miny -mo  off to a concentration camp.
Those books then became the basic evidence for what had happened in the camp and who was there.
And when they said  I was born in Bergen-Belsen  people said  oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp?
>> David Bayer: Well  there used to be a big military camp the Germans had called ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 Foehrenwald.
There was a one night the guards and the SS left the concentration camp and we was free.
Did you have a chance to walk around the camp at all  or -- did you go up to Mauthausen  the main camp  or -- I never got up there and you had to have -- you had to know somebody to get up there  because that was off limits as far as I know.
I dont really know because it was the first re al concentration camp that I had been to.
So  I think the grow grownup s might have thought  well  its probably safer to survive in a ca la bor camp.
And each time later with Nazis entering in the same way and going through the selections  right and left  and being beaten up  and being taken to Slonim to jail  and then winding up in a work labor camp until the partisans freed us.
Not a complete concentration camp  which actually it is recognized as because it has fence.
So   at the particular time I was in camp  I believed in  but when I came out of the camp and I knew the -- the exorbant amount of people who perished in the Holocaust  six million people and what they did -- accomplished by -- by destroying the Jewish people  I sort of had my -- my second thought about it.
And so we marched until late at night  and we came to an already abandoned camp  evacuated -- another evacuated labor camp.
So you were not in a DP camp or any Well Bad Reichenhall had also had a D P camp so we were in the DP camp for a few months.
But if you want -- if a interviewers [indecipherable] na -- ca -- talk about the camp.
And also  his father and his brother were in my camp.
When you were in the DP camp  were there any demonstrations for the partition of Palestine and and the state of Israel?
And then we wound up going to a third camp called Wasseralfingen.
I-I know that in Israel people meet  and if they were in the camp.
They were not locked up like in the concentration camp  locked up under electric barb wire and so on   constantly under guard.
She was a very  very skinny  little girl  so I said she cannot survive the camp.
Well from there which was a huge camp we was moved out to Auschwitz. [
And we were able to prove that Hajda was there because of a group of docum ents from the successor unit of the Trawniki training camp  the Battalion Streibel.
I realized when I came first day in prison camp that people with some kind of know-how ha ve more of a chance to survive.
We all though t that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come back.. But the whole thing was to trick us in  to trick us in.
And so the people that had this kind of experience  their chances of survival was a little bit less than the ones that  that I had a dream for example  and I dream about my grandchildren  I will sit at the table and I will eat the same food I ate in concentration camp or in ghetto  which is uh potato peels  that they used to give you in ghetto if you had swollen feet  this supposed  this was your medicine  there was not a medicine  you know.
And this was going on for the time we were in the little ghetto.
The barracks themselves that the that the uh  that the uh  uh  camp or where these people were housed were large uh ...I don't recall whether they were brick or wood buildings...but uh  filthy  uh  dirty  and it was just...the entire the entire uh  experience was something that even though we had seen uh  some of the things such as the slave labor camps out on the farms  where the people weren't treated quite as bad...uh  this was...we just never even conceived of this type of thing happening.
Since we were doing it in our camp  I went to help the people with typhus over there.
And that he would create again a concentration camp and it would be desirable for anyone from the Krakow Plaszow camp to get to Oskar Schindler.
And -- but I was told  and my brother  the family -- those years in Feldafing and in the other camps  a lot of them you cou -- you were free to go out and you come in in the camp .
There was some mattresses on the floor and we stay over nigh t and this is very interesting because all documents in a concentration camp and on the Gestapo  all documents from the foreigners was destroyed  but Salzburg  that jail for some reason I don't understand even when you go today  when you call up  they keep that record and says Julian Noga stay over night here in a on the way to concentration camp to Flossenberg  and this is the only evidence there in Austria where is I was sent to concentration camp Flossenberg.
>> Peter Gorog: I have with me one of the many postcards my father sent from the forced labor camp.
You see  in the camp  you co uld have gotten any clothing you want to  the Germans didnt care  because in the end they will get it anyways.
And you were first registered by who registered you an into the camp?
And he got in the in the Russian prison camp  he was no more first of all  he came half dead home  after a lot of years  he never was a communist again.
That was home so ever ybody went -- almost everybody went back to camp and plundered the supplies and had a party and celebrated freedom.
And then he comes there  she greets him  and then he takes a look at the child  and he sees the child s-so much close -- in close look at him  he looks like the commander of that camp from which he escapes.
Yes  which was a camp  and out-  a sub-cam p of Neuengamme  and from there they moved us to Sasel  to build temporary housing for the Germans for the bombed out Germans  and from there to Bergen-Belsen.
Next day  she was taken out of the camp  and she didn't come back.
My mother met my father in that whole turmoil during World War II  after he was released from the prisoner of war camp  and she and Mira were released from well  they escaped actually  from the labor camp.
And from that from the camp  you from from the hospital  when you were released from the hospital  where did you go?
And of course Itzhak Klein was lucky later  he got into the fire brigade  and he was doing bette r  but he had -- the food that he could spare  or -- or got through channels  he would give to his niece who was in the -- in the womens camp in Auschwitz.
This is the p -- the p -- the passport that I got after being released from the concentration camp in order to leave Germany.
She went to the main entrance gate of the camp in the morning when the Germans were expected and as soon as she saw the head of the German group  she went over to him and yelled  \ Heil Hitler Herr Oberst.
Its very confusing as to where I was liv ing at what time beca use we did move around  but only within those three houses sort of  and my grandfather  I think  I spent the least time there  and of course  I was the youngest so that I remember that the least  and I remember the Vrancic house the best  because Vika eventually died during the war  and she died I think while my uncle was in c oncentration camp  and I remember seeing her dead  that was more scary than some of th e battles because I ran into the house and nobody told me she was dead and there she wa s. But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on  and thats  you know  I remember  thats we were set then in that house from then on.
Did Interview with Romeo Fagiolo March 1  2010 32 But what I did  after we walked  this was the other part of our division  they had to secure the re the camp.
Where did you go from...no  before we do that  what--by the time you left at the end of thirty days--what shape was the camp in?
And when the camp commandant  who was at the time  his name was Meir  and th ere was an ubershtopfuhrer   who was over this camp commandant.
At the end of the war I was in Has-felt   a prisoner of war camp in Central Germany.
It was separated by Bergen-Belsen and five different camps: camp one  camp two  camp three  camp four.
My mother was smart enough there was one Jewish school only in Holland  and my mother  thank God  was smart enough to send me to that  and I say smart enough  because all of us children had gone through the wa r  be it in concentration camp  hiding  so we became like a family.
We were at Camp Gruber for a couple weeks  and then the bombs  what was it  like August 6 th  August whatever it was.
And they said  \ Do you remember when we were back in Camp Maxey  Texas  and two orders were--when we were declared hot....\  In other words  the outfit was fit for combat  and we were now going 21 There has been no Prime Minister of Israel by this name since 1948.
But the Red Cross  they never helpe d  so in that camp  I saw deportation and I saw thought the Red Cross was absolutely not doing a nything in the camp.
And I -- in the displaced camp  in Verkshide  I made friends with them  so oh -- and I was getting looking very good.
And it's been sin ce the site of the holocaust  since being in the concentration camp  that I really became Jewish.
The la -- you had n-n-nearly every function was marked  yeah  in the camp.
Uh-huh  so you got to a DP camp after you ran away from from Czechoslovakia ?
My aunt -- my Aunt R-Rachel was married in the camp  I remember that wedding  I remember going there.
How I got from the camp back home  I don't really know.
And one of his jobs was to go from camp to camp in the American zone to look for the SS men and the guards and the commandants of the camps who were hidden among th e prisoners.
They took my wife  my sister and my mother-in-law  they took to the German  to the concentration camp  and later my sister and my wi -- my wife and my sister-in-law  they was young  they was to the mu-munition factory close to the Berlin  they was in Ravensbr uck  and from Ravensbruck they gave to the radical commander.
So there were a lot of discussions of what to do  but how long can you stay in a DP camp and how long are they going to keep you in a DP camp?
They were very hard times and when I was in concentration camp  especially during the death march  when I was really givi ng up  I really had no desire to live.
You then went to something called free wo rk and Im curious if you had any notion of what that was  or -- Yeah  when I said free work  I meant that there was no camp.
I went out there in March of 1943 to Camp Hale Colorado.
From th e hospital anyone that was in relatively in good health was taken to the...was taken to Treblinka concentration camp or as I cal l it destruction camp.
Many things I can point out to you about the concentration camp because it was a very brutal moment and depressed.
But in Altenstadt when we were herded on a train  we Refugees  displaced persons  members of the nations which fought on the Allied side in Germany  we were now being sent to a punishment camp because we refused repatriation under the communist regime.
The sirens start coming up  out  and was very foggy  all of the sudden a fog came down  and they suppose to Czechoslovakia and the Polish Underground supposed to come in  accordingly what I heard  they're supposed to come into the camp to help us out in the uprising.
And then we wondered why  and we found out that they refused to fulfill an obligation that was against their will  never knew what  what it was  but something they asked to do and they refused  about 40 of them came into camp.
And then I turned back to her  after looking back at the camp and even seeing the ropes from this distance; and I slapped her hard across the face.
She thought if she had an ID  like I have  showing she works for the Germans  that that might be useful  and that's when she applied to the German military camp to work.
Uh  we were not bothered too much while we were in th e camp.
And evidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers to jump to jump into the camp  to prevent the Germans from murdering the prisoners of war before they are liberated.
If you were not in a concentration camp youre not a survivor of a concentration camp.
My grandparents were in Theresienstadt until about the end of 1943 and then sent to Auschwitz  and my mother's little brother -- I have documentation  he also perished in Auschwitz.
If I had the dream they would pack up camp and go.
I was in the...I was sure that he must be Christian because I was sure that all the Jewish uh the Jewish young people is in the labor camp and he was out.
On the train to the camp  to Bolkhain  I met a wonderful girl  a vivid redhead  a wonderful  you know  called beautiful people  tall  wonderful girl.
And they put us I think there was a prison there Uh huh.
That was our camp  was a French  old French  French camp with actually straw mattresses still.
But within each DP camp there was a committee elected by the survivors.
Which was a camp where we had where to live  where we used to get enough food.
People could move around in Berlin and carry -- many of them just left the camp and settled in Berlin and got into businesses of various arts  legitimate businesses.
My mothers brother was put in a concentration camp in France.
It was a camp  yeah  but they did not have  like I said before  they did not have the gas chambers there.
Now we had a very interesting Christmas Eve in a concentration camp.
It was our fault that Hitler ever came to power  and that they are now have an occupied country  and they are sitting in a concentration camp.
No  no b -- I was there fo r -- for about maybe -- maybe a cou -- maybe a week  and then they took us to another camp.
And so it sounds like that transport  did anyone ever find out if that transport when to Auschwitz  or it went somewhere else?
And we didnt know so much as perhaps the other people what we think  because we lived really  a little bit for the two of us  when we were in camp.
This became a major contact for them and...uh...i n that camp was Mr. Meltzer and there were other people.
She was there with four children  a son and a daughter in that camp where my sister was in another place of work  the same camp  another two daughters.
As we sitting and goo -- discussing the reports of these ex -- the evacuation of ours -- camp  two Gorkinsens appeared.
This we know  and he went in the second camp  and he bringed Kiefer back to the k itchen.
So they closed the camp and I was sent to New Orleans to be in a port battalion as a stevedore  loading and unloading ships  army ships.
Jaffa was known as having been the worst concentration camp in all of North Africa.
The uh  I felt one way to reach the camp population was for the camp to have a newspaper.
Was the whole night running  we were about four miles away from -- from camp.
That why we were transferring friends constantly to those parts of -- of the camp where we knew they will never be exposed to the selection.
And you know  so it is and only in po in other countries  for sa helping Jew  there was concentration camp.
So I saw ev -- all the friends from camp and such  all at one time and we traveled in Israel and saw a lot and was -- but I couldnt see my life away from this life any more  you see?
My mother on the other hand went on to the con- centration camp which was too tough and that's where she was the remaining of the war  remainder of the war. (
Because I had seen the chimney and I seen the smoke.
And I don't remember how long we drove  but I guess it was quite a number of hours because when we arrived we were unloaded in another camp  and that name of the place was Retzow.
And this is what -- what the -- for seven years he was in a Russian camp and he had a prayer book that was one inches long  somepla ce hidden.
And again  transports a day  in a train a few hours  and here we arrived in Auschwitz.
But the troop  when I got to scout camp as a counselor one summer  I was sort of– I wasnt– One of my jobs was to arrange the services and many of the scout troops had ministers along with them or they were their scout masters.
Then a Jewish organization took over our camp  after the liberation of the south of France.
I don't know no thing about the men  the life in camp.
The barracks  and and they put us there  in the barracks.
Matter of fact  I was sitting with an SS man and a civilian German  and as such I was able to go to the camp because I asked.
She wrote the director of the camp and the director gave it to me.
As a matter of fact  the telephone call was about that.
But we were main thing  we were free to leave the camp.
I escaped once from the camp in Pionki and I got shot in my leg.
Dr. Gringenouse  Samuel Gringenhouse  a brilliant man  was the head of the camp committee.
Uh  the camp was  I had been working at Mauthausen and most of those prisoners now the same as in our camp had  uh--well  those who were well were walking home.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 14 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: because the inner life of the ghetto was really around by the Jewish ghetto police  rather than the Germans.
And and in camp too  there was ce rtain rumors going around that if you volunteer to go to work in Germany  you get more food  and you get better things  and a lot of people volunteered for it.
So finally I have got all the money and when we went out the camp at night  wa s the winter anyway  it was January the 21st  1944 -- so I gave him the money and the money wasnt for him.
No  there were some children in the camp that were already the children  not too many.
You know  people talk a lot about uh t-six million Jews  and I must say 12 million altogether  the Turks and Greeks and  and Poles and  and Russians  when they got into Russia when they brought them into Germany for labor and also concentration camp  and the other six million  that was non-Jewish people.
So finally we got to the camp Mauthausen  which was a very  I don't know  forbidding looking place  the whole  the walls again  they're not temporary  they were made  built from granite stone and they were like maybe two and a half meters high or three meters high and on the top of the stone fence there were strips of barb wire again  like maybe five strips and again with the insulators to let you know that they were electrified and it took the better part of a day to get processed there and again somebody came  a German prisoner and picked out the younger ones and you go  you stay over here and among those was my brother and I tried to yank him back to the group where I was and the guy spotted it and he pulled him out again.
And you coul d switch  you could go from one to the other because I dont think that they did care really  if x y z went to one camp  even that they were release  because the most of the release were not Interview with Joseph Koplewicz October 7  1993 43completed because people were dead already by this time  or that they did care which ones are going.
The ironic  more irony  that when we got out of that train  in the camp on the way to Saint-Cyprien where we stopped for one night near Agde somewhere.
So I was beaten back  beaten from the work back to the camp which was about a good kilometer.
And then when the war was coming to a close  the Germans decided to evacuate the camp.
He said  \ You are going to the city to bring some uniforms for the factories what we have in the camp.
But we who were eligible for expulsion made ourself ready to be taken by stre etcar to a railroad emplacement  and from there  in a nice  third class carriage train to Westerbork  which is on the Dutch-German border  which had a transit camp for further processing.
And of course the camp police broke it up  and the man was in the camp jail.
And mine and then the the leader from the camp  Burameister  he know him  because my uncle used to go over there to his town and sell horses.
It was a work camp  and I wr ote the .
So you were in the camp the whole time and you saw what was happening?
Clearly he's in very bad shape and ends up in a Displaced Persons Camp and makes it to the United States.
And I remember that the shower was something that was very  very important for us  becau se it separated you more or less from the dirtiness of the camp.
I -- I went to Y camp  and one summer I stayed with friends who invited me to stay with them while Mother visited my father.
They had to dig two meters deep to get the blood out of this place.
And then they told us we should go back to the camp.
Because in the camp we had the ghetto police  mainly  actually made up of Jewish people who were policing the area.
And the cousin  whose daughter went to this camp that I was sent to  had nothing to do with me  and she was two years younger than I  and at that age its like a generation.
Not the camp but the uh  the  the Registration area No  not where  where the barracks were  in a barrack  uh  two times afterwards  where what we knew by then were uh  who shall live and who shall die  and to  to two of those  there were just  the whole the whole uh barrack  every barrack  was for day  for a lot of times  you couldn't get out because something was happening in the other barr ack.
So while we were talking  my cousin came with other cousins.
Well it seems to me th at Betsy  now I don't remember whethe r we arrived in the camp and then she arrived later or she was already there.
They were set on a march  marching from Auschwitz to Brimletz and being guarded by Polish-Ukrainian convicts that were set in charge of those women to march them towards the camp  these official guards were brutal during the route to those women on the march from Auschwitz to Brimletz.
He also had friends who  he had roommates who were members of the 2030 club and so he was in the mens camp.
And the German ask the police -- polic eman  go directly to the place where I am supposed to be sent to  Germa ny f-for concentration camp or to labor camp.
The grownups said that this looks like a labor camp of some kind  a work camp  and this is not the forest in Poland.
Now then  I got...I occupied now on Camp number 1 a little hut  a little buildng with a stove of Dutch tiles.
Thats happened during the war in Poland  organize and you know  and the top was mostly the officer -- army officer who was not killed  who was not in -- in a camp  and organize  and the other thing was very good prepare  you know  thats life.
And thats -- And thats -- Im sure that comes from that stupid camp.
>> Bill Benson: How he somehow was extricated from a camp and taken  you don't know the circumstance s?
And came back to my group in  in It aly  and we ended up in a displaced persons camp in Cremona.
People from camp -- young men from camp would go into German countryside and rob and steal.
And my mother  of course  those days she was a housewife when I was first born  but of course when my father uh was drafted in the forced labor camp  she had to take over my father's business and then after the war subsequently she had a jewelry store and uh after the communists took over she went to work for the government.
And we said -- not we said  they said they would take us through the camp.
My grandparents loved my father  and this -- especially her two sisters  to the point during the Nazi time where my mothers youngest sister  as they always accused her that she couldnt keep her mouth shut  she ended up in a work camp.
101 Camp Hood  yeah  they brought them from -- fro m North Africa  with th e North Africa corps  and they were still think -- they -- they -- they still thought they were going to win the war.
Its very unusual that he wasnt taken to a concentration camp.
One summer  the first summer  I think it was the summer of 39 -- the summer of 39  my mother and father were engaged to be camp doctor and nurse and I was allowed to go along as addition.
We didn't know who was the left  who was the right  but one went to camp  one went to Auschwitz or any other.
Previously  if when I needed medication I would tell to my sergeant  you know  who was the Kommandant of this camp.
One section had been cordoned off with barbwire and I was in internment camp.
Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 92 Well  except the some of the people worked in the that baza place  they would be in touch with some Russians up there  but otherw ise  there were very few Russians that would come to the camp.
I was in a displaced persons camp or -- three good meals a day.
Can I ask you one specific question th at you made a reference earlier to that you went to summer camp as a child  was that a Zionist summer camp?
They permit them to talk to the authorities of the camp  and they presented this  that we are the volunteer.
Starve them or whatever  eh  pause  about the fourth  third or fourth day when I was in the camp  eh an SS man entered the barracks and they made everybody line-up.
And I dont remember what I wore when I left that camp.
And by that time I was one year in concentration camp  five years in Sweden  it was six years later.
And another long and dramatic testimony of a woman who n was one of the early inmates in Auschwitz-Birkenau  Ozhrenczim Druzhinikov   and also lived and what was particularly moving about it was the fact that she admits in the course of the interview that in crucial moments in her life in the camp  or after the camp  it was her Jewish girlfriends who saved her life.
When I was finished [indecipherable] an area  I had to go back to camp  and you know  be in the quarry.
She was two years old when sh e and her parents went to a concentration camp.
At the camp at Leichenstein  they buried many people who were alive.
It was like  it was -- in camp was tailor place  shoemaker place  it was for us.
She told us  look  two things  either you follow me wherever he sends me or you say you want to work  you want to be in the working camp.
We sang the Hungarian national anthem with the children and we were...my...my late brother was in the boy scouts and went out on the camp just like here in the U.S.  so we weren't...we weren't educated to..to hate Gentiles.
It was a concentration camp that the Germans built built for the Germans  and all those that did not comply with the German philosophy Politics  right  right.
So  she made sure that we lagged behind a bit  and before we had a chance to look around  she had the cape over her camp clothes and she was holleri ng ﬁGet out  and get out of my way and get out of my way.ﬂ And  she was pushing and pushing and pushing  pushing us towards the woods  the small group of women.
So  they brought the body  and when we were working outside of the camp returning to the camp  his body was supported by something  I don't know  I remember some metal object so he was sort of standing and they put a table with an inscription something like \ Hurrah  I'm back.
The camp was dismantled at the end of 1945  I think it was November  where Greece was complete liberated.
And the Polish camp was Mr. Gotst  and I was the liaison officer for the Polish camp.
She began to do but it was later after all when she came from the camp  concen tration camp  from Russian camp.
The camp was under th e control  obviously  of the Br itish Army  but they had a lot of Hungarian soldiers who we re prisoners of war as it were  who were used to work in the camp doing various jobs.
Can you tell me how long you stayed in this camp?
And I was led away  and Ilsa jumped out of -------  and she also started running  and as we came to the courtyard of the camp  there stood the director of the factory of Bo ltonheim  and uh  Ilsa literally threw herself at  at his feet  and she said  \ I want to go with my sister.\
All right  so then besides the SS  who are yelling at you and pointing to go in one direction or another  do you see this camp?
And just across if you run out from the camp  from Mauthausen   you were on the Russian side.
Apparently the the same thing  but I dont know if it was she in different camp  or this camp  I that I dont know.
Marta  because she was so early in the camp  was part of the administration clique of the Czech girls  so she had a little bit of pull.
And then to -- to Fort -- to Camp Rucker in Alabama  and naturally I was put into the kitchen.
They were people from Camp C  the worst of the camp  which the people were working working with poison ous gases  and they were dying a slow death.
And of course  you know  that constant um  uh  uh  radio broadcast  which was broadcast through the camp  which usually started with um  with a melody.
So there were many who were quite capable of still working and thinking and talking  and those who seemed to be knowledgeable and better educated  I tried to catch them immediately and have them give me a statement you know  what had happened  where they came from  describe w ho was in the camp  what the circumstances were  describing some of the torture mechanis ms which existed in some of these camps -- chains  and walls against which they shot people  and people were thrown on the wires and all that.
And so they accepted– the stretcher cases were sent from the camp to Switzerland.
When I knew they were going to liquidate  my mother was al ready...my parents and mine sisters  my sister and brothers were already in this camp.
And the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Thats the end of them  they went back to their camp  and murdered. [
And this German soldier was behind where my father and his colleagues were.
The camp too I started speaking Polish  because some of my friends were hidden.
I  I recall less abou t this even than during  than later on in the camp.
When I was in and my mother were in the prison of war camp  after the insurrection  and there was a list of people sent [indecipherable] on the Polish part of Polish army [indecipherable] get freedom to our camp.

And she thought that perhaps I should be sent there because we didn't know what lay ahead  and she thought maybe I at least I could be saved and so my family thought about it and we talked about it and then in the last minute  they decided not to  because they said  \ We'll...let's...whatever comes  let's...we want to face together \  and I didn't want to be separated and it turned out to be a very wise decision because we found out later on that all the children from this camp had been deported.
He was wounded three times and he was very much anti Hitler  and he heard -- listened to the NBC or CBS  NBC  CBS -- CBS  and my uncle told him  be careful  they're going to catc h you one of these days  you'll end up in a concentration camp.

A woman with a child -- because no children  no babies in camp -- go to gas chambers.
You mentioned there being a lack of community space at the camp.
Well  I knew quite a few young girls there my ag e  and  you know  but we knew each other from before  so it wasn't actually that we just met in the camp; we knew the fam ilies from my hometown.
Periodically  of course  I inspected the camp and would see to it that they had enough in the warehouses.
The camp had several terraced levels carved out of stone and on each level were barracks.
I don't know if it's appropriate or not  but it's to destroy the human being  and that's what this camp was all about.
Now then  shes going to go to one labor camp  and then maybe next month Bubchen  my br other would be sent to another labor camp  and my father -- we would all be separated.

We had a neighbor at Camp Shanks who explained to me at what period of time I couldnt get pregnant.

It was called the camp of Nam Phong for some reason.
We were beginning to understand there was something very wrong in this camp.
When my father arrived at camp  at the kibbutz  I was not there.
And then we just ended up in the American zone and then we were in a displaced persons camp and then it's no big deal.
So now about Grese: like I told you  she became Lagerfuhrerin in our camp.
You talked about the little -- the music from the camp.
But eventually they made it to another you know  to to a resettlement camp.
It was just a tr ansient camp and you couldn't call it home  but in terms of living conditions and friends and so forth I feel it was nice.

So  he came to our camp  and he took my sister  and he ask him to be a cashier  her  in American military camp.
I was there  I Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 47think about -- I would say at least six months  until this German well-dressed man came in  into the camp.
We did trust him and we had to change our plans  and then apparently  apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape  and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldnt go in a different way  and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the camp.
They put you into a place  they put barbed wire around it.
Ther e was a transport from Slovakia and they was  there were no  they came all to camp  none came to the selection  none came to the gas chambers.
That was a working camp and therefore I was put into this camp as a dentist.
You know  I dont know how mu ch  but one Polish officer came and we ask him whether he could go outside of that camp and br ing us some fruits.
Then there was a part of the ghetto was a place where they would bring in Jews from some other places .
NICK WHITE: The  the picture that I have shows this  on one of the piles  probably maybe a thousand bodies in this particular pile  but the thing that was the most uh hard to understand  these people were able to get hold  ahold of the camp commander  and beat him to death  and then they tossed him up on the top of these poor people who had been gassed there shortly before that.
Uh  it started  if I'm not mistaken  with the first camp in Dachau in Munich.
I felt if I can prolong it for anot her week or two weeks or a month  that would be much better for me than going into the concentration camp.
I mean  how -- did your -- di d the treatment of -- of -- They used -- they used to bring food once a day through the other Jews that was prisoners in the camp.
Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the ghetto.
People I worked with for 25  didnt even know I was in a camp.
But they were not like us  they was a a was war prisoners they were treated differently like us.
So in order to save him from labor camp when he came up  I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the Rabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...Seminary.
They -- they took two hour lunch breaks and they lived like kings and the war was over for them  they had all th e time in the world to straighten out  to -- what they -- their how -- their main job was to check civilians  who was a party member  who had to be denazified  who had to be sent away to a camp or something.
As a matter of fact  when I wrote my first letter to the United States  when the mails started to function in 49 -- 1946  I wrote to Uncle Leo and Aunt Ilinor  my life in the camp  and he used this during one of the meetings of some organization in the Shandley Hotel at that time  I remember -- I was told later on  when I came here  of what was going on.
The ultimate purpose of that camp was genocide  and that only Jews were being selected for that genocide.
When there was something wrong  she spoke to me in Yiddish  not in Russian  you know?
He was some kind of a and uh so uh uh uh they they they uh uh he had the courage to smuggle himself into our camp to find out what it was or what was  because when I talked to these people  and I said listen  uh you I'm sure will survive.
For -- a-approach the camp with me as in your -- no -- as you reme mber approaching the camp  and take me through the entire experience.
I dont know exactly  but it was more than just one camp  you know.
A. A labor camp or a prisoner camp  something like that.
And but we didnt know whats happened after this next trip to Interview with Wand a Luos Lorenc May 7  2013 39Ravensbruck   it was also no place  full concentration camp  it was no place to even to lie down.
He found out that I am already in the camp wher e she is supposed to be.
This  the camp  the DP camp was closed  and they sent us to another DP camp by the name of Fohrenwald where my son was born.
And uh what happened of course at Buchenwald  there were 15000 survi vors  over a period of the several years in the camp  which first took prisoners and uh were criminals  and then uh  various displaced persons  uh  for political reasons or others.
>> Bill Benson: You told us that generally you were pretty well -- you were well treated in Villefranche but you remember one experience of anti -Semitism when you went to a camp.
And we could not leave the camp without allowness  yes  mi leave  that means only 10 kilometers because we have some things from [indecipherable] yet  and we could exchange fo r water  for something  or for honey  yes.
Then after after a while it became a Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 47 concentration camp  and we have received the before we were under the Wehrmacht   under the military.
Meanwhile every time we left the camp  like Augsburg or Mueldorf or Waldlager  we saw the Germans trying to erase all track of the camp.
I left the camp when the camp moved from Gaza to a different place.
The reason why we know  it is her daughter who was put in a camp of children and what happened is  it's one instance where the  where a bishop or a cardinal in Lyon--I think Gerlier--t here's a Catholic  there's called a Catholic organizations  they took a number of people  dressed them as police people and came in the camp and kidnapped all the children and pl aced them with families.
and we opened the door and out poured prisoners and some of them were so looked like skeletons and one  one called to me in Yiddish and said Im one of you and Im one of you.
And  you know  this one was maybe my luck because we don't see the danger and we try to keep -- the first thing what I know  I remember when we arrived to camp after the quarantine and we went outside  we were waiting because there was a table.
01:53:15 Bergen-Belsen were...was just the opposite of a camp from Auschwitz.
He was assigned to  I think  Camp Detrick  in Frederick  Maryland.
So  I lived with them  a nd they had three teenage children  and its thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustash e making camp in our backyard  and we were there  and just pretending that we were part of this other family.
Her maiden name was   a prominent Jew in Sweden  head of the Well Jewish Congress in Sweden  who opened negations with Himler  and as a result was able to rescue Jews from Concentration Camp .
Did the Jews tell you and if so how did they let you know? [
We were in a camp where the Nazi soldiers were trained.
You see when they were hanging somebody the whole camp cannot go in the barracks until they have seen for themselves the hanging and talk around it why they get a hanging and for what and everything.
Everybody  each one had the most horrible personal story  they  they were looking for loved ones  relatives and so on  and uh  I  I would say  you're just going to have to wait until Red Cross or somebody else gets in the camp.
One night I saw women lining up in the corner of the camp  they were given a blanket and dish for food and with my smart -- you know  what do you know at 16 in a camp from the age of 13 to 16? --
Because Feldafing  which had been held up by Dean Harrison as the model camp  was severely over-crowded.
He had survived Auschwitz  and No  he was in Auschwitz   but he they send him from Auschwitz to a camp  to a labor camp.
We started getting rumors from our guys  the cooks and bakers who were going back for supp lies  that they had found a concentration camp.
Now  during these terrible years  38  I was...the first time I was called into labor camp was in 38 or the beginning in 39 11 because the big trouble really continued  which started as a said before that the doctors couldn't be doctors.
It means that in the potato field  they were working inmates of the -- of the -- of the -- of the concentration camp  under the guards of the periphery.
The bakers from our  the Jewish bakers who were still in camp made this cake of his birthday  and  and uh dec--we decide to give him also a present  so one of our friends still have his gold teeth.
It neve r had any effect on me whatever  at all  until of course I went into the concentration camp.
You see  it was impossible sometimes -- I would say to s -- theres never s -- never was an escapee from the camp.
If the most will be we go back in camp  we go back in camp.
We were also... we were going to Weimar by train and coming back to the camp by train  but be ing outside of the camp gave us an opportunity to get some extra food that traditionally the Germ ans were storing in the cellars  like potatoes and jams  and maybe a piece of bacon  which obviously helped everybody to get more nourishment than they were getting in the camp.
I don't know if all of them -- they found of them and took them back to camp and shot them.
We heard a lot of shouting going on and that's the time the Germans already came into the camp  the Nazis.
Then I didn't give it much thought of course wh en I was in the camp   as I said before  that na ture takes care of itself and I didn't menstruate since we were put in the prison in Krakow.
So  I make the story short and the camp and one night it was late in '41 I had a dream there that my mother I want to run away.
Interview with Dino Brugioni November 13  2014 68 No  they knew about Dachau because Dachau wa you know  that that was sort of built up about if you look at the photographs of Dachau   it looks more like a prison that it does a Concentration camp?
We never saw there was a concentration camp  gas chambers  but –.
So when you were in the camp office  how did you take care of the period physically?
So I got my -- I got inta -- inducted in Camp Kilmo  New Je rsey and I took my basic training in Fort Dix  New Jersey  for 16 weeks.
When we arrived in at the station closest to the camp  which was in northern Germany  in the Luneburger Heide  the doors finally opened and we were told to get out.
I remember being in camp  and my father sending me information about the victory  and all hell broke loose in camp.
Eh  my responsibilities was more or less to see that they were fed and that the camp was kept up clean.
And then I think it was towards end of 42  then we were concentrated in Plaszow  Potkish Plaszow  the concentration camp.
My parents remained in Westerbork for a few months  then they were sent on to another concentration camp on Dutch soil called Vught  in the southern part of Holland.
What the Nazis did with everybody in the camp -- and this is a long story and I don't have time.
But I knew where she lived so when I came back from the concentration camp I stopped off in Budapest and I found her.
My husband went to...uh...another camp and he brought some...uh...some kind of special medication  penicillin.
All you have to do is just think about one person who is in a concentration camp  who is alive  who follows the regime  whatever that regime was  and what they must have been thinking and what would happen to them in any given moment  at any given time.
Did you see -- for example  there was a quarry there where a lot of prisoners were f -- Yeah  when we went to work  there was a long s -- line of steps or whatever in the quarry and many mornings when wed go  na turally  to have breakfast and whatever and then go to work  the Russians or the Germans had put a whole mess of stones in front  so they had to be removed before th e nurses could walk up to get to the camp.
I did not realize that until much later  but my father actually remained in Auschwitz  amazingly for -- for over a year  before being transferred to another hellhole  Mauthausen  another work camp  death camp.
Our SS man  that lagerf uhrer  the head of our camp  he was a shrewd fellow.
And we did not come to the get we we tal we met them we found them in the camp already.
05:09:06 It was just across from the camp we were in.
Now  mind you  a lot of these people were not...caught in this camp.
And then we would leave them there  the Italians would take over  and the two people that took them would come back to the camp  and come to Zanenfeld.
There was nobody I didn't want to lie about the fact that I was in a concentration camp and came back to Hungary and then I took the Alley of Beth (sic) out.
And compared with the first ride and experience in the cattle truck going from Amst erdam to Westerbork  this was a much sadder story because we knew nothing good was expecting us  even worse than the camp in Holland  and that camp had a I'm sorry  that cattle truck had some benches in there.
And later we went in a barrack number four  and that was really a camp within a cam p  because see now  if you had three or four of one case  they kept you in different cells that you couldnt agree youll say this or that.
There was a prisoner of war camp not far from Soly and obviously the Jews were all eventually  they say eliminated and Soly was sent off to Pona ri near Vilna and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated  but none of them surviv ed.
The Czechoslovaks that were free supposedly did not have as much food arriving into their homes as we were getting into the camp.
I put it -- I was wearing a man's jacket like and I put it under -- and it was alive and I was holding with the other hand I was holding the beak of the duck and I brought the duck into the camp  to Auschwitz and I sold it for a bread  a   like she was the maid of the barrack.
I met a lot of people in   al so in that camp where we stayed right after the war when we came to Warsaw after the war wh en we stayed in this camp.
So  it was the same in the camp  but  uh  as far as we're concerned  it's none of our  beat ing and hurting and muscling us  that was the same for everybody.
There was still 16 000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp because it was in a Russian zone.
I didn't exp ect that I was brought to a death camp.
And till concentration camp terri ble  was very bad  and our camp was governed by criminals  not only SS criminals  and German criminals.
I mean we were starving in the camp  but we we re not killed in Terezin.
And he told  what three years  there are seven years camp and in fourteen days th ey were away.
I go in that camp  and I take all the teachers out and the helpers.
The people there who ran the camp realized that they could steal all the food they wanted  the -- the people who managed the camp.
And he was a heavyset man  and I remember hed come in and everybody who was in the shift -- the worst shift by the way  was night shift  because that means you were in the camp all day long.
And  and the food th at we were given  excuse me  was again  you know  like army portions and that kind of stuff  but of course much more than what we have gotten when we were in the concentration camp.
The Germans thought that there was a Polish or some underground working insi de the camp.
This is a camp for grown-ups -- Oh  th-this -- RL: -- this place. --
Nobody who had been in a concentration camp came to Germany -- I mean  came from Germany to the United States  not at that time.
It  it  the shock in itself  of being fr-  from  from this camp on to freedom  it takes  it takes a while to realize that you are free.
And she was supposed to come in in the morning to this transit camp  and say that she is my substitute  if you will.
And my best friend was at that time the Schreiberen (ph ) in this camp.
And going out meant I'd get there as fast I possibl y could  usually on a Jeep  find out which unit was going in or had just entered  and go on into the camp.
That was a...quite a shock for all of us  especially...we had the women's camp and the men's camp separate  and I understand there was much more of a shock for for young women standing in front of the SS completely stripped naked.
We didnt have to stand on Zahlappel  and sometimes we didnt eat the food for the camp  but they give us some provi sions that we could prepare a meal by ourselves.
And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up.
Because I remember a little black man coming to the house and picking up all the men to put them in a camp.
In uh...I think it was in in August  early in August  we saw from from our pla ces in the factory and the camp  we saw our first major attack by the American air force uh uh statio ned at this time in Italy  coming from Italy.
So  he left  and very shortly after the order was given to break camp.
They came into my camp  is like a person purchase  buys a building and the tenants are there.
Of the 17 people that were there  14 of them were sent immediately to a concentration camp. ?
And a tally was made for the whole camp that had to count just right  nobody missing.
Well  maybe for example  I was in hiding actually  I was in hiding two years  give or take  from 1942 til 1944  til we went to Bratislava.
Very clever  very shrewd  and s -- again  as they had no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office whatsoever  they had a hard time to help each other to get -- Polish Jewish girls had no good positions because of that.
I just- this  to me  is one of the biggest puzzlements because it was really a horrible camp.
And in October of 1945  we arrived in the displaced person camp.
The head of the camp  the Jewish head of the camp  the lageraltester he was called  was Mr. Demera who had managed to bring a five year old child  his son  into the camp and he was afraid that his son would taken...would be taken away from him and sent to the gas.
Then we were taken into barracks  into what was then Auschwitz -Birkenau.
This went on for just about a month  because we left in the last transport that went to Auschwitz.
And then I got back to the same barracks where I was before and we were all working in all kinds of different units and one unit and this and that and the next day in a different unit and some  what we considered best was working inside the camp because then we didn't have to march a long march out to the worksite and a long march back to the worksite and we could go to the barracks and get our food  and the 46 the soup at noon in the barracks  which again was folly  because the ones who worked out there were distributed by different people who were not as greedy as the block chief and was more equitably distributed.
Thr ee weeks later  I get called in by the commander from the camp.
I dont know the significance  and very logical German explanation  that a couple of weeks after  we landed in Dora   which was another concentration camp in Thuringen T-Terian   and we became completely other numbers.
All of a sudden  he says to me  \ I s ee that some...it's a big commotion in the camp.\
There was also a shelter  a bomb shelter  that we went in.
So I was 11 months I was in camp because the uprising was in October  so that was not my time.
We arrived in Dachau my regimental headquarters in the late afternoon  or afternoon and I was asked to go to the camp headquarters.
How did you get to the ghetto  what did you take with you?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 22 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: already worked outside of the ghetto.
I I should have wound up in Theresienstadt or in one of the probably in that camp  and and that only the love of my mother pleading kept me from that.
And I worked for Yugosnyder and shipped me to another camp.
And that was where they really were for the duration of the time in the in the labor camp.
We had to do everything we could to save Danes from the fate  to go to a concentration camp.
Uh  in Flossenburg  for example  they used to shot people  and we used to  they brought in Russians and also people in the camp  and they used to have wooden logs  and make a fire and burn them right outside.
And Lithuania was free at that time  so he was in the officers of whatever it called  but camp for the officers.
I [indecipherable]  I considered him always my  my example  my hero  and I was very very upset when in 1942  he was taken away and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia.
That took a long time  I cannot tell you how long it was  and then my mother wrote to the camp commander a letter  telling him that my father died in Russia.
All I have is from General Taylor  di -- ad -- written notes to accept the Lithuanian two women into the camp.
And you know  was everything come right up to this moment where Warsaw uprising start  1944  and all the people must go out from the building  German took everything out and sent to concentration camp bu -- because th is part of the -- was not -- not -- this was a -- a -- a German [indecipherable] in other words [indecipherable].
Not knowing where we go  but we were told that...uh...that train is going to go into a labor camp.
They were basically streets with barracks on each side surrounded by barbed wire  and there was Camp D and C and B  and so forth.
So  look  this is the plan  very well planned  of the situation plans of the working and this area of the concentration camp  Auschwitz I. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Yes.
Because the German starts to go away from Poland  from the camps  and come closer to Germany  over th ere  in the other camp.
So since he had the motorcycle  I says to my friend  listen can you take me to the camp.
When they came into our camp  a newcomer you could tell immediately.
Yesterday I heard a story of a child  and I dont want to mention names  who went to a camp over summer and there were -- he was put with another kid.
That's why the concentration camp had the Daskimblovia or Gulka maybe that his name.
But I left the ghetto on  on uh December  for December 43 and  and after I left it was  before I left it was already announced it is a concentration camp.
I mean everything of value  including instruments  and then all of a sudden when Wilhekm  to the very end  when  ah  the camp was changed to concentration camp in order to give us another lie  all of a sudden they want a concert and they brought the instruments back to the  yeah  this is the story.
After seeing Buchenwald  after seeing the concentration camp  did it change your attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?
I knew I was going to Europe  and from th ere we went to ŠŠ from Camp Sharp  we went back to Camp Ritchie.
was one of the same  beautiful camp  becaus e the Germans they knew from  in America  that the Germans were very bad and they gassed the people  so they showed  they took the Germans to to show them what a beautiful camp it was  and it seemed everything was nice there  but they didn't stay fore ver  they took them  it says in that book  to Auschwitz.
All of a sudden we heard voices and a bunch of women came in  of course most of them had their heads shaved and nobody was looking human in those days you know like you look at a man he got like a triangle just going down to the camp  walking skeleton.
Uh we were the first and only Jews  about two hundred and fifty of us and that camp was attached to a factory in which they manufactured the casings for bombs and therefore there was a need for lathe operators and all that stuff and it was one of those...as as the war was going on  the time was passing  conditions were getting worse and worse.
And said because if they refuse to go they would put...put into concentration camp.
And th -- when they caught them in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday  or a Thur sday  or whatever day was  they put them -- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped  and Sunday they brought them out on roll call  everybody wa s there lined up.
I saw that Warsaw was burning and we had to run away.
>> Bill Benson: Do you recall arriving there and what was it like for you to be in that infamous camp?
This camp eventually became -- was an SS labor camp became a concentration camp.
In Dachau itself  in the city of Dachau  their main street was a  uh...was a camp; military was camping right in the street  cooking  doing all kinds of things.
And that camp was leaving next morning in trains  to go who knows where - to a camp  to another camp  you know  so who knows  and who has to believe that.
A displaced persons -- That was a camp for -- displaced person camp  yeah.
You know  to a lot of people  I believe that um a concentration camp seems like a snake pit where people step on each other for survival  they stole from each other.
And  uh  this was no idle boast--my uncle  who did not have Jews found in his house  was in a camp  concentration camp for a year... Let's stop...Go ahead and come down.
01:19:14 And we are put in  uh  a local camp  into the courtyard of the Jewish community.
She said  yes  when the camp closed  I took that receipt you had given me  I went up there and they gave it to me.
Uh they had just arrived  that uh that train  and when we got there the uh there were very few guards uh in in uniform uh in within the camp.
It looked that  I spoke to some people who were in the camp for several weeks and I Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 15 There was a small DP camp  maybe 200 people.
About 2 weeks after we were in this camp  we were again lined up and marched to the railroad station.
Its a little bit ironic in a way that you found yourself loving a job that you were forced to learn in a concentration camp  but you liked it later on  yes?
The blockaltester told you will train these new prisoners in how they should mitseup  mitseup   how they should keep the discipline in the camp.
You can hear them...you can hear the shots you know  machine gun  so we're going to stay as as as long as possible in the camp  but comes about five o'clock afternoon.
I think I hate all armies  and I am absolutely antimilitaristic  and I think the notion of traini ng a human being to push a button which will result in killing a million people  or a hundred thousand people  and thinking nothing about it  is a horrendous thing to do  and incidentally that's exactly what the Germans did to the concentration camp inmates.
And she al ways used to smuggle into the camp  some of it for me  which was a great help.
It was just in the vacation and camp there  but not special.
That's when all of those patients in all of those hospitals  including one where I've been translating diaries  were sent to Westerbork  to this concentration camp on Dutch soil.
And in 1943  spring of 1943  a typhus epidemic broke out in the camp  and people got very  very sick  and they lost a lot of people.
And when I read there some stories  what I thought I went through bad  then I said  I was in the luxurious Interview with Morris Rosen August 5  1999 64hotel  not in the camp.
It was an old...it was a new...uh...army camp  but it was empty.
In our room in the camp which was the outskirts I mean the outer-lager of Buchenwald we had this little lady  the rabbi's wife  she kept on her head a turban constantly.
And they were in line to go  they were put in the concentration camp  in the chamber  the gas chamber.

I was taken to a...what was a labor camp originally in Graben  near Striegau [ NB: Subcamp of Gross Rosen].
And we were taken to an assembly camp in Berlin  which used to be a Jewish old peoples home.
I can remember passing a label with Auschwitz on  and of course we never knew what it was  never knew what was happening  and just after Auschwitz  we stopped  and we got out  the  this was about midnight  and we marched down to a brand new camp  hutted camp.
But otherwise -- So you're saying that the camp was run really by the Jews?
So all the people have to march away from the camp.
They arrived there  and in the -- this of course  famous separation  the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor camp  was because of his height.
Anyway the Russians were advancing and the Germans decided to evacuate most of their key machinery in the factory as well as us  those four or five hundred Jewish prisoners who were in the camp who by that time were considered kind of specialists or important people.
They had a concentration camp  but they were the fighting troops.
I remember looking out the barracks where Schindler was ordered to appear to some authorities  outside of the camp obviously  to some authorities in Prague or outside of Prague.
So  since they didnt have any pl ace  they put us for a while in the Gypsy camp.
After a voyage of 3 or 4 days on the big boat  on the big...uh..boat  we were taken with barrages to a different concentration camp.

Of course  you know  Heinrich Himmler lied and three months later the concentration camp in Vught was emptied of all prisoners and they were all sent to Auschwitz.
Can you -- besides that the couple vignettes that you told me about the camp life  is there anything else that sticks out in your mind -- any other people that you can recall  you know  distinctly or relationships that you might have had or things that impressed you?
We only knew  the only thing we knew we were in a camp and what's going to happen to us next we didn't know.

He would bring us and he would buy stuff and bring it to the factory and he would send it through people who worked in the factory  so that -- in the Shellneetsa camp and even in the Mioufka camp  we still lived on stuff and money that they would -- they w ould send in the money or some bread or whatever.
I noticed in some of the reference books  when I looked up the Attendorn labor camp that it said it was in the British zone  but this was the American army.
One day in the concentration camp  someone told me that they saw my older brother Burachal??
As a matter of fact  I went back to Germany la st summer  and I went back to Chemnitz  and I stood where that camp was  and I recognized the ra ilroad tracks.
And when he came back  I was at the time teaching at camp.
But at that moment when I was there  the Russian soldiers were there  prisoner  also sneaked out and we went to the forest.
This hospital  by the way  in the camp was only for desperately ill people and not the people who were suffering from dysentery and dying from dysentery in the blocks in the beginning when we were in Gurs.
They -- I mean  if that would have been -- in the mens camp  in Auschwitz  it was different.
and they look like old babushka   you know and thank God that she did it because when this group was going to Pruszkow   there is one place where is from Pruszkow   people were taken to concentration camp.
And in many cases  ours like hiding in the forest  hiding and hiding was much worse than...than...than a camp  than a concentration camp.
And they said  ﬁWho would like to stay in Austria?ﬂ And I saw those beautiful mountains  and that b eautiful scenery  and like I told you  at the Russian camp I was boar hunting  and I was riding  and I loved sports.
And he said  you know  the trucks would go by  we didnt know that there was a camp there  there were thi -- they were doing this.
In 1944  you and your family -- your immediate family were put on a transport from the work camp in Starahovichen  its in Poland?
He took 50 of us out of the barrack  and he took us into a ne arby camp which was part of Auschwitz  Buna -Monowitz  a subcamp of Auschwitz.
So we got to this camp in Pilsen and before long we are shipped across the border.
It was all no punishment there  it was just a concentration camp in the bu ild-up.
And this was a very small camp  it was a sub-camp of Mauthausen  about 2000 prisoners  maybe a hundred guards and a small squad of guards with canines  about 15 of them.
01:34:54 So my brother was in a camp and we got ....uh...mail from him at...uh...14 days intervals or later or something like that.
The fact that we were hope that maybe they'll put us in a camp in Turkey  this disappeared very quickly.
You say the am you know  I want to go back to when the Americans came in the camp.
So how much -- how long a walk was it from the camp to the village?
This is a working camp and I will not go free.
One individual said  yeah  the last time I saw him was about a month ago ; he was in good health and chances are he was shipped to another camp.
Until in the fall of 1940  they came  they established a very notorious camp near us named Pruszkow  and Pruszkow was an SS camp.
But I -- I was alone with the German woman  and I cant remember the ci rcumstances  and Im just hoping -- I dont think it was at ca -- you see  I spent a lot of time in th e camp of Kownitz  but Im sure it was Belsen because in -- in Kownitz they were mainly H ungarian  and in Belsen I think  for some reason  I was more alone with her.
We as I said...I came out of that camp after 6 months and lived with a school teacher and his wife.
But when she was around 13 or 12 age old  I she came with me to Israel  it was my sons wedding  and I took her to Nuta Gudkowski and Nuta took her and told her about the camp  and she didnt tell her so much about me  but Nuta was talking yo u know  I I always divide the people the Holocaust survivors to f to two.
Then there were Czechoslovakian soldiers in the town who had a special headquarter and you could go to their headquarter if you were a refugee  if you were an inmate from a camp and they would give you a little bit of clothing.
Then they were saying -- we were talking  we were going from one camp to the other  you always meet people from different areas.
And on December 22nd  1942 I was given papers to a work camp again in the French part of Switzerland.
No  even the universit they were ne after the war  you know   were still in displaced person camp  and the camps are moving  moved around.
And some food was available for stealing because the kapos who in the past protected the supply of potatoes or cabbage was there  were no longer inside the camp  so there we were not knowing what to what is going to happen  and clearly I did not anticipate liberation.
And since I dont reme you know  I dont remember whether you had to be 18 or 16 when they considered you an enemy alien and they would put you in some sort of a camp.
That I was going to survive the camp  and they were going to take me out to a nother country  or to it -- that I am going to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 37be free.
And something like  you know  I think it might have been a John Wayne movies or something like that  you know [indecipherable] But you know  its really unusual  I dont know how many people would have been in a camp  a work camp in the Urals Mm-hm.
Its ju standing up in Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 59his Jeep  and he motioned they he motioned a tank or something  break down the fence  he come driving right inside the camp and stood up in his Jeep  and told everybody  you know  to be quiet or something.
And shortly after my father and mother sent these letters to the camp director and to my uncle  great-uncle in Oakland  they were arrested by the French police  the both of them were put in this camp at Casanuri.
All over Europe  every night between 10 Interview with Morris Rosen August 5  1999 10and one in the morning  they they called out names who survive  which camp were they at  so on  so on.
And when I was coming back  a Ge rman prisoner of war  17 year old guy like me  he see it -- he was in the same camp and I was  but they divided the camp in two.
And we organized...and and he organized this kind of relief action and he called me into that  to uh try to pick up thes e people who came by railway from the concentration camp into Berlin  and you could recognize them immediately  and to bring them to the Jewish community where they uh first of all were treated medically.
Well  the way the camp was done was like I said  wa one long street and there were various sub camps on various sides.
The Communists at least had an ideal  and knew what it was -- for what they were put into prison  or concentration camp.
In the ghetto  I mean  in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity.
And they were already in Siberi a when you were sent to Auschwitz?
At this time  I was the supply officer for Neu Freimann camp and all of the small little camps I mentioned before  which had sprung loose from the Dachau 10 concentration camp.
AG] well the discussion was seeing and talking if there was a way we could help any of them  you see  actually  I dont think  anybody tried to get out from ours where we were  because it was in the middle of a swamp  our camp. [
Well  we stayed there all afternoon and for some reason they decided not to shoot  so we were let back into the camp.
There was  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 again  a new camp  five barracks.
So I finally give in  and -- and then we went to the Camp Obanioli when -- Why didnt you want to leave?
I finally ended up at a headquarters company at Camp Blanding  Florida  doing various jobs.
He wasn't in my camp  you know  and he said  \ There was no response.
And the guys from the camp came in and they took us in.
Im talking about Rudolf Hoss  the camp commander  and he said -- he said  ﬁWell  I c -- I couldnt kill more people ﬂ he said  ﬁbecause the machinery would have suffered and broken down  and we couldnt take that chance  we had so many more Jews to kill.ﬂ But was horrible that night  I remember it.
And they didn't let no one go to work and they lined up the freight cars by the camp  not too far away  and they packed us in like sardines onto the trains we went.
And we used to play around there and kibitz and one back -- and he always give me to take something back  bread or anything to take back to the camp.
And after three or four days  it seems like an eternity  they sent us to a camp which was being built by Russian soldiers--by Russian prisoners of war camp.
I could tell you many incidents like this when the let's see Garnerlager  it was called the Gypsy camp  where they had people from uh  Theresienstadt.
So in the middle of the night we used to sneak out of the camp and sell everything we coul d get rid of  we didnt need.
End of the s -- September  we supposed to go out from the place where we was and sent to concentration camp  and these two pilot was together with us.
Yeah  the Russians were started to move in  they were they were shelling the area and they they were gonna theyre getting closer and they were liquidated the camp.
Other than that they had no memorial to the Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp  or to the -- the whole Holocaust  nothing.
Coming closer to our camp  we had to evacuate  go somewhere else.
And some of them came back and some of them went to Dachau concentration camp and some of them never came back.
Their...the the Nazis whenever you come to a camp  were deliver ed into a concentration camp  the first things they did was shave your hair and their clothing was completely crampled because it had gone through a so-called disinfection process  so uh...and then one building of the Jewish community had started somehow to operate again  and one of my leaders of the youth movement had immediately uh started to organize some kind of relief for those people who if they had been taken into custody in Berlin  they knew where to go  but many of them had come from cities outside of Germany  from northern Germany  fr om western Germany...those who had not been taken to Buchenwald or Dachau had come especi ally from places like west Germany or rural districts and so on.
So they avoid any... And so they came to [ NB: from] Theresienstadt  a new ca mp  a working camp it's all.
We figured this is one camp we will never get out of if the war lasts a ny longer and we had no idea in January or February how long the war was going to last.
I rememb er my father coming home one day  and I think that was when he came home from the one vacation that he had from a labor camp.
We 26 worked in this camp  and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed the ghetto and there was not any more work.
There was no German with us any more  in -- on camp number one.
So  you kind of worked against the element -- disruptive element in a camp that rest of the people did not approve of.
She stayed in Auschwitz in whatever camp they had them until they evacuated them  and then she came back to Krakow.
And I found out about it  and I was told also that every Friday  Saturday and Sunday  they have like drinkings with girls  playing cards  dancing in the substation from this Przeworsk camp.
They are just going to move you to another camp and all that.
And then it went...and the had to...to...and here the Red Army was already come closer every day to Lithuanian  and it was expected that everyday they might come to Kovno  but Gerker had a order that he should...the remnants of the ghetto  approximately 7 000 Jewish...Jews  that they shou ld be brought  transferred to Dachau  to the concentration camp in Germany.
So Farding gave out an order that he needs...you see  our town...there were four towns belonged to our town...our county...that he needs hundred young boys for each town to go back  and he will make a camp  a labor camp.
So  I dont think it was the name of the camp  no.
They were also part of the labor camp  but he had one of his children  his oldest child  who was engaged [indecipherable] went to the riverbank to see which people looked suitable  they looked balabatish to take in.
The rest of the buildings were all wooden and that housed the prisoners of the camp.
DL] And the food which you obtained at IG Farben  how did you smuggle that back into your camp? [
That was the extermination camp  so not everybody that was in Birkenau was exterminated.
Said well  what happened  and when I came back from the concentration camp  somebody called me and told me the story and by chance  I met shortly after I was told the story and little picture  I met somebody who had known my father and who told me the same story  who had witnessed...had not witnessed this.
Those who had a place to go had right away -- some straggled in  depends where they were kept  in which camp.
And when I told them about my plans to go to...to run away from the ghetto  which was as I said before already concentration camp  they said...G arfunkel said  \ Go?
Well  they didnt stay in the camp to work long enough  because in the condition and the si physical and mental you know  knowing that the parents are dead already  they didnt stay too long  they not knowing food  they get weaker  Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 120and when they cannot work hard enough  so they follow their parents to gas chamber.
And at this time  like I say  I went back to the kolonia -- to the camp because in the wartime the peoples they steal the beds  and the mattress and the all the extras that we have there.
And there was we were in a camp where where Russian men  workers  working only in the summer [indecipherable] and so on.
Now  it was a period of time that we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto.
And so he was there  too  and then I arrived  and I took a little room in [indecipherable] of the apartments outside the DP camp.
So app...usually an escapee would have to know  uh  have to  uh  get the hiding somewhere in the building in that area outside of the 8 camp  and then wait for a night to come.
And this SS man  when we came on the camp to this SS man who offered this: \ So where have you...?\  \
And how long did it take between the time you were arrested and the time you were in this labor camp  Klein Erika?
We just read the -- Sign -- Interview with Suzanne Foldes 38 We knew that this is going to be a work camp because it said \ arbeit macht frei\ .
Then there were many functions in that -- in the camp o ffice  like again  the principle bookkeeping.
And then I heard unbelievable screams  and somebody said  American is coming  an American tank came into the camp.
The lady who was Jewish who was in charge of this small camp and she was responsible to the SS  and she was to line us up and then the SS came to count us...but she was like a liaison between the inmates and the SS.
Originally I thought survivors are only people who went through a concentration camp and are survivors of concentration camps.
And Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 27that was the Arbeitslager  the -- what they call a slave labor camp.
And by -- when the others  I think  went to work  we were taken to a place called Bobrick  which was a very small camp  maybe 150 - 200 people  not very far from Auschwitz  but run by civilians [indecipherable] Siemens.
He was  from what I understand  in this awful camp of Jasenovac for almost a year.
It was up to the -- we were not put in prison or in a camp.
When school opened  all the teachers had been in the camp  and when th ey came back  they were so thin  and so young looking because many of them had beards  and th ey were shaven.
It was a huge  huge -- it was a labor camp.
So the bottom line is  my mother  my three younger sisters died immediately in Auschwitz   as soon as we got there.
And he was telling me about all the wonderful things that his union was going to do for the people of the camp.
Yes  we were -- went in -- we were assigned first civilian liens in some kind of kind of camp  I dont even -- bindermisen  binder -- some thing of this type.
And when the people coming from the camp  I was interviewing eith er na -- interviewing them  helping the doctor  and keeping the books.
They in this time they knew that they knew alrea and a in this time  after 42 - 43  they knew that people were thrown from labor camp.
This was the existence in that camp for the next few weeks until October of 1944.
But that's the only souvenir that I got from the camp.
And -- and that then later became a kind of holding camp  really.
I put you among all these young people.ﬂ I was able to save her  and she went through labor camp.
And the camp itself was close enough to the town . . .
I knew about her lesbia nism  because she wanted approach some of the girls in the...in our camp too.
We were better than 300 at one time  and my mother read in the paper where her son was in the British prison camp  and she went to my father and said  \ Now  we know where our son is.\
Do you know when thatŠ I dont know the story of the camp.
No  in the camp in the camp  wa-wa-wa it was w-w-wa solidarity was a main thing.
Now here was a...here was a camp that was made out of an old house.
Thats why I almost saved my life later on in the concentration camp because I declared myself a carpenter.
And they took us to--all the way to the station Calforing which is in the area of Munich and from there they marched to our camp.
I dont know what they did in the detention camp because after a while I would just stay in the school and on weekends since I hated having to go to the Anglican church.
And its not like Im in a camp  but Im trying to hide.
On the east side  east and south side there was also maybe 15 high - maybe not 15 - maybe 10 feet high concrete wall because next to the east was a road  public road  which of course  they didnt want anybody to see the camp and from the south.
One day they counted out 500 women and walked us out of the camp and to a train  a regular train actually   and transported us by train to a place what we later found out the name.
I know that I knew them  I know they lived there.
Yes we had a young actor whose father was a very famous actor as a matter of fact in Germany and he told us that he was in a camp and 5 that they treated him very badly but I mean they did not talk too much about it.
And I was told then  for the first time  that -- by is -- people  you know  in the camp  who had been in Auschwitz much longer   that they were doing experiments on people  which also didnt penetrate my he -- my brain.
So there the camp Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 146was located on the right by the railroad junc tion.
What did you do  did you work while you were in the ghetto?
I went to a place in Germany  a concentration camp where all the prisoners were already taken out.
But you learned a lot about their makeup of the camp  etc.
Maybe I am picking up the wor the bad camp and you will suffer because you follow me.
They brought us there  they gave us clothes  they sanitized us  they cleaned us up .
So they we saw a German  and he come in for the woods  into the camp.
We had -- the man who ra n our camp in Cyprus -- you know about the Cyprus business -- he was a school teacher.

And what -- what happened was that when -- by the time she applied for the job with the Germans was because she felt that if she had an ID card in case they could catch up with us and ask for papers that this might help.
We simply left the camp under no ones guidance  with lack of knowledge of what were going to have to pass through  whether there was still some fighting going on anyplace.
Who was the American who was in charge of the entire Dachau camp?
And then he  one day he says hes in trouble  because if they find a guard helping the -- what they called at the time haftlinga  which is prisoners  they get punished  they might put them in a concentration camp.
And that  of course is when Birkenau and -- and Auschwitz and the others came in -- into being.
So he went back in 1942  in the end sometimes  they liquidated the Judenlager  they brought us up to the Judenlager and made a concentration camp.
They had to know  they had to know that the camp was being emptied out.
Better ones than we had in Auschwitz I must say that.
Of course  we  as people  were running away and we didn't want to be caught  we didn't want to work  we preferred to stay in camp and do nothing.
There were thousands of prisoners coming out of...uh coming into and out of the camp.
And during the times where while we were there there were other people who worked and mostly men who were crossing our camp going from work to camp or the other way around.
The reason is because that camp was in the middle of the Siberian jungle  if one can describe it.
And so the decision was made that I should run away last because I would be interviewed on newsreel and on radio about my camp  and they thought that if I ran away it would blow the 19 The Tadeusz Kosciusko Division appeared in July 1943 and was comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command.
One of them died in a concentration camp  the other one was killed by the SS on the last day of the occupation.
And one time I mentioned it to some members of the camp committee and they looked at me.
You tried only -- I tried to avoid always not to work for the SS  not to work for Gorajetski  because he was ending up taking the men into the camp  which I said th-they never came back to -- to -- to the ghetto.
Okay  now 02:28:26 End of Tape #1 22 Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces 14 Tape #3 03:01:05 Paint us a picture  then  of that first day you were taken to the camp  were you in uniform remind us how old you were  what did it look like to you at first I presume someone might have taken you around what were your thoughts?

Also  you know  wood and such and there were mostly barns and people were housed very crowded in and every morning the younger women would be marched out at daybreak into the fields to work  and the others were left in the camp.
So tell me then  what was how did did you have a sense that the war was coming to an end?
SWB: Where were you when you  were you at the same place where he was and which camp was it?
I know certain certain ca was in the camp  you know  but there is nothing that I was able personally to personally to to verify  you know .
It was a camp  the German camp Russian pris oners  Russian soldier by the hundred.
And they kept the market at as a prisoners war camp.
Our goal was to reach Germany  where they set up this displaced persons camp.
And we saw a little bit the  the result of our work when we were able to take some of the displaced persons out of a camp  those who had been rescued from Buchenwa ld  from Auschwitz  from anywhere  and we were able to transport them illegally through all the borders of Germany at that time that existed at that time.

They never for her not to be afraid  Im sure they di dnt tell her where exactly it is  I mean  in 79 which place and how to do it  but they must ha ve told her that some where I mean  its not that I did  you know  its how I knew about it that she was aware of taking out of camp something that was very important fo r the people who were outside to know  and this is how we got the hard-boiled egg.
They tried  they worked on me very  very hard  until I took the cross off  it took awhile 31and I think what influenced me the most was when I met from Israel in the camp  there were some young Israeli  all though th ere was no Israel at that time  it was Palestine  but they came in some kind of uniforms from the kibbutz  maybe  or whatever.
There were women who worked in the laboratory were Dr. Mengele was doing experiments on the children  and they had every record what was being done to the children and so forth  and other very important operations performed by the Nazi on the campsite to which nobody was privy and it 78 never left the camp.
But it was nothing because they always asked for some thing  if there was in another camp.
And then of course the people who were in the camp could go in the evenings after the Germans had gotten their share of it.
BB] Oh blimey... [00:30:00] [BB] ...can hardly remember now it was er  couple of days I suppose  didnt take any longer  and we ended up in a camp  er  just outside Munich [COUGH]  which was only a transit camp  the camp there that was all British Officers   there was our camp  and the camp on the other side of us that was all erm  all Russians  and they were  and trying to talk to them was fun  but... And then they  they shipped us off to erm  Stalag VIIIB  thats what I was trying to think of in the first place.
And then it turns out that that graf  or that aristocrat  the Nazi found out he tipped my uncle off  they put in concentration camp and got killed.
So that was the first camp that you had to wear stripes?
It was a medium size camp  capable of holding perhaps several thousand prisoners  but at the time of my arrival there were be tween thirty and forty thousand prisoners there  most of them evacuees from camps further east.
And when I was visiting Auschwitz about two years ago  the tracks are the same.

Yes  I was aw are of German Jews being  former Polish Jews  who lived in Germany  being thrown back to Poland  and what they were doing  the euthanasia programs and the concentration camp of Buchen wald existed.

So you stayed in the camp until you saw the American jeeps?
He told us to line up  you know  and we lined up and I was standing next to my sister and hes as king my sister what kind of qualifications she has for an office job and she speaks German ve ry well  and she says that she worked in the office when we were in camp and Father was working in the arbeitsamt  whenever there was no transport and he couldnt mana ge to have all the lists for the following morning  one of us always went to assist him so that he could you know  he was not a young man anymore.
We were about ten days to two weeks in the camp before we found out that she had been brought back to the camp.
One of the magnificent things about the camp was the fact that -- well  let me go back a bit.
Now I can see how lucky I am because  dont forget  I was in this labor camp  like I mentioned before the food was relatively good.
That camp was a whole bunch of Spanish internees  because they came after 36.
Because all the SS guards from th e camp are gone.
The high school with our teachers was considered the hot bed of patriotism and nationalism simply because we were the more educated by comp arison with the average uneducated inmate of the displaced person's camp  and because the school in ??

I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they went to another camp and that period my frie nds and I went to that home that we were hidden in.
And thats where I ended up on very short notice  from Arkansas 18 to Camp Richie  Maryland.

They saw two boys and obviously it was they could sign up two campers  which indeed they did  so we wound up spending our summers there for th e next four or five years and it was wonderful experience for us  and a nice part of the country and we got to know a lot Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10  2001 62of interesting people and made a lot of frien ds  some of whom I still see today  and went to camp with us.
even though they were working in a camp  they still kept an apt.
The  the barracks were very low  built like in  like  like in down...almost like bunkers.
And he made up his grou p to go to a work camp.
Although when we went to the partisans we Interview with Leona rd Zawacki 59 thought that maybe we will be able to liber ate the camp  but we had you know there were a hundred of us and we were poorly armed.

From there  he was forced to three more camps in Austria  finally ending up in a camp called Abenzai  in the Alps  and there in abandoned salt mines  the Germans were assembling V2 rockets.

You will never see them again.ﬂ A nd I went and I was an only child  16 years old  never away from home except when I went to su mmer camp.
Uh what...to what was then the unoccupied zone of France uh to a to a camp that had at one time served as a refugee camp for the civil war refugees that came from Spain  because it was near the Pyrenees and and the Spanish border and uh they were they were simply dumped there with with without blankets  with...without adequate  with without anything and and and uh the Germans told the French to take over and uh so we we...of course  it took a long time until we then established some direct contact with uh my parents because they uh at first they couldn't write and when they did write it it took...that...those things took weeks and weeks in those days.
Then we moved as I say  to this third DP camp.
Oh  we went through the same experien ce and nobody... in that house  the only people who were taken away were a man between eighteen and  I think it was eighteen and forty-five or eighteen and fifty-five  before  before October 15th when the labor  when they truly were just going to a labor camp  labor organizations  that is when all the men  so there were no men until October 15th  between eighteen and fifty-five in that house  they were all taken away.
And what sort of special training did they give you at Camp Ritchie?
Then we were put on those trucks and taken to the concentration camp.
We just met them when they came to fix something in our camp or something so we weren't allowed to talk to anybody.
Did that experience  this experience of being in the camp Yes?
Many years later  I think in one of my travels   I did talk to my father about that camp because I did remember it.
Later a group working so-called \ Wald\ ...\ Waldkommando \  working outside the camp cutting wood for the pyre  for the cremation.
Course thats see that we -- we smelled it  you know  we -- in Auschwitz you could smell that for miles  and people who knew that s -- they were burning people.
They were thrown into the trains with the mothers and everyone else who didn't make the count and sent to Belzac  which was a gas camp.
It was one girl what was my buddy  Oola  Oola Stan  she also survived after the  the camp  and I ----- had a cousin there  what I met  and we shared always the food  and I was very  I was never afraid  and I remember  it was really heavy.
We know in ou r camp  our camp  the number one  didn't have not one German.
And (clearing throat) with our morals.... And people have asked me many times since then  \ At the scene  or leaving the camp... When you left the camp  why didn't you go into the city and shoot every German that you found?\
We became very close friends  and we were sent to camp called Bolkoreim.
What I mean under Vaschek   Vaschek supervised their work  that lets say if we needed supplies or something  they had to tell Vaschek and he would do those things or whatever  but they were trying the best they could for the people in the camp.
And what was the name of the camp  was -- wa -- that your father was in?
That was -- since I came from  I dont know where  wherever they had me come from in Poland  my Ukrainian was not perfect  my Russian was not absolutely perfect  but that was the excuse.

>> Bill Benson: Was your father with you when you arrived there?
And from November '38 to May 1940  I spent 18 months in Belgium  which were pleasant months with distant relatives and friends  constantly under the pressure of not being sent -- avoiding to be sent to a camp because they also had camps for these refugees.
We were the reason we really went to to Ratzkibor was because there was a camp for these young guys from high sch ools and so on  and my father was involved with them.
So you could go in and out of the camp  yeah.
I didn't know there was a cousin who I was very fond of...his name was Robert...and his mother who was  had been in the concentration camp with my mother  Aunt Clara...I want to find out where all these people had gone to  where they were  whether they were still alive  and they had lists in certain places...they must have been public places  so we went in Paris to all these different places and we would look at these lists  looking for my parents and other relatives and she looking for her moth...for her husband.
Her husband was in a concentration camp until -- almost til the end  but about a couple of months before  they -- they drowned him in a barrel of water  which took a horrible ti -- which was a horrible death  even worse than -- than his family's deaths.
They were  th ey were liberated and they were still back  they went back in the concentration camp.
In this camp  there were about thirty barracks  like prisoner barracks.
We allowed...it were a lager...it were already a Jewish DP camp in Austria  and uh we...there we stayed for a while.
I found out a few years ago that I was part of a group of kids because at my age you feel  how did I survive the camp  you know  when youre two and a half years old?
WERNER PREUSS: No  in the magazine which we got all the time for the   and somebody from Israel called me and say he saw the one of his friends  and he was also in this camp  but he -- afterwards  he was sent to Auschwitz later where he met his wife and lives in Israel.
Now the ones that were in the camp a long time  they and the cappos   some that knew how to get around because their number was just maybe 400 or 300 or so  and they were the rich ones and they might have been normal already  but the rest of us just were sterile I suppose.
Try a little 1Peterswaldau was a women's camp within the larger system of CC Gross-Rosen  situated to the southeast of the German city of Gera  near the Czech border.
No  that was a ghet -- th-th-that was a camp  nobody go -- could come in or out.
That friend of mine  we got acquainted with some British soldiers  who were standing guard on the gate  and he let us ride the bike around the camp on the outside and I returned it.
We ran out and just 5 childrens summer camp sponsored by Korczaks orphanage.
And the camp was liquidated because they send out most of the people  they sent to Auschwitz.
Because first there were three camps  then there were two camps  and then there was one camp.
The healthier were made to march alone and we left some behind and there some people from another camp joined us.
So the war is over  did the camp celebrate at all  or did you celebrate in any specific way?
I worked in the hospital  in the Revier  in that hospital in that camp.
And the whole camp  what was still living there  was still alive there after sorting out the old ones  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 old people and people who could not work anymore.
Well  we found out--they found out in camp that she actually had diabetes.
over to the camp in the -- because Auschwitz  one camp where we were taken  there were only a couple of -- half a mile -- well   ish -- well [indecipherable] close.
speaks foreign language here] [speaks foreign language here] I: About our lives  the men and  and  and from and men and women  they know about each other lives because they were sending s ecrets letters  there was only the road which divided the men camp from the women camp and the  of course there were familie s  so the husband was in the men camp and the wife in   so that the letters and they  sometimes they talk through the 52 wires  so was a certain way of sending in formation about the camps .
I didnt know the guy  he was not in the camp I was in  and -- but I was just curious how the German courts were doing with a guy like that.
They caught the guard s  they caught the camp commandant  beat them up not to kill them but because they wanted to burn them alive  and they did.
Now  if I went to work in the morni ng  and I didn't put on a pair of panties  or I didn't put on something under my uniform  and then during work  if I could slip it on  and put it on  then I would bring it back to the barrack  and I could barter it  sell it to somebody for something.
And my brother was sick and father was also not so from working  you know  and he was a and again  but again there was a raid and the Americans bomb again  a raid and the Americans were bombing -- Munich is not far away from Dachau -- and a bomb came in right not too far away from the camp and I just jumped.
So -- and they were put into a camp  which was kind of like restri cted.
They make a concentration camp out of it  became very bad  I mean this was bad.
And I remained in the camp with not too many people.
Well  at camp I remember a lot of people in there  very heavily populated.
But the main thing is not coming up about how do I get actually out of the concentration camp.
And this was just only a transit camp and we're asking the people  \ What's going on her e?\
Interview with John Bucur August 18  2003 38 Id like you to -- to walk with me through the camp.
I mean  it looks like a like a camp  but it was cleaner than most of the camps were  and the direc What were peoples state of mind then?
Our camp was in Cieszanow  where we dug anti-tank fortifications along a given section of frontier.
So is they said that sometimes parents went to gas  and daughter and son  young  strong  stay in the camp  and parents went to gas chamber.
They were not sent to the same one  Jewish concentration camp.
So I met in other words  I did meet a one of those people who was there when I walked into that camp.
We soon realized that even though there was no gas chamber  they sent a truck from a concentration camp that did have one to pick up these people.
So  my people in the -- I call it camp  its really abcenter  wanted to be like home  and have geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah.
So I thought I had it made and even after war I thought I had it made  but what was the thing was I was in the Jewish barracks  the only place which was segregated inside the camp was the hospital  they had one barracks for Aryan prisoners and one for Jewish and the ones in the Jewish got virtually nothing to eat.
When it came the Germans came in the middle of night.
Then we went to another DP camp and Do you know the names.
When I left Fort Benning  I went to Camp Wheeler  Georgia  and remained there as a training instructor for 14 months.
In the underground in the camp  was there or in the resistance and in the underground grapevine  was there any connection between Auschwitz One and Auschwitz 2.
Most of my work  and the work of people around me  was involved in enlarging the camp.
And there were -- because I felt so inferior  and they had -- the people I lived with after I came out of the internment camp  was the sister of the woman before  which was very strict  very clean and very neat.
The arrow points to the Santa Ceserea displaced persons' camp in southern Italy.
Well  on the way  we picked up Polish non -- non-Jewish slave laborers  who might have complained  probably that the food wasnt good  or that they were working too hard  or whatever and instead of a slave labor camp  they were now sent to Auschwitz.
One was in what was Slovakia at that time and participated in the Slovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged  was captured and hanged.
Maybe later in the ca mp  the displaced pers on's camp  there were?
But this one was a  concentration camp work was in his blood  I mean he was a concentration camp guard from the year maybe and  this too I only found out when I read his write up or biography  which I obtained from  of all places  from Berlin  from that archives which they have there and that was maybe in '37 already was a concentration camp guard.
Of course this  [laughs] this was a kind of excitement because I knew the procedure by this time  that you couldn't take anything into  in-into a concentration camp. [
And I imagine if there were any survivors over at the camp  were in physical condition  they got their hands on the guards at Mauthausen .
And as I approached the camp  and there were the freight trains outside of the gate  and as I came to the camp headquarters there were a lot of prisoners.
That was my sister who went for me to th e concentration camp.
So -- Still  they decided to close the camp in January and everybody had to be out.

Well  I I I graduated in in 1942  and during the summers during those years  I had camp jobs.
And if you were Jewish you have to tell that because they knew who was Jewish because they got all the lists from the synagogues  and if you did not tell them you would be sent to a concenration camp.
The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is what -- what I knew were -- how -- how a camp  the concentration camp looked like  it didnt look like a concentration camp  but it looked like a camp and you know  one camp or the other  theres no -- not much -- any bi g difference.

And -- And they all -- They -- They just came into the concentration camp and they werent used to things like that  you know.

And then in the end  I think there was about 15 or 18 000 prisoners there in this camp.
And these two took care of the Polish camp...of the distribution of the food for the Polish camp  and I was the liaison officer for that camp and that's how I met my husband.
You said when you arrive d you knew it was not a POW camp.

I was from *Schloktenzei[ph484] to the airport over there I had to bring the papers from one camp to the other and I had papers  not the MP  not the CNC  when they stopped me  when I produce the papers they salute me and I was going with my ...*?[
Also you had surrounding the camp you had the Germans or Czech gendarmes guarding the camp  armed with guns.
My father sends this camp director 50 francs for our care.
And Vught is -- is a -- is a camp located in northern hol -- northwestern Holland -- northeastern Holland  sorry  not far from the city of Eindhoven  and it was home to the Philips factory.
And...uh...we went to work the first day...uh..and when we came back the...uh...there was a rumor that there...from this camp  was gonna go a transport to another camp  and there is a...a transport is coming from our city of Chrzanow into that camp where we are going to go out...where the...where the transport is going to go out.
And they put those pe ople in a -- again  in a camp  but different type camp  you know.
And if they pal around with  in a society where very few people are Jewish  to say  ﬁWell  you cant go out with them or you shouldnt go to that camp or you shouldnt do this or you shouldnt do that ﬂ its much harder.
Our punishment would have been 76 Auschwitz if we would have been not careful and would have been discovered and she would have probably also wound up in a concentration camp.

Many died  by the way  of dysentery because the British were so sympathetic  they felt such pity  that they gave the inmates their food rationing and...and that was greasy food  you know  meat and things and people...people in  the concentration camp inmates couldn't take it so they...they died in big numbers after the war.
You know  in a camp the comradeship  the friendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend.
But over here on this you know  the northern part  the idea was that the British didn't know that they there were concentration camp prisoners on these ships and since Germany was always going to try to  to win the war  they were still trying to  to push  push troops up north through Denmark  etceteras  so they figured there are ships going this troops whatever  so they just bombed the ships.

No  Millot was killed and his son came back from the concentration camp.
We ended up in the camp called Camp Lucky Strike .
He had to report every morning  you know  to work but he could live outside the camp  but he was -- he had to be committed to work in the camp  and that's the only one.

So  by doing that  they of co urse they sent him to concentration camp.
They are mentally sick and they were thrown into this camp because they had to be kept away from -- otherwise why would they be behind that -- behind what?
I could get out from the forced labor camp easier but to get into the ghetto it was impossible already.
Once a transport left the camp  no one assumed the respon sibility for provisioning the prisoners of that transport  except perhaps for providing the initial rations.
And wh-what about other survivors  were -- were you living with a lot of other survivors?
And I do remember being -- spending months  a summer  in this boy scout camp where they taught us how to pitch tents  how to light fires  how to survive in the woods.

And in order for them to get their rations of food  which was a big kettle  like  where the soup was in  they had to go to the women's camp to reach the kitchen.

Th ese youngsters  I received a little time ago  I received from Poland a book who said exactly what Im not about me  but about the youngsters that all these people who went who were taken out of this camp  were sent back to Auschwitz and they all gone  all was exterminated in Auschwitz  and it was something.
And whether the court was influenced by that as much as it was against the witness who was brought in by Boisen  I think my cross examination of that witness was very telling because he admitted to being the father of the German concentration camp and the Gestapo.

There was a total confusion there  cause they were sleeping in the bunkbeds  and we pulled the blankets off them  and shouted  ﬁIts a raid  get up.ﬂ And when -- when we saw that they were all out of the bunkbeds  we ran  and we ran to the edge of our parcel of wood -- of woods  and as I always say when I -- when -- when -- when I looked to the left and to the right  it seemed to me the Germans were coming around the corners of the woods  and I feared that nobody that we had left behind  would survive.

And thats was all there was to do in this camp  there were -- there was one Italian that made gas out of rotten foods  or what -- I dont know what it was.
And in front of me... This camp was called--as I now know it--Dachau 3B.16 Uh  this...in front of me was a series of barracks.
Every camp had a square where all the prisoners would gather.
And they were taken for a working camp to -- together.
So finally they decided that we should go down to the krankenlager   to the sick camp.
For some reason  after this  I got diarrhea  and this was outside  actually  I didnt -- I dont think they even had toilets in this camp  wherever.
The camp itself was erected on a potato field which was when it rains was nothing but...but the mud bath that you put your foot in the water puddles and  you know  you came out with...with a lot of mud on your feet  plus your ...your foot when into about 1 foot of water...uh...uh... pails.

And on the way  actually driving into Kielce  I suddenly remembered the name of the camp commandant  and a number of other names.
I was disappointed  because there was one who was a very good Catholic  and he had all the silverware of my aunt  who perished in the camp.
When you went to this new camp  when you -- when you would say to me in -- in -- in Lodz  though we didnt know the words  we were going to overcome  we were going to survive.
They just killed people they couldnt send to a work camp?
I got typhus and when I get out of it there was no more prisoners in in the camp.
So  the whole atmosphere in the camp was designed in such a way to make you immediately so low and so despair  that sometimes a death that came  that was a salvation  really  for many  many people.

Because then...because every time when they shipped a transport from one camp to the other  so many they shipped was always just... Arrived less and less from every transport  you know.
And uh uh Sergeant Hadley  I  we didn't arrive at the same time  and uh I was looking around - I I I guess the uh emotions were so overwhelming that I looked for some sign uh maybe that's mental cowardice  that I was looking for some sign of something normal  so I looked for buddies uh who had come to the camp with us  and I saw one who had sort of cradled his eyes with his arm like this  and uh I I recognized him immediately - it it was Sergeant Hadley  and he was bawling like a child.

And the whole camp had to turn to the face away from them  so not to get in touch with them or they were afraid we will make a revolution.
You see the SS only was the guard  while the prisoners themselves were the people who did all the work inside the camp.

I mean  I could see I could see how terribly  how he felt  how terribly affected he was by the loss of Mother  and due to the fact that we we rent there  you know  sometimes I thought to myself  ﬁIf we only would be there.ﬂ Becau se when you separate men from women  and you go through a selection  I cant imagine that Renia wasnt of much help to Mother  and she kind of depended on Mother to take care of her  and Mother was taking care of 50 her friend  and Father wasnt even there to know what was happening  and I dont even know in what way Renia ma naged to be later on in camp.
Sometime my guess it was December...sometime during December 1943  our policeman...our friendly policeman gave the warning that he had heard rumors about a raid and it was decided by the members of the camp that we would post guards on the periphery near where the road was...in shifts.
But  I did not stop to think and realize that God forbid  she could have been caught and sent to another camp.
How could the war be over if we are still in a camp and they are marching?
To do anything he shot in the air and the others that were were supposed to replace him...there were about five sets of them boys...one of them was my cousin...my brother was away already at the new camp  the other brother... .
But my brothers went to this camp  and there was two soldiers in the English fashion standing guard  pacing back and forth  turning back and forth.
>> Laura Green: Your brother is sent to this concentration camp.
If the purpose of the training was to train concentration camp guards  if the concentration camp guards are assisting in persecut ion  certainly the person who trains them is also assisting in persecution.
And I stayed in that part of the camp either two or three weeks.
Can you describe the town for me a lit tle -- not the town  Im sorry  the camp for me a little bit?
Concentration camp thats the one part  people dying because was overwork.
I knew one man was arrested in the street  and so was his son  but they didnt know about it  they met in the camp.
How long a walk was it to get from the ghetto to the woods?
He did come back from the work camp  but I always felt for years and years that guilt that I had sent him to a work camp and we did some corresponding and he said that part of his decision was adventure  but he suffered.
When it was finished  it was supposed to be a show camp--how...how humanely the American prisoners of war are being treate d. This camp was doing construction.
It gave her a good feeling realizing that her own children were safe while she was trying to provide care to these very unfortunate children who weren't safe  who were in the first concentration camp.
BB] O they were alright  by account yeah [DL] And then you were moved to a separate Italian camp  or did you stay in... [BB] No  I was always in trouble in one way or another  and I presume the only reason I got it... And they moved quite a lot  I was up to another camp PG52  which is up north in  north of Italy  and I stayed there  and that was a good camp. [
We saw people marching past our camp and then in the evening  while we were not out being counted  we saw people marching back.
I know that sometimes we walked outside the camp and with hoes and we made little  small pieces of clumps of dirt out of big clumps of dirt.
And every camp had an office  a Schreibstube  writi ng office.
End of Tape #3 41 Tape #4 Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade  who came into my camp  around the end of June.
So  since I was not working outside the camp  but I was working in camp and he was moving freely in camp  he spotted that cute little girl and somehow  some way  we started talking  holding hands.
And on the promise that Himmler made to the inmates  to the p risoners  wasn't kept  and just a few months later that prison -- that camp was emptied of all prisoners and they were all sent on to Poland to Auschwitz.
I was together this last winter with Esther Robb and her husb and  which was not in the camp  and with Samuel Lehrer and his wife in Florida  and it was I who initiated that meeting.
And when he would come upon a typical concentration camp scene  and had to wr ite a report.
4 crew of less than 100 men  who at the time were barracked within the main camp.
Then  there was one time I was no more drove outside camp.
And after a few weeks in that camp -- the camp was west  the living accommodation -- and the food was even worse than Auschwitz.
This is tape num ber one  side B. So you went -- you went back to the camp and -- and then what happened?
You are...then  when they cut our hair  the three girls were in this...in this camp inside.
We stayed in that camp maybe a month  and then sent to another camp that was even worse  uh not far from Krackow called Vileshka .
And like he didnt have to be in a concentration camp to be afraid that he would be.
None of the people in our hometown went to a concentration camp.
And they starting already talking; they say  \ Oh  when somebody goes to a work camp  then my father will be sent away.
It was very difficult for me to carry the boards  and the camp was quite hilly.
And they moved the camp to a hotel up in the mountains of Greece.
What I would do  as a matter of procedure  I would immediately try to seize th e records of what happened in the camp.
Upon arrival at Krakow Plaszow Camp  we did not receive any prison garb  any clothing.
These children had actually learned to walk in the camp  had never known how to take steps.
Well  it was not nice to take of her  in fact  she took care sometimes of the things because she wa s very  she brought some foods  cans from the camp  more than  she was more daring than I  so she took some foods because in the evening  we  we ate the cans  whatever.
And we were taken out at night and put on trucks and we were taken into the Gettys we were at Camp Ritchie is you know  in the Gettysburg area.
And like in Teheran there were three civilian camps  and a military camp.
She had the calendar  we had in the camp office a day  and everything.
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 92 You know  they got they got in the camp  I dont know for they wasnt political maybe.
We went there  i-it wasnt a conciation camp  again a work camp.
I was called one night one evening I was called in and was told that Washington   in quotes  at that time wanted me to go to wanted me to go to the intelligence school  which was at Fort Ritchie  right in in Maryland here  then called Camp Ritchie.
Ma ny of them who came to Israel we re pressed immediately into the and and gave their life away  especially in the battle of   had hardly seen the country and were killed in action  so it was a was a was a troublesome uh time but th en slowly but surely things got organized and the the camp coul d be could be could be uh uh uh...I wouldn't say cleaned out but could could be ev acuated with...and also then the...luckily the uh the uh DP bill came into action  so people who wanted to go to America had the chance to do so  but the Americans had an interesting practice.
So  the  in the German camps  in the Plazov camp  they were not organized resis--resistance  uh to  to do something.
The Germans I learned  and the -- and the Polish I learned over there -- Mm-hm  in the camp  yeah. --
I thought they took them for replacing them to another camp or maybe some treatments to get somewhere.
In other camps like Mauthausen -- I remember Mauthausen very vividly  because it was a very big camp and I got in very early  and it was a terrible Vernichtungslager4  really  where they were killing people by throwing them off the cliff into the quarry down below.
When you leave the camp  you are supposed to turn them in or to do something.
For example this group here were in a camp called Turkheim.
And I go in one camp  I was chauffeured by one priest.
Do you know about how long you stayed in that house  before you left for the DP camp?
So then... So he was in a labor camp for how long?
ﬁ Mina  we will eat all the potatoes.ﬂ It made such an impression on me that when they broke open already our -- our camp to liberate us  you know  the partisans and they broke open the ledgers and everybody was running to the ledgers to get -- to get salami and bread.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 I thought  well  I jump out there.
For instance  they ordered  for one time  a thousand men  age 18 to 55  but only men t- transport  that they go somewhere to build a new labor camp.
Were Jewish prisoners in a  in any way . . .
But then he left  and then my mother-in-law -- at that time I had no idea it was gonna be my moth er-in-law  there was a Hungarian guy in camp they wanted to dance with me.
That -- this was a -- this was a camp for foreign Jews who had immigrated to France?
I didnt talk about the -- the concentration camp for a long time.
Of those two hundred and twenty or so of us that came to that camp  there were maybe forty  fifty alive.
We were  in the Czech army  I have to say  it was a moment of a wonderful feeling  to not be less than a louse  as we were in the concentr ation camp where they had power over us and we had nothing.
Yeah then they sent us to concentration camp   to Oder Al tstadt .
But this was like a camp where they were holding the the people who later were sent anyhow.
And there were trains and the job in the camp was sorting people  finding out who they -- where they were from.
Uh  I was involved  for example  building uh  a place for Hitler  a ---------------  which was under  this was again was  they called it the ------------- from  from Auschwitz  which meant really that it was a extension of Auschwitz  but a smaller camp  and Auschwitz had a lot of them.
And eventually those who made it  brought them in in the ghetto.
And I forgot to tell you that in my room in Salzburg   I have three rooms  and I was with my brother and another guy that wo rked in the kitchen  from the UNRRA kitchen that we had the food in the camp.
Somehow  we had an idea that maybe Oskar Schindler is still alive someplace and will be bu ilding some concentration camp and maybe thats where we would be going.
Yeah  this is the experience of the last one was Ganacker  and in Ganacker one day it was Landau or Ganacker   was one day and they decided the whole camp  wh-which if I am not wrong were clos e to a thousand of guys  oh  to take us  and the Germans said that were going to Landshut.
Peopl e who were taken out of Poland--not in concentration camp  but were taken out as a fam ily to work on fields in Germany.
Later on  camp at times  was almost like a well  kind of a mild danger.
And th ere was one Polish boy in that camp who spoke Yiddish.
Bu t I left the camp a nd went back to England.
And I collected my chocolate and sugar and I didn't have a chance to say this  but in the meantime Ernest was in a concentration camp  and I took that...and sent it in to the concentration camp and that was one of the reasons I didn't want to leave Europe.
People worked in the ammunition factory and they smuggled ammunition into the camp.
So  do you remember that  do you remember when you left the camp?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 27 In the camp  you said  in a way  you know  being able to play the violin saved your life.
Could you tell us how you were told that you They were told they told us that was end of 43  that we will have to move out in one camp.
That came very came very good later on when the camp was when the uprising came.
So we had a house in N.... I was in the camp in Nathania.
He invited me to go to a concert  and I want ed to go dancing  and I was invited from the American head of the camp to go dancing in the club  in the camp club.
Right  but when people go out to work  they we nt to different places in the camp so they could then tell people in other places  yes?
On carrying out her commission Ms. Mandel was shown great care and attention  concienciousness and ingenuity as our lecturing activity in the camp has ceased for the present and consequently we can not any longer employ Ms. Mandel  we are delighted to give her our very recommendations.
29 But certainly  I mean  I remember him telling me that at one point he and his older brother Maurice were on one of these death marches wh en they were moved from one concentration camp to another.
We were all driven out of our barracks  lined up with the Germans and taken to the port where ferries was standing by  and we chased on to those ferries and taken by boat from Riga to Danzig  Germany into concentration camp Stuthoff  and we heard  after we arrived in Danzig  when we heard that we were going to Stuthoff  we were devastated because Stuthoff was a camp which was very well known as one of the worst.
My mother described witnessing that camp being bombed by the allies and saying a prayer of thanks to God in Hebrew as she saw the factory going up in flames.
Yes  so January is February  March  through 29th of April  then we left.
One of the -- now  thats -- thats the story in concentration camp -- Yeah. --
CE: In October 14  1943 was the uprising and then we ran away and we ran to the woods  and you better tell about in the camp -- in th e -- when I ran away  we met the other group of the uprisers.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 10 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: And they must have also taken some people to the 9th Fort and destroyed them.
After the Pole was arrested -- the man that was hiding us  he -- the Germans -- I mean there was a trial and all that and supposedly they had to confiscate all of his property and the people -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- the people that were actual -- that were removing the property from the base ment and from the house  were the leftover Jews from the Yanoffska concentration camp.
All of these things were left to the people in the camp  the inmates.
And one of the officers was was inspecting one of the officers was inspecting th-th-the the camp and he came when he went by there  he heard the moaning  he asked  who is in there  to open up.
He was very fond cigarettes  and the the Judenest  they give him a job on the in th e camp we used to have sheeps  you know there?
That day  in the camp  we had nothing planne d. We were sitting on the walls.
Again  this camp was to be liquidated  and people were lined up to march out of the camp.
Between the bad people was two friendly American boys who supplied to Warsaw through the air ammunition and guns wa s shot by German and landed close to our house Mirdova and went with us together to concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to Flossenburg what I visit couple years ago are ho w many Polish people died there  was mostly died Polish  Russian  very small Jewish and two Americans.
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg July 29  2000 51 I think we were transpond -- transported in -- in -- in trucks to a holding camp in Aversa  Italy.
They even had a hospital which was about I would say  close to mile and a half from the camp  and they converted a hotel into a hospital  it was called a  the hotel the Kaiser and Elizabeth.
Uh  the  what I had  when these men came back  and we all  the whole camp had to also stay together  th e whole camp  and there were um  10 or 12 uh men  they put them also there together  and they  uh  th ey shot them each separate  uh  because  uh  that they were  that they run away from uh  uh  from Sobibor  and killed some from the uh  Ukrainians.
And I saw in the paper -- this was Hanukah holiday.
In any case  I went to that school  and there was one a one more half-Jewish girl in the class  and one girl who was a full Jew  and the rest were not.
And the she knew that the deportees from Poland lived in this camp  not too far away from them  but she could do nothing for them  and she heard that ultimately they were allo allowed to go back to Poland after World War II.
You -- You met -- Did you meet Minnie in camp?
Fortunately for me  he was with me and they sent us to Flossenburg  a concentration camp  and from there to Leichmerz.
Landsberg was also a dirty wooden camp built like in bunkers.
It was a transit camp of five days was the most that they would let you stay in that camp.
Oh  you are going to be drafted soon  because you see that was the end of the war and they took a lot of those criminals from the concentration camp  they sent them to the East  to the Russian front.
The camp in Gross Rosen  for example  where I was later on  had mostly homosexual  homosexual prisoners  all Germ an  and they wore pink triangle.
Ive seen these rubber blown up bodies being taken in Mauthausen concen Mauthausen concentration camp  which is wr ong  totally wrong  you dont do these things.
But they just gave us a certificate saying that so and so was released from this and this camp by the authorities in accordance with the lo with the rule with with the decision of the council of ministers on such and such a date.
So he decided to take his Jews  his machinery and bring them to Germany and open a little camp on his own  and that did not make him go to the front.
We really know that we are in a camp  and that was the nation So you were in Nordhausen for a few months Yeah  and and then you were sent I mean  it I mean  you were in Hanewacker for a few months.
Also in certain areas of Germany  not in the part where I lived  uh Jews were definitely uh  uh treated a lot worse than  than we ever thought.
And after that  all the DP camp  camps  started to form in a Bavaria  in Germany.
>> Regina Spiegel: Well  you know  it was -- we were -- thi s was when we were in the really not such a nice camp.
Each compartment had their own door to walk in  so was no use trying it there and again  let's wait until the next camp and see what we can do later.
But they didnt have concentration camps  they had POW camp s  where they treat the people just as bad as in -- in a concentration camp.
No  I didn't know much Yiddish but after the war in the camp Lithuain a Jews eating in the kitchen getting the food because we didn't have nothing  th ey heard us speaking Poli sh they said no  only Yiddish.
Interview with Jacques Ribons 76 Well  but it's such a huge change  where one month you were a prisoner in a concentration camp and month and a half la ter you're in a home in France and the following September you go to school.
That day  it didn't happen one day  it happene d practically every day --whenever he came into camp.
The camp headquarters...I'm trying to recall in my mind now  as you went down the main street on the righthand side  there was a brick building and beneath that brick building was the gas chamber.
And constantly  every week  they were afraid of typhus breaking out which in other camp typhus broke out  was disease  killed a lot of people then after liberation.
Camp Lucky Strike This is in France Yeah  camp Lucky Strike.
She was not in a camp  my wife  she survived as an Aryan  as a Polish Catholic.
And uh  I was hidden out with some people within the camp.
When they  when they started to liquidate the ghetto they needed Jewish workers to clean the ghetto  the apartments   sort them out and send them to Germany.
That person may have died while he was transported to the camp.
Like they took them away before to labor camps close to Zamo...was a labor...labor camp  [Mokre Zdanow ].
In fact  I have one picture left from that camp  with all the kids  only one picture.
Next day  we were all ready; and then a few trucks of SS people came into the camp.
Oh  about two  three hours  wasnt far away from from this camp  yeah.
Did you know w -- that -- where -- while you were still in the camp  did you know where your aunt was or where shed been taken  or did you not find out what happened to her until the war was over?
It expanded to the point where me  at the time  yet younger Jews were called into labor camp and I was one of them.
I dont know where we got the money  and going back to camp at night.
And you know  if you ask a friend  after all the story of the camp  he survive and he say  ﬁBloing   face to face  can I forgive this?ﬂ People say  ﬁNo.ﬂ But this is not what I ask him.
And Laura Swartz had the camp out at in Baltimore in the country  the children's camp  quite big and quite lovely.
Later  through the Polish underground paper it was mentioned that they took all the people from this transport and they took them to a concentration camp in Hanover  where they didn't survive.
But here  you know  the...the few in the camp... You know  there is police--you know  Jewish police--in the camp.
He was only -- 44 -- he was 14 years old  but he was a lot taller than his age  and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari outside of Athens before the transport  wher e he was forced to do stupid  meaningless labor of moving rocks from one place to th e other  had -- and the food was good  also  there  amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them  that he -- he gained enough muscle so that in the separation  he was then pointed to be taken to labor -- all right -- to the labor camp.
So my father was at the time in in the forced arm forced camp in Szoln ok  which is about  I would say  80 miles from Interview with Yehuda Adam 21 Budapest.
I got from my uncle who sent it through the camp to us.
But they say  ﬁNever mind  pribyknyesh 28 you get used to it.ﬂ So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said  ﬁYou come tomorrow?ﬂ ﬁIf I can  I come tomorrow.ﬂ So he gave me some fish  I took the fish to the camp.
When did you st -- End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.
So we we re really at that time ve ry - because they could have left us in that wo rk camp.
Many people got sick  of course not enough food  were killed or died working there  and population of this camp was decreasing very rapidly.
Now my answer and her answer combined is that wh en the barrack was assigned for the administrative  administrative work details  to work and to be housed there  it was very a negl ected one  the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that ba rrack  which was Block four  a wooden barrack.
So  glad to be able to share this with you  and Were very grateful  and the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial especially is very grateful for you having come all the way from Boise  Idaho  and having made the effort to remember some of these times that were sometimes painful.
I was only 12 years old  I mean  its not that I was and this camp was not exactly what you would call a camp here  it was hard.
When the transports came in  the able bodies would get a shower and they would place them in camp  but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not  so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved.
Let's take a minute before we go onto the new chapter to think about another aspect of your life in the camp for you.
What was the nature of the work  what was going on in the camp?
But the night  the last night in that camp  the night of the 29th and the 30th there was a bombardment in that camp.
We felt that perhaps we are being taken to another labor camp.
The French were the keepers of the camp and not the Germans.
Uh but uh in Dora-Nordhausen was established really as uh as a camp where they were making uh part s. It was done under under the mountain.
I was in that camp and then I met my frie nd  it was nice.
Now  what was it like in the -- in the barracks?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Do you remember the name of that camp?
Th -- She was farmed out to the farmer from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0028 24 the camp.
And we saw...and those Russians came in  and we figured  \ Why did they bring Russians here?\
They had taken meat of the dead horses and they brought it to camp and they barbecued it and they shared it with who ever came along.
A week later when Ludwig -- we couldn't be together with the women in the camp.
A lot of them were Russians and they didn't want to go back to to Russia  so  uh  we tried to keep them  uh  working in the camp and they  because the they said if we go back to Russia it will be the end of us.
They were transported to Ukraine where there was a camp  infamous camp where 50 000 out of the 80 000 Polish Hungarian Jews were practically butchered and killed.
And I remember not having shoes and ru nning out of the camp just for the drama of being outside and no longer inside.
So I said  \ You know  why don't you get the whole camp in there.\
When you moved out of th e camp  where did you go then?
Because the camp hanged a lot of people in the camp  in Kaufering.
One of the most cruelest things in any camp was called the 7 Appell  the roll call.
And this is the kind of view that I would have had -- that we woul d have had from the bus  from the top of the bus  after the crossing the channel and arriving  this is th e view we would have had  with the ocean behind it and this little -- little s -- little town of little -- little houses in which we were housed while we were in the camp.
And then I took him uh through the camp situation  took him up to St. Tetillion  a hospital  up to Landsberg  Feldafing  so forth.
Another death camp  built this time north  on the north side of Izbica.
I had also a friend that I knew from the camp by the name Blockman (51).
He -- He got two -- two weeks in -- in camp prison  but he was released second day and made hard labor  chopping wood in the wood barn.
This was a camp that was taken away  a working for a summer camp or some sort of thing.
Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board  but we have left out one  in my opinion  very important aspect  and that is the preservation of the camp inmates at the end of the war.
There -- there was only one woman th at I know who had actually been to a very unpleasant  very -- I mean  in the actual k illing camp in -- in Germany.
It is -- It was a novelty here  to be a survivor and the press was there  hungry to have news from -- from the concentration camp that we were -- were in.
The owner would come to camp  and he would personally pick up the people and touch the muscles and  uh  uh...and  uh  after he was satisfied  then they would go  uh  to various places.
Have you told people about it  tal -- About the concentration camp?
The camp was made for us  and this was like a slaughter camp.
And he had to make believe he was walking  and they came back  go back to the camp.
Because when they caught my father  they put him Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10  2014 16 in a camp in Hungary  in some kind of and that was for political prisoners.
In this camp was were some non-Jewish prisoners  they were not the same prisoners as we were  but they were still prisoners.
I would doubt that because that was in a secluded...this was a big camp.
As I said  I -- I think there must have been something like 2 000 people in that camp.
When we go out after the -- the 19th of April I saw there's nobody there from our family and then I was coming from concentration camp.
Probably - probably some of the soldiers who had liberated them  I'm not sure  but we were shown through the camp around the grounds  and the inmates who were there were still dressed in their striped uniforms and so happy  so filled with joy and trying so hard to do anything they could for us  and I think --I could be wrong here but I think it was both American and British who liberated Buchenwald  but I'm not certain  but all I saw were American soldiers there.
SE: When we came on  the first thing what we had to do when we came in camp one  we had to dance.
When -- in th is forced labor camp and -- but we hoped that he will survive.
They brought it into the camp and they were bringing it over to me and I concentrated and I was going over there.
In the concentration camp like like uh big concen...extermination camp  Dachau and 10 ...the people uh the Red Red Cross send over there  because it was famous and so there was a political...yes...but where we was  there was so many thousand and thousand.
She all a of a sudden came to the -- to ours -- and she didnt speak -- to our camp  and she didnt speak Russian  she spoke Yiddish.
I was in Birkenau in the nice camp in Au schwitz  so we went in there first.
After a few days we arrived in that terrible prison camp Flossenburg  which is in Bavaria.
Two or three days after the Jews were evacuated from Buchenwald  the Germans decided to evacuate the whole camp again.
And  and the men had to go already to  work camp but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941  beginning 1942 or so.
So the only thing I decided what I do in camp is  or since then I gonna do--since I don't think I have no answer to \ left\  or no answer to \ right\ --I don't gonna test fate.
We can only go by stories that were circulating amongst usŠone story was that Schindler was called in to explain how it is that the inmates inside th e camp received some food while the population outside is now being starved.
And these German former guards and and camp managers and so on Right  right.
Now Wagner was a man of about 28  30 years  and he was very bright  he was very suspicious  and  with him  you have to be very   very careful  we had a mas -when he came to the camp  we had a special name for him that we  on e person told it to the other one  \ Be careful  here he comes.\
After a number of nights and days of this terror-ridden concentration camp  we were sittin g assembled as I described before in one anothers lap.
Do you remember that the camp changed when Joseph Kramer came and became Commandant or is that not a significant moment?
Nobody outside the concentration camp knew whats expecting the deportees upon their arrival in Auschwitz  or wha -- that was not known of Auschwitz -- and people would not have even believed it and have not believed it later on.
A. Yeah  and then I had to go back to regime camp.
I cannot go every aspect of camp life  it would ta ke too long but if you want something to know  I can tell you that I had many  many incidents.
Now we went to Germany  to Waldenburg  I dont know how they call it now  and from there we were with a -- with a few people someplace else  and -- Was Waldenburg a DP camp?
The history was like this  when a  when a group of 60 people in camp from a table  and they caught f ood on them  they took them all to the hills  and they executed  and this day was 60 to 0.
And then she was deported to -- she was moved to -- no  she was first in a camp in Poitiers  in the outskirts of Poit iers there was a camp.
And so we -- we as historians were responsible for putting together a context of how the prisoners came into the concentration camp  by what pseudo-legal means they came into the concentratio n camp  of how the guards were recruited  of what their duties were  and of how their daily duties involved keeping these people in a place where they were being persecuted on the basis of race  religion and so forth.
The working camp was Au schwitz and the final soluti on took place in Bruckenau.
So I came back from this camp and I started to work by the Germans.
So one guy and we had also a forced labor from Hungarian  Jewish people came to us  cu t woods and things like that.
I saw them in the camp  they were playing baseball  but not -- never saw one before.
I was not exactly a prisoner in the camp  but I was there and I knew exactly what was going on.
And tw o days later I was transferred to the youth concentration camp.
In the morning we were taken into the Shul  to the temple  to the Houses of Study  and this became our barracks  and this became our new life to be in a labor camp in Kolbuszowa.
This was last concentration camp  it was during the upris ing  I talking this 1944  you know  because was two uprising in Warsaw  you know  about this one 1943 was in the ghetto  a very short time and another was 53 days  what was 63 days  what was in 1944  from September first to O-October  you know.
In this place  Zamposten  it wasnt a concentration camp  it was ---- of course it was guarded  it didnt have electric wires whatever it was but it was a prisoner of war camp.
Can you tell me a little more about going into the ghetto.
Of course  you remembered the incident with the anti -Semitic camp director  but you also told me you had another memory of the camp.
After they build up that concentration camp  I believe the first prisoners come from Czechoslovakia.
She just totally  absolutely  totally divorced herself from her Je wishness  from her camp experience  except that she did do a Spielberg tape.
So the camp was completely liquidated  uh  no trace of it  and uh  and our story was later  we ran from  w ell  during the day  as I say  we were trying to hide  and at night we walked because I knew a little bit  we looked on the big  the  on the big uh  how you call it?
Uh  I worked in the factory in...in making springs; and what's good about this is is our camp in...in the factory was almost a unit.
A and German came in again from the other camp  you know  and he was a big man.
But he told me that he had a very tough time to survive that concentration camp and he got a problem with his heart also.
And  incidentally  there are times when  among visitors of the camp  I have pictures from Catholic charities coming with supplies and food.
The -- that -- the first WV HA concentration camp case -- Really. --
Later on  we found that they were in a very unsanitary  unhealthy conditions  so the whole bunch was moved to a place in Bamberg  camp in Bamberg where the Jews lived.
So they were going to use the gasoline or the kerosene to maybe be a distraction  or to start burning the camp?
So  the warm sweaters and the coats that we left with them because  once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto  we met with Polish people at work  and if we knew people who were willing to take a message to them  they have seen to it that something was sent to us  even in this slave labor camp in Starachowice  even after th e ghetto  you know.
He was a young a young kid about 15 years old  and he was a Pole Interview with Morris Rosen August 5  1999 6in the camp  not as a Jewish guy.
We were very shortly put to work outside the camp  carrying very heavy stones.
There wa s like a little forest  and because there were civilians and there were the camp pris oners and there were the Germans who were trying  some in uniform and some already in civilian clothes  there was such a commotion  there was so much coming and going  you couldnt figure out what was happening.
All they knew that my mother was found shortly after she went into hiding and that nobody knew where my sister was  and everybody knew that my father was shipped to concentration camp right away.
Q. Now  because your husband was up there  and that Schindler up there  was he aware of Schindler and Schindler's camp nearby?
Well  in camp  the rumors were going around  and you know I was there  the war goes on  and all of a sudden we heard that the Russians are mo -- the Russian front is moving down  and how we knew that its really getting close  one Sunday  when the coal mines werent -- the coal mines were working  bu t in our free time  they take us out to dig ditches  for the army to  you know  to dig in.
If we hit on one who was in the same camp  ﬁSo  you knew this one  you know that one  you knew this one  you knew that one.ﬂ And everybody -- not only a book -- I mean every survivor has a whole library.
When did you go into the ghetto  do you remember exactly when that was?
So he says  ﬁYoure one of those camp people?ﬂ So we said  ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁWhere you going?ﬂ ﬁWere going back to Poland.ﬂ ﬁWhere in Poland?ﬂ We said  ﬁStarachowice.ﬂ ﬁWhat kind of town is it?ﬂ He spoke Yiddish.
even in the camp  so  I had uh  hoped that I'll get a chance uh to steal a bread  and th is is like a life saver to  to have uh additional uh bread because we were constantly  we were starving  and all we could think was uh about uh food  so I  and I was always the one  the daring one  so I finally uh got hold of a bread  and being that I had a coat  I put the bread uh inside my coat   but the girl next to me uh was scared and she said uh because there was always collective punishment  if somebody did anything  then everybody was punished  it was just your punishment alone.
We had a doctor from South Africa  who was the M.D. director of the camp  and we had Displaced Persons physicians.
And a few weeks later  I  I kind of visited that camp.
You know  the only ones that survive is the ones that found a way of breaking out from camp  and the -- Right.
And my mother had -- I don't know if you remember the \ Sophie's Choice\  movie  she would have to stay with father and go to camp together with us or go with my sister and save my sister.
Now  all these outside installations were under the jurisdiction of Camp Kisserwal.
You have touched on a subject that I think sometimes is very  very important and one of the losses that so many people had who had different experiences  that very often part of the experience a person went through  if they were in Auschwitz or if they were in a concentration camp or they were in an area further north  is that neighbors that they knew -- Turned them in. --
So  you know  anyway  when I came t -- first of all  when I came back  I found out that my in-laws  and my father  you know  were taken to concentration camp.
With the... Seamstress  tell me about what her work was  what she did  what did they... She came into the camp with her husband  he was a good tailor  and she was an excellent seamstress  and the Nazis didn't wear underwear just from plain mate rial  everything had to be made from silk  the shirts  the underwear  so she was excellent.
So that was some -- something funny  the only funny thing of the whole -- but in many cases  afte r the wa -- after that  the men left Germany  and left their wifes and children behind  because a man would have gone back to camp.
How did the camp know t hat the word res ettlement equates to death?
Interview with Gert Silver March 30  2006 45 No  it was -- well  the camp was bigger  but the barracks and the working hours  and the -- and all that  were just like in Buna.
And the German Government arbitrarily declared that they died in a concentration camp on May 8th  1945  which was the last day of the war  the date of war.
We were supposed to be going to be a death camp.
And what -- and there wasn't too long  it was in February  March -- March.
We didn't have a clear enough understanding of is this a death camp or not.
from the concentration camp  Fircht  I came to Westerbork in 194...2  43  and  uh  uh  when I came there  I found an uncle and my mother was there with the five children  and we came together w ith these girls that I met  we stayed together with them  and  and a whole bunch of uh  Dutch girls  we stayed always very close together.
Upon that  a request came from a camp that they need a few hundred men to build certain air strips.
And for him to have risked his life every day and yet retained the hope that there would be freedom for him some day  I thought it was a marvelous thing  and it was tremendous piece of evidence  because I had the record and the photograph and identification of every SS man who'd gone through that camp in that period of time.
I said  I gonna give you a little bit schnapps -- because he used to like to drink -- give you a little bit of schnapps in a little bottle  and you gonna take this to -- but not here in our area  you have to go far away with this -- with this package  that they dont know  hey  concentration camp does something  you know  who is this  you know?
And this we carried the people...uh...for awhile was easy because a friend of mine with the Americans CIC gave me some papers to bring his sister to...uh...to DP camp in America...in Germany.
Then we came into the camp and there was big sign \ Arbeit macht Frei\   Work Makes Y ou Free.
And so I was  for a few months le summer months  when there was a scouting jubil jamboree at that camp  with the beautiful trees  and somehow a lot of young people from all different camps  and and afterwards I came back to to the camp  and then we were taken to Akwaz  which is going south.
blank space on tape at this point) She said  I have heard and been told by SS people that this camp will be eliminated.
Because  first of all  it would cost a fortune  four children you have to camp  and I didn't want to send them to camp because I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the country  pi cking mushrooms and my mother showing  making crowns an d put on your head  and singing  and I dont want them to miss all this here.
Did that bring back memories for you about what you went through?
Anyway  they were not one  there were probably several  one remained  the ot her ones jumped off with me and we changed to another streetcar and we came to the camp where we are assigne d. And we never could get out from the camp.
Did you have any contact with those  with the victims of the concentration camp?
He was one of the leaders that was supposed to make that resistance in camp.
There was a sign above the camp  but you kno w  I can't remember what it said now.
Now in c onnection with all these transports  my then wife uh had prepared a knapsack with all kinds of things we thought would be helpful when we would go to the east to some kind of a labor camp and so what we expected  and had some some uh underwear and some books and the bible and and a chess set and so on  and certainly things for the for the boy  and uh had that ready so in order to grab it whenever whenever the occasion would arise.
But soon we became friends with them and even though we were separated by barbed wire  we had contacts with them being that they had also women and girls  and in our camp there was only men.
I says  you know  what would you have said in a concentration camp?
I arrived in the displaced persons camp in Berlin  in the early part of 1946  probably around March or so  in the company -- actually my sister  Kris was married to Miles Lehrman at that time and they were my guardians.
But  but she  especially on the   certain functions could not be performed by a woman  because we had no know-how  like repair ing of the roof  the replacing of broken glasses  putting a new floor  building partitions to  to divide camp  barra cks    designated to us  into a housing or sleeping  sleeping area and another area  so there we had the first time  certain ma le work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities.
At one time there was a young man working in a camp  supervised by a group of Nazi officers.
But it's so many years ago  I -- I really can't tell exactly in which camp it happened  but I was told by the people that had witnessed this terrible incident.
The second legacy was when my mother was taken from the town of Jheshuf  from the ghetto  cause we were taken from Kolbushova  from a small town to a larger town  to Jheshuf  where they gathered more Jews  to be able to send them to a death camp.
There was no  and at that time there was one man who just stole a cow or something and the two Jews  my hu sband and I and one Frenchman fro m the organization  so I went back to Mrs. Millot  Mrs.  the first one    and they took the father  and the son and the father died in a concen tration camp and the son had a before he came  14 went to the concentration camp  he came back th e was gone b ecause it just was half starved and he lost I d on't know  40 pounds  but he came back.
If you can't leave by then  then we have to send you to a concentration camp.
And the Germans a llowed people to come back into Germany providing they were leaving again.
Interview with Felix Nicinski March 6  2007 70 I cant tell you why because th-they asked me I had parents  I told them  you know  I was in camp.
Was a lot of brutality  but when you were in the camp already  they managed to take  make you weak and took your will away because you couldn't fight.
They kept saying  where we're going  he says you're going to another camp.
But the people didn't really come back to Auschwitz to sleep  but they went out to work with another small camp  was also run through the Auschwitz uh management if you want to call this right.
They there was a long space of time  I guess  that appears at at at such occasion  and then sometime that evening  they loaded us into cattle train cars and shipped us to southern France  near the Pyrenees mountains  to a concentration camp called Gurs  g-u-r-s  Gurs .
So this was a camp where from on  there was only one way.
Im sure there we re Greeks and Italians and -- What else did you see inside the camp besides the prisoners?
We were to [indecipherable] and the people who were in a camp in Switzerland came back  and they went -- the ones who were in the ca -- escaped to Switzerland .
So at least I know that my older sister wind up in the labor camp to go [indecipherable] the rest  my father and my mother and my sister  they went to the crematoriums  ovens.
They gave their blouses  their British army blouses and whatnot  to concentration camp survivors  who then used those  with other ident -- be -- well  they could get on a ship and whatnot.
From there  they selected 30 men--myself among them--and marched us to Camp 2.
We had a lager fu ehrer  uh the head of our camp  uh  his name was Leopold  and he uh was already started uh  uh give orders to dig trenches for us  you know  to be put and  and shut in case of the Russians approaching closer  and somehow  Schindler realized what's happening and asked uh Moshebasky  Mosheb asky today is the Supreme Court Justice in Israel  and at the time  he was a young man  ve ry good in forging documents  you know  he was kind of an artist  you know  he knew how to forge documents  and he forged a telegram to Leipold  telling him to go uh calling him to the front  which Leipold very reluctantly did  but we got rid of Liepold.
And then you never knew when theres gonna be another exodus  or then the Germans insisted that the Germans the Germans in the camp be sent back to Germany.
They're going to send all the Jews away and to the concentration camp and they're going to...uh...or kill them or they're closing the ghetto.
So -- but I remember that a acquaintance of mine  when we came already to another concen tration camp she had it.
And things would come back and y ou would talk about this or that and another thing that is so interesting  people often th ink that when people get together from a camp  all we'd talk ab out were all these terrible things that happened.
And this is what it was  it was bringing in from one type of camp to another international United Nation camps in exchange.
Well  everybody is familiar with the physically: concentration camp  gas chambers  evacuations  all that.
laughs] Somewhere in Germany  it had nothing to do with this camp that I was describing [Ahem] we got a hold of a hollow bronze head of Adolf Hitler  a darn good likeness too.
Finally I was told  practically with no notice  that an engineering brigade would be moved out of Landsberg and the village turned over to the camp and I could requisition a certain number of German houses.
Sachsenhausen was known as a   as a concentration camp  and that was  that was bad news.
So lets start with a time when you were in Berlin  in the camp for displaced persons.
So I was accepted by the people  by the small group that sort of controlled the camp   but I was put to work like everybody else.
And then we shipped from California to Camp Kilmer  New Jersey; and from there to England  because the 12th Armored Division had taken our equipment.
However  the Jewish  we  the Jewish girls  we were not together with the men in the sa me camp.
Then  and of course the Germans were making uh laughing and making uh you know uh uh uh dirty jokes  and uh it was just terrible  we were completely uh not prepared for this because we thought we're going to Mr. Schindler  you know  to his camp.
You never  never di -- no  that was a camp   you couldnt get anywhere out.
Only thing what I want and I could have gone ar -- out of the concentration camp  I could -- in Holland  I could got away and in the police station where I was in -- in Utract  I could have got away.
They kicked us out of the camp to go to work  and then locked us back in to sleep in the pigpen.
They arrested the little boy and the man -- you take out a rifle to him big  little for the camp  on the in and the mouth  where is the little boy?
Ghetto  well the ghetto  our ghe tto became a concentration camp.
selected -- got the 10 tailors  according to their cardex and names and numbers  and have asked the blockelteste to bring those 10 tailors tomorrow morning in front of the camp office  or wherever [indecipherable] Right.
He says  ﬁIt scales trauma on a scale of one to 10  and 10 is surviving concentration camp.
And then one of the American soldiers and the Camp Elder mounted the stand above the main gate and I will never forget because they stood over there with all of us  thousands of people down below  and he uttered in German these words  \ \  which translates  \ you are free.\
So the French doctor told them that when they take me back to the camp  take me into the French barrack.
RJ] Well  of course  other than our camp  there wasnt guards around other camps. [
I have no idea and I cant remember  but Im sure there were quite a few barracks with quite a few people in them.
I opened the letter and it was from somebody who knew that my mother was in a camp called Gurs.
With this in mind--that was the idea that I became a--a uh Tin Smith and I came--I came to a concentration camp in Dakaw.
So they bombed th e camp  they bombed  they bombed the factory  there were some among the  the .
I don't know too much about this camp  that's why I'm asking you.
So uh I I had to rush out of the SS camp to the pris oner's camp  and uh uh what I uh uh and uh (pause) and at that time I came back again to to continue.
And what -- what happened was that when -- by the time she applied for the job with the Germans was because she felt that if she had an ID card in case they could catch up with us and ask for papers that this might help.
So she arranged somehow that I could join to a small Kommando which came regularly every day to her camp to do some maintenance work.
On the way  unfortunately  there were either Americans bombing the areas of the ghetto...of the Auschwitz  ...of the Ravensbruck concentration camp  or maybe it was Russians.
Immediately  Germans began uh to...uh enlarge the camp by building new blocks.
Then the buses came down  and then they took all the prisoners up to a camp just north of the Danish German border  fa -- a place call ed Froslev So we come up there and we were there for a couple of days and then they took us by bus and they -- and train  we were supposed to go through Copenhagen and over to Sweden.
The soldiers were there for for a few minutes  they were on patrols whose job  I'm sure  whose assignment was not to liberate a camp but to march along a certain road to some destination and after ten minutes or fifteen minutes they left.
As soon as we Okay  what were some of those a-as soon as we arrived in   like maybe a week later  there is an announcement that there is a the the cultural committee of the of the camp  is meeting  all those who are interested should come.
One of camp  one of the times  we were caught in the selection  and we were standing in front of the gate.
>> Bill Benson: What were you forced to do when you were there?
After all  if a man is going to immigrate and he te lls the story of what it was that he did in a camp and the security officers except wh at it is they say why stop them from -- from going?
Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 17 And my father was taken by a truck to some sort of labor camp.
But other people have too  who were -- who were not in camp  but there are certain things that we do have.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 15 It was not the camp  it was -- The DP camp.
And then we were taken to a big camp n ear Krakow called Plaszow  which was built on the former Jewish cemetery.
And I'm very sad that we make such a about this concentration camp.
And when we came back to camp  we were told  \ You have to leave tonight.
Were you involved in -- in any direct liberation of camp?
I just want to a little bit about the conditions or the life in the DP camp.
We stayed in the second camp for I -- you know  I cant remember exactly how long.
And but they some way we all knew that and they knew about  they didnt think that theyre going to labor camp or anything like that.
Now Im in a camp  and the camps were run as cities.
We spent three days out in the drill drill field putting up a pump thats and everything was lined up with a string  all the way down through that whole camp  the whole division  thats 13 000 men.
109 And they had no -- nobody in the mans camp.
One day I have my little satchel with the stuff over my back  and I walked from Camp 1 into back Camp...from Camp 2 into back Camp 1...back into Camp 1.
They had not much clothes  and they said to us  \ You  you must be\  -- at that time they were called ﬁKZ 54ler ﬂ ﬁconcentration camp \  you know.
They confronted me with the fact that they had my papers and of course I was going to a concentration camp  if not worse  you know  whatever they threatened and I ended up in jail and I ended up in jail with -- a Dutch jail -- with about six women in a one person cell.
And they did f ind his wooden leg so his leg was sent to him in the camp of my parents both worked in the kitchen in the camp.
He said that was the -- they took the people to the concentration camp  and some place.
During the summertime  not to remain in New York for such a long time  we went to -- we got a job in a camp.
Was terrible  but it was terrible  but it was not so terrible as the concentration camp.
You know  but we couldn't  but we didn't eat because we didn't want to eat everything in one time.
And so he was...there have...there has been some st atements about Beck's status in the camp as being something less than heroic  but not in my conversations with people in that camp.
When you go to the camp  you were separated and where did you go?
One unusual thing in Theresienstadt was that they made dumplings  Czech dumplings  which Im sure did not exist in any other concentration Doris Rauch 24 July 7  1995 Page 24 camp.
Smelled beautifully because the barracks in that camp was freshly built.
So  somebody saw it and they took me into the camp and they gave me 25 on my back.
And they were already in a camp uh like they called lager it was the beginning where people got processed.
It -- perhaps that was the way German Jews  who had lived in Germany for such -- and I dont mean that in any demeaning way  had integrated so much that they did not view themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed themselves as Germans of a Jewish religion  i-if you understand  actually.
40 03:11:56 Well  she had her child but when she went to the camp  they say a woman with a child they took her away right away.
We used to meet a lot of the times  and he said to me  Im going to intro -- and it was a funny thing  I -- I was in the concentration camp with a guy there -- I mean   I was not in the same camp  but he was during the same time  and he got married to a girl here in the United States.
And we didnt know what I was lucky because I found I cut something  my leg  and was a not docto r  but somebody who came  helped me  and it was Polish boy who was taken from pos Poznan to concentration camp and he first saw Polish girl and he said  you from Warsaw  I heard you.
Yes  I knew about this and yes I knew about the mens camp.
The only way you could get out is from the concentration camp  on a ship  and off someplace   another country.
They were -- we were in two camps  but well make it in one camp  its too long a story.
I didn't see it  they  they locked us up in a  in an  in our first  in the first camp where we slept.
But the fact was they didn't came in to the camp.
Interview with David Schnitzer 54 July 17  2013 I went to the camp myself too.
CAMERA RELOAD] [CR#3] SWB: Before you start  tell me a little about your philosophy of running the camp.
>> Patricia Hebere rRice: And what was it like in that labor camp?
In the camp  I was only from from the D ecember [1941] 'til uh...'til uh January...I think  11th  '42.
It was amazing  I would say that 95 percent of the inmates in that camp chose not to take that piece of bread  once we knew that it was Yom Kippur.
And just -- just one second  just sorry -- May I also explain before we start  as I told you before  there were two camps  and this camp  Shtelneetsa was later liquidated and combined with the other Myoufka camp  you see?
Tell me  at this time did anybody know about some of the camp s?
As far as I know  he was the only person who ever talked his way out of a concentration camp.
While you were in this camp  did you have any idea of how the war was going outside?
The Gypsy camp is also men and women  the Terezin  the family camp is men and women.
Uh  after 2 or 3 days when we were taken  uh  kept there  we were  uh  taken by trucks to uh German uh  uh Freight railroad station  and uh  put on on cattle cars  and uh  then uh this train with approximately 1000 people left Berlin.
So you stand there do ing your thing and we knew that shortly before that the Germans -- the Gestapo had taken a bunch of fellows from the camp out somewhere in the northern part of Zealand 35 and they shot them all.
Painted by John Komski on one of his trips with the Auschwitz surveying team to explore and map territory outside the camp.
I should add that Fohrenwald was actually the last camp closed in Germany in about 1954.
And the other part of the camp were Spanish people from the Civil War.
What do you remember about the conditions there  at the camp?
While in this camp  I heard about the Normandy invasion  June 1944.
And I told her  that when I was in concentration camp  that I' m not going to make it  an d I made it.
And really honestly  it happened even if you just accidentally got three feet or  or a little bit beyond that the  the SS from there  from their tower  would always the machine gun was aimed out into  into the camp  they would shoot you so that the mass suicide stopped  but not because uh they were spiritual and  and they believed in  in something that they should have believed in  you know?
Because they took them to Poland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time.
And we could kind of talk because the camp the division was only wire so you saw what was going on next door and I mean we didnt go near the wire  because the wire were electrified you know.
It was very formal -- it was a very formal camp.
Matter of fact  not in that group  but I know my fathers -- one of his good friends from Yu goslavia originally  who was in a German concentration camp  and who came back liberated from ra -- from Germany  was caught in one of these Russian affairs  you know  taken to Russia and died in Russia.
I can tell you again  no writer in this world  to me  to read a book from concentration camp is a nothing.
However  three weeks later  at a party in the Jewish Brigade  Italian camp  she was a performer  she was an amateur singer.
And there were some parts for some milit for some other sa there was one barrack inside the camp  who also only people with high technical education work ed there.
And I also remember there came a...Pat  the British contact of mine  was just released from camp.
But my father told the story that those people who came from Poland  a couple of them who had escaped from Auschwitz  or anyhow some concentration camp  and they mentioned  they mentioned that they are killing the Jews and gassing them and  and -- And so your father had heard of that?
So we heard...heard already of the mistreatment and the atrocities that were going on in the camp  and we tried to bring...  and people in our...uh...factory tried to bring--because many of them had relatives and friends--and tried to bring them to our camp.
In that camp we got there in the beginni ng of 46  I would say  until 49  when we came to the United States.
Well  I'm sure that everbody by this time ha s seen the photographs of what the camp looked like and bodies lying in the dust  naked  a little item of clothing on  many of them not moving  some of them stirring  mostly bones; human beings  men weighing fifty  sixty pounds.
No  during this stay in Oskar Schindlers concentration camp and factory  we were not wearing any armbands.
We could have papers in the camp and some people had Swiss papers and uh we always hoped now that they will be defeated now  now they will be defeated...never were defeated.
And th ey hid in the camp and the Commander  Kramer  I 98 think was his name  he was caught.
And that's where the workers ...uh...got into the camp and these camps  they were erected overnight and...uh...that's where my brother was taken to a work camp at the 1940.
But her quality of life had diminished very much after all those years in a camp  and so I took it.
The idea that you can send packages to the -- to the concentration camp and they have mail call  and they say \ Schmul Kahn  there is a package for you.\
The one -- the only one that is -- not even a camp  it was a -- well  there was Wittenau  but in the immediate liberation period  I dont think I saw any of these skeletal survivors.
It was [speak s foreign language here] I: The hospital camp office.
They had on the north side of Tel Aviv  they had a camp with trucks.
Tell me about the hierarchy in the camp  what a Kapo was--- You have to start from the beginning for the SS first  yeah?
After liberation Rachel and Dina left Poland for Italy where they stayed in Santa ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 Cesarea in a Displaced Persons Camp.
Well  it turned out that after two weeks they decided  this is constantly going on  they were sending out 50 people to one camp  50 people to another camp.
We went back to–we were first in a DP camp in Stuttgart and then we went back to my grandmothers house.
It was called Kitchener camp because it was a Lord Kitchener who had opened this for the German young Jews.
It looks quite dim if they need that much bread  they probably get so and so many people and so actually  the existence of KZ concentration camp was known all over Germany by the way.
You know what a needle and thread was in the camp.
Stutthof was on Leipzig  a concentration camp  and we had to strip -- Now  di -- were you able to take any -- No. --
>> Bill Benson: And you had heard that you were going to end up going to a death camp.
A. In Austria I stayed in Wels and then I was transferred  I guess in about December of 1945  to a show displaced persons camp and by gosh darn in Austria.
Listen  when they came into the camp -- and Buchenwald was one of the best ca -- was one of the best camps I was in  the same thing with Dachau  Dachau was also a good camp.
Finally we found there was some camp under the Poles and four or five women invited us.
It was ve ry quiet and my aunt said  ﬁYou know  Sylvia  in comparison to Auschwitz  this is a vaca tion.ﬂ But we didnt know that was–it was no gas chambers  but it was a starvation camp.
Then  well  we had a little hospital in the camp  I remember.

Not I. They say  now I learn a lot from other people  but that wasn't in our camp.
It is actually not the camp to which we -- in -- in which we were housed while they were find -- trying to find foster parents for us  but it is the closest thing that exists today  or rather this is the only picture that -- that -- that I could find of such a camp  such a workers camp  which were used for the children.
Unfortunately  the Russian soldiers who liberated this camp didn't pay too much attention to what was going on there.
It was already I think  early March  that she got me out of that barrack into a other barrack into another part of the camp where I went to wor k  which meant that I got a bunk  and I shared the bunk with another person  and I want to tell you a little bit about that because I did something then that I have on my conscience  and I  I told you a bout my father  and I told you how I didn't cheat on Freda  and I'm proud of it  but there are some things that I did that I'm not so proud of.
There was no camp nearby that they could take us out and then put us into that camp.
Okay  were they th-they werent German soldiers then  they were foreign soldiers.
Well  the food was better because - I really got ahead of my story - but I didnt say that after we - those trucks out of Ravensbruck - that brought us in  all the so-called spots were filled with us  maid and this and the othe r  women were brought in - in fact  some of the people we knew from Poland - were brought into this camp  because there was an air force base  a German air force base  not far  a nd they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or whatever.
Now I say here concentration camp but there weren't concentration camps  they were holding places.

Krakow -- Plaszow  rather  at those days had anot her commandant than this (sounds like get) who was portrayed in Schindler's Li st because that is the same camp as is portrayed in Schindler's List.
If an individual is present in the camp as an integral part of the machinery that was putting hundreds of thousands of people to death  in that particular complex or even thousands  you had a good murder charge against them.
It was about two days after arriving to the camp in Buchenwald.
And in th is concentration camp  they kept us couple days.
My mother on her way back in May 44...I think it was in Utrecht  somewhere in a railroad station ran into a Gestapo character  green police member who could recognize falsified identify cards  nabbed her and sent her to a Dutch concentration camp  in Westerbork.

In some cases the Intelligence had reports  and I had a map  a war map showing camps at different sites of the major camps  so they kne w we were there and we would move for them and I could tell we were probably going to hit that camp in four or fi ve days and get ready for it.
>> Bill Benson: When he left you  where were you at that point?
The Germans wanted -- were afraid if something breaks out in the camp  it will go outside and they will be affected.
And I found them in the displaced persons camp  you know  in Poking and we became again  very close friends.
I was witnessing...looking out from when the aktion took place and seeing in what ways they collected the people in to what they called the Umshagplatz there in the ghetto  because because they had to take them  to take the Jews by large lorries to   uh to Borszczow to to transport them by train to uh...our area went to the annihilation camp in...oh my goodne ss  this gives me...I don't remember it so...(pause)...anyway uh the way how they did it convinced me that...until then I was not really convinced that people were uh gassed.

And I think that the reason why we really survive is the 20 years of po Polish independence  cause then we were after the 123 years of being taken by Russians  Prussians and Austrians  in this free Poland  the Pilsudskis free Poland  we it was imbued in this crowd of the old Poland  and I always was in this camp of this nation of a ma kingdom or repu blic of free nations  you know how that if you le stick together instead of qua rrel  you can be somebody.
Well  after the ambush  now  we were in that camp  trying to join the rest and just to bring to understanding an average day of life in the underground  what did it start?
Also  Auschwitz was on a Polish territory and originally Auschwitz was built to accommodate Polish political prisoners.

Oh thats no problem because this time in Warsaw mostly the gold was valuable thing and you can buy and sell and something like this  you know  and it was in my family  we was not poor people  you know  and that was one  and I never saw the girl again  she was killed or sent to concentration camp.
And from -- we landed there  and we go to concentration camp.
So -- and the Germans were afraid to go into the forest because they would encounter the resistance.
So they put us to a camp; and we were in a camp which seemed like it was a big school or someth ing.
Like  I dont know  I dont know how to tell you the certain behavior is  but theres -- theres certain instances where I can see how a survivor would behave and behaves  you know  and I can say that this is -- this is a survivor of a camp  not -- not from -- from -- coming early to this country.
She did get married  like you were mentioning  in -- at the DP camp  in Benzheim.
I but I do remember that it was a camp just next to ours.
The administrating compound is what I -- two or three streets down and blocked off by another street going to the left with the barracks with the SS troopers on this side and the barracks on the other side and the wired fences where they put the prisoners when they first came in for registration to the camp.
The first ten one thousand inmates that came from uh  from uh  Robinsbrik were the prostitute s. They were all German and prostitutes  and they became the functionaries of the women' s camp.
So he gave us a policeman and we you know went to this camp.
Then they camped us on the banks of the Seine and that wasnt very -- very nice camp  but it was just a holding camp.
You thought this was just a labor camp  it wasn't going to be so bad?
Uh  the other civilian Germans that were not in the camp but when I uh  it comes back to me very clearly again.
And I've got to tell you  being on that ship  like in three weeks I think we were in the camp before the ship arrived  and we boarded the ship.
Later on before this camp was liquidated  these two Russian prisoners were stoned to death by the other prisoners.
And that was a tremendous relief  but we could not leave the camp because we had a tremendous typhoid epidemic.
What else can you remember about life in th e camp or something that might be important to remember in history?
And I spent there some time just...uh...doing things as other prisoners and particularly taking care of cleaning the roads and the streets in concentration camp.
And what about a -- were you members of a Jewish community there?
And you didnt know what was going on with them because you were at the camp?
I dont think they believe thats Austrian  if they na -- were a criminal or the something  that they -- that they put somebody in a concentration camp  you kn ow.
And I remember when I just came out of the concentration camp  the first couple was going to get married.
I know some of my people went to concentration camp  and they dont talk about it.
He said  thats what that part of the camp was called.
We went from there  we went in the camp from there.
The other thing that was different about that camp...in in that camp for the first time I encountered uh women prisoners  Jewish women prisoners.
indecipherable] You once said to me that the SS did not have any control over the camp office.
And they was suspicious I remember at that time...you remember the camp that I told you...and they were asking questions the Germans.
Well  in the German -- in the camp in Germany I had started learning about Judaism.
And once we started with the string quartet and began to concertize in each block  we were given camp passes.
And they were telling us that going out of Auschwitz to a working camp is a rather fortunate occurrence.
And he said  would you -- would you -- but [indecipherable] it was a Cadillac  and we sa id  ﬁYes  please.ﬂ He said  ﬁHop on.ﬂ And I think that was such a glorious exit out of that prison  and the concentration camp  on the top of a manure cart.
Now  I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were allowed out of that camp that we were going to come to.
He got married and I was wandering... a young young young boy  you know  and wandering in the streets in DP camp and ...it were a hugh hugh camp with a lot of blocks  and one one one day  you know  I was coming to and I say 11 they's getting married and they getting married  you know  but not married into the talis and the   real real marriage.
I am told that it actually happened that if you fed them  they'd die and uh  in one in one uh  case we met uh  we came across an American prisoner of war camp.
Did it change the way you felt about the German people?
Can you give a little more description of the camp  and the individuals you helped there?
And I was sent for basic training to Camp Blanding in Florida   infantry basic.
And we were marched to the women s camp and when we came to the womens camp  the orchestra was welcoming us.
BB] Er  only  er we was in a  er camp  just up from our barracks as we were kicked out of our barracks to let the service men  and by then they were calling up the civilians as well  theyd taken over the barracks  we got  we got moved into what was called the Gann  the Gann  it was called  and er  I think it was er  somebody got a newspaper  there  there  they come down and told us all that the  war declared that morning. [
04:04:53 It was just unbelievable; and I figure out  if I have to stay  and I just prayed that they send me as soon as possible to a labor camp; that we're going to work.
PAUSE Uh after I was uh arrested first two times  we know the the getting worse and and uh my uh we get contact in Poland in case you...they send you to to Germany  so uh uh we somehow  you know  get a contact  so when uh when I was arrested and put in the labor camp  there was allowed once a month post card to your family  and uh I sent.
I tell you what  three years ago  as I said  Frank called me up  she saw ma -- you know  when -- how could I go from where I started in -- in Debrecen to -- you know  to go that collecting camp  its call -- called Sharvar.
But towards the -- later on we heard stories that -- not until I got to Auschwitz I heard that -- the rumors what went on.
And then when we came back  they -- they changed the feathers  because our feathers were  you know  those -- that's from goose  were very good feathers and they gave us very bad feathers back  you know  with a different material and we said  ﬁYou know  th-these weren't the quilts that we ordered.ﬂ And she got so mad  she said  ﬁYou know  you shouldn't have come back for -- f-for --ﬂ because as soon as we have an accent  they know that -- they know there was a -- a camp and that there was an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 83 Auschwitz and  ﬁYou shouldn't have come back from Auschwitz.
He was a reserve officer  that the army wasnt his thing  and he was running this camp  and he also had a a conscience  and so he decided to use his personal influence  and he he called up somebody he knew  and he I just read that in a book  I didnt know how that worked.
Did a lot of women do that  or mainly in the camp office?
Did you see  when you were recovering in the hospital  did you see other any other camp survivors  or have the opportunity to speak with any other POWs?
This is how we got togeth er--my father  my older brother and me--we got together in a DP camp in Germany.
We went with Cub Scout s of the bigger town in the area  the capital of the district where  I don't know  some 30  40  and the camp commander summoned three or four Jews who were there  Jewish boys who were there.
The man who was in charge of our camp lived right across from the camp  the camp was surrounded by barbed wires and had high towers with machine guns manned by the German soldiers.
They put us into  into the camp and inside the camp was another tent with barbed wire around it.
He was really telling them  you have a sexuality which youre only just realizing because in the camp your hair was cut  you didnt have your periods  you now do -- but he didnt say this in so many wo rds.
And there they saw actually they saw that he is Jewish  and so they took him then to Sered  and from there they took him to the concentration camp where he [inaudible] yeah  to Auschwitz  yeah.
So they took us to the camp  we have to walk to the camp.
And the next day I came back to the camp from work and that was the news what they told me that your brother's leg.
10 My other brother  as I mentioned before  we didn't know what happened to him w hen we got to the concentration camp.
As a matter of fact  she was in the same refugee camp in India with my mother.
And he was married in the ghetto and his wife  who was with me in  in the labor camp  and we were separated after liberation  she was there already.
Do you recall what a daily routine was in the Isle of Man in this camp?
In Germany  in the camp for Jewish orphans where we were.
And as we walked in on the right side into the camp  we looked back and we saw my parents  my father  my mother and sister with the little children  well that was the last time I did see them.
You said there were sewers Yes  for for the camp  yeah.
The authorities of the camp really didn't make any provisions to feed  to clothe  to house?
But we didnt go that far  we worked in the colony so it was like ten minutes from the camp.
That's interesting because in thinking about speaking with you  I know I'd hear about what this situation camp was but I guess I didnt really anticipate hearing that you would have to fight for the people over the treatment of the people.
And people were sitting  and -- and I didnt know a word of English  or -- or whatever  and I was still very much a timid person out of a camp  looking arou nd  being afraid these people are going to scream at me because my child is crying.
We had made a bet more than three years earlier on a train which took us to camp.
And I asked my cousin  \ Come with me \  because I knew there is some camp of some prisoners  Italians  and I think that maybe I can walk over there  or do something.
And I was thinking about it last discussion I heard about the choices between Peres40 and Netanyahu41 Likud42 Labor43 that if the Israelis elect Peres  they will be electing a leader who because they  if they agree with him  will work to remove the walls of the camp Israel.
Long pause JWB: JUDAH NADICH: The conditions of course varied from camp to camp.
She had heard from somebody that he was in a camp with his brother.
But my father was actually in the camp of Jasenovac and Uncle Ludva actually saw him there.
As a prisoner of war camp the Nazis didn't care how they treated the Russians so there were no beds  there were no bunks  there were concrete floors with straw thrown on them  and totally encircled by a heavy chain link fence  barbed wire  guard towers  machine guns  heavy search lights  the whole apparatus that looked like a bloody extermination camp.
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 94 So  the hu the people who were in th e camp when you say you were there two years  your youre a child.
You will go into a camp and then you don't withstand it  you just die like an animal.
I was asked to come to Germany to testify against two Nazi  former Nazi  guards.
Was taken in a camp  in lager  in camp everywhere he was.
I went through such terrible things  because when I was let out of the camp  I didnt want in any way that they knew I had been in prison.
I worked th ere in the camp and that was very good for me and the people accepted me.
And in the mean time then just abou t three years ago to ad to my other aliments I got a very sever case of shingles in my head and my eye and because of my impaired immune syst em through all the years of concentration camp I could neve r get over it.
And then the conditions there for the women were quite quite decent  but it didnt last long because they were only put there until they build a camp  the camp in Birkenau.
This dream  you -- you said that you dreamt that you were in a camp.
So In addition to the people who were sp eaking Polish  so you picked up some Polish language  who else was in the DP camp with you?
Uh Belsen did not have a gas chamber but it did have crematoria and I couldn't tell you in retrospect whether the smoke stacks were crematoria or related to the factory  but I imagine it was the crematoria because uh not long afte r the grown-ups left the camp uh there were wagons...open wagons like like carts  like the back of a horse and cart  open wagons  that were dragged along without horses.
But we were in th is camp  and they were getting ready to get a ship to take us to Israel  and a medical commission came through the camp to check the camp to make sure that all conditions were good.
What about -- you mentioned in the camp where this guy gave you -- Yeah. --
They said that all these people were lined up again and they were supposed to march from sugar refinery through the Austrian border and I always think that much too tall because that's another gathering camp.
That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people walking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the depots and whatever they could wear  the funniest outfits and funny things  and people were milling  looking for friends and that's how I went to the men's place  the men's camp to look for people from my town and people who I knew  and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye infection and got him doctors and got him to a hospital.
Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp  and you went into the camp  but I d -- I dont wish you to go there  so these a -- its an initial contradiction in the thing  and -- and I think that what we can  we have to do to -- not to live with every day  but to think of it  to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum  this is a museum of the death  and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death  and the death is -- the death -- death is horrible  its horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16.
He did his research on dwarves and twins in our camp.
No children were allowed in the labor camp  so Shmulek said to my father  Ill take care of Sarah and he took care of me.
Uh...But within the time that they were in the camp and we heard of them  we tried for the doctor and his assistant to come to our camp because we needed him more than what he was doing over there.
And of course  the story always was that the Jew  they came with nothing and now they are rich  so that is all just taken away from the German s. And stories like that  and then of course  there were also true stories of where a Jew somehow was caught having had a relationship with a non-Jewish girl and if that happened  then the Jew usually came to a concentration camp and those Jews who were there for  there was actually a term  a German term for that  which translated means sort of defilement of the race.
And one of the newsreels showed the -- a concentration camp and a guy behind us said  ﬁThats all propaganda  that never happened at all.ﬂ An American guy?
But those ladies  too  on the camp  I don't know what happened to them.
Now if that Jew was in a concentration camp --Buchenwald  Dachau or Sachsenhausen--and the Christian buyer was fairly decent and didn't know how to run the business that he just acquired from the Jew; and the wife  let's say  came to him and said  \ Do you need some help running it?\
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 3 the USSR during the war.
When I asked how do I get the wood cut  with what  and then how do I transport it from the woods into the camp.
And the Nazis it -- there's a long story about it  but we just simply don't have the time.
In back of the mans camp -- camp was a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 25 g -- Gypsy lager and now the Gypsy get recognized  unfortunately they dont -- they arent recognized as having suffered as much  but now at least  they speak out.
But when the camp was evacuated on April the sixth  the evacuated  I mean that the marching people went  and we were left who -- who couldnt walk  or couldnt march.
In the English DP camps there was very little of it  that that the DP camp in Neustadt was dominated by the majority who was Christian.
But my understanding was that at the time we got there there were about 17 000 prisoners in the camp and that they were dyi ng at the rate of about 300 a day.
So they took us to a place  a concentration camp  a subcamp of Auschwitz.
So I I had been da a couple of times during the year  I was to the commandants ca to his house  which was located right in the middle of the camp  and I was there for couple drinks and so on  I guess we had some wine and so on  but thats the only thats the only orders I had  and I was there for a year.
All of a sudden before that there were Poles that were ther e. The Russians came in and the Russians took over that camp and made it into a Russian military camp.
a Russian prisoner of war  he was in this camp too  he escaped.
So the lady who took me in went to the camp to see whether she could find my mother but she couldn't find my mother .
Also from the camp and he worked in this train and started crying about -- the toot  toot  toot and one German soldiers asked  where you going?
Henry Greenbaum: Well  we did get into a lot of trouble  not being in there I would say within about six or eight months in the slave labor camp  what happened we became very dirty  filthy because we still are wearing the same clothes as when you left the home.
Up to this day  we have friends that we lived in the displaced person camp together.
They were but I had to go into the slave labor camp myself.
But in the meantime  what had happened even before I came back  he had met a woman who had lost her husband in the concentration camp.
And say e -- in the -- in the Stutthof camp -- subcamp in Sofinbaden  there was the people from Poltuleetsa.
I re -- never went back to tep -- to Auschwitz  and na -- no -- not to any other camp.
But Georgine was shipped to a Russian camp from Auschwitz .
So it was not just the bar-mitzvah which most probably  was also being commemorated wa s -- was [indecipherable] so people did continue doing their lifecycle events  or so  and whats even more interesting in his case  is that bar-mitzvah boys received tefillin  but where do you get tefillin in a camp?
The mans camp was gone  there was a -- a Russian military company was there  so I couldnt even go through.
My mother had two sisters in Novi Sad  both of whose husbands died in labor camp a little bit later during the war  both of whom survived but their husbands didn't.
Maybe stronger because there were so many Polish women who had been there or some other camp and ghettos for a long time already.
He said  what you have just said  I can verify every word  because  he said  I was a 16 year old Jewish boy that had typhus fever  that they had pu t me into the death camp.
And so the women were they were the SS came many times to look for children  so they were hiding her in concentration camp.
Yes  every day there was beating and killi ng and smashing the prisoners  executions almost every day  every day a pill  yeah and they called the numbers going to work so what happens they take them outside the camp and executions   shoot them.
And again  like a lot of people  especially business people were arrested and sent to concentration camp  going back to 1941 and 1942.
I mean they were going  seven of them at that time and they were all around the camp.
At that time they took out 16 000 people and children  put them on trucks  sent them to the extermination camp outside Lodz  the first extermination camp.
Did you -- right after the liberation  where were you for the next few days or weeks after that?
Eisenhower  all the -- the biza -- the troops who were occupied to kick him out from the sanitorium  and let all [indecipherable] camps -- in concentration camp live in the sanitorium.
As soon as they settled on the farm -- by the way  they were in this camp where all the German Jewish men were put.
We had a series of concentration camp cases related to Mauthausen  and th -- and this is a -- a good example of how OSI operates.
I was not directly in camp  I was with the massacres  but his story is extraord inary  how he -- they were moved from camp to camp  marched in -- in the worst conditions  not fed.
the German armistice commission  meani ng colonels  majors  generals  SS  government people  came to check out who was in the camp.
And so in probably in July of 1942 after 20 months I left camp with the same social worker who escorted Hanne and her group to Le Chambon  and was bought to Talluyers.
Now  when I mentioned it contained a secret project  th is I also read up after the war although there was something known about it  something speci al about this camp.
So Zeitung came out C-A-J-T-U-N-G. How they got it printed  I don't know  I didn't ask  there are a thousand and one things that went on in the camp I had no knowledge and didn't have the time to look into.
And we went through a big gate  into a work camp.
I mean  she was in a concentration camp in Holland  and soon after that  she was sent to BergenBelsen.
CopŠ this is the picture what we got from my brother  Adolph Grunfeld  from a forced labor camp in Vysoky Tatry.
It is a  on a lake  just the other side from Germany  and there were so me very picturesque villages nearby  and I remember even though here the food was very m eager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains  and I rememb er that just above our camp  our refugee camp  there was a place  a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just di dn't give us enough energy  but we were still & RG-50.549.05*0001 61 pushing for it  we wanted to see it.
And then we came to this camp  this Birkenau camp  that was full of mud  ye s. There were lying corpses  yes  and we came to a block a nice wood block  and to a Polish blockaltester who this is nice  very block  and we always thought transport came  and they were gassing people and so were there in Brzezinka .
I says  your kids were playing up in that camp during the war  the whole time  the kids were up there.
Well  [indecipherable] itll take another four hours here  for me to ta -- you know  my life is -- is -- is very  very complicated and a few sentences I want to -- I want to mention them to you  so itll be recorded  but when we went -- when we went from Berlin to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 41 Poland  and Poland was overrun by Germany  the Germans were looking for people to take them and send them into the camp.
Pause-choking up) She is one...she is one of the few woman or persons here in the camp who manage to be still human.ﬂ I mean  I couldn't ask for a better information.
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 67 Oh  they were not in a camp  they were on the outside.
So now we knew he was a Russian prisoner of war.
Silk sock  uh stockings  and all those things  he used to tell us  pack it up  when we get home  when we come back to the barracks  next day  we're going to the woman's camp  and we're gonna give it to the women.

And I said  ﬁYou should have known better.ﬂ Has nothing to do with the concentration camp  but down deep is -- it goes back to the concentration camp  where I didnt want to do anything wrong  because it will cost me my life  or a beating  something like that.
And so uh even for people who had whatever privileges there were in that camp  time ran out for them too.
I didnt want to be the little girl who sat in class  that everybody was talking about  who was -- had come over from Germany   and her parents didnt come with her and I think her parents are in a concentration camp  and I think she was in a concentration camp.
And the killing aktion  they would kill or send people to the concentration -- extermination camp.
Thats how come we found out a little bit up the road was the British camp.
Believe me  had I been in a concentration camp at the age of 3  4  I would never be here.
Had they given you a ration before you left the camp?
And th -th -- they used to work in the Janowska camp.
The head of the Jewish congregation was married to a non-Jewish woman  so he was not in the camp  and he took over business there for us  you know?
Turned out that he -- she helped him to go to the military camp.
And one of the Germans saw it  and he called me over to the head of the camp there  was Mohwinkel He said  \ What do you mean?
That's when I found him deep in Austria  in a--in a DP camp.
And they said to me  well  you have to go back to the other camp.
And i ts a – also a miracle I went up – to camp.
She knew that my father was in a concentration camp and so on because she stayed.
So they took us again out of there  to the train.
I must tell you a story about Inga Sylten which is really like a novel.. There was an SS commander this particular camp.
I actually the re was a I told you before that the camp was bordered by one side by a rail track.
And we didnt know anyway  I didn't know this time that they are they decided already to change Budzyn for concentration camp.
My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke  never came back from it because when I went up there  I went to see him in Plaszow  in that concentration camp where it all happened  he was just a vegetable.
Then I I worked in the camp for the...partly to establish that brothel and then when I was working in the camp  I heard one day that there were British pris oners of war who had appeared in that factory and sure enough  uh what the Germans had done was uh the British  as you know from the records  had fought Rommel in North Africa  had surrendered at .
The transports  well  usually  most of them used to come in during the night  but there was some in the daytime too  when you heard that whistle from the commandant of the camp  that man  t hat the transport was coming in  and the men in the camp should get ready to unload the people  and so  that whistle was like somebody would tear out you insides  you knew here are other people  children  our  older people  people who never did anything wrong in their life  and they're going to go  and you cannot say  you cannot resist  you cannot just inside it builded up  that revenge  and that resentment  and that anger  and that pain  you know that we have builded up inside  and sometimes they came in d uring the day  and sometimes so many came in that they couldn't handle  so they would put them behind our barbed wire   and we were fenced in  and tell us just to walk back and forth  and forth and back  so what they told them that they going to work should seem to them to be the truth  and that was hard  it was hard.
I think that concentration camp people is all outside.ﬂ When my wife heard this and I did also she said to me in Yiddish because she did...the woman where we were in that place and there were so more friends  neighbors  they didn't know that.
So I went and I was there and then -- in the camp until the Germans make a ghetto.
It was -- since I have a comparison between fair and terrible  I will leave it for the next camp.
They offered a not complete but very reduced price camper-ship to the refugee kids  and I was in camp at the time of the invasion of Poland   but we all heard about it.
But the night before liberation there was a lot of -- a lot going on in the camp and people were afraid because they were going to be bombings  you know  the front was pushing towards that area.
And I wouldnt dare to touch those children because if I had touched a non Jewish child I would have been in a concentration camp the next day.
And Juliet and Al  Juliet -- wh en I had my baby  David  I wasnt allowed to have children  because in the concentra tion camp  you must have heard on the tape  they did something to me by looking for gold .
Do you remember the commander commander of the camp  Commandant Hubert  did you ever meet with him?
And in this camp also was my son and my wife  and also in this transport.
They went somewhere and bought a little bit  came back to the camp and  and sold it to the tailors and raised a little money  so small little businesses I would say the type like the years ago  the pushcart peddler.
Color  very all  very strong color  all should be if  for example  somebody Interview with Wand a Luos Lorenc May 7  2013 38can go to leave  its impossible because everybody could know that is from concentration camp.
They always took back a shift because we didn't walk back to the camp without a Nazi guard  which I would say it was a 15  20 minute to half hour walk.
Uh...they didn't need such great...uh...work force that they needed in our camp.
They were going to mines and they would carry two great stones  so they had a much harder life in the camp and also  of the survivors that came out of our group  most are women.
At that time they took us to a train and we left Auschwitz.
Those who were in the camp who got numbers and so on  there were approximately over 400 000 which were numbered and tattooed and  you know  the numbers tattooed  the tattooed number.
The theater was established and became one of the liveliest and the most exciting exponents of resilience and life in the camp.
They still came with ch ildren from some places and then you being separated and so that's what concentration camp was.
In my whole life since I was re leased from the British P.O.W. camp  was an attempt to catch up with those four years that I had lost completely  right?
We had our own prison  you know  like in a concentration camp.
I'm going to keep the uniform.ﬂ And I remember when we was in the camp  some Polish people  women  come in and ask for the Doctor  ﬁDoctor  please  my child is sick ﬂ or something like that.
And then th ey took what I said  they said to register the girls  they took into Sosnowiec to the dulac  and they sent 450 girls away  all the cream from the youngsters from our city  and they send them to a camp  Gruenberg [indecipherable] thats where I came.
When we came to Copenhagen  they put us into a...they said...from the camp in Swininger   they asked anybody who was not German to step forward and they took us to Copenhagen  and they put us into another gymnasium in Copenhagen.
For the time we're down there  every time we're up in New York  we have friends  mostly friends who were more or less either in concentration camp or in Russia.
Did you discuss any of this with any of the officers in the camp  in the Army?
I came into this camp as a youngster not knowing at all where the rest of my family is and being assigned to a barrack with lots of people  sleeping one next to the other on three rows high of berth or with some straw on it.
They stayed about three days  she and her mother in that hospital  covered with -- ... She has never seen a selection as such in camp -- I mean that she -- if she wasnt in it  that she saw a selection.
I saw it and I--that's what I wanted  and they put us in a camp called ‚Atlit. ‚
And your uncle  you say he was also in a concentration camp?
We hardly made it back  we couldnt walk  we hardly made it back to camp.
speaks foreign language here] I: People knew that there is a terri ble camp  concentration camp over there. [
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 12 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: school where they taught you how to be a Locksmith  Carpentry and other things--trades.
It -- I just though that maybe  after these people in -- had moved west  that they would want to become incorporated  included into some Jewish community outside of the camp.
They're taking us out of the camp  and they're going to kill us!\
And they took me to the infirmary on the concentration camp.
We were we were in hiding  I mean in the ghetto  in the cellar.
It was a little home which they disassembled  a log home  out in...in some village and brought back into the camp and assembled it there.
And of course they were  later we learned they were right away interned in Saint Thomas which as an internment camp for Americans  for white Russians and people that they suspected of being pro-American.
But in two months  about  in two 25 months we were called  schlosser   lock smiths in the...they should come to the blockfuhrerstube in the entrance to the camp  yes.
A spy  who detected the whole sabotage movement and identified the 4 Mr. Braun does not remember the name of this camp.
Well  we had no mirrors in the camp actually  you know  but um  yes  I  I remember that.
17 A. When it was a labor camp  there was no kill ing.
So when I come -- when my Kommando come to the camp  so I saw the whole column from my brother and he saw me.
ML: Yeah  the -- the -- this facility was run by a French chemist and two rabbis who had managed to get from the -- the camp where I was in Gurs  to this farm.
That means if I go back theyll send me to a concentration camp.
So  you did not have an experience that ot her women have had of women taking care of each other a little bit in the camp?
It may sound like an absurd question   but did you make any friends in camp?
A lot of my dads family was taken to a concentration camp and never heard from again.
I contracted it and I went to the hospital  what they called the hospital in the camp.
They tell her look...if you won't tell us the truth  you'll never come out of th e concentration camp.
Some of the guys who were in the camp were bakers  too.
In a concentration camp  it was about 350 calories a day.
They take the boats  there must have been si x  seven thousand  not only from our camp  they brought them from around the cam p. They must have brought 20 to 25 thousand people on the boat.
Our plan was to get out of there and free the...the penal camp  but we were not 10 able to do it.
Simply because they had not done e nough to get her out of the camp.
Then they took you to Penn Station  you got on a train and they took you to Camp Upton  way ou -- way out near Riverhead.
GEORGE SALTON:After we ere brought the British military to Lubeck which is in northern Germany  I found my way within a few days to a displaced persons camp run by the British in a town called Neustadt.
But it did not go to a concentration camp  it went to another camp  some kind of camp  a detention camp where as Poles we were held over there  but there were not like guards  they gave us to eat  they gave us cots to sleep on and we had like a army blanket even to cover ourselves and I remember that my mother said  this is no good  I dont like this business here  you know  with the Poles theyre going to do something with them also.
We couldn't eat with the women no more  because the women's camp  the slave labor  everything in 1944 became concentration camp.
They figured if they should happen to go through  they'll kill us all  but they left the Partisans and we went back  and at that time  they made mine fields around the camp  before there were no mine fields.
Uh  first of all he put on the list  this was how th ey actually  not Schindler  but the administration of the camp Plashow  to which his factory and the adjoining uh quarters  you know  were belonged to.
I really couldn't recall how many times -- probably Selma told about this -- 72 Dutch people  there was a rumor that they want to ran away so they took the whole 72 to Camp Three and they shot them all.
And...uh...yet...uh...when we came to the camp they separated the Jewish children and...uh...we couldn't figure it out  but we were very happy because it was good to be amongst ourselves.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 14 Yeah  you see  the camp was divided into f our parts.
See  at that time  we didnt know there is such a thing as concentration camp.
After a few months  my parents were transpo rted from Westerbork to another camp in Holland  this time in the southernmost part of Holland.
And so this cu camp in Les Milles you know how to spell it  Im sure.
And that was possible  and that -- that -- that happened in -- in some other concentration camp  that what I hear.
There were six and five and six and seven year old children who were in Auschwitz  who came from Starachowice camp.
Well  the only thing that I can remember that anybody that ever did for me  as a kind gesture from one huma n being to another  was when we were in the camp in   this is a camp where we were working in the manufacturing of ammunition and we woul d march close to an hour to the factory from the  you know  where we were stayi ng  these barracks and the same of course  coming back.
Then th ey send me to Birken Belsen but it was no more a concentration camp.
So did you become closer when you moved to the second camp?
We all thought that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come back.. But the whole thing was to trick us in  to trick us in.
But through the grace of God  we were never in a concentration camp.
All the camp consisted of elderly refugees who had been in England during the war.
And thats when Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 104he said  well  theres gonna be a camp in Dora for all slave laborers and I have to go there and get an I.D. Thats how it happened then.
Well  you know  thats like a -- its went through the camp  right away through -- through the camp  went through that we are going to try to cut the barbed wire.
And I used to go from camp to camp if I can meet anything.
I didn't get into the camp otherwise to visit the barracks.
Ther e wa s only a fear of being transferred to a different camp.
And we had huge coats  overcoats  you know  and we would uh  we inside sacks  we put  put potatoes here  potatoes here  we marched in the camp  and in each of these bunkers was a little stove.
I got up and moved around a little bit  here and there  and I dont know  I all of a sudden  I dr dont remember any more to Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 46what happened in Dachau   I wounded up in Landsberg lager s lager seven  camp seven.
So  with that  you know  they -- they took us to our -- our nurses quarters  cause we didnt go right into the camp itself then.
Was she deported to a concentration camp or - A : Yes.
I said  \ Because my parents have been in the Lodzer ghetto since 1941  and since the transports are coming now into Auschwitz  I would like to ask you if it's okay with you  sir  to bring my parents into the camp.
Interview with Anthony Acevedo October 13  2010 62 What did the Germans tell you when they decided they were going to evacuate the camp?
LaHavre  France was an embarkation  it was the this ab th where the camp embarkation camp  this is where you got on ships to go back home.
And then they -- they took away everything and I think they gave us the clothing which is striped  you saw the concentration camp.
And I think  as I mentioned earlier  our sister company -- our battalion was given the objective of liberating the camp.
So  I I was telling them I was born in Czechoslovakia   I stayed there until the age of 10  and then I and we went to Poland  and then to the ghetto  and then to my first labor camp  then concentration camp  and this much  and Israel.
In fact  at the last reunion  which was just the 55 th reunion  I was amazed  there was somebody there that was a baby in the camp  that was two or three months old when -- when -- when he was in camp.
So on one of the times that  on one of the times that my camp was being inspected  when the officers got through  there were about eight of them  and I have the listing here of all of them.
And no one experienced what the man in in Auschwitz said  the first thing you do is get out a ca a death camp.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 95 That your displaced persons camp -- Uh-huh.
And thats what the Germans Jews complained about  that the Czechs  because they were first there  had the -- the privileged status  as privileged as it can be in a camp.
And they brought us to a place  a Displaced Person (DP) camp at this point.
The camp were actually situated in a  in a woods area which was from one side bordered by a river  a small river.
>> Julie Keefer: DP camp was one room in a wooden barrack.
So  somehow that saved them from coming there in the concentration camp and being killed.
He organized this way  so on the night of May the 7th  to 9  to 9  to May the 8th  we disarmed 12 o clock at night all the soldiers  and we put them in the cellar  and we kept them till the Russians came in on the 11th of May  we were protecting the camp ourselves  we put our own people on the towers  and we kept the guard the inmate  and we closed the camp because we were surrounded with over 100 000 German sold-soldiers around because they were be tween the American  French and English troops on the West Side  and the Russian troop on the East side  and we were just in the center of the whole mess  and we put a big sign  \ Typhus inside \  so nobody could enter because the Germans were afraid that the typhus could be spread  and we put -----------because nobody---  and they lib--we were liberated by ourselves  but officially on May 11  the first Russian soldiers entered the camp.
So thats when several white buses came down to the camp.
And I -- at that time I realized what -- what happened  and -- and I was near Berlin  was some kind of a camp  I dont remember today  and I -- I was there a few -- few minute  I could not be -- until -- for a long time I could not hear anything about Holocaust  because Ive had -- when I -- I had mentioned to you during -- I -- later when I -- when I was a student at the Berlin University  for a long time I could not -- I had -- for a week or two weeks that I did not sleep at all  that each time either Gorajetski was chasing me and shooting at me again  or I was chasing Germans  and I couldnt sleep.
Nobody could could comprehend what the concentration camp wer in those years  and as I said it's very hard to understand unless you yourself go through it  went through it.
The factory was operating up north  but we were constructing the second project  and the job consisted of being marched from work everyday from this camp which was al so about four thousand people  and which was a very mixed camp.
We were billeted in some apartment buildings outside of the camp where the Nazi officers had lived.
The day before  I would say one day before the liberation of this camp  they managed  they managed us; thousands were driven out from the camp by our so -called tormentors.
Whenever I say hungry  I mean not hey  I would like to eat some  I mean hungry that you were starving  okay?
And we snuck it in and someone in the camp already knew that I had it.
A. The work camp was exactly if somebody w ould open a business of his own.
02:52:45 Now in Leipheim  how large is the DP camp office?
We didn't hear about them  we knew in the camp  we knew it exists.
And she was taken  her husband wa s taken  he was he disappeared  I think he just was taken to a concentration camp  period.
They  the Jews  who had been so severely treated by the Germans  were still behind barbed wire and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the DP camp.
So did you feel that your experience as a Polish inmate in a concentration camp was a little bit forgotten by history  in a sense?
Did you have to walk by foot from the camp to the train station?
And when they ke brought us to camp Teshuava  that used to be trees  but they cut that out for to make the camp.
but these are all published books  but we do not -- we in the museum do not publish books  but you -- Oh  by the way  when I was in the infantry  we had opened -- we had opened a concentration camp as -- I was in Patton's Army as we swept across France  Germany and Austria and it was almost like a different town every-- every day the advance was so fast -- Right. --
It wasn't easy to be in Sobib or or any other camp  I suppose  death camp.
Not only did it never occur me  but even when I was in concentration camp  I always expected to survive.
I would love to live the life my aunts  my uncles  and my parent s. To see the world Berlin  Paris  night clubs  dancing  et cetera  that part of the world  and Neustadt was just a DP camp.
But when you go into a camp  there's absolutely no purpose for that  that is of any value to mankind.
I spent in the camp right there for a solitary 5 days.
And I cannot tell you how many -- and I mean  this is my -- a handf ul of people that Ive known  you know  from camp  junior high school  says  ﬁBy the way  I knew you came from Europe  were you ﬂ -- I said  ﬁYou know  where have you been all of this time?ﬂ ﬁWell  you never talked about it.ﬂ I said  ﬁYou never asked me.ﬂ I mean  I dont go sit down at a dinner party  and say  ﬁWould you like to hear my war stories?ﬂ Some people do that  but I dont.
In Europe from 10:00 to 2:00 in the morning  they said on the radio from the Red Cross where everybody from the camp.
And they got -- they heard of it  the SS men  and they stopped the entire -- all of us  coming in from work  to the camp  and they looked all over and they said  \ You will tell us who is bringing in what.
And I -- [indecipherable] And occasionally were examined if we t ook anything into the camp  so everybody was very afraid if you took a potato or two  or a tomato or two  or some spinach underneath our clothing.
So when something  we  we could help each other  that's what we did  so  after the I don't I  I remember that the camp got bigger and bigger.
But apparently she got crazy and she got destroyed  because I was able to  to  to come into the womens  come into the women's camp once in a while by exchanging with somebody else that was carrying the kettles with food.
Could you describe what happened when you arrived in Auschwitz ?
So try  she told us  all the time to be in working camp or to follow her.
I think  basically what they did  I flew from Sweden to France  and in France the Agency picked me up and took me to a DP camp  I guess.
They took us out from our camp  from the coal mines  from everywhere  and made us march.
27 Special commando (German); A commando of Jewish prisoners in the six extermination camp selected to work in the gas chambers and crematoria.
And when I came to the camp  the camp was closed to all visitors.
And I reported to Whitehold Street  and there was a Viennese doctor  who said -- a Jewish Viennese doctor  who said  ﬁI now -- I realize  I see that you were in a camp and -- but  Im going to put on the paper that you are sick  that you are due for limited duty.
Was it possible that you were in the family camp  the Czech family camp?
Then theres no way to tell you what happened in 1942 and 43  all we knew  since we were completely isolated in the camp  without getting any news  because there was no such a thing like mail or telephone or newspapers  but in order to find out more or less what was going on  when we saw the guards were smiling  we knew things were very good for them.
Interview with Fred Gutter October 30  1999 39 Did you have to wear any identifying mark on your clothi ng showing that you were in that camp?
th-then [indecipherable] so then what happened is the camp commander let people go out sometimes if they had to go to see a dentist or a doctor or so.
Theyre not people who were -- its special to schools  like for instance who -- in -- in Ukrainian people  there was a school in Travniki  in Poland  there was a camp in Travniki  and this school was a special school to teach guards how to be cruel in a concentrati on camp.
That everybody who had something could bring it in because nobody  they didnt have to undress  like when they went to the camp in Auschwitz  they had to completely strip and everything was taken aw ay from them.
I wanted to go back to Vienna  because the last time when I saw my father  was in Kaiser (sp) concentration camp and he was came with the transport from Estonia and he was going around and asking for his little daughte rs; and I was at time in Dinawarkee  so when somebody came  th ere is a Mr. Margules who is looking for his little daugh ters  so when I heard about it   they use to send us to Kaiser to have our teeths pulled  so I thought that  said that  I have a tooth ache.
It was in a prisoner of war camp that we went to.
Left the camp on 6 th of August  42  for an unknown destination.
Only there was a door leading to it in the in this fence  and there was one prisoner on duty checking permission to from the camp  to small camp.
But  when the Germans were fleeing and trying to escape and wanted to dismantle the machinery   this nice Germans came in to our camp and asked for volunteers.
And there were maybe three or four ships but at that time there must have been 6  7000 people waiting there in this camp.
You can give them cigarettes and you can give them chocolates and they will be  will be looking away  maybe.ﬂ So I went back to the camp and took my things and told my uncle who was there with me from Belgium and his son  a cousin  that I am leaving with a friend.
But we were afraid they should leave and we started to beg them  ﬁDon't leave us  but maybe there are some still hidden in the -- in the woods and they could come and -- and hurt us.ﬂ So they said  ﬁDon't be afraid  we -- the -- the French camver all man ﬂ this was a man's camp.
And when we left camp  they had a  you know  a rude awakening  but during the life in camp  was good for them.
I was happy to see Mariani  but that was about -- I had no aba -- and gi -- at that poin -- you know  I think the camp does something to you.
In 1950  after spending five years in the displaced persons camp in Germany  Nesse emigrated to the United States.
It wasn't a resort  it was a camp  but that was the best one from all of them  so because it was really in Germany  so the German ladies  the SS women who worked in the kitchens and they worked with us.
What I wanted to ask you was  when you left Poland and came to Germany  and you put your foot do wn on German soil in this camp  what was it like for you?
If you have to fear for your own life  or for your life of your family  or life of yo ur community  you probably would do what they want you to do  if the system was like that Hitlerian system was Di when you said something before about you saw some of the concentration camp workers walking along the street Mm-hm.
She looked for him and she found him in some POW camp and make eye made eyes at the German guards to let her drop stuff for him after first they looked whats there  so therell be no weapons  anything like that.
Then they came to us to take us and she  with her husband  the two children and I went to a camp  to a big  big field where they were selling all kind of vegetables.
And in the meantime  I was with my older brother in camp in Paszow.
But she was so  she was from a camp or something  very depressed.
So I worked for them until 1956  when I came to the United States  and I married one of my former inmates in concentration camp.
And I remember when we were on the train  which ev entually ended up in Auschwitz  my father and some of his friends were looking through  you know   its trying to see where they were  which wasnt always possible  and they f -- one of them said  ﬁOtto ﬂ to my fath er  ﬁwere not going ﬂ -- itll come to me  the name of th at place  ﬁwhere we cant possibly go there  were alya -- already east of Dresden.ﬂ And thats when he changed color  and when it probably sank in  were not going to a labor camp  were going east of Dresden  were going to go to one of the camps in Poland  and I think that -- this is conjecture  I have no proof of that -- I think that maybe he did meet up with people.
He was in a different camp  his brothers-in-law were in a different.
So you -- you havent [indecipherable] When they took me out to the camp -- we were at camp  and they came in  they says anybody  Polish citizen could go if they want to do it  if you want to get out of camp you could go to the army.
The Russians came in for camp and took their own Russians.
So the pos itive side was they survived in relative okay condition  the negative that they were treating -- treated like criminals in Switzerland  in camp.
And I don't know which concentration camp he was killed in.
04:03:45 The prisoner camp  and after they separate them  SS one camp the Wehrmacht 57 in second camp  and the women was to the SS women was– and I remember it was an officer with a motorcycle come in.
Next we went to the Russians -- the Russians and the Americans were closing in from all sides.
It was to be our last camp  however  not our last transport.
And in that camp I remember there was a girl whose name I no longer remember.
Her boyfriend was in charge of the bowlightung of the camp -- building 57 office  yeah.
But which camp he died or what he died  I have very confusing or contradicting.
That was 1942  that was May 1942 he went to camp  a labor camp.
I was supposed to go to Venezuela  I told you that.
But she did remember that he was in the detention camp with us part of the time because she said that he  she remember ed him coming up and talking with my father.
Therefore  Austrian Jews returning back from concentration camp  therefore it would have been no questions asbay cause at the time  the police there  when it was  shied away from all of these things  sort of as to wash themselves of all the atrocities against the Jews they did.
How did things happen  how long were you still in Warsaw ?
And yet the Jews of the camp voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen  their complaints about Lieutenant Smith.
Thats where we fi -- thats -- that was the lifesaving part of it  because I was only in camp for 11 months.
I was sent to a gypsy camp   me and about 40  50 guys.
I think the main thing were answered in their freedom and and getting on in some shelter or away at least from that prison camp.
The next day they took us to a different bunk and that bunk had some kind of preach beds.
Because you and the other SS who are coming to the camp  and they are approaching the bad barracks where the typhoid is  they will get it  too.\
Yeah  tell me what yourŠ When we were at this camp and got this each and everyone of us used to get a piece of soap  piece of and was a ﬁjudische Seife.ﬂ35 You know what that means?
And Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 18 some ambulances were in the camp  going from the camp to th is mid station  which was just on the side of the road  it was a stable .
And in that hut were living quite a few families in the family camp  as I mentioned before.
No  only in that camp  theres -- Only in the camp.
Now we had about 20 friends who all decided they wanted to leave the Netherlands and try to escape rather than to go to a concentration camp.
I had  on the end  uh  of camp  the  I had the uh  t yphus.
So by this time I was already in other camps  uh  in the displaced person  uh  camp; and they used to bring us very often to Dachau  and they would sit us in the front the barbed wire fence.
I got an order for I think it was 50 ovens for the concentration camp in Oranienburg  near Berlin.
I did get in -- behind the camp there was this nice  rolling hill and I did get back there and inside that hill was a complete factory -- railroad tracks and everything.
Quite often  you know  when people in the beginning used to ask me how come I dont have any more children  in a joking way I used to say  ﬁBecau se I only have two arms.ﬂ If I had a few more arms  maybe I would have more chil dren  but for running away from difficult situations when I am threatened with being in camp or being that Nazis are always after me  Im running with my kids  two little kids.
We still just began to understand; but really didn't under....understand what was happening in this camp  at that point.
There were nothing in the area  usually  for many days there was always a eh British airplane hanging about the camp.
And if it wasnt  you were taken off to labor camp  and so people had plastic  white plastic things with elastic  and then the Jewish star  so the the the band was very neat and clear.
And when I was ready  I went to the office and I said  ﬁI want to go out.ﬂ They call to the camp  to the post  a nd the postman came and take me out from there.
He put me on that transport to that work camp Allweiter Rodgau  9 in Hessen-Nassau [province]  where we had to work.
standing with...with rifles on us  trained  and we saw far away from the trucks...we saw a big camp with a big door lead up with... with... with... uh... with....uh...lights lit up and they told us  \ We will march there.\
There was rationing and you had to do rationing reports which had to be typed a certain way 21 in order to get the rationing tickets to which we all were entitled to or the camp was entitled to  so there was a great deal of administrative work to be done.
And then So  and I went to a DP camp  in order to go there from there to America .
They were looking for 20 children to go -- I mean  the whole point of our being in the camp is -- wa s ba -- while they were finding us foster 120 homes  or schools to go to  or making the arra ngements.
So I live with the -- End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas and this is tape number one  si de B. Can you tell us about -- can you tell us about how you observed your faith when you were still in the camp?
You know  we could play a game  and just uh fall into the game while  while we were still in camp and we worked on the night shift.
Eventually  Susan and her mother were sent to the Kaiserwald conce ntration camp  which the green arrow points to  to do forced labor.
And they told us what the work will be and how will be the work and I was working there in the same group  until they ab andoned the camp.
Whoever couldn't take it was taken to the camp  to Camp Three and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they fell  just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was a change of people.
But that we had to go USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 63through something awful like that  and -- but just God was with us  God was good wi -- to us that we made it  you know  so -- Did you have any -- could you give any particular example when you realized that people really dont know that much  when you told them that you were in a camp  and there was maybe somebody responding in a certain way?
Neu Freimann  as I say  was a favored camp in that setting.
How much time was there at  between the beginning Well basic training was 13 weeks at that time  so I did work at the office for a little while and I thought I had it all made  that I was part of the camp and I was shipped out.
I didnt see them dead  no  but I knew them and it was it was the whole camp was  for the next few days it was it was just a horrible  horrible atmosphere in the ca-camp.
It were a a camp  like three or 400 French  German French  Italian prisoners.
Camp name was Camp Waldman and I dont think it exists today.
With our camp  was  after the uprising it was in  in October 1943  that was still in the war  so when that happened  and this  and they liquidated all of the Jews  so they just  they just  uh  erased the whole thing.
So-- There used toand it's still--Camp Ari  and I forgot were the womens'--girls' camp is called.
Do you remember the conditions of the buildings that were in the camp and approximately how many people were living in them?
The last camp I didn't work -- I worked in the kitchen.
It was uh it was my first time  even though we had of course had mock interrogations back in camp uh and trained  and be train...been trained in all sorts of things from German army organization to uh terrain intelligence - it was my first real interrogation with tough Nazis on the beaches of Normandy.
In our camp there was a very small group of women  and they were mostly in the kitchen.
And thats why they really didnt just open the– the concentration camp gates and say  ﬁGo.ﬂ Because  probably we wouldnt have been responsible what– what we would have done.
We went back to the camp to the same area we were at.
So after a couple of months  we are allowed to go home  as the...as the...as the local camp was dismantled.
Orders were made to destroy the documents in the concentration camps themselves  but in some cases this wasn't even done  or in some cases the Russians advanced so quickly that they...they still found lists of people who had been exterminated or some of the documents about the concentration camp after they'd occupied it.
You learned to build a   how to build rope bridges and how to tie knots and I learned how to sew which later on came in handy  and all the things that boy scouts generally do  singing  camp fires  things of that nature.
7 Speer  Albert (1905-1981); Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production  Thomas Buergenthal 50 November 28  1995 Page 50 former inmates in the camp and there was a little write-up of a book that had just been published  the diaries of a man  a No rwegian  who had been in Sachsenhausen so my mother said to me \ That might be your cookie -- he mi ght know who that man was.
We were given some supply of food  and we were marched out of the camp in to the darkness of the night.
The German was just outside from the camp  you know  they took care that you dont run away.
Everybody says Auschwitz  but I believe where you really drive up to is almost  its called Birkenau  I think  but -- So wer-were your barracks brick or wood?
We was walking in this wooden shoes  and this the uniform was from conciation camp  you know.
So  after three days  they send us to a camp called Retzow  which was– Wait a second - isnt it the case that somebody asked for your names and you decided you werent - one of you decided that you were not going to say a Jewish name.
>> Bill Benson: Were you segregated from the main inmate population or were you -- >> Manny Mandel: Our 1700 were in a camp.
And he says  ah  if they catch you that you are cheating their factory o-of time for the four of you  you gonna wind yourself in a worse camp than the Schmidt and Kranz .
Again uh circumstances of of luck that for which I take no responsibility and decisions that were made outside of my presence uh completely outside of any influence that we had  that some German officials in that factory or whatever  decided that it is valuable to retain this group of four hundred and fifty specialists which they considered us at that time  and had us catch up with the machinery that was being transferred to defense and uh uh absent that  we would certain not survived because working in stone quarries or salt mines or some other places was a job where one survived for only weeks and we worked with Frenchmen  uh guarded by Germans but working with Frenchmen in the factory and it was a better camp.
The following day  I sent him to work inside the camp  to a Kapo who was known as a killer  and I told him  \ Listen  this guy killed a  a prisoner.\  \
Well  the state of my health wasnt bad  because all during all during my being in camp  I kept myself clean as can be.
You knew where -- they -- they would tell you where they were from  yes  they would tell you where they were from  but -- Did you know at that time whether or not they were Jewish people or not?
In all fairness I must say that uh that camp was probably better than than most of certainly what followed because it was new.
And we were sent to Camp Richie  Camp Richie  Maryland  which is the Maryland National Guard camp  about 90 miles north of Washington.
And...uh...the camp commander  he must have been a pretty regular guy.
A. We got incorporated into the camp as prisoners of the camp.
The men and women lived in the same compartments  or big -- the camp was circled round with barbed wire and woven with branches from the green -- evergreen trees  and -- but there was many barracks was in that.
>> Leon Merrick: The Jews came into the camp  that's right.
But later on in the retrial of Frenzel  it came out that that la wyer was a commandant in a POW camp.
There was a compensation for having be en in the camp.
I remember one day  he brought our food rations from Camp 1 to Camp 2.
But the Birkenau area consisted of several camps  each camp was with a spe  with a ha d its own set of uh barbed wire. (
And the women that you said that were the prostitutes at the camp  do you know what their ethnic background -- were they Jewish?
My mother could not leave that camp to come and get me  no matter what happened to me.
So you have no idea Ephraim was not in the same camp No.
There was no place anyway  to run anyway  because all the camp was fu -- filled.
Not only did he survive from having been in Auschwitz from the earliest days  but he was sent to be a slave laborer  all though Germany during much of the war.
We went out and somehow they pick us out a -- pick us up to the place where we are cleaning the potatoes for the camp.
So luckily  after we got the visa  we were sent to the camp -- immigration camp in Br emenhaven  but we have to stay there for half year because in United States was a coal strike.
And so but yeah we went in th at sealed apartment and the Gestapo were there  two Gestapo men and yeah. .
>> Bill Benson: And on that night thousands of Jewish men were arrested and taken to a concentratio n camp.
And I remember every time I stand up to speak  it was due to them that I made the last days of camp.
So we knew he was at (inaudible) and we knew he was a medical officer because there were no doctors there so they made him a medical officer in the camp.
See in our camp there was never a selection like in the men.
Such as  well  for example  when we we re in 1943  we were in a work camp  and when that camp was dissolved  the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to be seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the ch ildren away.
So when I told this my very close friends  nobody coul d believe it  so I had the fortitude to bring this letter and to smuggle this letter with me into the camp  which was terribly dangerous certainly  but I wanted to show them also to give them some kind of courage.
It was a very brutal camp that was different from something like Auschwitz  that was ran in some sort of a very organized manner but it was equally brutal.
In the tent -- in the tent -- and no  there was food here and there.
They are separate   but actually  Buna -- this camp was in Poland too.
And when we got into the camp  the well  they call it the living camp.
Well  during the camp  I -- I -- I had -- I had occasions and instances where I was saved and I could have perished and I wasnt -- I -- I didnt perish and you know  its -- its -- it -- I had my -- my strength to believe that theres a God and the God is -- wants me to live and you know  thats what it is.
If the  if the SS will come in  there was only a few of them  if they will come in - defend yourselves  and also  he was afraid there were in Czechoslovakia from Vlasov of armies to Ukraine and the White Russians  and they will kill off some of people from 15 camp and take their identification cards and pretend that they are from camp  so protect yourselves  but I hope to see you.
Do you remember Harrison coming through to write the report for Truman about the conditions in the DP camp?
And he gave us a little bit more privileges  the father  you know  the camp director  very nice man.
What I would suggest is I do believe that Mr. Eisenberg was in the DP camp because when he wrote in one letter  he  he refers to me taking out my little book in the  and I think he said in the  in Belgium.
I don't know what he was  but he uh...maybe he was Jewish.
Be cause all the rest of the camp is divided by sex  pretty much.
The German Nazis who wanted to destroy me  they are the ones that treated me in the camp because they were prisoners of war.

I had read something -- the reason that Im asking about that is I had read something that said that the date was postponed because there were a group -- an unexpected group of SS office rs  from Osova  who came into the camp  and that was the reason why it was postponed.
