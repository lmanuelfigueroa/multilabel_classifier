Okay  but anyway  about a week or two later  I ran into her again on the same sort of line of the subway where I met her the first time and then I admitted that -- that her memory was really correct and 125 then she said  ﬁOh  that's marvelous ﬂ and ﬁlet's sit down at a cafe and -- and then have a little talk.ﬂ And I said  ﬁThat's a great idea  but I don't have a ny food ration couponsﬂ And in restaurants and cafes  you also had to pay  obviou sly  the price in mark  but in addition  which was much more important  give the food coupons   equivalent for whatever you were ordering  what -- even if it was just a piece of cake.
And you laid your bedding down  and had your food over there  whatever you had  you know  like used -- I dont rememb er what day of the week it was -- Right. --
They  they  apparently because the food was so rich--Well  I couldn't eat it  so that was lucky.
Well just the food they gave us when we left Auschwitz III  Monowitz  Buna.
Besides  we had no food and my sugar was running out  which wa s what sustained me on the way up the mountain and down the mountain.
Consequently  the kids  like myself  15 decided that we had to go outside and try and get some food.
You buy  bought some food over there and you tried to smuggle in back  into the 39 ghetto.
And then we went to our business like go to the shower and go to the food and like this.
by the peasants  knock on the door  had a gun also  told them  \ Give us food  if not we'll burn your house next time.\
Some gentiles men used to work for us  used to bring us food and used to tell us \ be careful  don't go out.\

I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my parents got in touch with a former teacher a nd they -- the teacher organized a little class of children to come to his house and study in exchange for almost anything like some food or clothing for his family.
And we were marching through the fields; and uh...there was no food.
The inflation didn't go unscathed by us and there was rationing of food and it is one of the few recollections that I have of being with my father after he had gotten back from the war and we were riding out in horse and buggy and opened freight car like in order to go to a neighboring village and buy from the farmer four geese.
01:56:53 End of Tape #1 16 Tape #2 02:01:18 I want to talk about the food collections.
I went on my own  and I took his br other  what he give me the first food in Chzanow .
My mother and -- the bombardment started and there was no food in the stores.

Especially when he died  it was– we ate it because there was nothing else  and we had food for the whole year.
But with the food  we had our own home  we had a garden we used to plant  you know  like potatoes  onions  cucumbers  everything we had for ourself.

And for a while  we thought that it couldn't be any better because the shortage of food was no shortage to us.
She heard the news over the radio and giving messages and food for several months it was.
He asked for other food  so I couldn't stand him any more.
You lined up by the time you took the food -- when they give you the food  by the time a few feet away  they grabbed it from you already.
So we went  and we walked -----------  went 12 miles  in October  in the mud  and the --I did  uh  my mother said take this and take this and maybe you'll be able to sell it  and maybe you'll be able to buy something  food or some.

Suddenly the kid was there  and there was our food and then he would slink away and disappear.
And my father also brought food  by the way from Poland.

Food was scarce and the food they gave to the prisoners was a hunger ration.
We desperately needed transportation and food and medical care to get from here to there  and eventually home.
And then they tell us to come out and they kept to cooking food for us.
After the war  life   we were all ec static obviously but there were huge shortages of everything and food was the most important .
And they fed us -- they give us food and clothing  and then the Congress took care of us.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 5 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: in the ghetto and it was a big dispute in the ghetto if we have to have a  an orchestra or no.
I wasn't a baby  you know  but I used to make pancakes and I used to make things and I used to bake and if the Russian soldier were coming  you know  from one side and to the other side  I don't recall from where they came  I always had food to give.
We know youll sit and rest here  will being some food.
And bringi ng the food  which always looked to me like some kind of a dishwater with something floating in it that looked like some burgundy sausage or something.
But the food was on the stove  I says: Don't touch it  because they probably prepared it for somebody to be poisoned.
I saw  and I saw food  I put in my pants  I bind around for the girls to bring to that hospital for the girls [indecipherable].
So even the time when we didn't have the food one evened out with the other  so we were not -- as far as that's concerned  not they fed us but we fed ourself.
And the other c ontact was when people went out to bring in the food.
And on the evening of November 2nd  a radio was in the living room  so we were having supper in the living room so we could be near the radio and hear the news and they started reading off the towns  going from west to east  which towns will be turned over to the Hungarians and he's reading Kosice  which is already eastern Slovakia and then Uzhgorod  which is in Carpathia  43 kilometers to the west of us and Mukatchevo and then Baranog and when he said Mukatchevo)  which is our town  my father virtually choked on his food  because he  let's say  put  in old expression  all his money on the Czechs.
And the servants of course that were around  were non-Jews  who served the meal s  so -- I dont think that my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- non-Jewish friends to any of these occasions.
And being eight and later nine or so  preparing food for them when the worked.
I got sick  because we couldn't understand that there's so much food and here we were going around hungry.
For the period of the time when I was bringing in the food in his bedroom from the  from the barns opposite  he lined them all up in front on the garden  on the lawn up front  and personally conducted with all of them physical exer- exercise.
And uh...we didn't have anything to sell because we sold our furniture and this sustained ourselves to live...uh...to have food come in...in...uh...and as long as we were by ourselves.
One of the things that happened  Jewish people didn't have the ration book  they couldn't get food.
Had enough to eat  but I couldnt eat too much  because of s -- [inaudible] seasick.
1941 the German came there and it didn't take lo ng that we were sent  we were there til '41 and then we were sent to Carasteenatz and that wa s like  it wasn't a jail  bu t it was a big room  a big how do you say it  I won't know how to say it in English  a big pl ace where we were all brought there and we were sleeping all on the floor and there were thousands  hu ndreds of  I would say thousands of rats  they were going over our heads during the night  I was told  I was still sleeping  because we were tired out and we got some food that time and they were cooking outside and they made the stove outside from stones and some people cooked and we had something to eat.
Now we didnt have what to do with them  so we put water in that dish we were fus -- getting our food in  put water in it  and we were throwing them in to drown them.
I don't know how mom got enough food to have enough energy to survive the next few months but she did.
Undeserved I have to say  but I got that reputation and I certainly wasn't going to refuse the food which they gave me for that call  because we needed it very badly  so uh coming back why we survived.
They got good pay  they received good food  add ..adequate housing  and they worked in the war effort.
And it -- it simply said that every possible protection is give -- to be given to the Jackass -- fact he ordered in one word  I guess he didn't realize that it was a first and a last name  family and -- and also that we are supposed to be supplied generously with food.
>> Bill Benson: You lived in these circumstances you described for us  and you're just to uching the surface  for three years in this setting with almost no food to eat most of the time as you described.
We notice that our brother is coming and he brought a can of food.
They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food.
I mean  how did you did you have any savings  did she or were you spared from these types of day to day worries  where will the food come from  how will we get by  or things like that?
Uh my father has access to food  so we send lo ts of parcels  lots of people uh parcels.
So what did he have to offer that it was so valuable to the Germans?
Father asked them is there still food in that place where he is  and they said it seems so because he's providing food for our husbands.
And the there are people  especially in Miami that ar e living out on the street and begging for food  that are concentration camp survivors and not receiv ing any money.
And he brought us present and food from [indecipherable] And then went back. --
And with that  no t for money  but for exchange and food.
She was cooked some something  some  some  some food for me  and I ate some food.
A lot of the Germans would buy -- tried to buy food to take home.
Very often I think -- we had a -- its mentioned the tape  we had a cellar in our room  and [indecipherable] in the ghetto  and we were hiding there whenever there was deportation  pretty successfully  and very often I think  maybe if we wouldnt have gone to Auschwitz  maybe if we would have been hiding there  but then I think  where would we get food?
So they gave us clothes and food and two days later the British had an honor  honor guard shooting in the air because there was so many coming I mean fished out of the water  all those  those poor dead people.
How did people organize the food and ... SONIA BRODECKI: People were baking  just strangers bringing things.
And he he look ed into it and found our address where we were at  and send us lifesaving food that were Im still grateful for it.
Went away to the food so parcel of 20 kilos  25 kilos but then I already could carry because I got used to it.
Yes  this is like a community that they grow and food and  it was a regular like an administration.
Because they never came back and then -- then it was the rumors were spreading around  so -- And have you seen any people who were punished for smuggling food?
They were allowed to bring the food down to us  but we couldnt eat it together with them upstairs.
02:04:22 We got these permits  these Laisser-passer  and it was really a game of psychology that was played constantly to make the people feel as comfortable  as safe  to ease their mind as to what the future might bring in  in more drastic measures  and like all the other population  the native indigent population of Bagneres  we stood in line with them for  for meat and food and  and anything else  clothing even.
There was a kindergarten  yeah  I attended kindergarten as I remember  but the food was  you know  a little pea soup.
The [indecipherable] smell was making us sick  not the -- not the [indecipher able] smelling food sometime  because we had been -- we had -- the food that we had eaten for -- for a long time was just bread  mainly  and some ba -- bayjay -- whats the -- what cows eat they cooked in there  and they gave them  and so on.
You didn't get any food or anything to drink  and they called when the interrogating officer called.
Shes mad because my mother doesnt let me go and -- and get food on the Aryan side  because I have Aryan looks  I mean nonJewish looks  and why dont I go and a -- why dont I go and -- and do that?
They take over us  and they give us food and clothe us and everything.
They could not persuade us because our security was such that we thought  if we walk out of there and  and we don't have and what to uh you know  what to take food  then we wouldn't be able to eat  and I also thought  if we have this uh bowl  we can go and beg for food.
Because some of the food was returned to the victims  and it wasn't enough to cook for them  so they had to bring in foods for themselves.
Because the [indecipherable] on -- you know  everybody else was on food stamps.
And the walls which they built  you know  people were smuggling because there was still some getting food.
You know  but we couldn't  but we didn't eat because we didn't want to eat everything in one time.
That was in the -- that way  but we had to work very hard  then we got food there.
Under what circumstances and when were you taken from the ghetto into a work camp?
And it was really cold and we bought a tent heater.
And if you shared a room  and you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf  it very often happened that by evening something had disappeared.
We didn't have an over-abundance of food  but we were not starving.
First of all  we had not enough food  we were just eating biscuits.
A. Well  we didn't have any food in any case so at least for seventeen hours we all fasted.
I used to bring food to the ghetto and I used to do such things that a child that age would never do  now especially.
We got out there  and and it was awesome  because when we got in there  we were welcome by the owners  and they brought us food and all that.
They would open the door and from the platform they would hand us the food.
Then they came in and they took all your silver (cough) so that there were a lot of things that my parents  I am sure  had to give away  but I am also sure that my mom  or my parents may have hidden some things  because I know that in the beginning of the war we were able to get some extra food 6 in the house.
And he did that tw ice a day  and we would share the food  and and that was for 20 days.
I di can teach them how to embroider  how to make lace  and so and said  there are a lot of girls in the village who would want this  and they would exchange my services for food.
And but this -- this is the story that is related to food.
They would interrogate them  maybe get some secrets from them  because I noticed that they were bringing them food and a couple of times they sent us to clean their barracks and they had given us food.
But my twin sister Erika brought me food like zwieback got for example.
We couldnt get anything and we didnt ha ve any savings of food or a nything by this three weeks of not traveling on that train.
Did you have food  and you had [indecipherable] Oh  we had the food.
They could give us some meat but it was so scarred [sic] scared [sic] [scarce] food.
We have never yet gotten our development  fall into the -- the range of devel -- of physical development  so that we actually had better food than -- not better  but probably more substantial  including chocolate.
She brought him sometimes food  and he wouldn't eat too much  because he was religious.
One helped the people from the camps  and then that o-organization to provide them food  and the other organizations to try to find family members  housing and so forth.
She she one minute  and she took a shawl  and brought me into a storage room where they used to prepare food for the pigs  for Interview with Ezra Sherman May 16  2014 49the for the cows and and it was there also that place  they used to warm water to cook potatoes for their she says  wait here a couple minute.
As I said  the only thing that I could th ink of was being warm  being clean and have food.
Now  if the farmer was a decent guy  he had some potatoes and food for the prisoners.
Thats mean we have two people -- bread  you know  daily bread  the breadmaker  breadmaker -- food  because was completely disaster.
Everybody had to take so much salami and other things because we were told that the food in Austria at the time was very critical  and especially there wasn't probably enough hunts for them to go out and get it.
They went over as far as Bublee with the food stuff.
Eva was not religious and she opted -- wh-when we got to Sengale and we had a list of -- of so -- so-called concentration hotels that we could request and she wanted to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 23 go to Les Auvants  there were others who off -- other ki -- hotels or places that offered kosher food  which I would have chosen.
There was a little lake nearby  people went for water to wash  or food  whatever they they were giving out ration food .
And they found diamonds  they found all kinds of things  food.
He was 44 years  its not old but the Germans done that and you dont have mu ch food to eat  you look like an old man.
It was the Sabba th food  some chicken I remember and a few other things in a bundle  dressed up as peasant woman and took off the yellow stars and we walked right out of town.
We still  ris- had to go down to the main kitchen to get the food  cause at the beginning they did not give you  for each family separate ration.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 25 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Germany or every occupied country  had on the front page a report from the front.
But that's where we laid around  and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and talked about better times which we felt we will never see.
So they send in the -- they send you some salami  some whatever  some food  and the other guys used to bring the food and hide it for -- I used to bring the salamis and everything el se and give it to the guy  the guy [indecipherable].
And the food was still...uh...pretty good there because the...the Jewish... uh... these.... uh... agency was supplying it with food.
No  I was not in my full height  I starte d growing a little bit  I thought  after that because I didnt have any food  so I dont think the food -- the gr -- the growth didnt come in til I started eating normal food again.
Two or more families in a room  no sanitation  food distribution out in the court somehow.
So at least we got a a a straw sack with new straw to sleep.
And there were ways to slip out where the work group or work brigade as they were called that worked outside  outside of the ghetto and with the knowledge  it was usually best that with the knowledge of the group leader  one could slip away either to do some trading  bartering  get food.
The people  they need food because the big city had a very good shortage of everything  and went one to another  I make myself a little money.
So the rations my mother could use from the ghetto and I ate there.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 15 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: know to write it.
She gave my mother some bread and food and of course the photograph  and mother came back to the bigger ghetto  basically again  walking with 30 kilometers.
So I took a bucket  a pot with a handle  like a bucket  and I took it out to that place where the Germans were eating and cooking their food.
And they were  they had to risk their own life of course too  to get all this  and having to take care of all those children  which I didn't know at that time  uh they they had an enormous job  so sometimes they brought me cards  and the family that I lived with had to have some help because we had no food.
We know it because a cousin of his was there and many people died because of the rich food.
But  of course  in completely different quarters  and with food and so on  supplied by the British.
We were given food  but Germans didnt have much of that.
So I went to Brooklyn and I brought in food for him  you know [indecipherable] .
So I he come and  you know  the German was like that.
But it wasn't like -- you know  sometimes you stand in line  and you say  \ No  we ran out of food.\
I don't have to buy my own food and things like this.
Yes  we had food  because we we bought it in in in a black Market?
Bu t in the meantime I learned one way to supplement the food and not to die of hunger.
Our skin was like leather  so dried out and and thick  so hard from lack of food and lack of uh whatever you normally would have had to stay healthy  so they had to take knives and cut through with knives to give us blood.
My mother felt we should all get our  a certain amount of food.
And the woman where we were gave us some bread and told us to go hide.
Of course food was very scarce so there wasn't much left.
The American troops that came in had been on C-rations or K-rations for months a nd all they wanted was some warm food and I ended up cooking pancakes.
They knew exactly who the numbers who they took and so forth  and that he would...uh....he took us into the house and gave us the first time some food which we got very very ill from eating because our stomachs had shrunk.
And in part of the kitchen  there was a big metal thing where there were shelves  and that's where the food was kept hot until  you know  it was time to serve it.
When you hungry  how to make different recipes what they gave us.
And I think we had all taken something to eat  some lunch and so on.
That could have also helped me to survive  because I wasnt as hungry  and my body did not demand as much food as other -- I -- was demanding from other people  who had a good diet.
And then the Nazi government  Norwegian  they had to give in  because the Germans would be furious if their laborers  all those  didnt get any food at all  it will stop all work.
So every time you wanted to get food  you actually bartered.
The problem was how do you get the food and bring it back?
I mean  was the same type of food  but we got more of it  we got puddings  which 74 nobody could even dream about.
We used to...uh...anyway  they used to...during the daytime  you know  they brought some... uh...food in those big  big cans like you used to carry milk and they used to bring some water  food  you know  some soup or things.
Those -- but they promised to share the food with him.
We were supplied our food from Wilno  the Wil no Ghetto was our main headquarters  you could say.
All  all the Gestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from  from Kovno.
And every day  practically every day  I had a chance to sneak away from the canal and go to farmers to beg for bread  for food.
But anyway  we had a nice dinner and they were very good to us  you know.
And right away  it had been such a way of getting organized either hiding somebody or helping somebody with food.
Honey if you gave up that  that spoon you could still manage without a spoon but that bowl  that food for  the dish for food  you were dead if you didnt have that.
So we always had -- in wintertime we still have things like potatoes and cabbage so that the f ood may not have been excellent but it was food.
And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 6 6early on enabled you to  or was an advantage as far as– you did mention that it was an advantage as far as food.
There were young women there  they knew they would never see their mothers again  so they sort of adopted my mother and my mother would tell them  ﬁYou know its going to be better  were going to get out.ﬂ And one of the strange things that -- I -- I dont know if that can -- how that con -- how a psychologist would explain it  they spoke about food.
But at the same token  they started taking my food away.
They had more energy than the Germans  because they had  I suppose  better food that th ey prepared themselves.
Then they must know each other  etcetera  and as I said  my father sent suitcase of food  etcetera.
She was going behind a German  a real German like carrying her basket with her food behind her.
Lying there [indecipherable] train in the cold without any food or anything else  and got to Buchenwald.
All of a sudden that was the Jews couldn't really buy what they wanted.
So  we came off the train in a small village and we went to a family and asked for food.
Do you tend now to have a lot of food in the house?
No furniture  we were sleeping on the floor and we were told that there is no food for the day.
Pela used to go every Sunday to church and she learned how to pray and how to act and uh then in the meantime of course our daught er developed from those wonderful things that she had around and the food she had  she developed tuberculosis and uh Pela took her to the hospital in Warsaw because uh men were afraid to  to travel.
And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families that ha d reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't fi nd anything on the black market anymore  and 21 so I had these reserves  food stocks  taken that these families had.
And hes also now a member of the Food a nd Drug industry; he goes once a month to Washington  because when they have a new drug  that has to be approved.
They have -- two buses waited for us with food  clothes  blankets  whatever we could use  and took us 12 or 15 mile eastward  right across from Netanya  a pla -- a place called Baykleet.
>> Bill Benson: That was to be your food on the train.
They thought this is a br own bag  that this is food.
But it was heavy to run and to carry; so slowly  they threw most of the food away.
And blanket  and food  and tea  and and and for the head.
And our main thing to do -- we couldnt give them a ny food  we started with sulfa drugs  sulfaphisol  because that was the antibiotic of that time.
And other than that  well  yeah  distributing whatever little food we had to some other people who had even less.
Because we were in a rural area  so we had plenty of food.
Then I go to my brother and sister  that they give me sometimes something  because they they give them  you know  some food and all this.
He ha d to find a way how to straighten everything  how to organize food  how to organize cleanliness.
Again a freight train  again overcrowding  again no food  and we had an aw ful lot of people dying in that train.
They were small areas  brick factories out under the sun and the moon  and they had no food.
I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday  but as far as the food was concerned  we didn't have the food that we had before the war.
And was the woman  Mrs. or Ms. Pukas  was sh e involved at all in the food -- getting food for you  or helping you to get food?
But I was but she I dont know  she had food  she brought me food.
Food I remember we probably didn't have any  but food you could do without.
It was a very simple food like -- but  we ll  comparing to people in the wartime  it was food.
But later it seems that there was no food for them  just for me they had some food now.
We had enough food because there was only 20 of us.
It was the -- they took the took the Germans you going to cook them and eat them.
How did you...you said you had  not a lot of food  but you were able to have three meals a day.
And -- And people were waiting at home for the food?
By the way  by that time  there was no food   nothing.
Did this affect you when you were rais ing your children  your attitude towards food?
No  he was the one who secured the food & RG-50.549.05*0001 25 by  you know  sending a contingent of people to  to get it and then we brought it back and then we  we divided it.
My grandmother was lying on a  on a dirty bed b ecause she was unable already to move from that bed  without food  and with her came to live some  a Jewish family  a young Jewish family with three little children.
That was the best thing I ever did because I had plenty of food and I brought home some food for my friends.

And the food itself was a I remember the first few days when we came  the people of there were some people there from from Constance  too  who couldnt eat it.
But on beginning only  we been happy that we have that food  you know  besides Interview with Helena Knapczyk May 10  2013 67 that.
They had nothing to eat  and the only food was what the baron had and so we told the baron that he was going to have to feed them and that we could do nothing about uh  them stealing  uh  well actually taking food  that uh  we were going to leave and that uh  uh  we we gave instructions to the people to be reasonable and fair and whatever happened after that I don't know.
They got a portion -- when food was portioned  they got higher portions.

And only every week or so I did  go back to this  the camp to collect my food and cigarettes.
An d we had amassed a lot of food from the villages during this period.
For some reason which is not understandable  were not given enough food.
Well  we ate what they gave us  which was very little.
And a few hours later he returned  but without a horse-load of food  and explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now  that they did not allow any food to leave the city.
Lucky she had that  because otherwise   if she had food   I would have probably died from eating.
She was not quite 15  and her father didn't like it so muc h. By that time  Lisa was her mother was killed in that big Aktion  so her father didn't like it that I was such an often visitor coming to the house  but I had a very good job  and I had food with me  and I had cigarettes with me and I had dry food what I used to bring from the Verpflegungsamt.
She cooking for his family  which enabled her once in a while to get some extra food to help to support the family.
In Poland  it is very important to bring the food  the priest should bless it.
Here you go to work ; the children are staying by themselves and there is no food.
And when was no more food  about two weeks after Judenrein  the SS came.
The people with trades  -----a tailor  for a shoemaker  for a man who knows to make ----  painters  they used to work in place and bring home more food  that's all; more food  that was the only thing.
It took two years almost until my body got used to food.
Youre going to feed your child food from the can  or from a jar?
And in that camp they had another camp and one tent where they put all of us.
One day we heard somebody by the door and we had to line up for food and the door opens up.
End of Tape #2 16 Tape #3 When you work outside of the Ghetto  you have an opportunity to bring in some more food  because the food was limited in the Ghett o. So  therefore  one of us  when I didn't want to work   I didn't have access to anything.
I probably wasn't the first boy to beg for food  but she was all messed up.
I committed suicide  uh  trying to  you know  cut my wrists  but this a long story  I used to  I used to bring in uh food back from the people.
It was a closed orphanage where we were given food and hea lth care  and and loving care from other children like us  only older.
You have anything -- everything what you need for food or something?
I mean we had a little bit of food with us.
And it was nearly dark  the whole day from morning  we were staying without food  without anything and waiting  if they will kill us or what will be.
My father had this one friend of his who had a restaurant  Tellenbaum  and he provided food.
And that were there to grab the food and they were exba sending all the produce Holland was known for cream and cheese and butter and all the  you know  good things in life that that was being sent to Germany  and of course that was the case.
L: I dont I remember they made a party  and they gave us some food  and that was very joyous  there was music and ever ything  but I think that was around the holidays  and thats when I remember.
And they let the Red Cross drop food in Amsterdam -- in and around Amsterdam.
We...again we had to register in the Jewish because to get some rationing  some food.
And somebody would pop up  thats enough food  I cant eat another bite.
We were told not to eat anything at all because our stomachs couldn't take any food.
They would help them to assemble their stuff  to console them  to give them whatever they had  a little food left to give them on the way.
So when I left the orphanage in 1948  some of the kids wrote me for a few years  they wrote me letters  and my parents would send the orphanage some money so the kids -- well  the kids could either have food or go to do some kind of show in Paris.
And interestingl y  about four  five weeks after we were liberated  I went to the UNRRA  the UNRRA was the U  N  R  R  A  that was the  the joint & RG-50.549.05*0001 24 committee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency supplies  food supplies  they were bringing them in.
I think it was mostly because the Italians we re taking all the food  but Im sure that also  you know  supplies couldnt come  yes.
For awhile -- I didnt even go for a long tim e there  because you know  there was no -- there was no food over there  no -- Were you parents very comforting to you?
So  he stole himself  and he took this piece of uh food what the dog had had left over.
And at that point we had very little  but we always had food.
So  in the building tr So he made he made his own furniture and cabinets  and so on  table  whatever he did.
There was a lot of fields with different type of food packed up over there.
It is a  on a lake  just the othe r side from Germany  and there were some very picturesque villages near by  and I remember even though here the food was very meager and we stil l were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains  and I remember that just abov e our camp  our refugee camp  there was a place  a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy  but we were still pushing for it  we wanted to see it.
I told him I had good food  I had sardines and wine.
I remember I had to take my own sandwich with me when I went there  but we had a lot of non-Jewish people.
I know my mother was – was given something to eat.
Do you -- do you connect -- I know you dont every day  but I mean  is there a time when you connect the fact that you were getting food for people to a time when you did not have it?
So they bought all of their prisoners and th-thats how come the Spaniard s had food.
So you had to have coupons for any kind of food that you wanted.
Every single day  a yellow pea soup and good bread  but I couldn't eat that bread any more  not in that stage  I mean I was  I hadn't had bread or decent food for  since I would say February 28th and this was May eighth and I was starving and I couldn't eat the food which they were giving us.
So  when she established a relation  my father who would give her some of the dishes whatever for  a little money  during the ghetto days she occasionally smuggled some food for us.
Was very expensive we had to give up food to be able to buy  to buy the guns  but without the guns we probably wouldn't be accepted to go to the underground.
So  we were in that camp for I guess it was about almost six weeks or so  close to six weeks and my mother had a run-in with some nuns that were put in charge of the food supply and as barracks chief my mother tried to beg  plead  borrow anything to try to get an extra ration of bread or an extra can of sardines or an extra something in each barrack.
He was in our camp  but he was planting flowers by the SS so he had a lot of food to eat.

We had to go at night or in daytime and to beg for food.
And food became a problem because as we went through the forest  we found blueberries or anything  we couldn't go ahead to have the luxury to stop at farmers until finally a few days later and closer to our areas  that's when we began to go eat.
And that really was very  very helpful  because now its summertime  the villagers have more food to exchange for for dresses  and so the situation  the food situation improved with the with the weather  you k now  spring and summer.
We had the maid  who cooked for us  I mean food was very easy  was very cheap for us  was available and was a easy life.

So  it was three shifts to cook the food and so when I worked nights  I used to say you come over and I'll give you through the window I'm going to give you a bucket of food and you saw Hannah    she sent every time another girl under the window.
But hi s wife gave me some soup and some food.
And the d at the DP camp  you were getting food?
But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition  and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months  which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the factories to work or to the -- they had a stone mine there that they were digging from.
But I I savored it  just the taste of food  was so great.
Thats how we went in and we brought our food  whatever -- whatever we could acquire during the day.
Well  you hardly could sit down in the wagons and  uh  and  uh  I don't even remember having any food.

Oh yeah  we were hungry  and that there was a terrible thing there.
There were -- a lot of people were swollen from hunger  begging for food.
Because we did not -- you know  and I used to wash my body usadine and then when we go into a village  we occupy a village or we stationed in a house and in the house there were water  I used to get water from the well and -- How did you get food?
And luckily  nothing happened  and they came -- but most of it -- I think it was many teachers that die on the way  it was very little water  very little food  and then they came up to the concentration camp  and the -- afte r about a year  the Germans [indecipherable] that little party  you know  Nazi party  they came i n. So the -- they won this fight  the teachers.
Q. The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?
Now  thanks God  my refrigerator is full of food  you know.
And all the food they had they gave it to us.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
And so I brought the food home  divide it between the children and Bela  and what was left was mine.

I know my mother was – was given something to eat.
It -- did you ever feel like there wasnt en -- enough food  or was it just an anxiety about it?
But I told you  we got a bread  and the bread  I think we didnt at e up a half from the bread.
And there was a man that was assigned to br ing us food or take out our waste  or whatever.

He brought food  which we didn't have that much of where we were.
It says a food distribution  which it probably is  I dont know.
My mother had to go out in the country  exchange her rings and everything for food  what it was like at this time.
All those uh salamis and vodkas and that  so I have uh as far as food is concerned  I was eating then it was  it was okay.

And UNRRA  this international organization which supply food for the displaced person camps  we supply us with food  with with clothing  and whatever they have.
m was involved and at the very beginning there was a lot of smuggling going between Warsaw which was the biggest center where you could get food.
And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families th at had reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the black market anymore  and so I had these reserves  food stocks  taken that these families had.
The food was not  you know...food...the Russian army never works on  you know  they used to get their own food.
Its no more no longer its yours  you you have nothing  just pack up whatever you can  food and some clothing.
And we used to have like a a an empty si can of a ration can  you know  from the food.
The only food I got when I used to go ŠŠ sorry.

They confiscated pigs and chicken and everything else and they came and they start cooking and they gave us -- and that was not very good thing because we didn't eat for so many weeks and now we got the food and many of us got really sick  diarrhea and type of illness from overeating.
But I remember some -- walking by a food store and somebody gave me an apple.
And that's the only food I ate for about 3 weeks.
And they had their little farm  you know  and they had like what to eat.
But then I started -- and then they started to bring in di fferent food  and I started to eat  and couple dis -- days later  I was -- I -- I got sick  and they took me -- they took me to a hospital.
Was from United States  from England; and we got some food from their kitchen.
I found out that her food ration was considerably better than mine.

Sort of came to life in a way  where she had been -- [indecipherable]  that's right  it was just like a miracle  because Mina was -- was in such a depression  she -- that she didn't want to eat and there  noth -- you killed yourself  I mean  to get -- to get the food.
And she made sure that we have -- food was impossible to obtain.
And the the Germans took the all the food  mostly  that they could get  ta and they didnt have enough to eat half the time  and the thats the thats the civilians.
She would slowly take the food and hide hide it behind I dont know  that wa that was where some shelves were  we found them.
Now  in Hanover  Dave  shortly after  I dont know the ex act date  Dave realized that the refugees are just lost  and h-he contacted the German authorities to -- to organize some facilities where we can get food rations  where they -- we can get housing  when the -- when we can get directions.
The soup was really watery soup and there probably was a couple slices of bread.
And he told me  I am from Breslau and we gonna get along  you gonna have food here.
After all  we were helpless  we had no means of support or help or food or whatever.
But obviously somebody noticed that she was carrying food to the barn  and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there sleeping in the you know  in the barn on the what we call it the wood and everything we just stayed there.
And as far as I remember  we did not like the food.
We couldnt eat it  because we felt something in the food  in the food.
>> Bill Benson: With your father losing his business  how was the family able to make ends meet  to be able to put food on the table?
The food was - no food and no place to stay in  and just chaos.
There were moments  you know  when we got in the piece of bread in the evening  so I ate the whole thing at once.
So we had no food  and we gotta march so many hours.
But when we got food  my mother wi ll hide it  because Italians wi -- would raid the house and look for food.
The food ca we recovered the food in the bank  was You did?
In a tent  and we used to make the heat  we used to go pick up the food in the forest.
We hardly got anything to eat and water was  there was no water.
This was winter time  we didn't go out  he used to bring us food.
Each time  we had to lin e-up  but food  like  the morning breakfast wasnt so important because many times the workers that went to the factories were buying somehow or exchanging things with the Polacks and were bringing home some bread and some other stuff.
No 42 bread (Russian) 43 Matyas Rakosi 38 food  even for everyone.
But as far as food  we didnt have mu ch  because somebody stole.
And she couldn't get any...any...any food that really was...any staple food.
But somehow they didn't give me any food and the job was very horrid.
I was struck by you telling me one time that -- because food was rationed and hard to get  they had rations for a family of free.
So we the food got worse and worse and the what ever water supply  I mean we had water but we had to be careful and of course the parties were over.
ALAN ZIMM Page 5 Was so terrible  first of all they didn't give you any food  every day when we walked out to work in the front of the steps were dead corps laying 5 of them  people starving from starvation.

I do kno w  I remember my mother talking about how har -- difficult it was to get these things  and there was one event that I guess epitomizes  that we went we were going to go to my grandparents in Deutz and we my father loaded us in the car and he had gotten apparently in in Deutz my grandparents couldnt get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh eggs  which were also in very short supply  he got them in our area  or through his friends there.
You -- you know  they th row it out so much food for the dogs there  for the cat.
So you had water and you had food and -- We had -- we had everything.
Their stomachs couldn't accept or whatever it was they got sick from.
Newspapers were brought  their exchanges with cigarettes and food and they got their news and they got what their going to do there.
But the conditions were terrible since we didn't have enough food  especially enough water  typhus came around  and when the Germans took us out  you know  everybody was emaciated already  and thats why my parents got killed in front of me.
But anyway  we were hungry at times  but not as bad as some.
Because I figure someday Im going to get out of this  I d I dont know how  but someday I will I will this will be over  and tho and the wonderful foods when youre starving  you think about food.
You bartered clothing for food whatever you co uld and you smuggled food into the ghetto.
The food ad equate and the Swiss soldiers friendly and sympathetic with our plight .ﬂ And then it goes on to tell the rest of the story.
We drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows  and we took and filled out pocket up with potatoes.
We still had food to eat because the pe ople used to come and bring us food.
But most of the time I would stay in the forest and enjoy it and bring some good food and have a drinking party.
I mean youre a noncommissioned officer but its no great fanciful existence and in Italy particularly the food was very bad and never enough.
We tell them  ma dam  give us clothes  give us food or we kill you.
And so we...we were very...you know  we didn' t eat a lot of things that were put in front of us.
And my friends in the army said they never saw such big anim als with such good food.
We got clean clothes  and we had food  potatoes in the morning  potatoes at noon  and potatoes at night.
Cu and they it was discovered because either my mother or father went into the bathroom after I came back at at some point  and saw that I was flushing food down the toilet.
The only way we had a contact with them is when they used to come and bring us the food in the morning and we were forbidden to talk to each.
Those people who were in the in the they were mostly of the Germans German people  not any others  so they had some food  and they shared some of us until we arrived in the place and destination where we wanted to be.
My mother said to my father  \ We have so much trouble for her to put a spoon of food in her mouth  (laughter) and she says she's not going to eat!\
They starved them  they beat them  they died from sickness  and all those things.
When we went on the boat  the baby died on the boat from food poisoning and died and was buried in the sea.
They were...they brought the food  you know  that little no-good food.
There was five boys and he by risking his own life  he brought us always food in the evening.
It is absolutely true because people were talking all the time about food.
And then we -- we -- a lot of people died after that  a lot of -- a lot of people from the concentration camp died because they -- they indulged with so much food that they -- they had the -- the runs.
You will have maid service  and room service  and food service  and laundry service.
And the -- the minute we came on this ship   they served supper  and I was amazed at the -- the co -- quantity of food.
After all  the food is of so dubious quality it might spoil.
And thats the sort of fo od I remember eatingŠ a lot of bread  and bread  of course  I could eat  although I really didnt have much appetite.
I went to  to ask what will be Shulmete because she shouldn't eat nobody will try to food  feed her.
They were watching what  as we were dumping  if there was any food.
Could I possibly help with getting food supplies because even had they the money  it would have been very difficult to buy food in France at that particular time in history.
He brought in bread  this and that every morning  from where he got that bread or whatever  I dont know.
And the hia HIAS  actually Joint  gave the money that what we paid for the rent  and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or something  minimum  but it was enough.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 15 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: were in the ghetto.
I remember with sorrow that not one of my girlfriends thought of coming over and bringing me some sort of food  not one of them.
I know we didn't get much there was no salt  and we had to eat the food without salt; and I couldn't eat it.
But as I say  by the time they came  they had something to eat or the Germans let them eat some.
A barter business  people brought me food and I treated th em.
And the food which we were getting was not easy to smuggle into the ghetto because they were always  the guards were searching us and we were very lucky when the guards were lenient  and we could bring something.

The Nazis were getting more and more scared  and there was hardly anything to eat because they couldnt get any food for the camps.
This did not last very long because the starvation came in very soon after the water  gas and electricity was shut off  food was shut off.
Wh en you mentioned food  we would do anything  and water  I mean anything.
The workshops for the Germans  the workshops -- like  there was a leather workshop  and there was -- there were all kinds of workshops which -- for which  you know  they were paid  and they could use the money to buy the food  and so on and so on  and -- I mean  the administration -- the administration  not individuals -- everything  the administration.
And so he did that reasonably successfully until there wasnt any more food that was hande d out  and -- and little by little the shops all closed  one after the other  after the other  and had heavy wooden shutters to protect them from vandalism and people growing quite desperate fo r food.
And that was a reasonably good place to work because while you were doing it you had enough food.
Just got a little piece of bread  a little bit of food  not much for the day.
Did you try with some desperation to get food  to get more food  rather?
I know my mother was – was given something to eat.
Over there they opened up  we came to Buchenwald and everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them.
04:06:03 Then food didn't mean -- a particular food didn't mean too much .

But she brought me soup and piece of bread for it.
Of course  our neighbors did not come to see us  nor did they come to ask if we needed any food or any help.
And she had a little bit of a position  and she was in Auschwitz a long time so she established herself already a little bit and...uh...after meeting her through a barbed wire  she managed to...uh...ge t me some extra food which was a great deal.
And so my my brother arrived with with food  to Agrinion .
And they ha d water in the place  and food 46 stored  some dry food.
Every morning we had black coffee and a piece of bread.

And later on  she got -- I would have a very difficult time  but Irene us ually had everything when it comes to food.
We know you have camps for internees  refugees  just to work and for food.
We made use of the time  since the Rachen was a slaughter house  that the slaughter house became busy  slaughtering meat  and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the forest by a contingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on  and they were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the forest  which only a few people knew.
But again  because of the extended period of no food  thousands of people died of starvation.
I was lucky that I start working with assorting clothes; so I had a chance to steal food from the  from the backpacks what the Dutch people brought when there was transport.
What we was frightened  the kapos because they want to show the SS how good they are  they no have to work  you know  they just you know  had a better food  you know  plenty food  you know  and of course you know  hey kapos  you gotta be careful with the kapos.
And then we had various other  I mean there was a whole bunch of people who we relied on to obtain food and for the money  as I said  we paid  I used the money gr adually that I obtained from the assets of my father that I talked about earlier.
You also were involved to some degree in -- in food and relief efforts  right  because [indecipherable] people were coming back Yeah  I was -- not officially.
Were there any activities  anything other than work  come home  make food?
I 34 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD was not quite 7.

Those people where they were before me  they prepared for the winter  food.
So you couldnt tra Or when people were stand in 1940  we had to buy the yellow star and we had to stay in line to get the food rations  because food was on rations.
As you were carrying the bundles of clothing to the women prisoners who did the cleaning and disinfecting of the clothes  and all of a sudden the cane crook the handle of the cane is behind your neck  and your neck and he pulls you down  he drops y ou  you drop your bundle and he pokes with that stick in th e in there  in the clothes and he finds some food and he before you even turn around he smacks you right over the head with the cane  and he would ask  to what Jewish sow are you ta king this?
The Germans then stuck us in cattle trucks  forty in a truck  and took me then I was in the truck for two days  no food  and we all had the runs  just imagine how humiliating it is in those trucks with no toilets nothing and we used one of the corners as a toilet.
The prisoners themselves   today  theyre interested in one thing  to have food  to have medical care  to -- not to e -- be exposed to brut ality by their guards  but -- and some of them may be interested in the jury le g -- jury -- legal system  yeah?
Yes  there was a lot of food that you really would have wanted  but you ate what you were given.
So basically what I needed is to earn enough money to buy food.
It took a long time for the food to come in.
But  as time went on  you know  we -- as I told you how we got -- you know  we surrounded their food depots.
But anything that was alive those days was doomed to be killed for food.
Within a half an hour everything was OK  and they had food. (
So the first thing what I had was food because I was hungry  for two days and two nights I didn't eat.
What I remember also  there was a hierarchy  yo u know  in my house  so when we sat around the table  the food was passed by the maids  first to my grandmother  then to my mother  then to my father  then to my sister  and I was always the last one to be served.
Its ironic  they came from Siberia  th -- and they escaped from the Siberia [indecipherable] and they -- now they say whoever it could made -- took off and got further into Germany -- into Germany where they had DP camps  at least in a place wh ere th -- at least lay down and have foo -- enough food to eat not to be hungry again  you know  whatever food it was  but it was food to s -- to s -- to survive until each one found somebody else or so mething like that  from the camps or that family out in the different countries or something like that  and they -- Why -- why did you choose to go to Bergen -Belsen rather than any other DP camp?
But we...but that time we already had something to eat  you know.
So it was like uh  we were chased around  want to buy food or get food  and later on  we came in   and they saying \ Gentlemen  how can we help you?\
You see  the -- whatever they officially send in  that the ghetto can afford  it was divided by the corporation  by so many  and we have distribution points  and we gave out  whenever this [indecipherable] what is the number of people in this area  and we gave them as much peopl e a -- a -- as much food as was there.
So they gave us two rooms there  and it was dirty and no food.
So we were there Were you was this the place where you finally had good food?
And there have been respectable people  and because the other [indecipherable] was liquidated  so they called me  and they ask me if I want to take over food supply  and to be in charge like a chef  they call it a boss  over there on the Reinspookstrasser.
And were your warm  did you have enough food  do you remember -- No  food  we were always hungry  no.

We might have gotten ration food  like a thousand calories a day for a person which was...and the bread was almost not edible  and then you had to stay in line for the bread even though you had the coupons and I remember I did not want my father to stay  because I was afraid for them so I would get up like two o'clock in the morning and get in front of the bakery and the bakery would open up like nine  ten o'clock.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 19 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: the United States.
We were terribly hungry  and we couldn't that terrible food that they gave  some very watery soup with uh a few beets inside  and a tiny piece of bread every day  which also caused our dysentery  it was this kind of bread.
It was called  had the name here  called the German Food Commission  I believe.
We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night.
I have  until today  I feel really bad  because no food.
So  man  and we got food  we got shoes  we got clothes.
What we didn't know in 1945 that the war was really coming to the end and one day was announcement that we should...if want to the ...the warehouse where they kept the clothes and food and so on  if you want to get...all we want to take all the bread we can carry  all the clothes we can put on...they open up the warehouses and then they line us up on the march.
We could order people to bring when we come next day this kind of food  fruit  whatever th ey needed.
So we  were sometimes as long as three days without food and in a bunker.
And we still were hungry all the time even though we could get as much food as we want ed.
But nobody else would–they would bring in food  take it back and thats it.
There was no food  there were no utilities  and everybody had to fend itself  and we used to live on coupons.
We we nt out for dinner in Lille and there wasnt much to eat in 45 in Lille  food was rationed.
We got less and less food  and we were...while our... Our condition was so deteriorated that some peopled started to get shingles.
Til later in the war  then my hus -- my mother gave some food for -- his father was in the hospital  and his mother picked it up.
So  the little piece of grass on the ground was eat  it was food.
They told him they go pay when you want to go pay  but you got to have food to eat and they got a lot of children  and it was a lot of groups  big groups.
I had to find food for them and to keep them alive.
But we ate  and and then this period when my dad was there  before Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 89 between Les Milles and Les Milles   you know  he came home one day and said  oh  you know  there was there was no food in France .
They didnt take me with them  but they said afterwards when it was found out  that it was me who had taken the food.
And she wa -- had to tell who -- to whom she got th e food parcel and she got the food parcel to a Jewish family  because she said they didnt have anything.
The main thing so we were not hungry  we had bread .
My aunt told Bertle when we came that Herman used to hide food all over the house because he was hungry  and do things like that.
And interes tingly  about four  five weeks after we were liberated  I went to the UNRRA  the UNRRA was the U  N  R  R  A  that was the  the joint committee of the Jewish Re lief and you coul d go there and you could get some emergency supplies  food supplies  they were bringing them in.
ﬁOh  you got some food  good.ﬂ But you know  there was a lot of -- had to take it out and hide all this stuff  the contraband.
yeah  its not the first time sh e went to him to give him food.
But immediately we felt there was some lack of food  started they all they started to how you would call it?
What happened to Evie  when those farmer  they woul d like to give her food  but they figure maybe tomorrow they will need it  because they are not sure.
So we got some food and  and  and Zulage 33 we used to call it  the Zulage.
You can imagine that's a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 story we could spend a lot of time on.
I remember we used to disguise ourselves a wearing shawls and peasant cloths and at night to to the villages and carry these good in exchange for food and many times these farmers would take there goods and not give us the farmers food and we would come back empty ha nded.
And they had set up this commission to supply fresh food for the camps.
We ll  of course  they sent us the kind of food you had to cook.
The food was barely edible  I remember one particular incident  it so happens I hate broccoli  and they had broccoli soup for 3 days in a row  and for 3 days in a row I didn't eat anything  just dry bread.
We -- at least we got something  a piece of bread in the morning and in the evening and lunchtime we had the soup.
We had very little food  and there was just no way that we ever found out what was going to happen to us.
What kind of food did they pass to you  do you recall?
Q. Was there any way to get extra food or different kinds of food?
Well  during the period when I was walking the street  there were days that I couldn't get any food cause I was afraid to go in certain areas in case somebody will see me.
I went -- found -- of course that was in the days before the supermarket  so in other words  you had to go to the butcher separately and to the baker and to the dairy  for each particular type of food.
But Bertle had a boyfriend who was a butcher so she had a sausage.
They tasted horrible but we managed to at least eat that.
Now you know  I can just imagine what scrounging for food -- th e loss of dignity  being kicked around  being cursed at -- I sort of took that in stride.
He gave me some food  whatever he had and he kept me till dark but he told me that...exact...he gave me an exact that over there and there are Jewish families  in the woods hiding  from another city  .
And so this is we we got in the taxi with some blankets  and you know  some household ma equipment  materials that we brought with us  and so we left the city.
The Americans in those days were issued with what was called Compo parcels so  of course we found a lot of them with food in  some had cigarettes in  some had gum in.
Then we were sleeping outside on the outer fields and our food was only snow.
Well they started  had to stand in line for some bread.
There was so much food these people had  and they were rich  why couldnt they feed a fam ily  or keep two kids together?
If somebody was liberated by the American soldiers  they gave them very little food until they could have something.
And you know  she she said  yeah  when you talk  s-speaking German  tomorrow you go to [indecipherable] place where they kept the food for SS  for this soldier who For the guards.
We just used to see a hand stretching out  placing that food  that piece of bread and water and just retrieve right away.
They have better food over Was better food than Pionki .
And  you know  still  we were so starved that some of the prisoners tried to grab that decomposed food and eat  and these guys that was guarding us  they were wearing arm bands of surrender but they still were shooting at the prisoners trying to grab a hold of this and quite a few people were shot close to liberation that way.
But they were also herded to somewhere and how they would sit in the compartment and sharing a cup of something or other  some food  they shared one cup will contain a drinking out of it all at the same time  going from one to the other and they were with a watchman.
My father  who is not a pack rat  kept the bill for four people and supposed food  for each of two months kept it for two months because he had two sons.
We had no food with us or anything with us because we were supposed to be there for eight or nine days.
I mean  I remember always in army  I dont know if I said it  I had to pick up food for my block  and I -- they hit me on my behind.
And then  this time was very bad  because the -- i-it was -- th -- it was big problem with food.
They gave us food  and the following day we are trying to get in the worst way to go back to Bergen.
So then remains these that uh my my husband hold the the ...the contact between the Embassy  between the safe houses to bring something  more and more shutzpasses  more...a little food and this was the maximum what in this this situation was poss....possible to make.
And when you had enough food  when they were cooking  you could eat all you wanted and the baked biscuits and the baked rolls  you know.

I was the only one to show in the dining room  there was marvelous food but there was  I remember this waitress that  eat more!
But food was all at our house  everything  laundry  food  everything.
Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23  2015 56 Well  we had a reasonable amount of food  I suppose.
So we prepared food that would withstand  have something to take with us.
And after it was Judenrein in all Upper Silesia and we got food from the Jewish community.
And she used to give me an extra piece of bread.
And he was davening one night and a Russian soldier saw him and said  Im Jewish too  Ill get you enough food.
You dont have to work  you have bed  and you have food  and you have -- I want to be independent.
And so at and also  food was getting shorter  and it was cold.
And then one of us would deliver it  because they were piecemeal  they were made for someone and then we would deliver it  and  she also worked in a restaurant   because by her working in a restaurant we were able to go have dinner there  so it helped with the food.
But the ambiance  and the work that is not work  and the food that isnt food  and the constant roll calls  and the threats if you dont show on roll call everybody else gets killed and all this  this has another dimension.
But anyway  we were hungry at times  but not as bad as some.
We asked the lady to take us out so we could buy some food for ourselves.
The food was not to survive no matte r how strong you are for six months  you know.
We heard about it from the son of this man who came to warn 01:23: us and this son  he was bringing us food into the forest.
Not really  when it comes to food I wouldn t -- well  I still adhere to the German foods a lot.

We got -- we didnt have enough food  we dont have nothing.
You know  they  they wanted to be paid and they wanted to be paid for the food at least and for the room so mother and I we went  one night somebody said there's going to be a  said it's going to be uh some you know people going to be picked up tonight so we went into this room.
And the way and the way we lived is that my my father would get so mebody who would give him things that you can exchange for food or or other necessities.
So he was working for the Kommando  for the Luftgaukommando 64 -- that mean they make the graves and the holes in the special machine guns against the planes  and they receive very good food  the Germans -- but he was in the commander and they have a couple men with him.
People have to have an outlet for all their feelings  so they fight for food.
And not much  you know  it was a very boring life  scary  hungry  no food  no nothing.
So when we woul d go in  we would find maybe some food over there.
Then their stomachs were not accustomed to have normal food and plenty of food.
A few days later we saw trains going day and night out of Poland with everything they could get...put their hands on and they were at that time making the Ribenthrow -Molotov Pact and felt obliged to give them food and assistance to kill everything that is...uh...capitalist.
Did he come to her afte r she found after you had He came probably a short time before we came  because he was caught by the Gestapo and accused of trading the points  you know  which were given for for for food.
They were distributing the food in metal cans and they were rusting.

The German doctor actually it was a French lady doctor  she thought I was get blood I mean food poisoning  she hovered over me constantly.
So as far as I know  normal food that she would normally prepare  you know  thats what we had.
And they brought us into this -- which they established  a DP camp and there were peopl e there already and they had given us a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 17 shower and they gave us -- they deloused us and they gave us clean clothes and they gave us food and they -- medical attention for t hose that needed medical attention and I remember them telling us  eat slowly  just a little bit of soup  just -- and -- and I just wanted to take all of that in at one point  you know  but I must say at that point  they were good to us  they were nice.
And did you bring the food to him  at the place of business?
A. Physically they give you the same th ing  the same food.
How di d you manage to make ends meet  put food on the table with your rations; as you said  a quarter loaf of bread and a little bit of kerosene?
And he tasted it  you know  and he asked me so many questions about food but I had to answer them you know  because we...we had to have a special permit to have that kitchen.
I could have food and safety and shelter and disease free.
I had to pay everything and he was not satisfied with the food that my sister made.
My childs legs are frozen  Sarahs legs .ﬂ So she say -- she gave me some bandages to cover the wounds and she gave us food and my mom took out her wedding band and gave it to them because we didnt have money to pay.
As far as how people  people that wanted to help us out and they wanted to offer us food some of them would offer what they had and that was pork and other meats  but coming from a background like we did  we refused the type of food that they offered us since it's not kosher.
There isnt any place.ﬂ I said  ﬁThey cant get any food  Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 38 July 14  1995 nobodyll have anything to do with them.ﬂ And the next night  they were all off.
So I made two trips there and I brought some food and she in troduced me to the leader of the town and said  its my cousin  we should get food rations.
She was stealing it  but she was supplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew  they noticed that I went out to get whatever  they were already waiting.

15 gates and locks  and we carried off a couple of hundred pounds of food and clothes.
We would have been glad to stand with all that food loaded on that wagon  I mean  they don't realize what they have.
The food shortage was worse at Rhodes  and moreso in Jewish neighborhoods.
And one morning when there was market day our old maid came to visit the city to see if somebody is home and when she found me there she begged herself that she doesn't want to get paid just food with us and live with us and she wants to come back.
The family that she maintained contact with was sending to her packages  food packages  monthly so nobody could suspect that she was Jewish  because if you have family outside and they send you food packages  then you definitely Jews did not have anybody who was sending daily packages.
But in some families  they were fighting for the bite of food.
We came to camp and all of us were told to bring certain food for the journey including some canned goods and a couple things.
And I ha ve no idea what happened  but the next– my aunt was with me in the room and the  the Ru ssian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few hours later and she said  ﬁDon t worry  everything is going to be fine.ﬂ And the next morning  we were given back th e cart  the horse  the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go.

First of all  pack ages were sent to us of clothing and food  and some of the food we didnt quite know what to do with  what it is.
And I was dishing out food and everybody came over  ﬁJospele  Jospele  give me some food.ﬂ Just pour it in.
Usually we we went out what if they ne ed for another from from another if they need something special food for the German  for the ca mp or for the Germans  we took this on the trucks or on the on our  we brought this in camp.
They used to beat you up every time you you you had to to work  I mean without almost without food  but constantly  and under supervision  and within the cold weather  t hey they used to put a a some a a side fire in our work.
So you dont have any -- I had my brother-in-law  I th ink he brought some food  yeah.
The people  the Danish people were rushing to us and brought us all kinds of things  cookies  chocolates   food  drink  everything .
All the other children simply tried to help out at home and do whatever they could in order to bring in some food to the house  bring in some coal  bring in so me kerosene.
Wh at you had was a backpack  a roll where you had your pillow  your linen  and you put in some food or anything.
You know  there was arranged a -- a big room with food  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 37the bananas and everything.
And then I was in a -- in a house  private house  where the -- the woman made out of it  a little hotel  like a little inn  with food and everything.
Because many young people who had been liberated by the British or by the Americans died right away because their body wasn't used to have normal food  what they call normal food today in order to dige st.
One thing that might be interesting to you is that I think they put something in our food  or maybe it was just the nourishment itself  but the -- most women didnt menistrate any more.
And we  we ate just our rations  our K-rations that we were  you know  that we had.
And -- and then we tried to walk from one vi llage to another village  trying to get some food  we were hungry.
There was also a system of food rations that people were entitled to about 200 calories per day.
Yeah  everybody was hungry  you know  hungry  I will tell you.
laughing) But you got a little bit of extra food by doing that?
And that day my...my parents went to the market for food up...uptown and we were alone left.
That's what the German propaganda announced : we going to send you to factories ; you're going to have more food.
So they take a tremendous crate and they bring it up and it's food collected from Norwegian childre n with a letter from him saying that he's the person and  you know  how delighted he was that I'm alive because he thought that I had died in the camp and as a result that's why the book was dedicated to me  among others  because he thought that I hadn't su rvived.
Not because there wasnt enough food  but because  I suppose  the matron  and the sister learned at some school or other  you give so many grams of these vegetable  so many grams of that vegetable  and so many grams of meat.
I d -- I really dont know how these people fought  because they were -- they didnt change their uniforms  they were dirty  they had all so rts of food that was unthinkable  and they were fighting.
I'm sure in part this was due to the fact that they hadn't anticipated taking 15 or 20 kids and with the Germans occupying all of France  what little food there was  was number one the Germans take priority on all food supplies.
But they gave you food  and you got clothe s  so much clothes and what what you needed.
It was  if you had money  it wasnt ha rd to get food.
We couldn't eat and we were in the ghetto for about two weeks before the Russians came in  and what I had heard about uh...the ghetto days are very hazy as far as I'm concerned because I kept fainting from the lack of food and my mother told me that I didn't have food for three  four days before the Russians came to liberate  so my recollection of the ghetto days are very hazy.
But Edith was so intelligent and so smart; and she said  \ You know  this is so wonderful; because only the most enlightened pe ople eat this kind of very elegant food.
They were sufficiently well off for my mother to have one or two household helps  because in those days you didnt have dishwashers  and you couldnt go to the gr-grocery store a nd get prepared food  so it was a lot more work to feed four children and a husband.
But we had to have the food  but straight away I used that that I am hom e for something good; because you can do good even where is impossible.

I was freezing  was not much I remember they put fences there  and we were sleeping in a tent in Israel because there was not enough space  and and it was very cold and freezing  and not enough food over there to and  by the way  on the boat to to Israel was not enough food to eat also  and every day we ate only fish.

This experience kind of splits into two  because of the fact that there wasn't enough food to satisfy the people's hunge r  and because of the fact that we had a number of Polish employees working at the fact ory also... that was already producing artilery shells  just the casings... I felt that it was a good opportunity to put in maybe a few extra hours for the Pole  and as a result  he'd give me bread or anything else to eat.
They got to our house to the kitchen  and they were eating food in our kitchen.
We could sometimes -- of course we couldn't get the amount of food which we needed  but we still could get some food.

He is the man that  he is the one that was risking hi s life for everybody to bring these people food and these  and get out and get the food  because we had no problem getting the food  there was just the risk to go out to get it.
But another guy  another peasant man gave us some food  a piece of bread probably.
We had special hours when we were allowed to buy food  exact hours.
And they didnt want to have anything to do with us  especially the Polish Jews  who had been there much longer than any one of us  so any new person who arrived was just -- they probably felt depriving them of food and so -- you know  its -- its very hard to understand  we were all Jews  but we -- we were not supportive of each other.
I was put in some attic  you know  and kept there for days in a row without being even able to go to the  to the rest room  or  you know  being delivered food like to  to a pet or animal  you know.
So when we were in the ghetto in Solopvina we had tremendous suffering because aside from everything  sleeping on the floor and things like that  we just didnt have food.

And you Interview with Michael Lin February 27  2000 64would do 12 hour shift with very little food.
And so we...we were very...you know  we didn' t eat a lot of things that were put in front of us.
And I got so scared that I fell down  together with a tray  with the food on the tray.
We hired some people  our wo men taught the Japanese chefs how to make good food  etcetera.
I was not conscious of it before the war  but only after the war people talked about the food habits in the camps  and those were my habits.
But when she did go out  she did not eat kosher food  okay?
Food  you know  to help whoever was left  or whoeve r survived.

We used to go at night to the farmers to beg.
I know we wanted to walk and get something to eat.
But they were allowed  and my mother was allowed to send packages  food packages.
So  as we were entering  the girl who stood guard to the entrance of Kanada  a little girl whose name was Fela   she saw the difference between the other women  the way what they looked like  and us  and she knew that this is like  you know  like something non-existent  because the people who worked in Kanada  they have access to food because the food was brought with the transport.
They needed over there to keep an eye to give out the supply ...food supply  what it came from the Red Cross.

I remember milk so distinctly  finally I am full  Ive eaten good food.
So I was going to carry the food  the bread  the evening meal .
So we ate up all the food that the farmer prepared for the animals  for the pigs and cows.
He visited all of these students at least once a week bringing them food on condition that they tell nobody.
They spoke Yiddish when they didnt want me to understand which was e nough so that I did understand Yiddish.
So they would pick up food once a week for three people  and they would share it with me.
You gave them  told them to bring in stuff but they need it for themself.
And there they did give us some to eat or drink.
And then every day we used to get what we ca lled potato soup  a la dle of soup  that was all we had.
That they -- women in Au schwitz didnt menstruate as far as I know  because they said that that was brum that was in the food.
We didn't get caught because that was uh  taboo  of course  going into German homes and grabbing food.
And the sisters at the convent  every day put food next to the fence  and we had cut a hole in it  and I would -- was one of the persons who was designated to bring the food to the hut.
The seals-- The seals  the fact that we couldn't go to school  the fact that they stamped our ration cards and our identification cards ﬁJuif ﬂ which made it difficult frequently  because if you dealt with those--for example there was a great food shortage in the south of France and when you start in line  people queue for four o'clock and suddenly you come with your ﬁJuifﬂ there  sometimes pe ople just pushed ahead of you and you weren't going to say anything about it.
And Hilde said  ﬁYou know  I cant eat my food  do you want to finish it?ﬂ So I finished her food.
But by the standards of Halberstadt  it was not considered to be so  because people were either extremely Orthodox -- and I remember my mother saying [indecipherable] kosher  which means we are new kosher  and that meant were not so terribly strict.
Pretty routine  but you went -- that was  again  became the norm  and you -- you took what you got and you went on line in order to get your food  that was -- you came every day  you ate this  and -- Right.
Everybody would lower their food on the street  because that meant death  you see.
I uh  it came to uh  uh distributing the food that afternoon  and I told the man who did give the food out  \ Give him a full \  uh  how you call it...\ A container.
Lot of people didn't like the food that they were giving  so they refused to eat it.
And is -- was -- did you have a favorite food?
And we started to go house to house  and asked for food.
So -- and then you come back  you know  this so and so had a little extra food today  you know  and sometimes somebody would st eal somebodys food.
We got food like normal  four ounces of black bread  coffee  black coffee  and in the evening you got a soup.
Some people...I I had an old...a can  a can and I just...I could get my soup  and I also had...I don't know from 19 where I had it...a spoon  but there were people who had nothing of this  so they would get their food in a big washing...wash dish for let's say six people  and now imagine how can you get your food...how can you fish out part of the soup and the potatoes...there were potatoes in it...if you have no instrument  you know  utensil to take it out.
They sometimes will kill  because staying alive might say -- might need food and if there is very little food  you have to -- might have to do something to get it.
Uh but uh we were in the ghetto for 3 years before we were evacuated when the Russian front came closer uh and uh I attribute my mothers ability to support us with food  beyond the bread and--and the marmalade or whatever we got for rations.
And I dont know [indecipherable] so get married  because I I wa I dont want to give you any food.
>> Bill Benson: They were able to continue that for a while?
So  I said  I'll talk German and I'll get some food out of these guys.
If you gave him a piece of food and said \ From the Jew\  he ate it.
We had to go to wor k  and food was bad.
One was we my parents had  as I said earlier  they had stored a lot of food in the the bank.
So the the in order to buy shoes  or to buy any kind of a food th at you wanted  you had to exchange for something else.
Except -- yeah  to go down to the food  you know  for the food.
We did not have contact with them  but sometimes we walked on the way back to camp into the train we walked past prisoner of war camps and sometimes they would feel sorry for us and throw some food in between us to be picked up.
The lady is scraping out that horses skull for food and eating it.
But again  this aunt of ours  of mine  who played such an important role in saving all of us  again  she and I  we teamed up a nd went  which was very customary then for city people to do  took jewelry and poss essions of the family that we th ought farmers migh t like to have and we could put on our bod y  and walked about  I would say  thirty  forty kilometer  about twenty miles from Budapest  and exchange it for food.
Before I went to the ghetto  I went to a place where the Germans were having a field kitchen  eating their meal.
We didn't know what was going out without the ghetto...out from the ghetto.
I said to my husband  ﬁGod  we should ha ve had all that stuff during the war.ﬂ Because the shelves were with all of those different bran ds of -- of food  and cans  and oh  what a choice you had.
We vegetated there for about two weeks  followed by yet another march and three - day train trip  without food  of course.
We were trying to put together every scrap of food that we could put our hands on.
The el ements nor did have we food  nor did we have enough clothing in sub-zero weather  in cold.
You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on.
And she and her mother prepared some food  and I was already getting nervous because the curfew hour was coming.
And -- and then when you did come with the food  who was going to get there before you  t-to -- over your head  you see?
But the the Joint Distribution Committee came in immediately with food and with equipment and I was amongst the first that was standing there and I have a picture with me with little children where we're giving them food baskets and and trying to show them that there are other people out there who care for them  who want to help them.
After about six or seven months  the janitor -- they were always attuned to what was going on -- kind of went after me one day when I was shopping and he kind of understood that I'm buying more food than I should  and he denounced me.
And I had to go every day  count how many people in each block; and give...uh...the amount to the kitchen  that they can...what they prepare more or less food.
She said  well  maybe some day -- thi s is her saying now  maybe someday you're hungry and you won't be able to eat.
102 She was just getting some food while she was there.
They started coming into camps where they could get rations  from the American Army  from Unrah  from Quak ers  from there were many organizations that would send boxes of food in.
01:40:28 So miracle happened even in Auschwitz; because three days later  Edith was one of those who brought the food over.
Well  after we sent the food out at 8:30  we began preparing the food for -- for the next day.
So in the first night  the guard gave the number because the girls took the food .
Well  the food was better because - I really got ahead of my story - but I didnt say that after we - those trucks out of Ravensbruck - that brought us in  all the so-called spots were filled with us  maid and this and the othe r  women were brought in - in fact  some of the people we knew from Poland - were brought into this camp  because there was an air force base  a German air force base  not far  a nd they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or whatever.
Sh e went right away to get some food out there  to buy some food.
He was only thirteen years old  and I saw my cousin over there  and she said oh  oh  she said  no food she says.
Buildings were bombed out  there was rubble all over  there was no food available.
You know  extra  a little food extra  a little cigarettes and what not.
He would say that -- it would even start with food.
Things were very  very bad  because a lot of people  we didn't have enough food  they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick.
Boiled cabbage at lunch  not the most nourishing food  and at dinner the same time.
And you  you  did you manage to get enough to eat during that time that you were in the ghetto?
We got lots of packages from the United States with food and clothing.
They -- they didnt do much  but I think they started giving us more food.
Another one had to go the next one and to pick up the food from the Pollocks  which we were dealing with them.
And she freaked out when I -- I said to my mother  ﬁIm going to send a case of Gerber baby food for Sarah when I come.ﬂ And she said  ﬁWhat?
And we were hungry  we didnt have what to eat  its so crowded.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 15 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: And um  did you do any organizing for food?
They brought food and they fed the people and helped them with clothes  and so.
My first job was I worked with very responsible people who were directing the food distribution for all orphanages in Warsaw.
In a way we were happy because we had clothing  we had food  we had good friends  we had been in school.
For instance  we had -- yeah  we prepared all the supplies in canned food.

And then I only remember something which is not very pleasant; and that is  that I guess on the ship uh there was  you know  suddenly food.
But we originate the whole thing  and uh  they was real nice because people show up from all over  you know  like there was a camp  and there was like the only only thing going on that night is a wedding  and everybody came in  th- it was like  here they call it a covered dish  we didn't cook  everybody brought some food and fruit and people bottles whiskey and drinks and all was  unsolicited  that was real like a community project and then the music would play on a trumpet a little bit off tune [laughs] but it  we had a good time really.

Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: pots uh and took some food that we ate from somebody else's pot  uh it was uh a relatively quite period at the time in terms of any action or any thing of that type going on that I recall.
But we had wonderful food  and we could relax and the nervous tension was gone  you see?
The people who were well off like the owners of stores  food stores or hardware stores or clothing stores  they were well off people so they were able to disappear simply from that place.
A bitch  a real bitch in the sense of -- if I wanted something I got it and I remember exchanging USHMM Archives RG -50.030*370 64 things for cigarettes because cigarettes were more important than the food because a ciga rette was a moment of -- I don't know if you've ever been a smoker.
I remember  or hot dogs with raisins or sweet things  marmalade  so I was safe from this and plastic food and so on  but I see the Ellis Island  which I knew all about.
It was shortage of food  everybody suffered  but life was kind of normal.
SE: No  I went in that -- in that building where all that food were -- a -- our things were and Id give him a knife and at once he wa s gone.
Then we got -- in the morning we used to get the bread.
They were glad that the food came  but uh they didn't  they were Jewish  just like us.
I know that the food spilled and I fell to the ground; I evidently fainted.
You would pick up the food  and that's really all you would have.
So we saw fish floating by and we tried to catch those fish.
Later on they brought us food  which was a...a  uh  loaf of bread.
Did they bring you food  did they No  no  no  it was not about this.
One thing that we were all served American food  of course  for breakfast and they had these lovely boxes of cereal  these single cereal things.
And my parents  the Spiegels   would ply me with food.
And so the idea is  if I could  somebody was in the krankenbau  in the hospital  I will bring in a metal container  food.
In the meantime  the UNRRA which was our body of the world organization  the United Nations  will be helping you out  you're going to get food.
And then food started being a problem because Jews  the rationing stamps were stopped for Jews.
Well  in Auschwitz though the food was meager  less than meager  it was doled out with a system.
And that anything  even the difficult life whatever--there's not much food around and all kinds of difficulties.
And p eople which have in the – smuggled in the Š you know there was people  when they ca me from – Interviewer: Carrying food.
Incidentally  the friend of mine who was so sick in ghetto that we gave some food to  all of us  a little bit of ours  she was taken away to Auschwitz.
But here in the middle of the day  you know what I mean  weak challah and the food they served up  it was out of this world.
And we always fared very well  though  because my father had a good -- good job and worked seseveral days a week and so that we always didnt have to wo rry about whether we had enough food on the table or anything.
People in in Athens were starving to death  but we had plenty of food  because we had brought a lot of food from these surrounding villages  and they were stored in the house.
They prepared gold to bribe the guards  to pay for food.
And  uh  so we stayed the night and in the morning we saw the American soldiers coming by with the trucks and  and  uh  and they started to bring us some food and  and  and  uh  then we knew that that the war was over and this was May 1st  1946 2 01:37:02 and  uh  from then on and  uh  from then on  uh  they took us into a neighboring  uh  place called Feldafing which was  uh  it originally a Hitlerjugend camp.
I dont know how those boys survived without water  without food  without anything in that thing.
It was in Mr. Dellwells hands to supply water and food.
The food was not luxuri ous and not -- not gourmet food  but it was totally adequate.
We had not the be st food; but we had entertainment  and people were nice  and we were not in danger.
Uh  in the first camp that we were  food was not a problem because uh  uh I guess my father still had money a nd there would be food brought in from uh the Aryan side  from the polish side  so food at that camp was not a problem  but in the other camps  when we were in Stahavitz  and then in Austratzalager??
And I I thought to Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 103 myself  I prayed  I said  or she is going to bring me food  or she is going to bring me a German who is going to to kill me?

You know  but we couldn't  but we didn't eat because we didn't want to eat everything in one time.
But we -- we were hungry but we were not starved.

Yeah  she ta-take them -- took them food  let he r in  you know  and one time one of the guards I think was objecting and so forth  and what she said  you have to let me in because these people owe me money.

We stayed in Vienna for  I think  two  one or two weeks  and in an Am erican hospital  that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we we re all there and we we re given good food and warm rooms and it 51 was very pleasant  the only thing we were always wa rned about  not to ever wander into the Soviet section.
So time was very hard to pass  because we did not do anything  and as I said previously  the food got scarce  but we tried to live from day to day.
It was cold and  and we were hungry and we didn't have any  any hygienic possibilities  you know?
They had to feed us light food for the first  in the beginning and we could have all we w ant.
People were fainting all the place of especial old people couldn't all the day long without food in the cold  fear.
And we were immediately helped by UNRRA 27 by the United Nations  where they gave us food  and we were registered with UNRRA and the struggle started how to go to Palestine.
For the hungry people who have not seen any good food for two  three  four years  you dont give the lamb soup  with the hot fat on top to the people who are completely devoid of any Nutrients  yeah.
So they said  right dont go out tonight  were going to mortar the woods  alright  and the next morning wed made friends with the farmer  two or three of us   made friends with the farmer cause the Jerry couldnt feed us we had to go out  get food where we could.
Now I wasn't Orthodox myself  but some of us were Orthodox  and they were strictly kosher  and they would not eat a non-kosher food.
She used to lock the food from me  after the war.
women who had something  like my mo ther gave her ring  and they would go and bring some food  or maybe I dont re member if we got an what we got for that wedding ring  but anyway  these women were arrested while my and were kept in the prison in that town where my mother was now  with my younger brother.
I was the only one that could leave the the ghetto to get food.
And uh we were very well treated there: food  and we get other clotheses.
My father also ended up in Buchenwald in an adjoining barracks  which was separated from ours by a fence  and because I was getting enough food during the day while I was working in cleaning up the destruction  I was able to give him some of the food that was allocated to me in th e evening when I came back from work.
The thing was that Panana −imait used to come and get food every day  and we -- she had such a metal -- me tal little  like a bucket.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 16 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: time and they took those clothes along to the work places out of the ghetto and they exchanged it--the Lithuanian people use to come with butter and uh margarine and potatoes and sometimes even some meat and they exchanged it.
During the war  regardless of the pain and the worry we had  food was available  people were stopped on the street.
Schindler arrives with this engineer of his and we hear him distin ctly pointing at the end of the camp  ordering this engineer to build a fence  a very high fence with corrugated metal solid so the outside residents would not be able to look inside to see that we have food in the camp while they dont have any food.
And I was the one that went out to procure something to eat.
Just to describe to you one day of food in a camp where we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening.
I had a very good job  I mean  I had plenty to eat  much more than the people in the ghetto.
I went and took with me some bread some food and I went to th e cell and I wanted to give him this.
I never had pocket money or wages or anything  only food and sleep  lodging.
Our microscopic rations  I don't know what the official rations were  I think some working people had some food supplements.
And so first of all  I -- I di -- wasnt eager to separate anyhow  but that [indecipherable] she approached and she thinks its good for me  Ill be better off  nicer physical environment and better food  that [indecipherable] my interest  so we consulted a rabbi  the rabbi said yes  go ahead  under the circumstances.
This was a very famous uh headquarter for the Zionist organization and this was the source later for the shutzpasses and the several places including uh uh storage where was where was food for the children homes and everything and my husband began began to work at on the outside.
And he got to be 98  I think  and for years I didnt drink any coffee  because if Howard Kirschner got to be 98 by that kind of a diet they did not eat rich food  of any kind  he and his wife.
This is Tape 1  Side B. We're interviewing Mrs. Ida Henig  and you were telling me ab out the conditions in hiding when you were cellar  so that when you ran out of food  you had to come up from the cellar and start looking for food.
And I was very hungry; and I ask him for food.
And then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans  he could work for the partisans  or they would allow him to go into an area that was already liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over  they said.
So  you know  for everybody because Marseilles  the food was very  very low.
It was so tempting and I knew if I could get my hands on something like that  I could probably live un til the end of the war by bartering that for food.
After all  they helped us -- they helped us with food  but when we met up with the 10 -- f-first 10 already  we decided that well go for a little mi-mil -- missions.
He enjoyed good food and so he was totally emaciated and he seemed to have aged fifteen years or something like that in that time period.
So you got weaker but you didn't get less food or trea ted worse or anything like that?
So  the men were eating on the table  and the women were serving the food.
They kept the corpse  people  after they died to  to get.
Once in a while he took us down for -- to wash ourselves  and the food -- we had once a day food.
And then we were 69 already spread to different homes  and -- but I was going to all the prisons and -- and bringing her food and taking care  and so -- She was imprisoned here  in Lithuania?
My mother--they were all able to work and or gather enough food and whatever else we needed which was not a hell of a lot just to get by.
And they didnt give y -- us too much  because they said -- they -- they spoke German  so they said not to eat too much because we going to get very sick  and we going to have to go to the -- to -- to the Riviera -- the Rivera -- the -- you know  the -- th-the hospital  because you going to get sick to our stomachs  and our stomachs are not used to those -- the food  and its different than -- than in the concentration camp.
Actually  it was in the section of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews.
You know  I remember people were worrying about food supplies and sugar and so on  because they were afraid that the Russian soldiers were buying things up and shipping home.
Now  the way we helped the uh  our people  some of them were in the forest  were healt hy  and we helped them with food and so on  they helped themselves too  and our protection  the other groups didn't bother them  for one thing.
I mean  she somehow recuperated enough to  to help me and to  to  to and not think so much anym ore of suicide  and um  and she was a great help already in that way  that I could  I could already  let's say if  if I had to fight for  for the food or  or  or to  to get something additional  that I didn't ha ve to worry  that my sister is the meantime going  going to kill herself and there is nobody  everybody had to have somebody in order to survive  for instance  my husband  my late husband who was al one  he adopt  they were like brothers  he adopted like one friend that they took care of each other.
To this day I cannot see -- my kids will attest to it -- I hate throwing food away.
I couldn t tell you where  and who was responsible for it  but just like the civilian population had their food rations  and which applied to each German citizen  and -- or applied to -- to the German population of an certain working group  like light industry  or heavy industry  or whatever  there were certain standards set  yeah.
did you get any kind of -- of medical supplies  or -- No  the Russians gave me -- as we -- when we were there at first  when they gave us some food  they gave me some bandages to wrap myself  thats all.
Then one day -- yeah  the ne -- but in Krakow there was no food  because there was war  there was no food  and then she didnt have food.
But they told us  as soon as we reached Istanbul we are going to get  the suppliers of the ship were going to get us food once we reached Istanbul.
People had all sorts of problems and there was a quest ion of food and things like that.
After you would give these people pills and what kind of food were you able to give them?
The Red Cross couldnt be that dumb  that naive that they cant see Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 57that we get this kind of food every day  that -- the way we looked?
Particularly my parents  we were this kind of family  close 44 family  always passin g the food to the next one  were not hungry.
Rampant typhoid  hardly any food  Russian plans attacking us  didnt know that it was probably a camp or so.
And I went and I said  \ I want to...to work  to take those container to the B Lager.ﬂ Because they said  \ You will get a little bit more food when you finish with that work.ﬂ And because I was hungry  I said I preferred to go and held those heavy containers and get a little food.
The other thing that I remember is that everything was  in terms of food  was in credibly difficult to get.
They were very poor  there were ten children and my grandfather had a tailor shop  Sylvia Green 4 January 11  1996 Page 4 tailoring shop  and there hardly was any food on the table and my mother 3 was the second oldest girl  the first one was a boy.
They took cans of food  things like that  so we were the ones what 7 really worked with that  so knowing that we don't have much to  to eat  so we took the risk to steal this food and we brought it back and we ate it.
They ga ve us -- you know  they fed us very nicely and it was a beautiful place.
Plus to eat  we were given a little something to eat.
We have no papers  we have no money  we have no place to stay  we have no food  we have nothing.
We stormed the food barracks and that afternoon that must have been the day before we were leaving the food that the Nazis were eating these Nazi officers in their mess hall was left on the table  untouched like some of the fairy tales.
We had people that died because they -- they went into the village or went you know an-and got food that was -- that they shouldn't have eaten.
I also  towards the -- remember one particular time when I was hungry and the last winter of the war in Holland was extremely bad  very rough  and there was really very  very little food.
But I couldnt afford eat the kind of food I wanted.
But we -- we were hungry but we were not starved.
And the German government had to supply us with the best food  with the best in everything.
If you knew a kapo  like I was carrying his lamp and things like this  so he couldn't do much for me  the only one thing when he dig in the spoon to put it in my plate  the food  it was full to the top so I already got awarded.
Did it bother you to have the non-kos her food  I mean that it star -- Yes  yes -- -- it both -- it bothered you when you were -- didnt -- -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these camps  although the food was not prepared under kosher auspices  ate what they could eat  which was not -- definitively not kosher like.
And we got a piece of bread and we were eating and like this.
But I know that this what is from my girlfriend because she send me also a small pillow  and I recognized the pillow that it was from her  and she sent me some food.
They're bringing with them fur coats and all kinds of things and food and we asked the guard there  bread  we asked you see what there is.
There was no problem with food and housing and all that.
It wasn't -- the neighborhood was quite a ride  maybe thirty  forty miles in some area until we got all the food together and brought it in in the tank.
But the only thing I ate was bread and potatoes  right?
And immediately gave us food to eat  and told us if anything will try to get in in the door and he will tell us to remove the pail  we should put the food in a corner nobody  not  not to be seen.
They brought us in the Jewish   that was an organization  an d we got food  bed and warm clothes and we were sitting there  there was a man going back and forth  back and forth  looked at my husband and then we were scared  we thought we sa w a Gestapo man in everybody.
Well  we had very little contact because they had treated us so badly and they didn't help us in any way  I mean they knew we were hard up and we didn't have any furniture and we didn't have clothes and we didn't have money and they never offered to do anything.
So we ate them ho -- half raw and full of sand and grit a-and we ate it like that.
SB: Then  you were 12  then you--you had to work and you had to try to find food among other things.
After two days or so  when we were ready to leave  the waiter said  ﬁWell  you'll be going for three days on a train to Odessa  on the Black Sea  but there ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 won't be any food.
You were able to get whatever you want and supplied with rationed food and all that.
Yeah  this was so private somehow  like we were -- we had the same -- the same food  we didnt have more than them  at the beginni ng  yes.
She could have -- she tooked all those things that belonged to her parents  not all those things  whatever apar they gave her and she used to sell on the market and get some bread  some food for herself and for her little girl who she brought with her.
My brother was went with one nice Russian Byelorussian man  went to Wolkowysk   and to see my father and to take some food for him  and they didnt let him see my father.
Also dried mushrooms on a string  couple strings of that because there was no -- because we came at a time that it was called senna  there was no food.
So we slept there and they they fed us  and they gave us they helped us  they gave us clothes and everything.
So did you still eat breakfast and dinner with your your parents  or No  I ate I ate not breakfast and dinner  but whenever food was available.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 29 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: before the Germans came.
The flour  we got out of it  but we had other food.
>> Bill Benson: Until that time was your father able to continue to work and feed your family?
The main thing so we were not hungry  we had bread .
so we started out giving them the same type of food they had been receiving  very watered potato soup.
But that whole -- not tension  that wh ole -- at -- at -- attention  too  and focus on getting your food or so  became part of your daily routine.
He be used to buy mostly a young calf and killed it  cleaned it  and something to eat   smoke some  and use it for food  and that's what we been eating.
Some of them had friends in the non-Jewish community who -- who helped them  though in those early days  nobody had a surplus of food allowances  the -- but 25 there -- so there were these German Jews  we -- well  as a matter of fact  what am I talking about?
So the -- So were you -- were you required to cook  as well?
Why  I wouldnt know  and whether it was due to some concoction or an agent or a chemical being put in the food  I couldnt tell  but I knew that much.
Not that I... I didn't eat the whole thing because I couldn't eat the whole thing.
She was supporting them  giving them money so they could buy their food.
Some time before that  we had to register at the Jewish Community.
We were so sick that the doctor had to give us me dications because we couldnt hold food down and we couldnt eat.
I remember lying on the corner  and and she was standing over him  and she was shaking a finger at him  and and she would say  remember with some things  one German closed all the all the food in the ghetto  this  and no one is was allowed to touch the food.
They had been on such a a starvation diet and such an inadequate diet that they were getting sick from the food  the richness of the food we were giving them  so we had to be very careful about uh what we gave them.
I used to run to this hole with 2  3 other guys because we find a lot of food there  we had potatoes  peelings  this and that  was a good  you know  a good place to hide  the bombs were fa lling.
Because  for instance I will give you an example because this is just really for history to know that 27 the  they set up a kitchen  and  and they asked us all very nicely and  ﬁWe will give you food that you can that you should eat that we give you  because your health is if not you're not  you're not going to survive.
They have it calculated to give you just enough food to keep you alive but to extract from you all the strength so you become weak.
She took the food cakes to church and the food cake was blessed.
So the it seemed that food was very much the central part of our lives.

My father was a blacksmith  and if you wanted anything  clothing or shoes  you had to give them food  otherwise you wouldnt get them  because all you had rationed  a pair of shoes a year  or a pair of soles in the shoes.
He told me first of all that my mother had forgotten certain things that he offered to bring in and they would also be glad if I could pack some additional food and th en he added that my mother also told him 63 that she was interrogated the day they arrived there by the Gestapo  and the Gestapo showed particular interest in me.
Because there was no food  there was no  absolutely nothing  especially for us that we did not want to eat meat.
You know  to bring up six children  to -- to cook and wash and as you  Im sure you know  in Poland  you know  a lot of food  you know  you made yourself.
My father always went to work  he did selling house to house  bought things at the wholesale place  sold them and ma de a living  cause we were never deprived of anything  we had food and clothing.
So what they did  the poor girls  in that dish--which is not even nice to say--what they had for food  they finish themselves there.
The food department  the Sheesheesky department kne w how much talons hes giving out.
Good thing we we had a good send out  you know  with a little food  but not enough for two days.
You know  food was scarce  was -- was a -- was a big problem.
And of course  the mere fact that you liv ed in the same comm unity and that you knew people  Christians and in some cases  Christ ians who were willing to assist you on their very own  and in some cases  Christians with whom some people left valuables  and they were kind of disposing of the valuables and helping and sending to the people some extra food or some clothes or whatever they needed.
They didn't give us the food  I think that was the Chaplina  the community who gave us some food  you know  that we should have something to eat  but we were very hungry that time. [

And we would go there for weekends  and I remember that we packed the food in big baskets  and then went -- we would get on the train  and then the -- the man who was taking care of the estate would come on his buggy and horse  and pick us up from the train station  and take us back to the -- we used to call it villa  to the villa.
Every day you got coffee and a piece of bread in the morning  and soup in the after -- in the evening.
And my paternal grandfathe rs wife Anna was very small and she always liked to give me food that I didnt get at home.
But the Germans  they would take me  too  if I approached them.
We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the field  like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that  cause the farmers couldnt get it  because the man didnt go outside  they -- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in Germany  I guess.
But other than that  I mean  in the in the Riga ghetto  she was doing laundry for the wellto-do Jews in the ghetto for food.
So the the we lived  and we we tried to to to really eat as well as we could  here and there  you know  not to starve.
So the people uh  uh  uh  how should I say  had  people didn't make it  they  they  for  for  food as I said was not good and they  they beat them  and they gave them to hard work  and  and after that  in the evening  if one of the Germans felt like muscling you... We need to reload.
01:16:10 No food  no shelter  no facilities  you have to come out  and that is what happened.

First of all  I think I indicated before  that food was rationed and so it was very important for each family to keep its food supply identified and separate and there were frequent suspicions and some even  sometimes even accusati ons that somebody else ate somebody else's sausage or at least part of it or that something was missing that should have not been missing.

He brought a bottle of vodka  he brought food for us  he never came empty-handed  and he wanted  waited for the woman to come home from work.
Basically  food was not a problem  as I can recall it at that time.
And we used to go in in May. In Poland was beautiful weather  we used to go to the forest  Sunday morn ing  you know  we get the group  used to go out  take food and spend the days over there.
Twice  because first of all he...he saw to it that I got a double ration of food.
And like lunchtime  the American came into the camp  and they start to people was hungry  you know  they wou they we went to the to the military  says  give us food.
Because we went on this so -called trip to a port  we were told to pack some food.
Make you work for me and we pay you with the bed and food you're going to have.
Everything was the food was terrific  and the people were nice in those places and so on.
But we had a some kind of soup  I think  to we were fed  a little.
And they just threw everything together  and even at times they emptied out bags that the people had brought food when they were taken on a transport  and were and it was sometimes these bags of food managed to get into the camp.
They saw that we barely were breathing and embraced us and brought in cases of food and prepared us for departure.
Then we came the morning  they gave us hot coffee  bread  and some cheese .
To make the story short  we stayed the whol e Shabbat at the airport  without food  without drink  without beds.
The army came in and -- the American Army came in  and of course  they start giving us food  you know  rations and stuff like that.
We tell them we walk here  you can take our parents back?
At night they would come back and we would all congregate on that tree where they would bring out some food.
Well  the camp was set up really to clear land  to make land arable because there was a great shortage of food in Switzerland.
Well  we had our first food  and my first food was a piece of bacon.
And luckily  they had to let us out of the gate because they needed food for this place.
And as I told you my brother was graduated high school in  in the ghetto was a group of  a lot of young people went to school and he 8 got a very good position in a  this food distribution store.
I had to count the people  uh  to get them ready to...for inspection; and after...and also the food.
So this is how sometimes Father managed to get some food and maybe sometimes some neighbors that he knew would help us.
I try to tell them sometimes that our staple food was something was barley.
They says  no more food  no more food  dont come back.
And we had a...uh...I had a cousin  a girl cousin  Gerty Schweigger  she was bringing us the food every night.
And we said  well  what did you have to what ar e you eating?
But you see the winter time was very bad because when they came through the back window for the food they saw foot prints in the snow that every night somebody is there.
We got very good food  decent food on the train and always hot water  what they called kipyatok .
And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of separating  to bring in almost all the food in the bedroom of the Commandant Ritter.
The parents were bringing us the food down in the evening when they came from work.
And -- and he saw this bowl with the -- with the food.
Were there provisions  any food stocked  or was it just a big hole?
And these places where they distributed the food  mostly the old people had to go because they had no place of work.
Did you feel -- I mean  you worked in the food department  so you had enough to eat?
And I had to see that every month  even if it was at the farm  the food was scarce  and bad  so they still wanted raf -- the ration cards  so after the robberies  we had to see every month  with every Jewish  and if it was very poor people  we gave them two cards or so.
The funny thing is  years later I remember thinking  I don't remember getting any food or water.
Trucks with food  with ammunition  whatever we need  and carry on the b on their backs  on their arms  to the other side  and load the other trucks  go to Jerusalem.
RJ] They were dying on their feet fr om lack of food.
for this food that you were given  yo u dont know who gave it to you  the extra food.
There were plane crash with 18 young people and six survive  rest died  and they been in the mountain food is none.
Now you want to eat and I havent got any food to give you.ﬂ And then my mother was not the type that would s -- I dont know  she was thin  and she didn -- maybe she didnt eat th at much.
You were you able to hand in the food that you brought with you?
The probably where we had most of the food where we did not starve was that short time that we lived in that summer cabin in Berlin and also when we were in that hotel  this resort hotel in Binz auf Rugen.
Did you eat together  was there f -- was there food there  I hadnt -- Oh yes -- [indecipherable] food  it was a long trip. --
I had to sleep on the third floor because if you sleep down there on first floor on the second there was a Polish or Czech guy so called he'd kill you to get your food.
I remember that  being still in school  I was given the assignment to nationalize a large a large wholesale food business  which all kinds of items there  and we had to take the inventory.
And that was food that we had and the -- some soup.
You know  we kept separate dishes and -- for whatever food we had.
Im saying their stomachs and their bodies werent used to very rich food.
And we didn't like their food but now we started to be strong enough to have opinion about food.
Until the moment when the -- the second Umschlagplatz happened to me  and then I st opped working  and the only food it was -- which was smuggled and w-we bought  and it was pretty bad.
It was a farmer boy who happened to be Polish - speaking s o he spoke in Polish words  we recognized him  to the chickens that they should gather together  he brought them food.
And so we we somewhere we decided that we had too many suitcases  we took a couple back to the house  and went with the rest of them.
Tell me... Tell me about how you got kosher food there.
So  then I ate from their food  and the son told me so  not because he wa nted to be mean  but he thought that was - was cute  you know  to say  ﬁYou know  you ate my bread.ﬂ Well  then I couldnt eat.
But we didn't have any co ntact whatsoever then  they gave us food  they gave us some food  you know   to live.
And then he helped me -- that was at the time when I broke down out of hunger  and he was able to -- you know  he was our kapo and as kapo  he was supervising the food rations which we got.
There wasnt too much food at the mess hall and we were still hungry.
I still cannot understand my endurance  the strength to survive it all where my only food was snow on the ground.
Well  s-sometimes when I -- when I wanted to carry something  or -- or -- or get something  you know  like buy some -- some food or something  to be sure that I wasnt -- you know  that it wasnt taken away from me  I would take the ar mband off surreptitiously  and then once I was in the ghetto  I would put it on again  you know.
It really could be exasperating with this forever complaining about food.
We had no idea what we were eating  probably things we didn't want to eat.
And after the war they were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my father said what are you doing that for because now we have food.
Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something  no matter whose fault  people would rebel.
When we went to work  we got our portion of bread in the morning  some people ate it right away  they were so hungry.
She sent it in for the knitting  what I was knitting the whole day and maybe a half a night in order to get that in  to supplement  to supplement my  the food we ha d. I don't know wh at that's  what should I talk about?
But then about a month later  I was taking them medicine  and food  I was stealing from the Russians  and givi ng to the poor German kids.
I had to stand in line for every piece of food that I was getting.
No  I -- I think I commit a crime if I throw out food  because I remember how hungry we was.
4:47:59 So he hid us for several days there brought us a little food there  and he gave us names of people to contact in the Polish underground.
So we had a piece of bread  an extra piece of bread  to eat that day.
We couldn't make a traditional sha-but   there was no food.
He was able to manage the Germans authorities to give us more food  more this  more this.
The Russians actually brought food  stuff  sardines and all kinds of things they gave us.
And and they brin g the food  you know  things like that.
Food was I mean  hung er was one  which which came after a few days already  you know  there was hunger in there  and rats  and vermin  and In your And we were in a barrack  the barrack we were in was a in Gurs  there were I think it was right next to a what was it?
In other words  any  say pound of meat or whatever   was -- which whose price may have been one mark regularly bought in a store with food ra tion stamps  would be 100 mark on the black market.
But it was a question of loneliness  of no food  of having sex.
From January 4 to January 18  which is essentially two weeks  we had no food.
Yeah  we we had well  we we used it  of course  for ourselves  for to trade with food or meat.
I gave him all of my food  another one I helped.
That particular region   and I had the feeling I was told the farmers that there were young 16 children from the big cities undernourished and they are here to get better food  better air.
I never stole from my fellow-inmates; I never fought for food; and I never sat on the ﬁkubleﬂ. The kuble was a barrel which I took out a nd brought in but I never sat on it.
And there was a lot of food in the north  and where we were  there was not so much.
It turned out that the Slovaks  jointly with the local Germans went -- and they had a list of hostages that they wanted to pick up  people who were suspect as working with the partisans  you see  because my father managed the food business  even und er the Slovak regime.
Just today -- what's tomorrow happens -- today have nice  nice dinners  nice food  you know.
Just because they demonstrated  he could not go to the Germans and say I want more food for my people  all right  and whatever we had we had to work for.
You couldn't  you  you  you could barely st and...they didn't give us any food.
So I used to go home with her  and the maid used to [indecipherable] I stayed by the maid a couple days at the farm  and when we used to come home from the farm  back to the Mademoiselle Milan  she used to load the load the on the on the back  you know  on the on in the rucksack  she used to load the food  and we used to bring home the food because in those days you couldnt buy food in the store  there was no food.
And other things  for example  Passover came about  th e rabbi announced this particular cereal type of food is good for Passover  for those people who were Orthodox.
And I had managed to get one of the food canisters  and hide it until the Germans had taken everything.
But they left a certain amount of people behind for the running of the town and administration and all that and once I was able to get around again  the Russians did help us to get some food.
But we wanted the lard because it has something to do with food.
He started to establis h so-called ﬁarbisinﬂ  they were shops which manufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people who administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people working in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto.
So we probably made because for a German to say to a Jew  'Please.'
The inmates were -- were taking the -- the food across several locked doors.

The  the place itself was terribly  terribly dirty  and there was nothing functioning anymore  there was no food for days  and I mean full days no food  and uh  everybody had diarrhea  and never made it  so it was very  very dirty  and uh  so what  I walked out and the first thing I saw were the uh  the fl  the flowers  the little white flower  oh  in May. Under a tree  there are little white flowers  they are here in the United States too.
I mean  and it was not sufficient  it was a starvation diet.
Although there was food  the deposits in the ghetto nobody volunteered to go there because the snipers from the va rious buildings  plus the shells  could kill people very easily.
Just we exchanged a little leather for the goods  the  the Poles what they came let's say with food  with eggs  with uh flour or some what they bought.
They would have shot you if they catch you  but we nevertheless we did it  so the -- as far as food concerns  that was really the situation  but if you think about how they fed you -- forget about it.
And I used to pick up the food for them and there were a lot of potato peels.
So here we were in our barn and this neighbor was nice enough to bring us food once a day.
And that I was a much better eater  you know  and that I would eat the food off Hankas plate.
And this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didnt feed us the proper food.
The block le ader  he was the head of the block  and his helper  schreiber they called  secretary  or stubendienst in Buchenwald   would take care of cleaning the barrack when we go to work  bring food at the evening for us when we return from work  so we s the soup was there already  a-and so on.
They want some food in the night and they're going away.
Yeah  that is all what Im trying to say  th at it was not so simple how people think  and to manage an -- and t-to manage the food distri bution  the clothing distribution  the bedding  you name it  all s -- s -- clothing ides  including shoe s. That is -- was not -- was -- became always  during those years or th-those months  improve d  improved enormously  yeah.
They was promenade the str eets where they occupy  you know  they were happy there  they got they took all the food  the wine  and the so he got he got beat up  and he came home  he says he says to to my mother  Mom  Im leaving.
And I was sitting with this delegation talking  wh ile this thing  and then later they brought me good food  you know  they make then dinner.
Well  the food is -- makes no sense  e -- I -- I think you -- you heard this several times.
If we had food  we would eat a lot  would pig out completely.
They  they gave me a little food to go  and the next day in the morning I started off to go on foot towards Lithuania  which people suggested the route I should take.
But on many occasions  I was able to sneak these food materials  foodstuffs  into the womens barracks which was simply a way ... The way I got that into the womens barracks is by throwing it ove r those barbed wires.
So Warsaw  we didn't have the hunger because we found a lot of food in the buildings  staples.
One thing I do remember  and this must have been very late in my stay with the Madna family  when there was a tremendous shortage of food in Holland I remember being very hungry.
And I bought food and I bought material and my girlfriend make the dress  and I went into the organization -- was there a friend  but he was the leader and he got mens what you were bringing back to the border.
We had parties in our house  I have -- we had -- I had bi g di -- Thanksgiving dinners for them.
But the most privileges of food and milk and the better things had the kids and the old -- elder.
We came to the railroad station and we they packed us in in all it boxcars  without food or water  and we took off to not knowing where.
We went from Germany by train via Switzerland to Italy  and then we went to Kenya  on a German ship that served us kosher food.
You got your ration card  you went and thats when they gave you food.
I think they said it was for food  because we had assigned women who did the food -- picking up the food.
And so she came once and she brought a big package of food an-and brought -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 55 bought stuff and filled up my Fridgidaire.
Because he told them that the orphan  she has no food in Lwow .
And anyway  there was  in addition to the number of liters  they always gave some extra for the chiefs in the barracks  so they would have more food than the peons or ordinary prisoners  but it was not enough for them  the extra what was being shipped to them  they used to  first of all  as soon as the containers arrived  the block chief went in with the ladle and got from the bottom of it  where the good stuff settled and gave one for myself  one for you  one for the clerk and one for the Kapo and one for this and take them inside.
So  at the beginning  because the 26 conditions  the food was terrible.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 40 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Yeah.
So  you see older people  babies  sick people died  lack of medication  lack of facilities too or lack of food.
Low and behold  every evening she put one potato until she had four potatoes  cut it in half  scooped it out.
At the times I just described  I was still with my parents  so we were still together  and we still had some means to buy some food on the black market.
Pollacks came over to me and they said they will kill all of them if they wouldn't stop gr abbing the chickens and the food in the night.
Then they realized that the food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food  so they started giving us like a diet food for a while until we could adjust.
I went to the garbage cans and picked up food and ate.
Now I'm not sure I asked this  but your parents did not -- obviously  they didn't keep any traditions so there was no Kosher food at home?
But it was the Dutch eat potatoes and the  the staples really were bread and potatoes and a littl e bit of meat  porridge  food like that  vegetables.
Buy different food  but I dont know what happened to him.
It was I felt that I'll be able to go there and get some food and bring to them.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 The things -- many things I remember because at that time I was old enough.
Well  they cooked Yugoslav food  and they cooked very well  and occasionally they would invite us to come and enjoy a meal with them because our food was cooked by the Arab cooks  and it was okay.
Whether it was kosher  I dont know  but we did have a kitchen and we had lots of -- we had plenty of food to eat in that -- in that displaced person camp.
ﬁWill you give me meat?ﬂ Thats how I -- you know  that I get food.
That affected so much the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the Lithuanian houses and begged food from them  got food from them  came in and throw it on the floor for us to eat.
So  on the other hand  they cook very delicious food  very rich and delicious food and they have some nice things.
We get -- we got rationing  you know  food  every two weeks  and it wasnt great  but at least you could survive.
Uh we uh...my hiding father as we called him  would would get some food from the farmers because we were on the uh market right there and since he was a barber the farmers would come for a shave  and he would do some dealing with them  so he would get some vegetables and some fresh potatoes and we would get some food.
But two weeks later  they brought in food and supplies and feed  fed everyone  and kitchens were set up  we get food and they processed you  you know  the name with country you came from where you were  they gave you DP cards  identity cards.
There was a man and my father said to him some who have these whatever food was there and we was going traveling like this maybe three days.
And so the Russians were very edgy and they & RG-50.549.05*0001 35 confiscated the cart  they confiscated the food  they confiscated the horse and then  they also incarcerated my aunt and myself.
They were put -- the Germans put them on an umshatz platz  a place where they kept them for two days without food  without water  without sanitary facilities and those that still survived were put in cattle trains and taken to the c amp.
So they also  she was a very lively person and she also  she went to this friend of mine who used to give me food for the transports.
The food was  talk about the ability of the human to invent and to in some way overcome certain adversity.
They – they already restrict us on food what we could eat.
And usually they fed us some kind of a hot soup and some black bread  you know  rye.
If there was food  the stragglers would get nothing  as they were not able to.
I don't know now many of them  eight or ten  so they had a separate nicer house where they lived and where they ate  but they had to go for their food to headquarters  to the nearby headquarters.
You know  I I put more f more food away than most people  I you kn ow  we always have extra stuff.
They gave us ration that time  very little food  but something so we can  we did survive.
And I waited for this police officer I know and I told him that I dont want any food or anything  I only want a -- this is in the -- in -- in the documents  too -- a personal  like it was youn ousewise  that I -- and he gave it to me.
By that time  when you had gotten your strength back and had food and so forth and school had started  by then did you feel free  and feel liberated?
We didnt have much food and they -- our group went around thinking they could get food from the Germ an warehouses and they found they were empty.
Be ver y  very careful not–ﬂ Šthis was on the second or on the third day  I rememberŠ ﬁnot to pick up any food and conserves.ﬂ They had a lot of things  the German  in jars.
So so wed go in there and at one time when when in 1941  when Germans attacked Russia   we went in there and there was th there was a food storage there.
The kitchen was the best place to work  because th ere was food and it was warm.
And so did  you know  my friend got  19 he was working  he was cutting woods and so he got a little bit more of food  too.
The food were almost  in every camp they were the same.
I had to make sure the food is in the house.
But they to ld us  if you volunteer on any transport to another camp  you might get more food.
warning  warning not to bring food to the gates until its clear  you see.
And uh I think that the the two Russians sort of wanted to to to sort of keep with others because of food or whatever and so in November we got uh we joined a bi gger group because we were going to move our base and we got caught  surrounded on the moun tain.
Uh...We were sleeping on the straw and...uh ...we were given food once a day...uh...small little piece of bread...uh...and...uh...some kind of brew that they called coffee had no similarity in smell and taste or anything to coffee  but at least it was something to drink.
And they help me with clothes  to get clothes  you know  and they give us food in Vienna   and then I ask them  I says  I want to go back to Poland .
I felt that a lot of the food was so strange to my palate  and it all tasted of soap.
He wouldn't eat on the ship unless he had kosher food.
Right away I cleaned out where my sister works and put this in her basket  that she should have the food.
So  you know so  but lu this u the problem was  when we come there  half of the wood  or more than half was either stolen ei -either sold by me to for food  you know  for us  because I was taking that.
So my grandmother would always go around the neighborhood collecting baby clothes and food for for the the the the mother  the young mother and the baby.
Of course  they were starved for anything like this  and they all ate to their hearts content and got sick to their stomachs  but I mean [indecipherable] used to such rich fare.
For some reason  if its good food  whatever it was over there  and I could have as much as I desire and everything.
You can get as much fresh food as you want to.
Well  we...I remember we left...we left Belgium and we...we took a train and I remember the people from the underground  they gave us some food and they gave us some clothing to take with us and  of course  we had to have a passport and I do remember the train ride because we were taking the ship from our Goteborg  Sweden.
It  each  I think each one of us brought a little bit of something that could keep us until we get so-called normal food.
They find out that there is a -- somebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food.
I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat  you know  in the beginning.
01:21:10 And I was still in Shomeratzayir  so I was able to come to bring some food for them  not much  whatever  share between my sister and between them  and I was still active in Shomeratzayir.
But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know  the regular Jewish mother.
As a bonus for this  they used to give coupons to buy some hardware on a farm  stuff like that  ordinary nails  anything  some food stuff  or clothing.
They– I think she probably mo re died from starvation than anything else  because what little food we could get hold  she would feed the kids  me and my sister.
And that most days Im not sure if we got that every day  but that was that was the food.
So I would go to them  and they would give me bread  maybe potato soup  a glass of milk.
And then where in where the time goes on and on where you dont have food  and you have no nothing to drink  and you have nothing  you know.
And I was swept out with this large crowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the middle of the road  they were just going people with children  with -- with bundles of -- of -- of food - not food  I dont know what  and that -- and we were going toward Meeska  toward the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed when the took out the people from the -- from the houses  they closed the gates.
I mean  how -- how do you get food  how does -- No  I didnt work any more.
If you order too much food  you know  you'll go broke  possibly  or at least you're not going to make much profit.
The first thing peopl e went  and they were looking for food.
At that time  we knew something was going to happen  so we made this big out of some fabric back packs and packed all our valuables and some food.
>> Nesse Godin: One day  they lined us up and said  Go get your blanket  your dish for food.
It was the -- they took the took the Germans you going to cook them and eat them.
He gave us food  bread  bologna or salami and -- and not butter  margarine.
I use to make templates and make multi-colored kerchiefs and that was a means of ex- changing it for food.

Yes  after -- it was -- because I was -- I live practically in Warsaw  and study over there in the woods  you know  the condition over there  no money  no food  no apartment.
Near the lake of Como  there were mountains called Laigreenai  and there were refuges where we went  and we had to carry our food in the back.
So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.
Well my mother had some that she put she had some money left that she shoul d be able to provide for us some food.
I mean  there we were also kept like in a prison but not as bad because we had food  we had clothes  everything  but we could never walk from one village to another without a Russian soldier.
I tried to see that she should have something to eat.
And these two took care of the Polish camp...of the distribution of the food for the Polish camp  and I was the liaison officer for that camp and that's how I met my husband.
So  this was a way for the women to get food?
They were proud that I was fat because they had enough food to give me and children were starving in the Holocaust.
But I dont think they was in as bad a condition as we were  because they even the hospital  th-there was more hygiene and more food.
They would occasionally hand out some food to us in those early days.
We stayed in Vienna for  I think  two  one or two weeks  and in an American hospital  that's where the Joint somehow got an American hosp ital for the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm r ooms and it was very pleasant  the only thing we were always warned about  not to ever wander into the Soviet section.
An d uh the only thing my parents were able to do was to inform this engineer   whom until now we had only known on a social basis  that his wife invited us to Christ mas party or uh her East er party  and uh came to us and brought us food when we lived out in the village  and uh they immediate...I had been left home by myself  so she came and she took me to he r home at the beach where they lived  they lived year-round  and uh he  it took him about four or five days to uh get my parents out of jail.
They ha d food...uh uh some re serves of food  some soup and they offered us...uh there were two who had been selected for that job  and uh they o ffered us whatever they could and uh we really felt good for the first time to be in a really warm room and to to to eat and to fill our stomach and interesting en ough when they asked us about where do you come from and so we told them Auschwitz...they knew very  very little about Auschwitz.
And so I guess they ate it or they forced themselves to eat it.
I was watching them so much because my brothers gave it away in Bergen Belsen for food.
The main thing so we were not hungry  we had bread .
The food  on the -- The -- the s -- The -- the -- the -- The pot.

You didn't get any food  just a potato a day  that's all.
So  it was black market things  you know  just to try to get along somehow.
I mean  it looked sha bby  and then children without limbs started coming to the window of this cafe and were sitting there having food and asking for food.
Ho -- who has money and how do you get food?
It was an old lady and she says well Ill give you the food that you want but if you eat that food that you want  youre going to die.
The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the  to the  to the dining room was Unter-- Oberscharfuhrer Blaufuchs  the head of the kitchen  because he was putting food in his stomach.
So  when they took this guy to deliver food in to prisoners  you know  in other cells  he told me  you remi nd you look like Polish ranger from Sarzyna who two or three weeks before  shoot and kill the deputy chief of the Gestapo  in Jarows aw  from Jarows aw.

But you soon learned that if you ga ve somebody some food and you saw them choke on it and drop dead  you know  that you didn't do th at again.
And they said...not starving but not enough food to...you know  we did our best.
We realized it from the very beginning  and I do remember there was no fear of not having enough food  because you see  uh we had gotten bread and French...and especially those of us who had been in Vernet had been hungry  oh there was plenty of bread  apples  and I think even pate  French pate in big...in big...so there was no...we were not...I wasn't afraid of uh of starving  at least at this moment  but...and also with the water.

And they wrote a letter and could ask for to send them a package of food; and they got the food from Portugal  from France  from Switzerland  yes.

We lived with a family  an older lady and her adopted daughter and I would help them -- help the older lady in the kitchen sometimes  because we would sometimes provide the food for them .
We didn't have any luxurious food but we had enough of potatoes  legumes and food of that nature that people had enough to sustain themselves.

But the food you got your ration in the morning  22 bread and once in a while you saw a little soup and water  and that was it.
Lotte  with her family  stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there quite often and though as I said  in the beginning  we had probl ems with food  but because in the Bukovina  like in all of Ro mania  food was plenty an d then we got to barter different things from house.
In addition to that  the food rations  which the refugees got -- the displaced persons got -- was so very low  and the diets were so monotonous and so on.
And then we went to Spain   and Spain was another problem  because Spain this was the end of the civil war  and th-there was no food in Spain .
So I met those people with the with the stripped uniforms and already they took off...I don't know if they took because they took off their Juda ...you know  that...so I gave them a lot of food and they...I gave them clothes  and one day I went before uh uh...I forgot the name of the town...before Auschwitz...... Don't worry about names of towns... No  no  no  no.
A little later in the day  and the guard was going all day long back and forth  and I had to look outside to see what happen  and then the other baby start crying  and being hungry  not having no food or water  the moth er urinate in the hand  and let the baby drink  and the baby quieted down  -------------at 4 oclock  the German punctuality  I heard the whistle blow  and this car  the truck passed by again  and got all the guards together  and I wait other 5 or 10 minutes  and I opened the  the shed  opened the cover  and came out and didn't see nobody there  I told the mothers  everything is clear to come out  and one baby still crying  and the other baby didn't say nothing  and when the mother had put her hand to the baby's  baby's mouth  she choked the baby to death  and when she realized that  she went completely hysterical.
You not gonna be you not gonna eat a ger th e food in in in you in you place  you gonna eat the food here  German food.
We also had to set apart part of our land for the Germans and give food  part of our crop such as beans or grain  my father had to give to the Germans.
And you know  one day I took some small piece of bread and I put here.
Desire is less important than food or clothes to be mended.\

Peopl e die each day  you know  and s -- I was -- thank God -- I was hungry  not enough food  I go through typhus.

They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly enough that people would think about those kind of things in the ghetto but I guess  love is a pretty powerful influence  it comes right after food.

We had in Lithuani a a barber shop  a beauty shop  so he was very known as a good barber  and he start getting food  and he start naturally me and him were  were very close and he start feeding me  start getting back to our energy  but our mind was to find my mother.
And then they  but it took time to organize that everything  and or ganized that everybody would get food.
And what I didnt realize is that there was a h-hook in the head  and trying to get every last morsel of edible food out of this thing  I got the fishhook stuck in my tongue.
You know  its -- we stole anything we could  and we ate anything we could.
And he told me then one day...and then as...since our life was such a peculiar kind of life  without papers  without books  without...with hungry for fo r for some spiritual food also.
We boiled some water in this rusty  iron kettle  in the barn.
I made guys go back who had too much food on their pl ate  I made them go back to the table and eat.
And we had to stay on roll call  and we I had a lot of food in my coat.

And one day we stopped at dusk  and us ually when we stopped  somebody  very often my moth er  would climb up on two or three suitcases to reach the little window  thats how I remember they were high up   and try to get ask the passersby to give us some food or anything.
The farmer was not Jewish and oddly enough  in all these days when he was bringing us the food  the exchange was so sw ift and fast that we never saw the face of the  of  we never saw his face.
I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family to the ghetto  Rzeszow  because in Rzeszow they would starve.
So my mother thought that here my girls are going to die from starvation  let them go to work  maybe they will be fed  maybe they can bring home some food for the rest of the family.
One of the things that some of us knew about  maybe all of us knew about -- I don't mean I but the adults  but when you take tin cans and you use them  you can boil them and clean them and put fresh food in them and take them to a factory that we knew about that could reseal them so they would be somewhat protected from botulism and things like that.
Then we met -- originally  we were also at the Czech border  and we got a lot of food.
So we took blankets and pillow and whatever necessity we could carry with us in our hands.

Brought a lot of food and all his friends brought food.
And  and we were escaping and escaping and sometimes we got some food from the peasant because the partisan were there and I don't know what to say  what else  maybe you want to ask me something.

I rise above it because oth er people were drawing or reciting poetry or thinking about food or thinking about the past.
Conseque ntly  we ate kosher food as a mitzvah for the rest of the community.
And we knew that it doesnt af fect anything  because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didnt have any means to get over and w hy would they come over  but there was a battle over there because Trans-Da nubia was not liberated ye t. And so the Russians were very edgy and they confiscated the cart  they c onfiscated the food  they confiscated the hor se and then  they also incarcerated my aunt and myself .

But unfor tunately  you know  its -- its the -- the main thing there was the food and -- and the conditions we lived in.
Made sure I had enough to eat and stuff like that.
Food  they didn't give us no butter  no meat  just plain soup every day.
We found that out later and--and food and the most of them died of starvation and of thirst.
We never did things like that.ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  everybody here uses this kind of food for babies.ﬂ ﬁNo ﬂ she said  ﬁwhen you come here  were gonna cook for the baby.
We were brought food in field kitchens by the military where we stopped.
The best opportunity was when the new transport arrived and people brought some food so you could go and you could try to acquire it  to steal it.
As soon as we saw them standing  we dropped the bags because if you brought in food  you got killed.
There was no money  so everyone -- it may not sound nice  but thats what happened  everyone who had access to something  like the carpenter had access to wood  the cook had access to food  there were workshops where they worked for the Germans  so s -- that was a mitzvah to steal from the Germans.
So you could buy other food with it... So I could buy...yeah...I used to I used to...this I used to sell  you know  on on the on the...with a cup.
I was taking care of the whole house as far as the cellar where the food was.
They usually had better jobs  but they always bring me food.
We had food but we didn't have any cigarettes so we changed with the Romanian soldiers  bread for cigarettes.
And she just let me have a little piece of bread.
We were absolutely--we really didn't have enough food to eat there.

It wasnt too bad  they supply you the food  and we were -- and the work inside the ghetto  they have to work in the different things to put up factories and stuff  you have to work there too  you know.

So  well  I got typhus in the  back in Belsen  and Paul Lepitre  one of the Frenchmen  stole food and sent it to the camp  so by the time I got the food  there wasnt that much food left because she shared it with other people  but evidently it must have helped some.
So yeah  they figured the troops need some rest  go back behind the lines   get some rest  get some food  and then youll resume later on.
There were a few incidents  like I would brag  you know  really  you want to get food  you know  if you were little  even adults would push you asid e  okay  get away  get away.
We didn't have to wait until -- you still had to have cards to go and get your food  like coupons.

So we were in there  but some people  older people  younger people I was too weak and too young to s to Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2  2010 28 to think  went out from the from the from the barracks  and they went to the where they had the food that you know a nd started to open up the stores there  whatever they have sas and they starte d to bring it into the camp  you know.
They did it at great risk; but the SS women took the bribe of the food  because they didn't have that much either and thought they would allow other people to eat.

Pause - drinking water) Uh  at one point in Auschwitz uh that after I had met this kapo and uh as I mentioned uh if not for the food and occasionally a piece of clothing - she had a uh coat commandeered for me uh because uh when people arrived at Auschwitz they were uh  their clothes with the outer belongings they may have still had with them  was taken away and uh we were given that uh pajama type uh prisoner's garb uh striped prisoner's garb.

Life was -- there were wives who fought with husbands about food.
They would sell something and they would bring back this food  so my in-laws said let's go there.
And -- and I gave her -- I brought her something to eat and I got her signature.
But the only thing I ate was bread and potatoes  right?
And then they said if e you know  we gonna have some food in the kitchen which  they gave us food.
But they didn't play a big role in my life  but...but I have their names and I'm very thankful because they also bring food and shared sometimes.
I didnt have too much because I couldnt eat  you know.
And we  we got food and we uh the basement they had bathtubs.
In fact  Ernie Ernestine   his daughter  tells the story of coming downstairs one morning  and found her father with his head in his hands  on the table  worried that he didnt have money to buy food that day.

So when they were looking for contraband  if anybody had parcels  food parcels  what have you.
But as I say  by the time they came  they had something to eat or the Germans let them eat some.
And the general living conditions  wa -- how was the food supply?
Sometimes the people would go where there was an overpass and just throw some food down to us.
And uh  they had to be a place ready where those people coul d stay  and a lot of factories were given  uh taken away from thei r owners in Czechoslovakia and around  and some German trust  trustees come  and they take over the factory  and they get all those people to work  and they pay so much  they have to pay for the food of those people  was about 50 cents a day.
My grandfather wouldn't go anywhere without being absolutely assured that there would be kosher food.

Several Viennese  and we danced a Lambeth Walk at in the evening  and the food was delicious.
So then we got -- we asked this guy that brought us food to leave the -- the cha -- the little basket  so we can put in  you know.
And then I got back to the same barracks where I was before and we were all working in all kinds of different units and one unit and this and that and the next day in a different unit and some  what we considered best was working inside the camp because then we didn't have to march a long march out to the worksite and a long march back to the worksite and we could go to the barracks and get our food  and the 46 the soup at noon in the barracks  which again was folly  because the ones who worked out there were distributed by different people who were not as greedy as the block chief and was more equitably distributed.
Food was a little better than in Majdanek but not too much more.
There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto-bites-on   that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the Ukraine for work.
One day - it was so bad that we were so hungry.
They prepared food and Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 66we ate  and we drink  even enjoy it.

And they did this precision bombing  and I rememb er seeing all these Germans  this is 49 now  rolling around on makeshift -- lik e torsos rolling around  lots of them  on a wooden crate  with like the wheels of a -- of a -- from roller skates   you know  one on each corner  so that they could -- you know  their legs blown off  and -- and I reme mber -- and they wer -- the food was terri -- no  the food was good  it was bad in England  and in -- in London  and in Paris  you couldnt  but in Germany  through the PXs  you could get almost anything  and it just bothered me  and I -- it just -- seeing these people rolling around  I just couldnt have cared less  is -- its -- you know  I had no sympathy whatsoever on how difficult the war was for them.
And so that we had something to eat and we had something to drink.
He got a job in a mens clothing factor y  which provided him with enough of an income to buy food and to pay rent.
I had my mother had another cousin in this ghetto but they did not have enough food for us.
Anyway  there were certain places to deliver food  very small homes  very small at the beginning of the ghetto.
I was -- so they used to bring me food and take care of me or find a scarf for my head or find a pair of shoes that was too big  but it -- at least they helped.
There were little brigades where you could if connections with the Lithuanians  change with them your...your...uh...belongings for food or for mone y and so you got some food.
They went from farm to farm and back for some food.
But we -- we were hungry but we were not starved.
They slaughtered a few of those horses  and they told the people to cook some soup.
It was when the when the ghetto was established  all the Jews were herded into one part of the city.1 Food became very scarce.
In fact  in the beginning we couldn't eat all the bread that we got.
And as we went to pick up the food  we saw on the other side of the gate  that there were some  a pile full of rotten beans  laying there.
So many died  you know  my -- my -- my George relates the -- the -- the 55 fact that many who couldnt -- who were wea k  you know  or cou -- or wou -- couldnt -- you know  couldnt make it  you know  were just shot a nd so I remember that  so thats why we got the food and that was -- that helped them a lot.
He gave maybe food some dressing and they escaped from this place to maybe another place.
That was the biggest moment  and during those not qui te four days  four thousand was shot and then we'll go back just a little while...a little back where we...there was a little town there  Stansriedt by the name there...not far away from city  and we stayed there for...privately 23 for two weeks and the Americans make a kitc hen for us and we had plenty food and we stayed there and after three w eeks the Americans give me the special paper  pass and they give me bicycle and I go back to Austria.
There wasn't enough fat content in the food and most of us were deficient in a number of nutrients and so forth but just about everybody was frostbitten fingers or toes.
And people were dying every day  no food  no water  anything.
Even now  this family  when they come to visit  the sister-in-law and the nephews and nieces  food is so meaningful  they come into the house  and they go right  pick up the covers of the pots and -- and then pinch here  and pinch there.
Well  the I didnt I didnt I dont remember well  Ive never eaten treyf food.
And of course  they all had -- as I say -- we all had ration books -- we all had ration books for food and -- and for clothing and for anything  so I mean i-i-it was very hard to buy things spontaneously that -- at that time.
So we called the food they gave us  this kairza   like plastic it was kasha   like porridge.
And sometimes by the time your turn came  the food was out.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 17 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: to get something to eat.
I tried with those ingredients we had  to ma ke food thats mainly a Czech -- Czech food.
Whether he assumed that they won't keep us without money  which I think was the wrong conclusion or whether the man did not have money to go and buy food  which I don't think was the case because the man was growing his food and I remember they were slaughtering a pig while we were there hiding in the barn.
Other pe ople went to the wagon  they find food and start to eat  and they got diarrhea and they were dead right away  after the liberation.
Much of the time was spent uh wandering through the ghetto looking for some opportunity to to do something that would secure some food or listening to rumors or just wasting time.
Fortunately  when we have enough money so that we dont have to rely just on the food of this Ten dollar a month place.
There was no food  but she somehow she was able to bring the bread or the cornmeal that was the main sustenance  main meal I would say and I wouldnt eat it of course.
So they had to go some distance away to another town  to a big town to buy the produce and food for the household.
Can you tell me about a little what happened in the town after the Germans come in  were there lots of shortages of food  you know  that kind of thing?
in the skin  and a lot of them were half rotten potatoes  but again  we had much better food than most  and so did my room  because my fa ther never just brought the food for me or my brother.
Yeah  I have to mention -- I have to mention that my wife was always much more Jewish than I was.
And they had something like what's called a community project whereby they collected food and so on.
And we just had like flooding in the basement  we had terrible ra in  we had to throw out a bunch of food.
What was the -- did many people die through the hard conditions and lack of food?
And they were not able to get the supplies  where they had to have their lice  and they had to have their their their flea  and and the and th-the discomfort  and not have the food in their time  and and the rifles were I mean  the cold winter was so cold their rifles were stuck  you know  they were not able to to shoot when they had to shoot.
Yeah  if you need everything  all what you see  the things what I need.
Then we came the morning  they gave us hot coffee  bread  and some cheese .
Yeah  well  before my father left  he  as I told you  he provided for food  and told her to buy clothing and shoes  it's going to be scarce.
In case I cannot buy because I didnt have  and the same with food.
They were -- the law that applied to everybody about rationed food applied to farmers  too.
But then  after that  when th ey -- my father wrote of my brother -- he had false papers that he was in the food supply.
So what happened is very few people were willing to volunteer t o get the food.
W ho is in charge -- who is in charge of getting that food into ghetto through the gates.
But there wasnt much of a time  there was in the meantime  was no food at all.
When we stole food  we didnt tell on each other  but the Russians told on us when they saw us stealing food.
She went into town and brought back the news that my brother was shot  again gave us some food  and we left.
I was distributing letters and uh parcels but I was...I was terribly...my wife had sent me for a while food but then she left France and I suffered terribly from hunger.
It was a -- I think there was a lot of ent -- diarrhea  I mean  all the unpleasant side effects of not having a -- a decent food and decent water and decent conditions and certainly very -- no medical care  very little medical care.
We can't get out from the blocks; we're sitting in there with no food.
And then our stamps  our food stamps had J ude  Jew  stamped all through the food stamps  and if I went to a butcher shop with my food stamps -- I did all the shopping for the family because my mother worked.
The food uh we get uh we have ration also because uh Germany economy was bad and uh and uh international organization supply uh make the German supply some food for for us for a few   so there was a short of everything but uh uh because it was free so so we survived and everybody was waiting for uh immi...going...immigrate  go to Canada or United States or Australia.
We will get straw to sleep on  and fuel and food.
By the time they got to the concentration camp from the country they came from  they wou ld be stuck on this cattle car without food or water and by the time they got to the camp  40 or so people were already dead.
They had to share the food with the children that came in  300 of us.
I would not  never as a youngster  eat what I was not allowed to eat for the religious reason.
And I think they always figured as long as I had a roof over my head and food on the table... I mean  what else did I need?
In that orphanage home we had very meager  but we had some food.
Then they put them into barracks and gave them some kind of clothing but the food was very  very little so through the winter they almost all died out.
The grandmother was doing the cooking  whatever cooking she could do  because there wasn't very much food at that time either  so I think we had goulash made out of potatoes and a little bit of meat everyday.
Some people smoked  so that they trade the bread for some cigarettes.
Wed get American PX packages  with a little canned food and a beautiful piece of chocolate.
You know that some people say there was nothing put in the food.
On the gate they used to take away parts of the food that they  they didn't allow to go in the ghetto.
Break in tape] Could you take some of these rations and go to this market there was an outdoor market  and try to get some food of some kind  or was there very little?
And the Russians were nice  and they were giving us food and stuff.
Get into -- get -- start working in a hospital where they have food.
I once went to Warsaw  1941  then to Lublin  I was travelling to Lobartov  almost daily  to buy food to help  you know  to do something.
Was and at that time it was much easier to send uh uh food packages to my family.
Being so hungry that I never thought of anything else but food.
The daughter which was in her 20s went out and bought food for us.
There wasnt much refrigerati on there  so you had to buy the food the same day that you were cooking it.
And so later on  my mother would take one of the chicken when it grew  to ask some Russian to kill that And then youd have some food.
>> Bill Benson: Susan  with your father losing his business  how did he manage to feed the family and make ends meet after that?
But when I was sick Chaim took me to the bathroom and made me walk and  he brought me  I think  food.
After all this wa s the only official presentation of the Jewish community  and they were the distributor of food.
Light very not always  food very poor  and only I we couldnt have radio.
Even the hotels were so much better  and -- and the food and th e -- it was an -- it was already a Germany restored  almost completely  economically.
Your situation was not so terrible   because there was this -- some food.
And a big part  I think in the beginning the people of the ghetto made about 60  if not more percent  coming more and more and more till a day what from the ghetto nobody could no more join us for internal things that happened in the ghetto  so this turning point afterward we become less and less and less.
We were hungry  not hungry while interned  but we didn't eat meat for months  just vegetables  we couldn't afford any.
We had food  we fed us potatoes  were not hungry  had water and everything.
And there was a newspaper article from the doctors not to give us any food because our lungs -- we were not accustomed to rich food.
Like I told you  the government gave me the key from this school  where I fi nished school  laid down on the floor  no clothes  no beds  no food  no nothing.
Not only that  but he allowed that my mother should send a few train wagons into Transnistria with clothes and food for the Jews that were there  [indecipherable].
Then was problem with  with food  because this woman she wanted special  special food all the time.
Were these people mostly Jewish or not Jewish A. No  not Jewish.
We were locked in  except for when they came to take our pail  and to bring us food and water.
A little better  and the food was right away a little better too.
So  we had to go and pick it up at night.
From place to place and to get frequent information to put that information to to look always a little bit farther what to what to what is necessary to made  what and this...he went to see other children home that there is the food and everything is going OK.
was the exchange that you were staying in this place and they were giving you some food?
So for that period of time  it was -- I mean  food was scarce.
I me -- not we inerschnitzel  you understand  but beans -- bean soup  a -- but food.
So it was a...to to be protect  to be protected when the change will come  so there was a...I don't remember...I think in the but it is today not interesting that it in the memoir that where was the storage and and where and this uh bakery where where my husband was able uh to get some food.
Did you eat a lot of Italian food  or -- No  because we were tainted  you see?
Our first instinct was to hand out food and candy and we were told not to because their bodies couldnt take it and as soon as our officers got in there  we were told to get out because they didnt want us to get typhus.
So -- well there was not much food anyway  but -- and then  before the war was over  I think  on America  they sent on the Red Cross  they sent food over.
The food was 1/16 of a kilos of bread per day  a weak soup made of some cabbage.
There was the Red Cross  Christian relief  the highest helping  uh  giving us a little food  telling us where we can go uh for to sleep over.
You had to have a place to hide somewhere and you couldn't hide on your own because you needed food.
I had to bring the food to the kitchen; they had a huge kitchen there and everything.
Look  first we got all our civilian clothes  my watch I got  and all we get  and we were still political prisoners so we didn't and then we have a code message with the resistance and so on  and and they give us also food and a special SS man came and brought us in the department of this speed train.
One a very sad one was a moc-row-seat   a very poor neighborhood where th ey dragged out all the Jews and for some reason they focused on them and then there were  food was already beginning to be rationed  there was little food.
He was a professional barber  and he had food he had brought in.
A certain thing  I dont know whats called thats put in in the food  they shouldnt have any sexual urges.
And as the day s  in those first days of liberation went on  do you remember the kinds of emotions you had as you started to eat a little more and as you  some of the first sensations  like the taste of the food and the.. Barbara Farkas 13 December 9  1995 Yeah.
But still  listen  it was very nice of them  it was very comfortabl e. We had -- We had plenty to eat.
I had to take some food to help because starvation in Warsaw my mother and father heard about.
So  they were getting food at the factory or on the premises  but this Salka Perinsweic was  she was one of the inmates as I call it.
My father was in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hu ngary so we could visit him  we could take food for him and eventually  when a ne w prime minister came  he declar ed that anybody over lets say  forty-five can go home.
We did not have individual dishes  but they had these bowls that they filled and since we always marched five abreast  five  you know  that a bowl full of food was given to one person and we had to pass it around and everybody took a gulp and passed it to the next one  so there was an orderly distribution of whatever was given in that bowl  whether it was soup or the coffee in the morning  quote-unquote  you know.
I have all those things but uh there is not too much interest in there because he wrote only about what he would wish for the country  Holland  he felt very close to Holland  and um  the whole world and the hu  hu  hu the human  the humans  what they would do when the war was  the war when the war would be over  and he was sure already for years that uh Germany would lose  and even when it looked on certain times that it was impo- impossible because uh they were um practically in all of Germany  in all of Europe  every country bes  besides two or three  were not under the Germans  but he said the Germans will lose  and from this view out  he had articles about uh economics  about religions  about anything you can think of  philosophy  former philosophy  and help was that th e people who were helping us to get to the place  that every two weeks  one came  and here the whole list of books he wanted for his writing  and they all came  every two weeks when we also got our food um slips  how much the food was for any person in Holland  how much they coul d have  and all the people who were underground were supported and were helped with those coupons  because every month the uh  the places where they were uh  where the people could pick it up themselves  they go in and they took out what they needed  and it was every month another place  and th ey never found who did this for more than two years--was really remarkable  and the woman who had us there  she  she needed  otherwise she couldn't have fed us at all because everything whic h was edible  everything needed a piece of paper and a coupon.
I says  what the hell  this is not the life for me  you know  he I was making money  I could live just three days  because I have to pay for the food  that we used to have a German cook  Esther  that she used to cook for everybody  she used to come every day  cook up and go home  you know.
Now we were giving food through the UNRRA  then  of course  is a -- many people were living on Oberstrasser.
But it -- it was hard and I even at the -- at the wedding  I have a few pictures where I see Zebbe sitting alone and some photographer caught me tal -- trying to talk to him  his head down and -- he wasnt upset a bout the food  he was upset about what was taking place.
How long can I do these exercises without having food and other?
Because they were so good that they said  ﬁYou can take in food  as much as you can.ﬂ They allowed you to brin g in food.
They would pick us because they felt sorry for us - more sorry for us because we didnt fight  like we didnt - we didnt fight for food or grab it or anything like that.
As the food came up  it had to pass all the ports and all the food disappe ared -- as they came up.
So when we got to there  where they were  everybody was in bad shape  because there was no food  there were terrible shortages  people were sick  full of lice.
Why there were Italians I don't know  but uh  uh  the baron uh  came out and asked me if I could do something about these horrible people that were uh  stealing all his food and we uh ....I I was a platoon commander at the time  and uh  so he invited me in for some wine  and so I uh  went over to my uh  sergeant and asked him to get uh  two of our people.
Now that I am a mother  I can understand the tragedy of a mother who is doesnt know where her food fo r her children comes  where she could exchange something for some food.
I had no food to eat  so during that time  it was like in July  there were on the trees some green apples  and I ate those green apples and I have uh diarrhea and I got very sick  so I was going from place to place and finally near Nowy Korczyn there was a Polish family who needed a shepherd boy.
So that was the kind of food  was not very wholesome  but it kept me going.
And then they gave us a hot meal  a hot di nner  the first hot food we had since we left home  and then we were taken to the ship for the channel crossing.
He was blond and really  his Polish was so very good  and he did many  many times run out on the Christian side  come back  would bring some food.
Because they had to go and give us get us stamps  because they didn't have enough food.
They needed laundresses  they needed cleaning of the stalls  tending to their horses  preparing their food.
If you want to help me out  the food won't help me.
I will save you.ﬂ A saintly Christian woman opened up her house  took us in  attended to my sister's wound  gave us food  opened up a sleeping sofa.
They said  \ You listen  you obey  nothing will happen to you  we are thinking about your welfare  this reason we're taking you out from all these apartments and houses and places where you live around the city to one place  we will provide you with the food  you will get the uh certain amount of food  the whole amount of food was not more than 400 to 600 calories a day.
They gave better food than in Landsberg  because probably after the transport in the train  we were really in a bad shape.
At that time was no food  all day  till you came into the camp  they gave you something  you know  to eat  you had a little piece of bread  and a coffee in the morning  and then something evening when you came back  which was very little.
Food was rationed and there was no money exchanged  and pille people were willing to risk their lives.
They demanded housing for their office rs  demanded shoes  demanded clothing  demanded food  whatever they were able to get  whatever their mind was working on  they came to you  give me  give me and give me.
So he told me  and he said  today will come a German and take some people to work with the kitchen  with potatoes  to wash it  to prepare food  I dont know.
The food was very difficult to come by at the time.
I used to go in the kitchen to order the food  and this way I start to learn the language.
You know  food and certain vegetables so last for awhile  whatever.
On this we slept there  but my cousin...there we had good food already.
Through the choir -- Through [indecipherable] -- we met  and for -- for some reasons  incl uding that I provided some more food for him  we ca -- we came close.
As a result I carried part of the food we were able to obtain to the hospital every day.
We need a quartermaster company  at least a company to come in here and set up some uh kitchen operation  with food.
You release the eight Jews from the ghetto that work in my p  Ill give you the food.
Now you are going to sit down and have your meal.\
You know  every day and we...it did mean getting food  which was  you know  really great.
Now  they were itching to re-establish this after the war and what better thing to do than to sell out these Russian people?
Only in the houses where the SS men were livin g. There food was too good.
For a c ouple of days we actually got food  but then they made up for it for a long time with nothing  because the food was gone again.
Some of them went out at night and the place where some partisans were telling them and they found the clothes  they 16found their glasses  clothes  food  .
I mean I never...I think I said it already...I never observed a food blockade.
That uh it...the Ital...the st rategy behind it was uh probably that uh the Italians were not worth uh wasting uh food for in POW camps  or wasting ammunition.
They also helped her with a little bit of food and to bring back for my aunt and un cle.
CE: If -- if we -- it was no transport  nothing special  is when we came back  they gave us some food  some soup.
The whole camp waited for that  for each train  that they got food  and they got clothes and they got jewelry  and anything.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 15 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: at the workshop.
Now  some -- someplace you said that water was a more difficult problem of yours than food.
The main thing so we were not hungry  we had bread .
You put coal and on top it had the door where you kept the food warm.
And then in the morning we got up and we were in Harwich.
Did you -- did the Jewish government provide food for the Gypsies?
What but actually he was after the the the [indecipherable] there was a situation that people had to say to who worked there  had to say send less food because there are less people in the ghetto  because they were already well  RG-50.030*0580 46Rumkows and no one wanted to sign  or whatever  which had to be signed.
And they invited me if I wanted some food  they were cooking some thing.
They threw in one bread like this was food was in for the day  and the others break a piece for this one and a piece for that one.
We will pay all expensive -- all what you need  food and everything  we will pay.
16 It's a big  big pot where they used to cook the food for the partisans  and they told me to wash it.
She comfort you and the -- if theres no food you -- what can you do?
My mother had some food stocked but there was no food.
but you know  you take your bread  whatever you have  or whatever -- whatever  and you go.
The black market  the -- the market was really some thing.
There are all the possibi lities that the court of the because of the lack of...terrible lack of food  because the terrible pain of loss of wife and children and mothers  people may loose their   thei r divine vision in which we all were born alike.
Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families are going to be together and work .
And so did they feed you  did they give you a place to stay  did they protect you?
And we went to his office and he didnt go for it when I told him we were talking about food and we we re talking about family  he didn't -- he didn't believe us  so he gave both of us a beating with  like I say  you get on your knees  rest your stomach on the chair  the head went through the back of the -- of Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 53the chair  and you t -- without your shirt  and he was whipping you with a whip.
You know  we we used to go to the church  first of all to not to sh ow that we were any different than the other villagers  and also to eat some food there  because whenever there was a a memorial service  they would serve koliva  which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates  cinnamon and sugar.
Now  you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with them.
You tell them that I sent you  and send him to Agrinion to get the food.
I dont remember which month it was  but this time my father and Mykas decided to leave the village  but my mother decided to stay  to guard whatever food we had.
Everybody huddled tog ether on the floor without any kind of facilities  no water  no toilet facilities  no food facilities.
And then they gave me -- the kerchief I dont have -- they gave me a blanket.
They brought us food and they said don't USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 9 worry.
I heard that you could get 100 Gelders for betraying a Jew  and our maid  who uh  was deep in the black market  was uh  because of her family  transporting and this food to Germany  and stealing from it  and selling it  that that saved our lives because many people died from hunger.
And I remember loading ourselves up with cans of of vegetables and goods  you know  food  because there was full of it there.
But I had nothing to do with food  I had nothing to do with distribution of food  or anything of this kind.
They had food and stuff  th ey brought her in the back.
So we went as Germans  thousand cal ories a day  but we have to buy that food  and we have no mone y  bu from where?
And made beatings to walk faster and no food and when we got to Auschwitz  they loaded us into barracks  about 1200 people in one barrack.
And he took me there and I got food and I got sleep there.
But she on the contrary  being upset  she wanted to eat more  every time  so we were the opposite and we would go in the kitchen and steal food for her at night and so I was  I felt very responsible for her.
But all -- as I understood it  all was about food.
It wasnt a question like when we left the ghetto  we could take a little bit of food with us.
My mother very quickly distributed a lot of the fabrics to people that she dealt with and lived in the area to hide it from the Soviets and the arrangements for her with them was  they will use what they needed for themselves and they will let her have what she needs for herself and in trade she would be able to get food for us  for our necessities.
>> Jill Pauly: Actually  we were supposed to be in boarding school  and my mother and father  because they were kosher and didn't want us to eat non -kosher food  decided to board us out instead.
People started to die because we didnt have no food  and to say what is food its so hard to say because nobody understands what food.
Then when it was quieted down a littl e bit I was going twice  took in some food to Warsaw to my sister and brothe r. I took a horse and buggy with a Polish driver and we went to Warsaw and gave it away the food what we had th ere to my sister and brother and some friends and then a while later  a week or two weeks later  I did it again.
They were taking it from everybody  because the war was going on and there wasnt enough food so  it wasnt that people lived by laws  there was no law.
That was -- lunch you get some soup  some cabbage or beets or I don't know.
Only allowed to shop between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon  my mother could shop.
And then we went into -- to homes to -- to help ourselves  you know  with food and things like that.
And I was in this room with the soldier; whic h was like a ball to me  because every time they brought in food for the Russians  I got extra above and beyond.
He was working at various farms to try to find anything he could to bring in some food or whatever.
And -- and then firs -- I remember the first time they gave us food  it was sauerkraut with rotten apples in it.
Yeah  they sold the bakery whatever money they got  we have to pay money to smuggle us and they we were on trains with coal and you paid the people working and they put us between the coal.
And I need a job most of it because the food wasn't made for Europeans.
And what he gave me was a hog  you know  a cow  a life  and some money -- and some different  you know  food I couldnt remember.
Very  very careful given...uh  they give us very careful  uh  dieting food  that after  uh  ten days everybody get a lot of pounds.
And the train stood there for eight days and a woman died on there I remember and we would bring food to the and I was among people that we wou ld buy  get food at the pension and bring it to the people there.
So I went to a place where a German group of soldiers had a kitchen.
So I have to assume that this was April 29th where I got some Interview with Ivan Becker 54 food.
And the food was terrible but I remember one day I had a feast.
And -- And now we have already the hoopa and -- so this cousin made -- made food -- she prepared food for everybody else that was in our wedding co-company  these three people and for us she made a piece of fish and that was -- after I fasted the whole day  that was a whole food.
But we had some tin cans with us from which we took food we were told to take along for the ride.
Now category one and two  if somebody everything was donation food  rich people.
There was a whole village made up with maybe millions of showers with hot water and food.
And the living  what you say Š you had four meals a day – three meals a day; and were a close -kni t family .
They were employed mostly like you sa id  it was easier to get food that way?
From where can -- where can I take food to 38 eat?
And -- And we got  every second day  delivered a piece of ic e  because thats you need there  because it was too warm to keep the food.
So I made a proposition to him  I say  ﬁI will supply you food for the workers  on pre-war prices  because you must pay them in pre -- in -- but you dont pay me in dollars  or in zloty  but you pay me in goods  in textile goods.ﬂ Uh-huh.
And we had very little to eat and this peasant must have had a terrible time  Linka 's father  must have had a terrible time to get food for us.
This was my job for a very  this was 1945  1946  and there was plenty of food.
I could help my families  my relatives to give them food and give them to eat.
The little bit of extra food  the extra hot water to wash.
We weren't given anything to eat practically and we weren't doing--we were unable because we didn't have no strength.
The Food and Drug Administration has drugs and foods  I am in the food section  protecting the American consumer s from any problems that might arise.
That cabbage bring in food for and or if this permit they brought in again and again not little so that  so we managed to solve the problem.
East Berlin was very d -- you know  just like you would expect a Communist place to look like  very old and stodgy and -- and neglected  and even the food.
They were getting food and clothing where they could scrounge it  and I guess most of important of all  they were doing a relative search.
The punishment was that I was put to work outdoors  and that was already uh fall  but the weather was very bad  uh  working outdoors in the rain and the cold  but it was good for me because I was able to cook outdoors  and I was able to take food for my lady  hot food  you know even if it was only water  but it was hot  so my punishment turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
And things were pretty good but I dont like  I didnt know any French food.
And in the letter  she said something to the effect that it wont be long now when the children will be finished off first  because of the food  the lack of food.
But that was the symptoms that a lot of pe ople  usually children  had because we didnt have vitamins  we didnt have pr oper food and hygiene  nothing.
Did you ever go to the prison where your father was  to bring food?
For us it was very important to get \ heel\  [ NB: Dutch word for \ very\ ] good food  and he was very nice.
You take a piece of bread and chew it in your mouth until it's malleable and the guards who take their feed -- the inmates who take the food to the guards just make an impression.
And suddenly  after two weeks  we didn't get any more food there.
Uh .. the British couldnt really do anything for us for the first couple of weeks -- they did bring us food but it was rich food that we really couldnt eat -- but at least we got water.
Where was I going to get food for me to eat  I had no money to eat.
There was no food there  but there was a good bed.
The second moment  war broke out  the bombs are falling  no food.
So you -- then there was a lot of suffering going on with -- Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 16especially with food and -- and health too  because we had the overcrowding caused the -- the sanitary conditions were very bad and typhus broke out.
Here  I had this -- they were talk -- I heard them talking  the co mmanders talk about their Jews that they had in their -- in their -- in their units  who were giving them trouble in terms of not wanting to work on Saturdays  not wanting to eat the food in the mess hall  wearing a hat which was against army regulations and so on.
And then he said  \ The other two kids who were there with me used to join me and at night we'd sneak into the nearest town to steal food.\
In the morning again  one sliced bread with the dark coffee.
The problem was food was available  but because the streets were terribly dangerous to walk  very few people were volunteering to bring the rest of us food.
Also  once  when I was in Camp Zazel  I brought some food from the place where we were working  and when I came back  I was being punished.
And in the evening also  bu t anyway in the morning we got a piece of bread and that had to last us the whole day.
My younger sister and her husband one evening  we lived in one room - I wasn't married yet - a polic eman came said th ey were arrested because they weren't allowed to be outside at th at time after the war a nd they were taken to the jail in Lansberg-Amesh {ph} {ll5} so I didn't have food and I went to them and got from them food and I went to the jail and I had to walk there and then I found out late r that Hitler was there.
But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come with airplanes for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it was different.
And for some reason too  I dont know why  they picked me over there in Theresienstadt to be in charge of the food supply.
So we had to go home without bread and without anything.
We just wanted to beg for food and come back.ﬂ And he...he does...does it like that (gesturing)  and...he says  \ You think I am not hungry?!\
Because number one  we saw him  number two he brought food  which helped us to have a little feast then  and number three is that he  we knew that thats what he would have done  he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four  family of five who were out of their own  well  problems  housed in our place.
In Europe you eat with your -- you cut your food but you use your left hand to put it into your mouth.
I arranged one time here in Washington  at th e officers club at Fort Meyer  to send some food that was leftover to the old peoples home.
Every night they used to go out from th at bunker to a different way and they used to find some food in the...in the basements  but this was also got 52 the reason how they surviv ed.
And he told me in Hungarian  come closer  and he gave me some food.
I I mean  the fact that maybe one had food  one wanted more  I dont know.
If we had a piece of bread and a couple potatoes  this was enough for us to eat.
We used to go at night to the farmers to beg.
They used to take out groups to work outside the Ghetto so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed  the Germans did not especially check those who went 19 out  they only checked those who came back  so we used to go and beg for food.
I gave her the food and she hid it under the blanket and I stood there helpless not knowing what to do.
They were so hungry that they should grab something  or you know  their cabbage or something  and I have not seen.
Pro bu t the main reason for going to school was food  because there was the United Nations  UNRRA provided soup for child ren in school.
When he took his food out of his pocket it was three large carrots and that was his food.
I will never forget that day because what...what we did  ...uh...we were preparing sandwiches and food and we were giving it to the soldiers as they were going toward Russia [the Polish army was retreating eastward in an attempt to avoid encirclement by the Germans].
The  the coupons were collected by one person and through certain channels we were supplied with food.
So it was a block oldest [NB: Blockaltester]  and I was either the...like the vice um oldest or I was just um helping to bring the food  and block... An assistant block...Blockaltester.
And then in he give di di he didnt  he so  I just forget it  and What was the food taste like?
So when we got to Adelsheim that time  there were two people: one person who said his parents had brought food -- his father brought food over to my mother and father at night and that his mother was very concerned because if she had been caught  something might have happened to his family ; and then another woman who said they had traded things with my parents for food.
It was la te Saturday night  just got a drink of water  no food.
But we...but that time we already had something to eat  you know.
But  before the ghetto period already  extra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews  she would tell my mother  ﬁYou better bring George with you to the apartment.ﬂ So  I would stay for the day at the apartment safe when my mother was cleaning or whatever  yes.
So  your father worked there  your sister worked in the food production place  your mother stayed at home and tried to find some way of making meals.
The only way we got food  the Poles would come to the wall  it was a wooden wall  a fence  and we would give them some of those clothes that we re left over and wed trade it for food.
So she had fed this strange black cat who was very happy to receive the food.
made it into German food  which is  of course  what everybody loved.

I had ma ybe 20 on there  so I got double  so I took this food  you know what was left from us  all distributed it again to friends in the other cars.
When we were in the cellar  we had no communication  but since since we run out of food  so we had to do something about it.
I didn't even know; because when I would come home  you know  the  the food was there.
Uh food was unbearable if you were - you eventually learned to eat that but it was uneatable really.
Well  we walked day and night without a ny food  without water  without anything.
Very  they used to put the heads in those big pots of what they brought the food and liquid the tanks there and I said what kind of animals are they because they m ade us animals.
And they said  we need s we need about 15 - 20 people  and you gonna get good food  and we need volunteers.
They were able and managed to get food so that I would be able to be fed just like them.
She came on e evening with the food and there was a Gestapo seal on the door.
I mean I went in and I says ﬁIf I can get something please?ﬂ One day a woman asked me  ﬁA big boy like you shouldn't beg for food  he should becomeﬂ summertime you sent out the cows on a field  but somebody has to watch them that they don't go and eat the corn and the wheat  they should eat the grass ﬁA shepherd.ﬂ So I said  ﬁWould you hire a Jewish boy?ﬂ She says  ﬁMy God  I would never believe your Jewish.
They said that the economic si tuation is very hard  that they don't have food  that Russia occupation  they were at that time still they have Russia soldiers all over.
Like I said earlier  there were shortages of food  water  electricity.
For instance  I never could get used to Oriental food  whether its Chinese  Japanese  or what.
Not that I... I didn't eat the whole thing because I couldn't eat the whole thing.
you brought her the food [indecipherable] Yeah  we did everything we could to make her better.
There were  were dreams  such stories  you know  about food  you know  what they dreamt about what  what they had  you know  eat in dreams.
Then in Se ptember  we were taken back to Hungary; also again of course  in freight train but in much better condition  with food  with shelter  with everything.
Because  in the ghetto  as I told you  my brother would risk his life and go out to get a little food to keep for them going.
He brought us some food and we sat the next day  all day  and the evening he bought us some clothes so we be looking like Gentile people  and we started walking.
I assume in the kitchen  the food you served the Germans was very different than the food you got?
And in Jellafi in Jellafi I I went to school and I learned the language  she has a lot of friends who came to the house  and she had a maid too  who used to cook the food  and the made name was Mart Mart .
Because theres really nothing you can do  you cant give them what they really need  is more food  because you dont have it.
My shoes were gone  so I had from wood made  you know  rags and that and around and we were every...once a week we were going to to the villages and to ask for food.
One person had brought food and put it on the steps at night  and he told us his wife was -- his mother was very upset about his father doing that  because he was afraid he would get caught  then ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 something would happen to them.
And anyway I went and I was able to take a little meal again  a little cheese and a little sugar or whatever they gave me.
September 14 Despite the regulation against bringing something into the Ghetto  people smuggle food through the gate or over the fence.
It was all over  there was no food no water  beatings every day  that we were used to  we endured it  and 2 years passed.
Now  through this uh  uh  by the same way  found the way to the camp  the medi cine  and an extra food  which  and the group of surveyors  I work with them very often  were very eager to do this.
The Jewish commanders  or the sous-commanders [indecipherable] were also quite bad because -- because they -- they -- they regularly stole the midare -- the -- the food.
I could barely eat the food and I had to go to school.
I mean  we had our portion of food that we shared  and we did not fortunately  we were not confronted with any kind of a disease that would have separated us for a long period  only the boil on my leg  which fortunately healed fast and I was returned  but otherwise  in the three months that we were in Auschwitz Renia was beaten once very  very badly because she dared to dip her pan into a cauldron with soup as it was delivered to the barracks.
There was so little food in '45 there in January and 42 February and March that we saw that they were cannibalizing the bodies and people were eating it.
In Prague when we came  the Red Cross had a station and we were given food  and we're given shelter  if anythi ng wanted  and they helped us with providing transportation more.
They were merchants and they had a deposit with they had all kind of food  the potatoes  all ki nd of thing.
They knew exactly how many Jews are in the ghetto  because everybody wants to get food  and the rations were very small.
There was not a wheel  and so Kraus in the first moment told  ye s  baby carriage would be good if there is SS man  we will have a repair  and so I have spare parts  but what we found in this package was food  and there was a camera.

It was a senseless type of distribution  but the food was distributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany.
Somehow they were always happened  but I noticed that the dog gets a lot of food after lunch.
Because they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with them our food.
Smuggling was an important part  because a lot of people depended on smuggled food because the official quota that you got of food was not enough.
The only way you could get extra food would be if you bribed a soldier.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 3 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: And  tell me about-- C: One second. (
He passed out  of course  we started to yell and scream and put some  there was no water ther e. I remember we use to squeeze down our food and take some moisture out of it and that's what we drank.
But there was no provision for us  you know  like I would understand they came in with doctors or  or Red Cross  you know  medication or some food  nothing.
I went there and I was wandering two days without food  because when I come on the border  was -- on one side was the Polish police  and on the other side was the German police and  ﬁHalt  where are you going?ﬂ ﬁI go working to the farm to keep the potatoes ﬂ because it was not me alone  but some Polish people did traveling  too.
We didn't have food; they gave us very little when we got back from work in the barracks.
Poland had most of them  more like wheat  potatoes and other sources of food  but a ll of those luxury things was coming from Interview with Maria Devinki 16 different countries  and we had the privilege of having open business for all those things.
They used to get so many grams and so many uh uh quarts of milk  or so much butter  you know  that money was no no...you could buy but when you work in a in a in a cooperative  you get...you get food.
There was one lady by the name Madame Louise who was kind and genero us and giving me once in awhile food for Josiane.
For about a week to ten days I would say with hardly any food  hardly anything to drink.
We had to control the supply of not only -- it was not enough to ask for people  and to supply the people for work  but it was an 79 question of  as I said  food rations  clothing  bedding  hygiene  cleaning of the barracks  cleaning of each bed  a -- delousing  de -- and we had to -- we had to work very closely with the work detail people.
>> Bill Benson: As you were being forced out of Pionki  you were able to get some food by sneaking into tunnels  if I remember right.
If you couldn't get food with it  it doesn't mean a damn.
The fear is always there  that you dont know where youre being taken  that youre going to get less food than you had that particular moment.
How the German guards  if you paid them off  they let certain people daily  they will bring in food.
The food situation in the main camp had deteriorated quite a bit.
But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway  because it was food.
I -- we went to the kitchen  I-I mean they took us -- that was done on Sunday because during the weekday they wouldn't waste the time that we should go to dig out potatoes for the German kitchen  but on Sundays  that we shouldn't  God forbid  have it too easy and -- and to relax  so they would take us either to dig -- this was a very -- everybody wanted to go to dig up potatoes because you saw that you had a chance  you know  to eat a potato or -- or to steal a potato and bring it in and we would eat it raw because this was no -- no problem  th-that we had to cook it  we thought this is the very delicious food.
What are you buying the food for  so you give it to your girlfriend  your sister  your brother  your mother  and throw it over the fence.
So when I arrived in Detroit in this coat  and white gloves  and I looked -- I suppose I was already nourished because in -- Joint gave us food  and in -- in New Jersey I was getting good food and care.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 19 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: The dogs and they responded with guns on the floor and say there is a uh underground shelter or a thing like that; but... SB: Tell me about the life in the ghetto and trying to get food.
You know  have your bowl and have your food and have your line-up.
There was like a hole underneath  we got out of the ghetto  me and my friend  and I went to my house where I used to live and asked for food.
The Germans gave each former prisoner a double ration card and enough money to buy the food on it.
They havent got enough food in their stomachs and not enough USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 75 voice in their lungs.
And I stayed there maybe about two months in Marseilles until a an-and I used to go to the o-zay   to the o-zay   they used to they used to give me some money to buy food  and things like that.
And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother  with the food  really made us more normal people.
So whoever had the money to give money to buy food.
There must have been food there in the river  but nobody was fishing.
Now  was there a different amount of food that could go to classifications of people  like people who were working  or women  or people [indecipherable] officials -- Every -- everything was for working people  there was no provision for not working.
On the other hand  youre deprived of food and y-you know  we werent hunters  you know what I mean  its not like -- yeah  I mean people ate -- you know  they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found.
And we figured out that since there's no other food and no other provision  we are going to die  especially the farmers told us that in this place died many people before we arrive there.
So food was always something whic h they had to beg us to eat.
I mean  he gave us food  we had a bucket there for our toilet  and he  there was hardl y to live on  but it was the best it could be  there was  how  in this times  what could we expect more?
And you see  I always talk about the fact that I was skinny  and I wasnt hungry  but maybe my body was grow ing and required more - maybe it didnt require food but it required rest.
And they actually trained her to eat everything because there was no food.
Yeah  in the evening we got a piece of bread and a -- and a soup.
So you saw people walking around as a skeleton  because if you have no family that takes care  and you are by yourself  the only way to get stuff is go to the farm  and exchange like linens  or clothing  and then you got your food  so thats what we did on the bicycle.
Anyway  I did hide him in my cell  under  in my room  I brought him food  and I did keep him for a few days.
They were  they were locking the boss of a manufacturer  manuf acturing plant  locking him into his office  and prevent  preventing him not only to get out  but also to receive any food to eat or anything until their demands were accepted.

It was a time of sear ch  a time of inst ability  a time of insecurit y  a time of losing selfrespect for oneself  being that we were dependent on this Hebrew Aid Soci ety to provide us with lodging and food.
We didn't have fruit trees so we didn't have that problem but I remember the food was terrible.
So then the Americans started to give us injections and give us the food and we stayed in these barracks where the Hitler Jungen ph used to stay and then they took us to Felderfinj ph358  and that's when I met my husband.
He thought that I told him I was Jewish so that I can get a pa ckage of food  or a place to stay from the UNRRA.
They gave food to the men  but they didn't give food to the woman.
But of course  her ration tickets were regular ration tickets; but our ration tickets were marked with a \ J \  so we couldn't shop when there was food in the stores.
Food was rationed already but even then the shops were empty.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 16 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: the Germans and whoever else were helping them.
The man with whom she lived used to run a food distribution center and he was caught stealing  and he ended in prison  and she had Rumkowski release him under the conditi on that he would not get a job.
Now  how did you get whatever you needed like food or supplies?
They were held there for between four and six days with no water  no food  and the toilets were starting to overflow.
There we have excellent food  you know  they  everything was buffet style  we were  I was serving the people  the food there because many of them  they were in the bed  lying and I take the food to them and it was good.
Oh  the second or th ird day  I already receiving  I was receiving food from outside  in other words  a person was delivering me  twice a day food.
Can you talk about food in Bergen -Bels en  because in the diary you talk about spinach.
Food was scarce because we could only barte r food one day a week  market day.
So thats -- So you were in some ways involved in the bringing of food into the ghetto  in the ver -- I-In -- well  not in directly  but -- Thats right. --
At one time there was working in the harbor unloading boats  food for the military  which was stationed there.
Then it it arrived the problem was what happened afte r. We were all of course  we didnt eat for so long  and we were all hungry.
We got the flour  we got the flour back so we could at least furnish part of the bread for the camps.
Yeah  the peasants had the right to bring their food to sell.
And I came home  I brought b ack a bread and some other food that they gave me  you know   they gave me some food  the Germans.
When we painted this big room  the beds were standing there with everybody  with the cabinets open  with food plenty.
It was not very difficult because there was no there was no strict rules about behavior or buyi ng or selling food.
Somebody -- Somebody -- Somebody went on my foot with his ho -- wooden shoes  and -- and in Auschwitz the situation was so  you have the -- the -- if you was -- if you were hurt a little bit  it couldnt -- it -- it -- it couldnt be healed  because of the -- of the -- of the extremely poor quality of the food.
We -- we did  from time to time  bring in 32 food and we had this convoy that -- no  that was -- the convoy to Switzerland  was -- was that from Berlin or from Munich?
So as I got into these towns I found the Jews living in the old barns  over manure piles  and cellars and my job was to get them housing and food and shelter  clothing and...I had Eisenhower's...General Eisenhower's orders in my pocket for the Germans to provide decent housing for them so I was able to do that.
And then they were shot  ye s. Without food  without nothing.
I kept them there for an hour or so  two hours  and then put them back on and started looking for food  whatever you could find.
>> Bill Benson: Terrible because of the terrible shortages of food.
Incidentally  Lithuanian food was very good bread  the the the butter  and all this.
One night I saw women lining up in the corner of the camp  they were given a blanket and dish for food and with my smart -- you know  what do you know at 16 in a camp from the age of 13 to 16? --
She gave extra food to those girls they were a little bit...know a little bit they were weaker.
So I was  I was given by one of the Germans a room on the  on like an attic and  you know  I came back quickly because I had good food.
These were people who were coming to my home  sleeping and eating  an d I was helping them with work.
Was there some food that was more comfortin g than others  or when you were able to be around la rger amounts of food  perhap s with the Poles  the Polish army division  were there some types of foods that you bega n to really want to have an appetite for?
The la the the a month of food which is left in that little bag is fa is a half a pound of sugar.
A number of them were not too religious  but none of them were willing to risk their lives at that point to bring food.
So i-it came to a point that time that we had plenty of food  and of course the food consisted from three meals a day  mostly soup and meat.
And he told my mother that I was fine  and as soon as I just lived  you know  had more food and so on  I would be fine  and I was fine.
And I would eat th at  and I guess I sort of enjoyed some of those dishes at the time.
Again  a lot of people got sick from starvation and died.
He asked this man to stay in this house  it was where he kept food for his cows and all and they stayed there.
94 In fact  I would have to anticipate  I dont know the figures  and we did talk about this earlier yesterday  I have a very great feeling that most of them -- there are survivors  but I dont think they survived in -- I mean  from my perspective  we didnt ha ve a lot of money  but we had clothes  and sho -- and en-enough food to eat  whet her it was -- whether we had -- we didnt have meat every day  but we were on rationing like ev erybody else in England.
He knew  and he knew that I knew  in the POW camp  you dont have to fight any more  you get shelter  food  good treatment.
With that first transport  I mention whole families came  so I had somebody staff the kitchen with women who knew about food  who knew about preparation of food  understood food  although they never worked for 39 thousand people  I -- I -- neither did I. But at least somebody w ho knows how to handle food -- food.
Did you see that  or -- No  I dont be -- I never stole food.
You nourishe d them  but you had to start out with  you know -- thin  thin soup  because you couldnt give them food  per se.
And you said you had enough food  did you -- Yeah  you get food from the Joint.
Your parents did not obviously so they didnt keep any traditions so there was no kosher food at home.
It was a time that you never knew what is right and what is wrong  what you're doing is good  what you're doing is bad  so we left  but whoever was...after when they took away all those people in tra...in in in trains without food  without that...they took them to Siberia.
About the food  about al l this  we finished with talking about the camp  and that was very  very strange.
Uh we had to  we fed her literally with a uh milk bottle that belonged to one of my dolls I s uppose and uh I don't even know where we got the milk from because I'm sure my mother didn't have enough mi lk for me  but I do remember that she bought the uh can of condensed milk and watered that down  and that's what the poor little puppy lived on for a while  and I also remember that one day she made some cream of wheat and it bur ned on these wonderful uh cooking facilities  and somehow that became food for this baby uh dog  puppy  for a few days.
Because they had this warehouse  other warehouse with food  too  some of it.
Canned food  then th then the macaroni  and all different kind of food.
No one gave us food  no one  but because it was families  they got something with them.
For three  four months and there were a lot of German girls who spoke Italian and after the war I remember the UNRRA came and we could get some food packages from the UNRRA and all the interpreters I met there were Jews who had worked for the Germans just like we  Mimi and I and several others.
So was USHMM Archives RG -50.030*0151 8 some  some kind of connection to get some food over there.
And I said  I would like to have something to eat.
Although Tschich  Commandant Tschich  never harmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he  if he will ever catch me returning anything to th e  of the confiscated food to the Jews  he will shot me right there and then.
We'll get to the farmers and maybe we'll be able to bring some food.\
Then they come in they're leaving they come into my office  there are two women sitting in front of my desk complaining about the food  and I say to them  \ Look  I'm trying whatever I can do to make it better \  and they say good-bye.
Then i-if they bring the food  you know  and all the natives are dressed in fancy hats and everything.
We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night.
And I asked -- the prisoner came by  and he said  oh  he's burying his food.
They would give us bread  and sometimes they would even bring some like hot soup or so to feed us.
We couldn't say that we starved for hunger as far as food is concerned.
And luckily  luck was with me  I went ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 over to the good side.
And once we find a truck with -- a Russian truck with soldiers  full with equipment  and full with food  and full with everything.
But  apparently  there was confusion and they were killing people en masse and so  people were trying to escape and there was it seems that my father and a few other people escaped at the very end  and that they went someplace into the w oods  and then came down came close to a village looking for the food  and that they were surprised by a German  I think  German patrol  or Ustashe patrol  Im not sure.
But the problem that we did not understand was that these people had not had any kind of food for months.
The food was scarce at that time and hospital food was kind of awful  but it was nourishing.
They were robbing from the people and take everything  money and food.
My physical condition was the best of the three of us  cause if there was food  I ate it.
And we were -- Denmark were rather important as distributor of food to Germany.
But when I...I did it I was already lucky because I was...I had it already...I could breath in food in the ghetto.
So I was able to make the trip and enjoy the food.
>> Josie Tra um: It was a society that took care of people to make sure they had food.
She simply couldn't handle the food for all these people  so I essentially was trusted as the permanent babysitter for my brother.
There was not enough food and the coats -- the coat was a big problem.
We didnt need any money because the food we needed to live on  we got from the soldiers and from the German  t -- who had to look for our well being  so that part  there was no -- no need for.
And he kept comi ng back and -- and making sure  you know  that I have food and that -- that ge -- I mean  I couldnt move  I was so sick.
Was most important to  to have to drink  like water or you know  some  some food to  to  to eat over there.
They hadnt set up the food situation yet  and that wasnt very nice.
But the Germans are walking in thousand and thousand columns so we grabbed some food from them and some something  whatever they had over there.
Trucks were coming in and out with food  they were being checked  you know  who they were and all that and just to keep order in the camp.
At one point I was able to make contact; and I sold my... First  I sold a few of the...used up money I had on black market to buy extra food.
They were allowing many food packages or like my father took his starlet bag and he used to fill it or whatever.
Our railroad car or the transport we were on would travel a few days and food was very meager.
And my mother would go and bring him food and water and come back  and he would not come back into the house for the 49 fear that they will come again and -- and pick up the men  or the people  whatever.
They said take your blanket and your dish for food; we're leaving the camp.
It took a long time  especially on the farm  it was easier because the fresh air and the fresh eggs and the fr esh food that we were very hungry  you know.
If they were stealing some food  beca use the partisans  the group fell apart.
When we got into that ghetto when they condensed the ghettos  we got a little more food.
We didn't have food  but at least I was sure -- I was not sure -- but I was sure I was going to live until night.
And  of course  they used to come on th e farm for food  the Gestapo.
Father was a cost analysis engine -- ... Okay  did the women all cook together in the kitchen  or -- Well  everybody was cooking together  and -- and -- as long as the food lasted  there was food cooked in -- in that place all together.
I knew him  and he would send us food and send us clothing  and I think we did it also through the Jewish Community in Cairo.
And during this -- during this time we find  you know  there was a concen tration camp and we released the -- it was be -- action was very  very quick  the Germans surprised that she didnt -- na -- even -- it was the [indecipherable] the lunchtime  they leave the -- the food in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 22-- leave on the table and run away  because fortunately was this way  they were at time -- this a whole story  but a -- very shortly I tell you we have a German tank and was prepare very good and the tank break the gate  Arbeit Macht Frei  you know  was break right away  and the German who supplied the German tank [indecipherable].
Over there  they came to work for you only for the food  forget about the pay.
And in the middle of the room we had like a pot- belly stove  if you could manage to get food and cook  that's what we did on that pot-belly stove.
So for three days there were no Water  we when we got out  people they allowed you to get out  water we had at at the train station  but no food.
I did not give my sister  Anna   which she accepted my reasoning and was willing to suffer and hold off her thirst and craving for food. \
It was really semi-orphans at that time who lived there  it wasn't at that time a treatment center  it was semi-orphans and they had girls and boys and I got a good job as a house mother for the boys and  of course  we lived there  we got our little apartment  our food  everything was taken care of.
We And there was rationing so that you co uld get only a certain amount of any kind of food  but was it actually so that cert ain foods were forbidden to even have  whether the e for example  if its eggs  or butter  or meat.
So you know  so the second selection  it was more cynical  because with the second selection  plenty of -- of Polish prisoners arrived  Polish Jews from Polish ghettos  and they knew that -- the food was so bad that they all remained small  very small.
But again  this aunt of ours  of mine  who played such an important role in saving all of us  again  she and I  we teamed up and went  which was very customary then for city people to do  took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers might like to have and we could put on our body  and walked about  I would say  thirty  forty kilometer  about twenty miles from Budapest   and exchange it for food.
So we were there a few days  we were starving there too.
And there  one day as the war was approaching  she received notice to present herself at the police station with three days' worth of food  whatever she could carry on her back  and two blankets and she would be evacuated  which basically was the buzz word for being deported.
So I went there  one of the stops that I did on my Berlin visits was her little apartment and she always had some food  first of all she always fed me a warm meal and then she also gave me something that sh e had saved from her ra tions.
They gave us some clothes  they ga ve us a place to sleep  food to eat and then -- th-th -- there was one nurse there  I -- I just went to visit with her in Ramatgan.
And then one day the Germans came and they wanted our house.
She went out to the  you know  to the field to pick up at least a raw potato  or something - you know  something to eat  because he di dnt give us any food.
We were in the field and we had -- there was nothing to eat.
So they -- which was  in a way for -- for us it was lucky  because what was happening  when lorries with food and potatoes or carrots or something  they werent in sacks  they were loose -- or they [indecipherable]  so  you know  you soon find ways  so we had long wires and we used to try to hook them onto the lorries when they were passing  or a horse and cart  and move that thing and they fell down and eventually we could get some potatoes or whatever was on the [indecipherable] we had -- we had to try to steal things.
I dont think my mother did because I remember her telling me that she went to a birthday party of this one uncle and so that she could travel on the subways and my father couldnt and I remember she was so upset that they didnt send any food home for my father.
We were 20 hours a day and food only for one hour.
>> Bill Benson: As you said  you were under these circumstances for about three years.
>> Michel Margosis: Food became very important  especially since you don't have that much food.
He he was responsible for making sure my Jeep was operating properly and that I had the necessary fuel and food.
Yes  then my I I believe they sent my brother first  with with Baba Yoros with a horse loa load of food  because by then we had having sold all these little dresses made out of the parachute  my mother had collected a lot of wheat.
So we had t-to work physically so hard  no food  no nothing.
Look not everybody h ad the food and there were many and there were two hundred settlers the life was -- not so good.
So  that between the two of us  we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal.
We didn't do work there  but we weren't fed either  I mean  just water  sort of  or liquid.
But they told us to take some food  so people will take whatever they had  maybe bacon  or bread  basically.
Uh but uh they told me that their immediate need was to open a soup kitchen or soup kitchens  uh that food was in short supply.
We had to go down  you know  put a gun on people to get the food  and it was much more rough after this burned down.
I don't remember what my parents sent me  maybe they send me something  some food or something  whatev er they could.
So when the three days were over  I sa id  ﬁOh God  theyre out of the wagons.ﬂ My mother had some food  and some drink in the wagon for the trip.
So you and Veronica went and found your brother  and gave him some food?
The struggle was to find food; because we were constantly hungry.
But if this was within the scope of the directive the German list would provide  then they organized a standard way of life for a community  hospitals and welfare and food.
But in the minute I reached the Czechs  I didnt have a problem with food.
But here so far we didnt ge t just -- just this bread in the morning and the watery soup in the evening.
Most Germans just woul dnt want to work in that  and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could produce.
We have to give 01:13:30 up our silver  gold  whatever valuables  and of course we were rationed and the right first week you could see women  children on the street without food  without medical care and then institute now our hometown the ghetto where all the Jews living out in outlying areas had to come in and we happened to be in the part where the ghetto was established.
You couldnt help anybody be cause you couldnt share with anybody any food  because if you get so little food -- we used to get -- you know how we used to divide our bread?
I was getting some food here and ther e. I remember I joined a young Communist league because they give you a pound of beans if you did.
And one soldier who was from Cleveland  I know  I wish I would have remembered his name  gave my mother his food ration.
So we went in to the mayor and we asked him to give us food.
There was fun food  but you  you know  and  of course  my mom wasn't that...you know  she was holding on to it  too.
They had four levels of ration cards  the largest food rati ons were given to Czechs and Slovaks.
And so then  my mother  wh-who is a very resourceful person  she decided that Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14  2010 65that she is going to barter clothing  our pers onal clothes  for food.
And I don't remember how long it was that we didn't get any food.
They really I'm talking about 8 Food distribution bureau (German) 9 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to oversee Jewish communities and ghettos.
The people which never was hungry do not understand how the food can [indecipherable].
Then they started later on if they needed  and everybody was trading some valuables for food.
the -- the -- the Russians are outside  and theyre cooking  and we didnt have any food.
They had kept the Jewish food stores open until a minute before they took us away  ten o'clock in the morning or whenever they had to close the Jewish shops and I remember my mother sending me out to the store.
People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of food without refrigerator.
So we lived in the ghetto  and life got terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations  because rations for Gentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month  but didnt got.
Now theres one interesting thing happened  it was one of the underground movements  that was later on a different group was looking for food.
They gave us food and health care and li as much love as an older child could give you.
We got only one slice bread in the morning  soup with no potatoes  nothing  but you got to eat.
But I saw this [indecipherable] when they already having good time on the food and everything.
But when I came back from work  they didnt ge t food  those people who didnt work and I gave them my half of the bread and I dressed them up.
So  I would pick her up  and take her between me and my sister sh e should stand  and then  we would watch over her that she should get her portion of food  but a few days later  there was a selection  but we luckily again passed that selection  but they took out from that selection 500 girls.
These uh food packages were being stolen regularly and they were appearing on the French black market.
We used to get coffee in the morning with a piece of bread and sometimes noontime they used to give us a little soup and then in the evening again the same bread and that was our food for the day.
And I had convinced the sergeant that the Kraut was a pretty nice guy and he was my interpreter and give him a big sales talk and finally the sergeant rele nted and allowed the Kraut to get some food in the kitchen  but I heard him give a -- General Warlimont orders about washing his me ss kit afterwards and cleaning it -- cleaning up after him  and he used a four -- a few selective phrases.
There was some truth in it  but I dont think he realized that maybe the young pe ople need more food than the older one  and the kids need more food.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know how your parents  once your father lost his job  was forced out of it  how your parents managed to make ends meet   how they were able to feed their family?
Other tha n being hungry all night long and hating the food  having to learn a new language and having to memorize all kinds of things.
The German soldiers kept on saying ﬁwe dont have any more food either so we cant provide for youﬂ. Every morning they would march us a few kilometers away from the jailhouse under the supervision  the guard of the SS soldiers to a huge mountain.
So he cam back to Stockholm  and of course  he couldn't do a thing for anyone  but he became a partner of a Hungarian Jew who couldn't travel anymore  who had a big import  export-import business in uh  food.
The streets were littered with homeless  dying  hungry peopl e. And my mother  who was a very poetic person  loved beauty  loved humanity  told me : well  you should not have given your sandwich away because we don't know if there will be any food tomorrow.
So thif thats first thing what they get for  you know  to to bring food to the ghetto.
There was nothing to eat  no water and no sanitation facilities.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 31 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: PT: The German orders they are ti  this one was typed  taped.
I had mixed my camp f ood with an little bit of selfcooked food.
On-Only three  usually it would be more   food or something.
This was a very good job  very good pay in food  mainly food.
Not trust-worthy  and I was the only one in the unit that had a pocket watch  and he asked...he found out that I had a watch and he asked me for the watch because he had to know when to stop to food  8 you know.
So one night  they told us to get up  pack our things and marched us out.
So following day they took me over to the veteran's hospital and they want to give us food you know but lucky I couldn't eat.
There was a neighbor across the street that provided food for them when food was available.
The following day  Mr. Bereczki gave him a shovel  some food and three breads and salt and took him -- o h  they wrapped his feet in rags because  of course  nobody had shoes to fit him.
The levels were occupied by different  they were Russian prisoners  French prisone rs  and we were on the top and there was a rail going up and one of the privileged prisoners controlled the brakes  that is he let the full lorries go down to the valley and brought an empty one up and we had to fill each lorry with  what  12 lorries a day or we would get no food  and we -- the rail for the lorries then from the brake station were then two of the different niches where the prisoners worked  so I had this and another one had this and so on.
Well  I pretended that my sister and I  to make more money  that we buy food and sell food.
Well  those first few of months  why did we do those business  that kind of business  preparation  storage  buy food  put away  all in  in our mind was only not to be hungry  anymore.
So I used to go on my bicycle to the villages to buy food  to help out the families.
Or so -- so  y -- generally even in Holland af ter the war  there were all kinds of new ec -- experiences or so  about food  or otherwise.
So they were always caught in between having [indecipherable] because the food was al so terrible.
Trying to adapt to -- to -- told not to complain because that -- that grandmother who ran the house there  really gave us very  very  very poor food.
The next day she brings me some food  Mrs. Foltanski .
Because the Germans and even the Hungarians had a tremendous amount of food and other necessities in different places and we had to hurry up and load the wagons and...and trains for them that their material should be taken...uh...westwards instead of being taken by the Russians.
I dont touch  well  any of this junk food that might have -- or any junk food  you know  Im very careful [indecipherable] I -- I -- I cant really eat junk food  because right now my -- my glucose is out of control  rea lly  so Im trying to be extremely careful.
9 The food -- being hungry  most of the people thought about it.
They were ha rdly giving them any food and she was already exhausted.
The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war  so they brought them into concentration camp and never gave them any food.
In a way  we were like wise beyond our years because my parents would tell us to go and listen to what some of the Germans were saying  you know  because -- You could speak German?
And they came in and th -- and they started to cook.
I don't I cannot tell exactly and there the people the population  the Jewish population put them in right away and gave them food and they kept.
And you could buy a stamp  that you could send somebody in Prague  which they woos -- would use the stamp to send you a food package.
So people -- but it -- they were to -- you know  there was a lot of black market going on among those.
That camp was worse than the prison because the camp was barracks and in the meantime it's November and it's raining and it's muddy and they have a toilet out on the yard and the watchman out in the yard  and my mother got a bladder infection and the food was terrible and we had it was like almost.
Of course  we were touched by -- the things I remember is the food shortages  but they werent real food shortages.
And food then -- then -- at work we -- we had to go for lunch and get food  and so on  yeah.
But they fed us which was good  kosher food  very nice.
And we cut a hole in  and we put a like...what you...what you carrying food in it...a bucket.
This aunt  Connie  send us care packages after the war was over  with food  with clothes.
Now  in order to know which vitamin is good for us  which is not  or [indecipherable] food  there is a method used by chiropractors  and also other practitioners of alternative medicine  called muscle testing.
Well  we ate what they gave us  which was very little.
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 109 There were Jewish people  but they got out on account of the food.
And we are not -- we -- we were not used to that food  see?
I was less afraid then that we would be caught or or some thing horrible would happen  because things were very stable in a way  we you know  there was this couple and they took care of us  and they were nice to us  and there was  I guess  enough food.
And so what I had to do was interview each of these students  find out what they needed; books  a place to stay  food  etcetera.
>> Bill Benson: Between 2:00 and 4:00 was your only opportunity to go out and find food  then not available to you very often?
There are also non-Jews in these places  but their condition and food cannot be compared to those of the Jews.
As a matter of fact  they was too good  they start cooking and giving us so good food - like too fat things.
On every corner they're putting soup and bread and food after libera tion.
There was really no food available  and people say that even dogs and cats had disappeared.
So so my father tried to calm her down  saying well  well send a man down to Agrinion   we have a lot of food in the bank End of Tape Four Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14  2010 62Beginning Tape Five Okay  so you come back to the village Yes.
Now the point was  with that ID  one could go then to any food rationing office and get a set of food ration cards.
We heard that the Germans surrounded them and the artillery is going  and there was no food because there were more than a million people in Warsaw.
He provided food  the ------------  he didn't allowed anybody to interfere with his work.
Once I was taken to the hospital I wasn't given that kind of food.
01:34:18 A little later he came back and brought some  some food and no sooner we started to e at  this SS soldier came with his machine gun pointed at us and tells to the German guy that uh Juden so and uh Raus  Raus  everybody.
How did you get the food to them wit hout being seen  and without being shot?
I sa ys yeah  thank you very much  and they gave me the [inaudible] see  they were ba from the tra when the transport came in  so the people broke through the you know  because they thought they going in the working camps  so they gonna need food  so whatever  they had food.
We had our food  every night we invited somebody else of our friends to come for dinner; because in Vienna there was...was so terrible then.

Stay with him because I wanted to make sure where they are  and when I went back to this guy  but he was treating  food wasn't much to eat  but he was  he was hiding us out  so we go used to that  so we don't want to go with them  but lately  if we went there  and we heard that the  that the front you know  the  the Russians coming closer  we made a foxhole in the woods  and then we all joined each other  and we stayed in the foxhole  and the Russians came along.
Now  what would happen if you got caught bringing this food back?

D-Do you remember that you didnt have very much food during this -- this is -- Im -- Im now asking before your father is actually arrested and you dont see -- No  I have no memory of not having enough food at that time.
And he was in business  I am always saying we are eatin g his horse food  because  oat  oat.

The nuns gave the fo od to the men  but th ey didn't give food to the woman.
So  then the...uh...there came an order to li quidate that camp  and we went to another camp and there was a shortage on food  and they gave us rotten...rotten potatoes with...they gave us a spinach...maple leaves.
My mother -- my mother at that time was by herself in the apartment and was able to bring me food once a day  so I saw her.
When we came on the ship  the first thing we asked the fellows  the Americans  says when we get our coupons to get food  because we always used all those years to get coupons to get food.
During the bombing  my father and my brother went to look for food.
And I used to shop  and bring home the food  and make three meals a day  and it was just like my mother did  the same thing.
And I had to find a place to sleep  which I did.
They saw the cans of the food  they didn't touch it.
People suddenly proclaimed their Jewishness because -- there was  I know  some sort of a table and I guess people -- if you got more as a 75 percenter or even a 100 percenter  people were now emerging and claiming to be Jews because they wanted the favorable treatment of supplies and getting more food  getting packetten -- packages.
And the four of us used to take trips  and we were looking for food.
But we had a swimming pool  the food was good  and we -- we thought we were all right.
Of course at the time we didn't know it and everything that we could eat  we ate.
And they told us  this is the last week  and we going to go to another place  going to be much nicer  the food will be better  everything will be better  and the -- were going to go -- theyre going to ship us to Germany.
But then in a little  they gave us something to eat.
They collaborated and the supplies of these ships  and oil  and food  they helped prepare these shipments or these movements of people and the trains  they put at our disposal.
I'm sure that my pare nts may have hidden some  maybe my mother hid some of her rings or something because the 1st y ear of the war  once things started being a little more normal  there was some food that my parents were able to get  probably on the black market.
There was time where there was nothing to eat because Warsaw was surrounded by Germans  and on the wa Vistula river by Russia there was no food coming in.
Also  some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit  get from the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit.
I remember we sent him a package of a pillow and some food.
You know and Vienna at that time also had no food.
So a little bit of a taste or a little bit of an understanding we had.
If you had so mething to carry  you usually carried it inside your coat so nobody would detect it  or else you were attacked by other people if they suspect you have food on you  theyd do anything.
As I told you  we had coupons in order to get certain amount of food every week and quite a few families  Jewish and Orthodox  23 no distinction there  chose many times not to report a death  to go to the cemetery and drop there the corpse  in order to save the coupon  so they can have some extra measure of food.
And and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand  you know  n-no food  you know  were not going to give you anything.
Even living in Poland and considering ourselves middle class people  we always had a enough to eat  and it was nourishing food  but this we called luxurious food that people ate every day here.
Also there  some people  some girls get sick from the food because they  they give us very dietetic food in the quarantine and even with that  some girls get sick and they were transported to the hospitals.
>> Bill Benson: So after you lost your store and your vineyard  how was your family able to make ends meet and feed the family?
And I was in such a battalion working  a nd somehow I came to the...uh...very...was...very...very helpful that I was able to buy during the day for the exchange of all kinds of clothing which I 14 brought from the...from the ghe tto and...uh...the Poles to us and were selling bread against...exchanging against...uh ...potatoes  against that clothing which we brought out and this was a tremendous help if I was able to come back with the ghetto which is also illegal and brought back some food.
But before that carnage  I don't know how else to call it  they did give us some food too  maybe not as much as the women  but we didn't need as much really.
And we went to that camp  we been so happy  my goodness  we have food  and you know  if somebodys sick  we have medicine  because you know  the they took care of us  the English government.
We didnt have any medications in the camp  we didnt have a thermometer in the camp  le -let alone enough food to get you back to be strong  and people died like flies.
Th ere was some  it was easier to  to if  if  if people had something that they can  that they could bart er  then they were able to supplement some of their food.
And I...I know my father got better food than I and my...my mother was looking and she came from a poor family in also...but from a cobbler's family.
So my father got together as big a package of food as he thought he could manage and uh started to make his way north because he knew his friends in in Amsterdam were starving.
And my father worked most of the time in the kitchen  camp kitchen  because everyone had to go and pick up their food.
You got something black in the morning which was supposed to be coffee  two 6 hundred fifty grams of bread.
>> Bill Benson: So your ability to try to get food and trading was gone.
So  they didnt all own property in Athens  and they were able to  if they had money  they could rent a room and they could buy food  and eventually we got food in through the American Joint Distribution Committee  which we could cont ribute both to individuals and through the synagogue.
But people didnt worry about that  there was more worry about food and whats going to happen to us to worry about the bath  you know  there was no such a thing as baths.
And they said  the hola we one or two people from the fra ternity all go every week and they bring the food for everybody and then you dont have to go and take do this journey.
Uh the Russians are uh very friendly although they were a little bit rough  but they were very friendly  and uh they uh offered to share some food with us  which was uh  very much welcomed.
>> Bill Benson: Because I think already food was beginning to get scarce otherwise.
He took care of us  food  something to get dressed  things like that.
So there theres nothing at first  and slowly they build again  like a platform where we just sit and I the w the they then give us they carry food in pails to us  you know  and its all usually it was something with rice  you know.
So  what she did is  she walked the railroad track at night  slept under bushes during the day  and wh en she ran out of food that she had  she took fr om the fields.
And I didn't get sick without food  without water  for 2 weeks until I reached a farmer where I wanted  where I thought I would find refuge.
As part of that Haganah  and as people left  at some point I became the camp director or commander and the most difficult task was to keep the Bulgarian Jews from the Rumanian Jews  and everyone wanted to be in the kitchen to cook their kind of foods  so we had committees and rotations so everybody tasted the other persons food.
Next day  my father said now you're going to go  and you're going to tell him that you used a name when you buy food.
That has to do w ith the type of food  you only had soup.
And this woman went every day and they  they were not in lack of food.
I always had enough food because I guess as a child they gave me all the food that they didn't have  that the others didn't have.
We did not appreciate all the beautiful food that the Jewish community was giving us because we didnt know what it was.
But  like thousands and thousands of people  men and women  thei r stomach couldn't take the food.
I was in the part part of we studied in ghetto without food  without nothing  but we studied.
But with the bombed out ID  one -- any other food ration office -- suppose one moved to a different part of Berlin than was required to hand out a -- a set of food ration cards.
Crying) You know  they try to... also to help me with food; or when I got this terrible dysentery and a touch of this typhoid fever  they were the ones what sent--through some guards and workers what were assigned to that camp--some charcoal tablets and  uh  uh  some medication  so that I've did survived.
Many of them  they had digestive problems and so they quickly learning how both the prisoners and the people who were giving them food to be very careful how they transitioned to the normal life.
Now  where my father's family was in the mountains  there was much more food.
And they came across a farm and when they knocked on the door  the Germans were frightened obviously and they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some wa ter  whatever.
And my stepmother then one day  one of the times that the was on the phone  \ Yeah  you didn't send me food  packages.\
If 500 reached that destination  maybe more  maybe 600  but the rest small children  no food  no nothing.
Did they give you any food to eat  or water to drink?
But later used to come people who know it a little bit about the Holocaust  and the concentration camps  they used to ask me if I was mistreated  or if I didnt had enough food.
And a little bit of food spill out from the container; and the SS uh woman saw this  and they punish both of us.
And you had to watch  because if you had any food left at all  you have some  once in a while  about once a week  you get about three little real small  little baked potatoes  half rotten  but theyd been boiled  you know.
05:16:14 So this organization there gave you food coupons and -- Yes.
That was her luck because the others who took the food  they died.

It became part of her daily job to make sure that the food was growing.
At the same time when I went over to the other children  there was less food and less [indecipherable] but  at that time it wasnt a question of hunger or no hunger  and it didnt make a difference.

And he worked in a pl ace that gave us some privileges and food.
Everybody helped themselves that they finished off all the food what was.
Our food wa s brought through a door in the floor.
And then one day my mother used to gi ve me food to bring to my father  you know  like food that she made that he liked.
Because at this time  we were being sent supplies from the United States to the UNRR  and La Guardia came  and  since I was involved in with the distribution center of the food -- but this was food given directly to people -- and La Guardia came -- and there's a picture of him with me -- he was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually happening.

No food  absolutely no food  no nothing  only the mercy  whatever the civilian throw you a piece of bread of things like this.
So they actually got food for three people and shared it with me.
The food was not too much; but  uh  we had a nurse in the...in that  uh  barracks  was a part of barracks was the infirmary.
The health problem was so bad that people collected what you call it  became no water  no soap  no nothing so people could not wash or clean and we were so filthy so ever ybody had lice.
From age  whatever  they will remain alive  they should be lining up  they will be united with their parents  they will be given better food  they are going to have milk and cake and bread.
I mean we didn't have any clothes  only what we had on.
We were only to gether at dinn er time or eating time and then he had the plate of food.
Little by little she gave us food that she felt without fat.
So  she was having like a little bar  you know  and she was using me to bring in food or a 01:46: little whiskey or something to carry into that little store and to help to serve the tables.
They were hungry so they got the food to they could live.
And when I got the next day my bread  I couldn't eat again.
interruption] The meals werent ju st good because you couldn't afford the food  or because food was rationed and there just wasnt much?
I didn't run away but to go out for some food.
She ran into the village and bought some food from the peasants and brought it home dressed as a Polish woman.
The food situation was also very critical because the farmers also had -- they couldn't get much more than anybody else and they were not allowed to slaughter any animals because Germans kept a very good record of that.
And his body smelled from you know  the only food that they got was apparently the Germans took whale blub ber and cooked that into a stew and thats what they got to eat  that and some potatoes.
And they r-r-rented one  this hotel hotel in those mountains  in this little town  and paid Germans with food  with cigarettes and so on.

And I rem and my father in camp  hes he knew he was a plumber there  they used him to do plumbing  and he helped people get out of the camp  and they paid him by giving him like an egg  a tomato  a few potatoes and this way he would make his food.
They used to give her food because my mother was so restless  was like crazy.
I was very depressed and I just  we had enough food because we we re told to have food and we had a maid who brought sacks and sacks of potatoes and sugar and everybody said to stock up on potat oes and sugar and flour.
If another 10 people dropped by  I would have enough food.
You had your food locker and it was already there you were sitting somewhere to eat.
They were barracks  three high  three people to each plank  very little food.
You would -- you -- but was all kind of food you wanted.
Anyway  so she said go to the store and buy this loaf of bread.
I dont know what we were eating  I dont know how we got our food.
And we also would keep there in the winter the perishable food  you know   when we cooked something.
>> Rita Rubinstein: We had food then but we didn't know what the canned goods -- the tuna fish and other things  spam.
Bill Benson: How did your father's -- how did your father support the family after he lost his job?
We were so exhausted and so hungry that when we would be in the barracks  we -- we could not walk around in the barracks just at our will  we had to get into the bunk bed and stay there  when we came in at night.
When we were getting  I told you  the of food  it was a small portion of meat  but Bert sent it to my parents.
Sometimes we would steal something if something was to be stolen and once I remember a peasant  a woman caught us while we were sleeping and the two women started talking to her and asking her for food and they offered her a ring.
You had to have money  buy your star and get the food st the the coupons  in order to buy food.
I appreciated the food because three times a day we were eating.
Eventually UNRRA was turned 14:19: into IRO  International Refugee Organization  but all the scuttlebutt and all the appearances we heard and saw was that there was an enormous corruption  an enormous black market of food supplies collected from many countries of the world  including I'm sure a great many well meaning people in the United States with a gr eat deal of it being stolen or ending up on the black market and some of the officials gett ing very rich in the process.
I was able to  to bring somethings to Pani Ola  food.
There was another questi on of food  because in the summertime immediately they told us what we can find in the woods.
In terms of food rations  di -- amounts of food -- Yeah.
Actually  right now I work -- I do some consulting  like for the food industry  like restaurants 29 and sup -- food stores.
I wa s able to spend that on the subway system 45 and learn what New York is like and get a job as a busboy in a place called Farm Food Restaurants  near Radio City Music Hall.
And my daughter ruined her shoes on the boat  I had -- we had to buy shoes  and then the rent  and some food [indecipherable] Joe had the job  a nd I started to work too  in that little town.
But more or less they let the Jewish community  there was a person that was like president of the camp  people that were in charge of  of the food  distribution of food  there were  at the very beginning  there were two kitchens.
So there for awhile I was out of school  there was no school.
And was start problem supply the food for the people in the basement.
Well  we were able to do at first  but then they see  the Germans had squeezed the rations.
This woman that hit me  she was  she was strong  and cheeks like this  red cheeks  and not like us  that we  we just had no food  to eat  nothing  starving  and had to work.
For I dont know how many days  clothing  food and everything so when the Germans come to our house that we were ready to be taken away.
We bartered with the peasan ts and we got at that time food enough.
No food  no nothing  so uh and we started to travel and then noticed that we are traveling 15 towards Czechoslovakia and uh across the border I think  and it was on an afternoon when we reached the the uh the area of Vitkovit ch   which is an indu strial area in in Salasia   which is already in Czechoslovakia.
And there is  there was some food to buy here and there.
We were treated extremely well  we were taken care of  we had shelter  we had clothes  we had food  and we did not suffer the sense that a lot of other people suffered.
Ta as much yes  take as much as you can  basically food and warm clothing.
Let's just...go back one minute to how you were bringing food to the people on the ramp.
Much more I can't miss because they don't give you enough food.
We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night.
There was a hospital there  and she was a runner in that hospital  and that made her life a little easier because she had a bunk  and maybe uh  a little more food.
But the people went to the mountain  they had food with them.

And we had them in  in  in the special barracks  where the children worried about their parents  where they saved food for their parents  where they matured so quickly.
Y-Yeah  well you know  it was really long time  the hunger was hunger was a one of the big  big problems.
They sold socks  mens socks and ties and I dont know what else  you know  and he was able to make money  little bit of money  you know  he wa he was in you know  so and then Giant Food  Mr. Cohen was very good to the Jewish immigrants here  and gave everybody a job.
But two weeks later  when I was asleep  a dog ate one of the shoes  because it was food for them.
And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around.
He was -- they were very rich  and we went through a -- a time where my father left everything  and the money was not availa ble  because either it was in a bank  or whatever it was.
They would send out a mess sergeant with someone to look for food.
I mean  it was very healthy food because everythi ng was boiled.
During the war you wrap all the food in old newspapers  and I would understand some German.
So are they giving you food every day  and water a little bit  or nothing?
So first  I would meet with the functionaries  that is  the man in charge of food  housing  immigration  various aspects -- health care.
One time  I mean...and the food - one evening I was so desperate  so I was trying.
And when we came in the kitchen  there were in every camp kitchen forty kettles of uh steam kettles  where it was cooked  the food for all these prisoners  and uh  they asked we should repair these kettles  and by the time we learned how to  in the beginning we didn't know nothing  but later we knew how to handle it  to repair and we always get some food for this repairing  from the SS men  from the accessory men  that they were  couldn't handle it and they needed it and so.
Food  we had food enough to live  let s put it this way.
I had the good fortune of not getting sick  so I was running around the Interview with Regina Gelb March 23  2001 18boat and of course there was food above and beyond the need of anybody  because nobody else was eating.
And in -- evening used to throw from the top  you know   from the -- used to throw food and pick up 99 the -- you know  bucket with the -- sometimes two days they [indecipherable] hadnt eaten the pears who was nearby.
>> Could you explain the kosher food for those that may not know?
>> Bill Benson: I want you to tell one other  if you will tell one other thing that you shared with me before  and that is the time you'd slipped out of the ghetto to get food and you came across a soldier.
I really wants to share that and admire these people that wanted to give you a little bread for you to eat and wanted to give a little type of other food also to take back to the ghetto for your family.
That means that we must have had - we didnt ha ve any fancy food.
We have some good food for you.ﬂ And a few came and a few of us just didnt and he came to me  he said  ﬁOkay  come on  get off.ﬂ I said  ﬁI cant move  I -- I cant sit even.ﬂ ﬁStand [indecipherable] up.ﬂ Said  ﬁOh my God  [indecipherable] that bad?ﬂ I said  ﬁOh  Im not so great.
fires and kitchens were cooking and everybody had food to eat.
Uh we were malnourished to some extent but my aunt managed to get us as much food as possible and we were under the doctor's care  the foot doctor care and this and that.
They said  ﬁOkay  you don't want to go to the transport  you won't get any food.
01:03:11 But I must say the Jews from the town  esp ecial there was a man named Burger ...he was the oldest from the town and he brought some food special for the children.
The food was unbelievable and a particularly good thing was a fish shodoe .
Who we are  they knew  but they didnt ask  didnt bring food  didnt bring a doctor  didnt bring a nurse  nothing  nothing  nothing  nothing.
We -- we had to stand in line ﬂ for sugar or for meat or for something here in the United States.
It was  I cannot tell  it was some days  it was maybe 14 days after this liberation because it was this very dangerous typhus and it was not good  the children stay there  and after they had passed  and after  although my father organized his life after liberation  he took care about food and about helping people and also medi cal care started.
Ghetto  a ghetto  what it really was is that they came and took an area within a city  and surrounded it with barbed wire  all built walls  and concentrated as many Jews as they can in a very confined area.
We ha ve nothing  we have no profession  we have no savings  we are nothings.
When did food improve  that you would be able to have enough to eat  that you didnt feel hungry.
I remember one time there was no food  and I went to the dump behind the kitchen there.
Well  we stood there and we scrounged around for food wherever we could  because the Germans had the idea that time that nobody is left  and if somebody is left they couldn't get at them  and that's why they decided to set afire...also because there were a lot of Jews that were underground.
This was when the [indecipherable] L: Oh  they gave you food there.
So whatever you had had and little  you know we knew that the war was gonna start  so each one  like over there  prepare the little food something for the future.
If -- as long as everybody will eat his portions  then these old people that were dying would get enough food  too.
And children volunteered -- i n my book I describe how children collected clothes and food and put on shows  and raised money for needier children.
Or in Bergen -Belsen  in the kitchen to get food  or wherever.

Then we would jump at night and go  because then we got liberated in the camp  and we had no food  nothing.
The villagers would bring things that -- that obviously are important to Athens  food primarily  and in turn they would excha nge it for goods of all kinds  and principally textiles.
That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food  for in the morning we only received some cold  viletasting ersatz tea  made from some kind of leaves.
And then  of course  the only person who had to continue working through this was my mother because she had to serve the food and wash the dishes.
What did -- It was the main topic of the day was food  and it was a bad thing  people used to say  oh  then my mother used to make goose livers  and [indecipherable].
And the inmates take food to the guards  saw them packing.

Uh  the...uh  Riga was at that time--because of the Army going back for supplies-with food up to the top.
I remember during my during my stay in the ghetto  in the concentration camp  most of thetime I spent thinking about this food more than anythingelse.
But in the days when I was cooking  and I would have a party  whatever  I would have no time to eat  and I was so hungry  hungry  but I had to cook  so I said  ﬁWell  let me first start cooking.ﬂ And by the time I was done cooking all these French dishes with the wine and all  I was so satiated 66 from the fragrance  this beautiful fragrance of the food  that by the time I was done with cooking  I really didnt need to eat.
We didn't have our period time because they put something in your food that we weren't women.
It was an instance I had a guy  his name...German Jew  and he was a policemen in that camp  Skorjisko   and I was working in that camp and I found out that when you go to 12 o'clock  he gives out food.
But he and I decided what -- how to find food  where to steal trees  you know.
Not only just with food  theres no place where to stay.
Uh  we came from a place in Isbitsa  a  a town in Poland  and  uh  we  we didn't know where we're going  we  and the place that they  they guarded all the Jews and that they send them  and they send them away  we were hiding there  but the Germans didn't leave so we eventually we had to come out  and then they took us all to a train  to the station  in uh  in uh  -----train  cattle trains  and they loaded them as full as possible  and we  the whole night we travelled without food and things.
Just the way you find them in a natural food store  they were s acks of raw beans and peas and -- and barley and rice and -- I dont remember specifically which ones  but ther -- there were all these staples  which really saved all of our lives  because I was fr -- I-I was quite stunned  actually  to read in one of the papers I had been looking at  that they figured that some -- something between 1700 and 2500 people died simply of starvation in the city.
And I have a ca things with with food  etcetera that I couldnt couldnt deliver him.

In the first year of war  we had to now livings and there was a tremendous shortage of food so everybody was smuggling food from the countryside  from peasants.
When we registered for the food rations  the Jewish community building had a list of everybody.
Maybe that lent itself also to them having s lightly better food conditions or something like that.
And others were stealing from each other  w-would eat up ea-each other's food.
And one man talked abo ut his father putting -- leaving food after dark on ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 their doorstep.
On the other ha nd  I thought maybe I will ge t more to eat  in an innocent sort of way maybe somebody will be kind and give me more food.
I then deci ded that in order to survive and get some decent food I would join the Polish forces.

Yes  whatever food was So Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14  2010 101 was available  stored  it was returned.
There were like bunk beds and so many people to a room  and they gave us food and tried to treat us.
128 Yeah  I mean -- I-I am sure that these card officers  foo-food coupon officers where I went under an assumed name then would forward my name and -- and this address that I gave to the food office in that district and then within da ys they would find out that person never existed there  and -- but by that time I was gone a nd when you -- the food ration coupons themselves didn't have a name of a person on it.

The next day  un expectedly the same girl did come back and ask me if I slept good and something and she did help me with food.
Middle of February to the 25th of April they had no food.
And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish  bartering food for clothing.

She was carrying a canvas bag with all kinds of food.
They gave us what they gave to th -- to their own  but it was -- we were always hungry.
We were both alternating at night to retrieve our food  by crawling forward towards the haystack and one night I  it was my turn to do so and I reached out for the bucket and reach ed too far and by holding the piece of bread  tumbling over and falling off that big haystack.
The pa nic was already getting -- but the army was sort of -- Polish army was set up at the ror -- at the borders and things like -- you know  the propaganda was so the -- that the Germans wouldnt last long  they - they didnt have -- they dont have food  they - they starving  they starving and they -- they -- they dont -- they cannot -- theyre not ready for war  th-the population that they talk and they -- among the people  they -- and -- So the assumption was that the Ge rmans would fall  they would not -- Theyre not going to fight  -- Theyre not going to fight.

So what we did  we gave the Germans the canned goods and they in turn gave us some fresh fruits and vegetables.
So  you can feel  I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it is a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care  or delivering food.
And thats the reason a lot of people they could surviv e  died from the food.
And if -- Of course  there are Ge rmans around [indecipherable] Germans around  yeah  but in these villages there were -- you know  thats -- from people who lived there  and nobody want to give us food.
Either he didn't get much food  or he must kneel or he has penalty work and so on.
It was not at a point where and I know that my mother always finagled something and food ended up on the table somehow  but the food I mean there was no meat  there was always this well I remember like fake  fake chopped liver made out of peas and things like that.
So he went in the back  and he brought me out some fruit  and it was wonderful  because I was very hungry.
I got stamps for food under her name  and I was under her name.
It was before we went to the ghetto  in the ghetto we had no -- I dont know there was space or food for animals  I didnt see any.
The food and the hell  --as all the concentration camps  but exactly as you know  maybe you remember about my life  later then I was arrested and my knowledge about the situation of Polish people  Polish Jews in Torran was broken.
As long as we had potatoes  we had bread  we had water  we can live  but if something just didn't work very we ll in her household  we could sit two and three days without food  without anything.
And I want you to know that we just left the house just the way it was  with the pictures on the walls and the food in the refrigerator and the clothes in the closet an d  and  and nothing was taken.
At any rate  as soon as I learned all this I had all my food I had in my litlle warehouse sent over.
A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of k illing and she's right  don't you think?
We had to go eat ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 outside.
I wouldnt tell the Russians  yeah  that they are hiding there  so I supply them with food.
At other centers  where the food was more abundant  i.e.  more fat and high protein  which wasnt too well digested by people who starved for too long  there were cases of serious diarrhea and death.
And they put us there  and they gave us a room there  and they brought us food  and we wash ourself.
anti-Semitic attitude at that time  so he was not mistreated as a Jew  he was di mistreated as as an as an not only as an American  but by the fact that there was not enough food for the German peop le  the captive Americans were given no food at all.
The two women who gave her work to do on the side  and after she came home from labor  and in exchange  they would give her food here and there.
Other than that the the there was sufficient food and eh sufficient clothing given.
A you see this five five years was very  very difficult  because was very short of food.
I pay my rent  I pay my food  I pay my clothes.
And of course they couldn't eat  they'd starved them anyway  but when we got there it was terribly hard for them to eat.
In the morning  like I said  we had a piece of bread and coffee.
My specialty  I have been working for the Food and Drug Administration for the last 30 years with a specialty in botulism  a very poisonous bacteria when found in food and that's my specialty.
In addition  there was a system of distribution of food that especially applied to farmers  the compulsory reporting of agricultural production  what each farmer produced  corn or potatoes or whatever.
And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less.
But they would also go out  leave the forest and go to some peasants that they knew or some farmer  because the woods were still in the area and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far enough into it  so you were able to leave and go and get some food.
And all she could do to get food on the table was do domestic work so she came to us.
Let me ask two questions; one is  do you attribute his response just to the fact that he was disappointed that there was no food  or do you th ink any of this was anti-Semitic  or anti-intellectual?
So it was fortunately [indecipherable] the military government  and met somebody who had coal  so we were able to get some coal  but it the food was really very  very short  and I got lunch every day at the military government.
Some people stuffed their pockets full of something and they ate it  but I don't rememb er ever having been given any food except that we were given water and in some cases pe ople weren't even given water.
And we sold and traded  not so much traded  with the Polish railroad people  traded with them for food.
Life was fairly miserable meaning extremely skimpy food ra tions  watery soup  barely enough to sustain a person.
And they had those big cat  cassels that they put the food whe re they made the food  I dont know exactly but there were altogether in the camp close to a thousand peo ple  maybe more.
You know  each day when he came  he -- he was buying food for this  and then wa -- whats stay  it was for -- for him.
But in the evening we co uld sit together after dinner  when after work we had dinner  the food was brought in very  very big . . .
2 Well  uh because I I I helped out to a certain extent to uh to uh to uh...for instance  when there was...when food was distributed  you know  there was a certain order had to had to be established.
So all during the war these farmers would bring her all kinds of food so she had plenty of food.
One of them turned to me and said  \ Levine  you and the Joint are doing a good job providing food  clothing and shelter  but we need something for the Geist.\
And there was a woman who recognized a mother who had been there a while  and she brought extra food  but that was already the next day.
My father was  My mother was a very  very good-natured woman  extremely good-natured woman  and she used to bring into her house food.
And so he got a -- a very significant job with the Russian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and its surrounding.
And The doors never opened unless they brou ght us food.
He picked one of the guys to go with him so they put you into a wagon like a hor se with two wheels and there was a part on it to go to their kitchen to bring food for them.
They were there  they didn't took over our group  but they were there so we were safe  because they were very nice to us and that's all  I mean and then I guess in '41  th ey brought us to Chaplina and in Chaplina they were also the Italian there  they were also occupied by the and I don't know if you say occupied  they were also Italian soldiers there  but there we got to eat  we got to  I guess from the communi ty  I don't know how we got to eat  but they got food  some 11 food  but that was already very  very little and we started to be very  very hungry and it was next to a church and I think the church wa s a Serbian church and I made it at house where we were sleeping was maybe all of them there Serbs because it was an empt y house  it was a bi g house  because we were all brought there and we all slept in that one house  all th e  all the people.
And one thing I definitely want to mention is the stealing in the camp  stealing of the food by the ones who distributed it and the stealing of the food by fellow prisoners.
Certainly no vegetables  no no food  no nothing  so that was bad  because we were very deprived of of vitamins and and that kind of nutrition.
You went shopping everyday for food and so he brou ght fresh food everyday.
The same thing and work  work  work  and no food and there was typhoid around and it was -- And what did they do for uniforms  did you have the same uniforms?
So  one day  when we went out to get our food and we see the hole there.
Then I also carried some food to a synagogue where some professi onals were locked up.
These people brought in food  as much as they could get from the farms around or wherever and then  of course sold it at tremendous prices in the camp.
My brother was with me the same thing  he he was the with the same thing what I did  to supply food for the family.
We  one morning they give us some food and we had to go a freight car; and we had to go in this freight car.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 24 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: reality.
German were always looking for food  for eggs  for chickens  whatever.
So he took so-some food fro m the store and he took some what his mom had and he came back and he fed me.
Is uh special make like uh color brown or in other ways they recognize you you not German  and because they was in in was Germany  and uh besides that  you have to have uh the P on the right side of your jacket  so you you you...when you go out...some...sometime we have to ask permission go out uh repair the shoe  uh to get shoemaker uh or or buy the shoe  so uh you have to walk on the right side of the street and you you can't go in a store where food is.
In order to get food you need the bowl  you need the card.
Do you reme mber being hungry while you were in hiding  or you had enough food?
There was a Russian lady brought me food  out of her good of her heart.
these are flames  these areŠ We kind of understood they were– At the beginning  we thought that the smell we were smelling was th e Germans cooking food for themselves.
And then he was given a choice wh ether he could fight with the pa rtisans  he could work for the partisans  or they would allow hi m to go into an area that was al ready liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over  they said.
I didn't need food because if some reason even in that time was so many food in empty houses...  it was an Aktion in between time which I survived by hiding in somebody's hiding place.
We -- We used to bring in Chinese food and have it on paper dishes.
And its -- m-m-mostly what -- the food what we have is -- was bread.
So  to work for somebody was a basic survival for food and lodging.
My...my legs and my arm in chains  and it took eight guards du mobile...guard du mobile is the French police and gendarmes...to guard me  after they chased me down  after I was already down to nothing from lack of food and lack of sleep and and and I had no more tears left to cry.
So she got the restaurant and she give me food and she says  I get you some money  and I and this time th e Russian was there al-already  you know  in Poland.
And then  I always remember that some food was kept in the reserve down there just  just for that eventuality so that when one had to go down there was something to  to keep everybody nourished.
And the first thing we made  we made a stop to the old farmer to thank him for all the months that he slid us with additional food  which chances are probably saved our lives.
When he found out that I was going to be ther e more than a week he in Holland you could still get things  in Germany you couldnt  so I got a couple of food packages with chocolate  which of course I shared with my fellow you know  travelers.
When I came home  my mother didn't want to eat it.
They lived -- they had very little to eat  because the guards took the food and people died of dysentery  died of -- I mean  there are 3000 people died just of malnutrition.
She would come once a week and bring milk and food and play with me.
But a lot of Jewish organizations  and a lot of Christian organizations were establishe d in Warsaw -- in -- in Bialystok  and they gave a temporary help  housing  food and so forth.
And they were so scared that they don't go get any food  that they board a horse and buggy and joined up into the transportation cooperation that they should say that they got some work and they been doing work.
>> Bill Benson: So you would swap a shirt for a little bit of food until you ran out.
You know  he was tall  with moustache so he didn't look like a Jew so he used to bring food there.
Did you have a favorite food when you were a kid?
They put it in the kitchen  the started to cook the food.
People were punished for smuggling in food  and people -- I -- I cant tell you now this  I should check really the dates  I dont remember exactly when it was  but there were -- for instance there was a Jewish fa -- a -- a Jewish man who had a Christian wife  she was Belgian.
Because we had food there  but a -- yo u know  that wasnt -- the best food wasnt -- Right. --
And I think we had all taken something to eat  some lunch and so on.
And wa -- one became food and begeda -- food and beverage director at the San Francisco Fairmont and from there moved to -- to Denver  to the -- and opened up the Denver Fairmont and ultimately ended up in Atlanta in -- and entertai ned the position of resident manager.
And then when she saw him  how skinny he is  she took pity on him and he appreciate her food so much  and she whispered to me  because he was so skinny that his Adam's apple would move up and down  his neck  and she whispered to me  \ Don't let him take a bath  he might get down with the drain water.\
They went out  and we went out  and we started to run to the houses to get some food.
And the German got plenty of food in the house  mind you.
We were not allowed to leave that house  toward evening one member of a room snuck out and brought back some food.
We had a room and we didn' t have much to eat  but we had food stamps  and we got food here and there.
Besides the cans that we had and vegetables th at we had  food that had  we threw that.
And not only food  also clothing  everything  shoes  everything you can think of  all consumer goods were rationed.
We worked  I w-  um  I worked  anyway  about sixteen hours a day trying to find food  and I probably made a mistake  I should have relied more on the federal government.
So I was able to provide a little more food for the family.
We found a place there  it was a German barracks not too far from the -- where we lived  and we got food there.
You had to stay in line for to get a loaf of bread.
They would give us bread  and sometimes they would even bring some like hot soup or so to feed us.
Many of the Jewish families gave money  but did not give homes  okay?
And at night  one night thereafter  an SS came to the barrack holding a violin up  and saying  announcing  \ Who can play the violin to co me to the front room  and if I like you the playing  I'm going to give food and water.\
And a little bit we had to sell to pay the rent and to buy some food.
First of all  there was so much food of everything  every kind that we could ever want.
But after we moved back to our apartment  we were very fortunate to have the assistance of some soldiers from New Zealand  New Zealand  who brought  you know  us lots of food from one of my father's clients from south Italy.
And so it was hard because there was no food available and things were difficult to get.
But the-they Interview with Norman Coulson October 4  2013 63were going to Dachau and theyd steal food  or what ever  they theyd just knock people down and take whatev er they had.
And then every body in the kitchen you try to steal as much as possible so you can have food later.
But after a few days  really  I wake up and I start to eat that terrible food.
And [016] from what I understand  Teddy might have taken that food from us  from the sick people.
And they were cooking  making food  something for the family.. When I saw this group  I couldn't I couldn't believe.
The place was not too crowded  there was no work for us  and the food was at near starvation level.
Listen  13 people that I needed a lot of food for them.
When we were in Jelene we had food like the military  normal food.
Would there be any way to he lp those people  could you -- Interview with Alan Kalish October 24  2003 82 N -- [indecipherable] was there -- what are you going to -- you cant give them food  you cant give them anything  except just see them go down the tubes.
You have to take your food for the day  you know  you di you make your sandwich and that.
22 In that kind of a situation where people are living under such tension  yeah  with so little food and under difficult apartment situations  was there a lot of fighting and arguments?
I am worried that my grandchildren will run out of food by the time theyre grown up.
The drudgery  you know  of trying to get food and of survival and -- Okay.
And I can just see my poor mother between my father  who was so scared he was starting to get heart trouble and a little ulcer and -- and trying to keep us kids calm and trying to run the house and trying to get the food on the table and we -- it must have been -- and she started to get very  very thin.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings w/AVRAHAM TORY page 30 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AT: To the Jewish committee.
I think at one point I sort of lost my appetite for food except when you know you have a grumbling stomach  but I didn't know really.
And whatever I ma de  whatever extra  I had to give to my parents  you know  for food and .
It was...uh...that winter it was September  it's gettin g cold and we had to find also not only food  but we had to find also mean s of...uh...of....uh.. .heating and that was very problematic.
Maybe we'll organize some food by  or maybe some...So we went  and we went a few kilometers   and we got a bottle of milk again and a loaf of bread  and some onions  and we started walking back  and we came back  and we climbed up the lo ft-I'm making it very short you see (laughs) --and  the bottle of milk  the guy  one of the guys left it on  on the floor downstairs  and I said  \ Where's the milk?\
Worried  they gave a little bit of food in the evening.
And one or two of those Germans who were in charge of her went to visit the parents and Im sure got some money from them and Doris Rauch 41 July 7  1995 Page 41 brought stuff back for her -- money and food and so on.
He was emotionally devastated and under the circumstances not being able to work  the rations of food which he which he was getting was not enough to survive  so it was just a matter of time and he got sick in Stuthoff  typhoid  and he died in Stuthoff.
Go to work and see how many hundreds have no no no food in the house.
They left so fast they even left the hot food on the table.
And this what I -- I was thinking when I give this piece of bread  and this come from my mother  too.
They give us some food and they put us on a train  but we were all very excited because uh we knew that if Oskar Schindler came and brought in a list that somehow there's an opportunity of survival  that we may be able to survive.
Unfortunately  in their goodness  the soldiers gave us food like chocolate  which we were not able to digest.
But you ask me where the food came from  I don't know.
We have no food  and we cannot earn any money to buy food.
And we were settling in for the night and we had found some food already  that we were able to steal from the Germans and I was walking around and I knew this -- I mean  it was -- you could se -- really see the guar USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 35 -- the guards were disappearing.
But they learned from this mistake  because whenever they have prisoners now  United State prisoners  they dont give them all that food  they just gave it to them gradually  and reconditioned them gradually.
The time of the occupation occurred  I've heard my older brother  because of th e economic situation  my older brother started to go and organize some food.
Do you think that over the course of  of your life that you  that you  that you -- that hadn't made -- you know  what you said about how you -- because you didn't have any food and that just having food  having food was enough and to be able to sustain yourself is enough– That was the dream in the camp.
Then a lot of times they were giving out food and supplies  so we had to stay there  keep order  you know?
This is this is in 1941 - 42  when there were tremendous food shortages in in Greece  and I remember  you know  my my parents had to go to the nearby villages surrounding Agrinion   such as Moustafree was one of the one of the villages  and Verkini was another one  where they would go to buy food supplies.
We didnt have a piece of bread  we didnt have anything to eat.
Did she have enough money to for living expenses  for food Yes.
But we had a some kind of soup  I think  to we were fed  a little.
Cough) And uh bartering and trading clothing and or pieced of jewelry for food.
They have to bring..the ships ar coming to Hamburg and we'll unload the food for you.
Yeah  but Ill tell you something  your mi nd wasnt really thinking of food at that time  you know  because now we really knew that we were in the pickle  and we didnt know where we were going.
And what will happen to us if we collapse  we will be shot or we will expire anyway from no food no strength nothing.
We had to go to the kitchens to pick up our -- I think  midday soup meal.
Now  you cannot keep th at warm  huh  but anyway he got his food  and then we exchanged news with him.
We got in there and f fortunately for us  it was not that the fact that the apartment was furnished  but they were -- there was some food left in the apartment that we could use  they ran away so fast.
Do you remember when -- Mrs. Preskovski -- when she worked there  in hospital  you know  my mother  the way I told you  my mother used to cook and come to be with them and give them some food and so on.ﬂ He said  ﬁYes  its true .ﬂ And I said  ﬁYou used to come to our house with the horses and buggy.ﬂ He said  ﬁYes.
I mean th is was how they made their living  and this is where they got their food and their substenance.
And then I remembered Mr. Klipp from the ghetto  he was my boss there  and when I was in -- and when my mother was in Krippo  he one time was helpful that we got a little bit more food.
The ones who had very little money or who got very little money from the outside were not totally shut out from buying some food  right  or whatever was ava ilable.
Because the other situ ations  they may have been uncomfortable and you didnt have enough food -- No  Gurs they die -- they -- they died too  in the winter  plenty of people died there.
You know  in -- in every o -- camp  you have to keep track of numbers  you have to keep -- for food rations  you have to do your own cooking in so-called field kitchens  whatever we got.
Then when the times were bad  when war start  and the food was we always had food because we lived in the country.
So we had these families  women and children and pregnant women and sick people  no sanitation facilities and no facilities for food or for any kind of liveability.
The food was horrible  just watery soup  and if you didn't have your 12 lorries  you wouldn't get any food at all.
In comparison  a lot of money in rubles to buy food  and even he was a four-star general  some surprisingly he didn't have any adjutant  anybody with him  and they didn't have enough food.
Youre bus y  yo-you yo-you you you go  you change diapers  you make food  you shop  you dress  you bring them to school  whatever it is you do.

She says  \ You should be glad that you are here  because the food is much better than where the other people went.
And th -- hi -- and it was  you know  the food  was no food at all because the food was only for the German.
Where did your mother get the food from to feed you all?
Yes  yeah I was -- I was very strong  and I was able to survive very well in the coal mine  even though the food was kind of poor.
Interview with Tracy Strong June 11  2009 18 Oh  I think there was food that was be ing brought in by a ship  and the Quakers were distributing it.
It may have been the beginning of typhoid fever or it may have simply been the food or it may have been an ulcer but I was vomiting.
cut them  and Was it was was there a shortage of food?
There was no cooperation -- Oh  b -- -- between the people  of any ki nd  to help each other  or -- Well  they di -- they -- there was not hing  because you didn t get -- you didnt get enough food.
My sister Edy  who loved food -- she remembered things about food  talked about going across the border and coming back with things tucked into her undies that they brought across the border.
The Jewish Interview with Henry Kolber 11 community of this Rabka was assigned to prov ide food and shelter for us.
I can't remember everything  you know  my father used to work for the Polish people and they used to come in and bring potatoes and some different things and somehow we ate.
We didnt fi ght for food because we got we got good finances  Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 29you know.
And even today  I have to be very careful in eating rich food or ...or certain drinks I have to avoid.
But we probably spent more money on the ope ra than we did on food  because food we ate  but I had a very close friend  and I think I told that story  in high school  whose father was a hairdresser  and they lived in Jackson Heights  and every Sunday  they had roast beef  and this really expensive dinner.
And the city start getting a little more crowded and food -- shortage of food.
There was never a question of whether there would be enough food.
We were already safer  because we lost  you know  we went one time from our group  we went for a underta -- food undertaking.
But water we bring with us because the salt was making thirsty  but no food.
My uncle  should he rest in peace  he smuggled in some books  they used them on the outside that's because the whole family was involved in buying food in the Ghettos  so he smuggled in some books.
And we would pounce on this food and th-the SS men -- the soldiers would shoot at us in groups.
People have to go to the bathroom  there is no food.
We were running to the truck to see if maybe there was some kind of a food leftover  which did not burn.
I don't remember...there was no food  nothing to drink  and I missed more not having anything to drink.
The Germans had  left their homes  left food almost on the table  and  and had left  and we sort of 18 Sachsenhausen was liberated April 27  1945.
There was only the food that we were able to take with us  what we had  and we didn't have very much.
I mean  everybody would be killed because there was  you know  the Germans might kill them.
Did it bother you that you had been depr ived of food for so long?
and told them we were Germans and -- an d they gave us food.
Did you ri -- you rented your apartment  so you had to pay rent -- Yeah  rent  no  rent -- -- plus food.
And uh my brother helped them uh with the with the food  because he also...my brother come  two of them  they come uh to my father and they transport the food to to town.
And you -- you -- did you manage to get enough to eat during that time that you were in the ghetto?
Everything was like you had to get  like for food  you know.
As a matter of fact there was talk about the rats being also 10 starving  not having enough food so they used to bite people.
It was surrounded by the British submarines  and we had difficulty finding food.
End of Tape #4 48 Tape #5 Edgar  before we get on to your roommates  and -- and your relationship with Schacter  I wanted to ask you about what kind of food was -- was served.
I was now from then on...I was a Christian kid from the city where in the meantime food became less  you know.
Well  I mean  I the doors open  get some fresh air  and the food.
Hunger and cold became  you know  so severe that while working at the airport  we didnt have any chance to get food with exception at midnight were getting a little bit warm soup  which if somebody would have this soup in America  you would think this is not even good for a hungry dog or cat.
We remember the first time that we got there  it was late at night and the food was piled up on the table.
Whatever prisoners come back  they kind of condition them slowly with food.
D-Does he want a nu -- how to get more food or something?ﬂ And -- 17 and I had this great feeling of guilt when he -- all he wanted from me was  ﬁCould you help me in some way to find my family  my children?ﬂ That was -- you know [indecipherable]  oh my God  I was resentful of this poor guy and I felt -- tremendously identified with him.
We had matter of fact  we ate to the tim e that we fell asleep.
She would come out to the farm where we lived and bring us food  and uh when the chips were down  that is to say in 1943 when uh  well I don't have to repeat the history which is already known  but eventually the Germans regarded the Italians as their enemies and they actually occupied Albania  and uh to the extent where they depor ted the Italians by trucks  vi a back into Italy.
So I collected it every day  and I used to bring it home to my parents  because food was something -- we never -- the hunger is someth ing that you have to experience to understand.
And we attended the services  a full day of services  without food.
And another th ing I remember is that outside was a school building  was an old Jew who was selling some food  po tatonik  and you could b uy it with butter or with margarine.
We had no idea what was waiting for us or what was waiting for them.
I mean  especially so longer it was  we were preparing for a process  we needed more exact information about th-the conditions  and about the brutalities they have committed  and their approach to the to the prisoners with their their food rationing  their their the the composition of the of the people in the in the in the in the camp  and the and so many details that were everything were we had everything was written down  and and ready  almost  for a for a process.
She risk her life  and she smuggl ed food in for people who were incarcenated or something.
But we had a some kind of soup  I think  to we were fed  a little.
I dont remember feeling hungry there in ghetto that I felt I -- I didnt have food  but I was so scared that probably  you know  suppressed the -- the -- the hunger.
And so  it happened that some people were working very hard  some people less  and what's important that the people who were working hard even could not  or have the possibilities to buy something  or change food for clothes  or clothes for food.
So everybody left those houses...that we went into those houses  and we took food.
They went to this factory restaurant they went  and they had a warehouse full of food and they start to grab it and eat it and there's so many got dysentery and all kinds of -- and I was just the opposite.
We were issued ration cards  and the food distribution centers were throughout the ghettos.
Some people did throw - they were standi ng on bridges and they threw some food so the people behaved quite well because what what happened really we went through Czechoslovakia going from the north to the south in Austria  and uh we stopped at Mauthausen.
I told you at Im sure he could in the beginning  that he was an extraordinary honest man  and he didnt see any reason to have better food and better treatment than his colleagues  because the colleagues -- or just because he was a doctor.
they talk so much about the food  and how there wasnt food  and if you got a potato  or an extra piece of bread  or something like that -- Yeah  yeah  that was the life. --

I didn't eat too much cause after that they got diarrhea  they got sick and so forth.
Now if I recall  there are too many things wh ich happened on the train is if very few I can I can recall because the situation was such that people who were uh for for many days without food.
Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food because there is going to be uprising Warsaw proper.
Most of it was wrong  by feeding them the food the way we did.
Our job was to hand the food out to the soldiers.
He helped us to make the bunker  to buy some food  I mean  potatoes and such things.
When you dream of food you don't dream of anything else.
But she arranged  for instance  a loan in the food store  in that [indecipherable]  that we got whatever we -- we needed  yeah.
So we stayed pretty mu ch indoors and everybody was sick  no energy  no water  no food and then I got dysentery problems again.
I didnt want him to s -- to see me taking food.
I gave them bread  anything we had because somehow they were begging for food because they escaped and most of them were caught anyhow.
>> Michel Margosis: We were fed through the window  people throwing food at us   throwing whatever.
I remember as a little boy I worked in a little store they were selling health food and I took the deliveries for him.
So the ghetto was still open and I was able to get out of the ghetto and bring him some food  and also actually was one oth -- one -- one time I actually went into his camp  I was allowed to go inside.
But the orthodox had a special problem  it had to be kosher.
This Katia that I mentioned  who was a medical student from Lamberg who posed as a Ukrainian  she left me to the job in the kitchen and she got a job as a housekeeper by a German physician  a doctor  which was much easier  better food.
Then we came the morning  they gave us hot coffee  bread  and some cheese .
Secondly  the food  the e-everything  the people were welcoming and I felt very comfortable.
They had already a place what they built by themselves  you know  a place for winter because winter time you can't go out  right away you can see that people are walking in the woods and from the woods  and they had to prepare food.
We run from this place and we -- we met -- Socha was coming to -- with the food and he saw us running and he took us to a different place.
And he met the mayor of the town in a short while and he instructed the mayor  without any doubt  that he has three Jewish survivors and they are not going to sleep on the street and to provide us with a comfortable home and food and all that.
But I worked  oh  yeah  I worked in a trucking company then as a helper  a little boy  and they carried the -- it was a food trucking company with all food.
There there's no criminal activities whatsoever  and my first reaction  my brother's and I when they asked for volunteers  we wanted very much to volunteer for that too  because it meant have a uniform  have a little bit larger rations of food  not to have to go to work in the city  be inside the ghetto and all that  but my father  God bless him  was very much against it.
Before you knew it there were dogs  there were -- all the Germans were out.
And by the way  we used a lot of food because we had a big family.
And then -- oh  they used to lowe r  you know  the container with food or bread  usually there was paper bag that I took home.
Now  when you were getting food coupons for example  from these other organizations  I'm curious about systems  how you knew about each other  how many organizations there were?
rifle watch this would be free in the village not too many men  mostly women  but you got some food .
And they [indecipherable] of my uncle was a man  he had a -- made the upper parts of the shoes to a Polish guy  and -- and before the war  so he remembered that he lived not far from the -- in that area  so he knocked at the door  his door at night and he told them they hiding and he asked for food.
Moira reading excerpts FOR HER MOM  TAMAR LAZERSON Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: was killed.
That was the biggest  you know  as if she won the lottery because - because if she is going to work in the kitchens  we would have what to eat because we just come from a place where we didnt eat for three days  and from Auschwitz where the food was so scarce that we were fainting most of the times.
It was a  I mean we didnt get enough food  enough water.
It s ounds like it was just all of sudden youre waiting in line for food and you just felt like  I gotta go.
I remember a grinding  ordinary grain in a coffee grinder  mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the..the gas burning stove and that would be our food.
I m ean  many of my friends  also my friend Hans and I and so on  we talked about going underground  but to go underground that means going into hiding with forged papers  seemed like such an enormous undertaking  I mean 58 first of all to get forged ID's and it would cost a lot of money and then food would have to be procured on the black market and  of c ourse  none of us had any money to speak of  so it was mainly a lot of talk.
Early 1940 th ere was a program in Antwerp whereby poor children would be sent to a camp ne ar the sea for two weeks to sort of rehabilitate their health and their malnutrition and feed them good food.
The soup -- this -- the -- mo-most of the food was of a soup.
And after that we got better food and we could share that together with the girls in the room.
There were some people who were chain smokers  they give away their food for the cigarettes.
He gavc me food through the gates and I was put to a very easy job.
It wa s served in beautiful porcelain with silverware  you would never th ink what you were eating  it was great food.
Interview with Lena Jurand August 15  1998 74 Where did they take money from?
We had an ingenious  as a matter of fact two places in the ghetto where we dug holes and camouflaged them and that was not through the gates so we would go out  sneak out and try and beg or barter for some food and th en wed go back the same way.
In the stores 11 line -- people were lined up to buy food.
At that time it was brand new and downstairs on the street level there was a small grocery shop where you got your essentials  milk  butter  essential food items and so on  a small store and  of course  my mother when we moved there they immediately recognized that she was German by her accent.
And he said he needed kosher food on the Nazi ship.
So they opened factories  and they had a lot of tradesmen  had shoe factories and tailor factories  we're going to produce material for the Germans  maybe send in more food or maybe they'll leave us alone.
The food we had wasn't appropriate for a person who was -- had been on a starvation diet.
I mean  what is he going to do  go and tell people hes getting food ti -- food stamps for two Jewish kids?
They were in the center part of Slovakia  and one day as I was searching for some food because we were really very short of food in the forest.
We're always in one place  but food was available  clothes was available.
From that point on I did some smuggling to go into the provinces -- well  going out of town  they call it the suburbs  by bus and train and trade for some meats and cold cuts  bring it back into town and trade it for food -- How did you know -- -- or other staples.
And we would all pounce on this potato or this whatever this piece of food was that came at us.
But she started to say  oh  weve had the Jews  you know  here.
So long we had a piece of bread on the -- most of the -- feed the children.
And so you So I had with me food and drinks  you know  for my father.
But on the Death March  he didn't have food so they're the ones that died first.
Yeah  well thats also ﬁLifeﬂ magazine of May 6 th  1946 and in this picture  still under the -- the -- the school that Paul Geheeb  the German edu cator left  escaping from the Nazis  he -- I am in -- in the dining room  running th e kitchen and passing food to the kids who are th -- in -- who are sitting there.
But wh -- if someone walked over  they would sh are the food with everybody.
I can give her food  I can see her  I cant leave my moth er here and I just escaped and went back.
We didnt care  we wanted that piece of bread  we wanted that food.
But just what was ever yday life getting food  you know the poverty.
It had nothing to do with lack of food  I was just a poor eater and a very thin child  but she was rather dismayed at how thin I was.
My fantasy was just to bring in food in the house and we should have what to eat  and– and we should all be together.
So  there was a bi g differentiation between people who had the means and could buy food which was smuggled into the ghetto.
Now I have to find somebody where I c ould exchange that golden cross for food.
No  we didnt go to school  but I was elect ed  I had to go with my father up to the mountains or something that we could wa lk up and trade -- I dont know what he traded to get some eggs and get food supp lies for us.
I was there from November ‚45  to April  1946  eating mostly dairy food.
But as far as providing food  and I remember my sister was having a baby in ghetto.
Then they dropped medical supplies and by this time  wh en we were supposed to get the food  we were running out of gas again  so they came back and they kept dropping diesel fuel or gasoline  whatever they burned.
Opened up the lid  we would go out  stretch  walk and we were given food at that time and I guess maybe we washed ourselves.
Uh secondly  with regard to food  uh two thousand calories a day which was an improve ment over what the Jews in the camps had gotten earlier under the American Army treatme nt  that two thousand calories a day was not sufficient to build up people who had been suffering from malnutrition for ye ars.
And he knew that we were starving and so that was it.
But we kept them  we kept them in food  and we kept them safe.
And the same thing with food  when I give  till now I cannot face food  because I remember the times we starved  and moi -- my poor daughter said -- she was quite chubby one ch-child  because she said  ﬁYou always reminded me how we -- you starved  and the children in ghetto star ved  and you always make me eat ﬂ which is true.
So he put them in our basement and they fed them with our food stamps.
So they ha my parents had to start rationing the food.
They came with -- w ith some provision  food and stuff like that  and they took us in -- they took us to Sweden.
Thanks to their willingness and their courage -- don't forget  food was rationed.
All we were concerned was getting enough food to eat and getting well again.
We found there a Jewish family who let us come in and have a little bit water  a tea  I dont rememb er even if it was food.
Until in 1942  May eight  my husbands birthday  he closed up -- yeah  meantime I must -- I marked that -- not once my husband came   he was already there  he met already with his brothers  they had already conversations there  in -- at fathers home and there was already relatives from Novagudek that escaped from the city because of the mess  but -- when they came to them -- but them -- and they had the meal a nd they had the chickens and they had the milk  and they had the -- all  you know  a supply -- mostly supply of food.
Very upset  and winter is coming and sources of food are scarce.
And  you know  it was sort of shady  Im sure  as to where they got their food.
indecipherable] I -- I did feel -- I became quite weak because of the lack of food.
So they uh...we stayed in two hunting camps  small little enclosures  and all day long without food after crossing the Alps and at at night the trucks came again from British army trucks 21 with officers in this already uniforms and they have ID papers for all of us with new names.
You clean the camp  and you used to give out food.
We ourselves did not have yet what to eat  but we knew we will not be short on food.
They wouldn't give me  give me the food  so each time somebody died  I ate his food until the fourth and the third one died  I kept a few more days  and uh  I ate his food  then he then he start smelling and I told them  I told them he's dead  and these  the thing is the way we find ways to preserve ourselves  ways to  to  to survive.
During the war you had to either -- if you had some money  you could try to get some food on the black market.
The main thing so we were not hungry  we had bread .
You are accused by the janitor that you bring too much food for two people there.
We -- at least we got something  a piece of bread in the morning and in the evening and lunchtime we had the soup.
You had every you had there you had there everything  most ly   except for the food was problematic  but they find  in certain ways  you know  people that went out  they came.
>> Bill Benson: During -- so your father's business is obviously really suffered.
5 Were you able to help your family by vi rtue of your position other than the food?
But we -- we were hungry but we were not starved.
So we slept  they ga ve us food in that little shack.
They didnt need a knife to cut their food  there were stews and things of that nature.
So tulip bulbs would be ground up  and tha t's what we would have as food.
They had no food  very poor clothing for the weather and so on.
So I finally got a job with the Food and Drug Administration.
So  I still was working  not too much food to begin with  and my sister was working  but she was still living with her husband  more near which was more of a Jewish section.
Alright  this is basically the 60 atmosphere  now also I should say about Siemens  coming back to that  I said already that we got no worker food ration stamps and even less than the general consumer  we got paid less than the German workers who did si milar work and I said we couldn't go to the toilets  also we couldn't use their cafeteria  we had to bring our own lunch and sort of eat it at our work desk and of course  we had no right to vacation time .
But this time I had an attache case  because I was going to my way to pick up some food and my watch.
Well  again  I was very saddened that I would be alone  but I got even with them in my own way  before I left I appropriated a warm long coat  a pair of boots  they were different sizes  I remember that  but they were warm boots  and some mittens and a shawl  a lot of warm clothing  and they had lots of it  and also I took some food  and I just left.
And I got hold of some real type food  and after a little while I got better  and I got back to where I was.
First  we had no right to go to a store and buy food or anything else un til 4 o'clock in afternoon.
But you know  after a few days they become hungry too  and they they actually ate the food.
This was a hospital by name only - there was no proper food there  no beds  nothing.
And in order that they should sustain living  you know  the food etcetera  food etcetera  they should s have some funds and they didnt have it  so they sold jewelry.
And evidently we were told too by the old timers that the people that they were going to gas  they were fed salty food  very salty soups so that they were so thirsty that they would just going half crazy and they would just as soon go into the gas chamber than to suffer .
As I said  the Russian soldiers  the occupiers brought us food and medicine and that's how we were being helped to   you know  to get stronger again.
In fact  some of those people came to town on weekends and came to visit us in the apartment and brought food from the country for us.
She managed to get a bottle somewhere and she put tea in the bottle; and in that um what we got the food  it was a round dish.
Because we were starving so we were talking about just a ?
And my mother  did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she washed him  she bathed him.
Besides being a messenger for him and ma king reports  what else were you do -- I [indecipherable] the same  I had always to receive the Russian commands to prepare  you know  special food for them.
And I forgot to tell you that in my room in Salzburg   I have three rooms  and I was with my brother and another guy that wo rked in the kitchen  from the UNRRA kitchen that we had the food in the camp.
And then we received food  they provide food for us too.
Just sitting or walking with my friends and ta lking about food.
Because number one  we saw him  number two he brought food  which helped us to have a little feas t then  and number three is that he  we knew that thats what he would have done  he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four  family of five who were out of their own  well  problem s  housed in our place.
And we carried a big bag --each tried to hold one handle --in which were food  mostly  and in the other side we each had a bed roll.
When I came every Saturday or Sunday I can't remember when I went for the food I connect myself with the people  the people whom I knew and I was talking to them  \ People  Let's run away.
And they been an hour or so outside in the fresh air; and the food  when they delivered  the men--because they saw the girl s out  so everybody picked one--and they... In the kettle  when they lift it up between the food  they put a little either packets of some special food  or just a letter or a little present.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 76 Yeah  I cant see people throw away food.
I met this guy Schlemmer  he gave me his food  and he talk ed to me every evening  I used to ask him what he's doing  I ask him about the ovens  he sai d  \ Yeah  it's true.\
And once I took the food  they gave us food  maybe two hours later I got sick.
When you were in the army   I think you had mentioned some -- you dont like to see food wasted -- Oh yeah. --
And what sort of work were you doing in this ghetto?
We had nothing to eat  we didn't have money  couldn't buy nothing at the beginning.
So we walked into town and indeed  we knocked at the doors and we told  cigarettes  cigarettes  trading something  and they gave us some food.
So it was a matter of getting enough to eat when the war started   because we didnt get ration cards.
So after that when we stayed there and I mean the Russians themselves--they didn't have any food and they didn't have any food for us.
You cant give a starving patient food  but what -- what we had and what we -- they were sending up to us  they got.
My mother was put in the food shop  where she was selling mustard and relish  thats all they had.
And my mother said that -- of course she felt very bad  and sick about -- hearing about the Jews  but she was determined  and she said  I have to go  I have to get food.
The only thi ng that we could not get was of course  what did we get  flour and beans.
And we were -- we would buy the -- our meat there  and all this.
Then at night  I could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over  they gave us if I worked the night shift.
And he was in that business  feeding  oat feeding  because everything was horses  not cars.
And Krisha was in the kitchen  we always had food to eat  you know?
But after a while  it became extremely  extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value.
And then as I prepared to enter the University of Munich as a pauper student after graduation  the food was scandalous  the little rations by that time.
She was feeding two babies  because they had had no real food for so long.
And food was for people  for example  we can buy  but bread was like gr eener  like something old  some ny not not good  of course.
And also its you know people heavily complain here about the food  including me.
Because she used to bring food to Resistance who had been caught and put into the hospital.
Well  they gave me food and shelter  and I also something I could help my parents there  and then my brother got also a job.
I know you tal -- you talked it -- about the -- that was very interesting about the -- the food that the Americans prepared was too rich.
What we did know was  number one  take care of any survivors medically and also see to their welfare; that is  proper food and a place to stay  clothing  and then have them interrogated by the representatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of our military police detachments -- CID it was called -- and then also have some JAG people there to see from that point of view what was going on.
When they rounded us up  they told us that we're going back to our homes  pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're going to be relocated and your parents will join you.
But as I say  by the time they came  they had something to eat or the Germans let them eat some.
Everyday the Chaplain came down with the...with the...with the little hookup  the kitchen and brought us food into the little yard we lived in the... And we used to eat good.
NESSE GODIN: Uh  well  uh  some soldiers gave us a bite of bread and they said to us we are afraid to give you food  if we give you too much  you may get very sick.
The only thing they did was also that they -- they looked for th -- wood for to make it -- to barbecue the food  you know  roast it a little bit.
And of course  food was very difficult to obtain at that time  and the people from the land would come with baskets to Cologne to bring us food.
They couldn't ge t food and you could see on the street laying -- almost on every street you could see some pe ople laying dead from hunge r and they looked like skeletons.
I'm the only one who can go out and bring some in food to the house.
And the same thing I thought maybe when we left for the ghetto.
Well  they were -- came from a v ery religious background  but when we lived in Italy  my dad tried to maintain all the Jewish traditions  you know  Passover  and mainly I remember Passover  where he made his own matzo because we couldn't get that  but there was no such thing as having kosher food or  you know  anything like that  but we Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg 27 maintained  you know  at home.
I told my husband and my daughter I-I have to get out of here  because I-I have a headache and of course they knew right away that it's not a headache why I am getting out of there and my husband -- I made him just pay and leave the -- the food there and we went home.
I skipped -- actually  I was a 27 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD little ahead of myself when I was finished.
And he did it off -- sometimes they took off -- took his food  too  you know  all around.
51 And -- and so  right  a lot of money was used not for Socha to get rich necessarily  but to -- to buy the food and the items that you needed  right?
Not just peace  but bombed out buildings and -- and bombed out apartments and -- and very little -- very little food.
I mean I was so hungry and all that food in front of me as much as I wanted and the only thing I ate was bread and water.
So  the one turned to me in German and he said can you speak German.
Coffee  stuff Americans give us  I sold it to the Germans and started making money.
There were women and men and they were serving on tables  I remember  with napkins and  you know  it was first normal setting of some kind of a food.
Yes  and then from one day the German came into the kitchen because I helped the Germans that was just poor Germans they didn't have enough food that time either and they weren't bad.
As several Jews  from time to time -- arranged by the admin-- Jewish Judenrat33 -- they're coming to the Wache to  to beg and to buy themselves food.
People did not want to leave the sanitorium  because yes  while ma -- word of mouth  they wanted to get out  its awful  no food  but  it was actually a very good place.
Uh...He taught...he picked certain children who were blue-eyed  blond and decided we didn't look Jewish  like people thought Jews should look  and...and he told us if we are to survive we are to smuggle food into the Ghetto.
Shes gonna make good good food for us  we gonna make a little [indecipherable] there.
They provided food and a measure of clothing and medical care.
It was...it depended...I shouldn't say that...it depended really on what your situation was because the rationing...uh...the food that you were allowed  legally  was really not much.
It was a Soviet institution that would exchange valuables that foreigners may have had  for things th at you couldnt otherwise get  such as food  such as clothing.
I  coming back to my story  it was just  I was never a boy scout  I never lived in the country  I never did any hiking  I never did any camping  I couldn't live in the woods alone  where would I get food?
He says to me \ You're lucky that I like you  because you're a very good worker.ﬂ He says  \ Next time  make sure that nobody brings in any food in the camp  if not you're going to be done.ﬂ Two days later  they started they took the women away from the camp.
And I run to the farmer  knocked on their door asking for food  for bread.
No sign of kitchen  no sign of food  no sign of -- o-o-of their soup what they bring.
I find some extra food  I sh are it with you and it has to be complete honesty and none  none of this taking away from the cabin.
The little food that we got  we got very little  I used to give to him.
And so  we think the same way  you know you I have a stack of food  lets say  you know  so I never even though we were both unemployed for a long time  I never wo rried about food  because I have that stock.
I remember there was in Bergen Belsen a girl who was with us remains in Jerusalem  who would collect in an old broken can some rain water in order that she could wash her hand to that little rationed tiny bit of bread and bless over it so she can thank god for sustaining her life and giving food.
Then  when I I was in the school over there  I I it was no kosher food.
It was where people were -- there were hardly any bathroom facilities  hardly any food  hardly any water  hardly an y life.
And one time I was packed with things to take out to change for...for food  and I heard the is over there  so I went back quick to throw down...in the ghetto  to throw down the things because I knew he is...the...is very strict over there....to throw down.
Because the food came from generally you went  stood in line for  for your soup and your Did you have your own dish?
I knew if survive it was good to have sugar  and there was plenty food laying which people brought.
And now you are coming and you are sitting down  and you have that little food.
But there were brave souls who still marched  ﬁNo Food  no soup  no work.ﬂ ﬁNo food  no workﬂ in Yiddish and Polish  and she was taken away a second time.
Whatever the chickens ate  I had more food than I wanted.
Now  these houses had stoves so that people could cook  take their food and cook as they pleased.
And apparently there was an incredible amount of... of red tape and bureaucracy and waiting lines  and there was no food; and it was just a mess.
And then I was hearing that someone just food food [indecipherable] horses.
And I run into a basement there where they used to keep the food for us.
Plus to eat  we were given a little something to eat.
I hated to eat and I would push the food Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg July 29  2000 9from one cheek to the other.
Mm-hm  of again  of food  which of course  is another way of being nurtured.
Food was delivered to us on their side of the fence and we would lift it over the fence.
So -- so I eat that time  from the first day I eat.
Besides not giving them food  did you have the urge to help any of them medically?
So he came visit me and br ought me more food.
They didn't get hardly any food  and you know any -- may  maybe I need some medication or whatever.
And people from the other parts  Latvia and never had enough food -- got involved in this  start taking out people already from the ghetto right away from work.
4 R: And how to go through day after day with food  and with -- we were busy with all kinds of thoughts.
When  when uh one of the brothers wanted also because one of the brothers got uh died  and he was so despondent he wanted to run to the electric wires  my  my uh husband saved him  wouldn't let him go  and then when my husband was on the train  uh  it was those open trains where they took them on uh  after  on uh death marches  but this was but this was like a deat h march because you  it was in the winter  and  and you were travelling without food without water  and uh  it was snowing and freezing and my husband was for a while his  his mind and he was tr ying to jump off the train  so his friend and his brother  the one that eventually died  was  sit on him  they sit on him that he shouldn't jump.
They -- it -- it told you to give me food to f eed me with  always a problem.
By then it was  you know  November  December of 41  and there was very little food  and my mother was our mother was trying to find  you know  food  and there were various incidences that were just very horrifying.
What were the ways that your parents went about getting some food for the family?
My mother was in the hospital for a few days  because her -- er -- the -- we were given -- the Red Cross -- the Swedish Red Cross had sent in food packages and we were given like first -- two people to a package and by the time it got to us  it was five people to a package  which was really a lifesaver  because there were sardines and chocolate and thing and butter.
So when it was dark he didn't bring the food like every evening.
So anyway  we came into a town which was a farming town I believe   because it was a big plac e and was cows and things like that and they put us into that bar again and uh..no food  no nothing.
We received some care packages actually from the United States and my rela tives here sent some food.
And it had a a like a the motels  hotels  and each each hotel had a a low the lobbies hotel were Interview with Anthony Acevedo October 13  2010 81 refrigerators full of food.
Now after about 3 weeks  I was able to start eating regular food.
Very cheap food was over there - ten dollars was a kilo of bread.
But if -- there were times  of course  that we managed to get home with some 21 food and we had so much food  and -- but we were still -- it doesnt matter how much we had  we were hungry.
It was allowed to send at that time one kilos something food.
I don't know where we stopped  we -- no food  no water  no -- horror  50 or 100 people in there.
So our job was to -- to get coupons so that we could buy food.
This guy  for about six or seven months  brought food every night to their hiding place.
My mother told me to go to the store to buy some bread.
So  she bought whatever she could  so we ended up having uh  chocolates  and halva  and caviar  and  and  and pickled uh herring  but no  fun food  but not real food.
Forget about relatives  forget about your parents  forget about your brothers and sisters  forget about your property  education  nothing existed from this world except food.
And he apologized for that he cannot supply us with more food than what we get  because it is just so much he can get.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 20 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: everybody a little piece.
Presently all the young researchers are trying to get me to review their publications  but I left everything at th e Food and Drug Administration  all my files  and I try to turn them down  or a few I know [indecipherable] I can do it.
And we were hungry  we didnt have what to eat  its so crowded.

Clothes were very difficult  everything was coupons  for food  coupon for this  coupon for that  and with the armistice  the king  Badoglio  and the 56 government fled to the south  leaving the people  the navy  the army  the air force in shamble.
And he lobbied in favor of giving Jews the same amount of food as everybody else.
It was  for us  very nice because my father was able to bring a little bit of food from outside  which was very  very nice  which we didn't have before.
I think it was called Itania  which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all those -- those things.
And I needed to get in there because my mother was going down with the food they were having.
Well  we lived in an area that later became part of the ghetto.
She also had a problem with saliva  she couldnt produce enough saliva to chew her food.
But it was still  we're hungry  I mean that's  we di dn't get enough  but the Italian  the soldiers  all the time  when they have seen children  they gave them even  some times some of their food  part of it  really  but not to us  because I'm talking about children now  because some people had little children  very few  but some people had little children with them.
Again  like i say  that was the last things everybody worried  we had less clothe s or we'll have less food  as long as they leave us alone  because for some reason other -- we didn't experience anything like this.
But them put me on a  on a  on a bed  they gave me blankets  cover me with blankets and they gave me some food.
The Germans cant put themselves in the soul  or in the situation  lets say  of a Jewish mother who has two children  who is forced by German soldiers or German [indecipherable] police  into a cattle car  is driven through days and nights without any food or water  embracing the little childrens  and then thrown out of the cattle car  to the ramp of Auschwitz   for instance  and then they took away the two children.
Throughout these difficult times Elfriede Dressler  Fritz's aunt  provided the Glucksteins with much needed extra food as rations continued to decrease.
And he always also knew a little bit of news  because in the Verpflegungsamt  out by the Germans where he worked this was the Wehrmacht 12  the army  the German army that he worked for in this huge  huge depository of food.
I mean it's an innocent thing to help to buy some food for somebody.
does that -- do you still have sort of a special -- Yeah  I -- I -- -- feeling about food?
But I did not find out until the war was over that when she broke off a piece of bread and gave it to me  that she not only gave me my portion of the bread  but she gave me some of hers  to help me survive.
And -- Well  but now  isn't it possible that if you wo rked outside the ghetto you had more of an opportunity to do business or to get extra food or that kind of thing?
They had enough food but even home I wanted a little more butter.
And even though there was so little  hardly enough to get through the day  food  I still had somebody.
And afte r the war I f ound out that Father Bruno who supplied the food stam ps for us had to get them illegally.
So I was very familiar with German -- and I had never lived in Germany  but still coming to Germany -- except in the concentration camp  I was familiar with their way of talking  with their way of thinking.
We had hoarded bread for our trip because we had to take along food for five days.
When he got to the town  he got for himsel f  uh food you know.
The food had been stolen  or someone had been killed  but it was really frightening.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 34 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ny all along  because Poland and Lithuania and all those other countries did not exist for 200 years  they were al occupied by the Russians.
I dont -- I really dont know  because I had the same -- the same food  and -- and everything the same  so its -- I dont know.
>> Albert Garih: Well  once again the big problem was the food.
They  you know  make a you know  all kinds of food and music.
This was very 7 dangerous for Poles because anytime you helped a Jew by giving him bread or milk or whatever  food or sheltering  you endangered your entire family and your village.
They had what 90 seemed to me limitless supplies of food there  I don't know what their sources were  but part of the source  in fact  was the sister of Harry Gladenik  that Nazi.
The problem with food was not only in the ghetto  but was all around there  everybody has a problem.
The first time was  of course  the raid on the hut  second one was later on when my -- when we all lived in that little cottage  and I -- we went every day to get some food in the village.
A few hours later he says he going to bring some food  give it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food because we were starving.
You were being...being made to an animal by slurping the food.
So  after a week or so of being in the forest  when we heard our woman  Jewish woman  when they went to villages to buy food  they were intercepted from the Polish hoodlums  collaborators  some were killed.
And if you were the one to distribute the food then you always had a little bit more  and you always were trying to get from the bottom of the barrel  the  the potatoes that that were small  you know th at wasn't so  wasn't um  just watery  that had more potatoes.
That doesn't sound like much  but when you realize that he had to go on his bicycle across Belgium  you know  24 times to find families to bring papers  to bring food  to bring the child.
We ate vegetables and also we managed to uh have they uh Lithuanians cook some cooked food for us for exchanging things.
How my mother divided the food among uh some friends or some neighbors and I mean my ant and my cousins were sure they uh but there were a few neighbors and my dad at that time worked at that time worked on the um Video Tape No.
If it would be a food store or anything else and to cut down the prices and even already some places 1 A Zionist program which sought to evacuate Jewish children and young people from Europe and provide them care and education in Palestine.
When I came to Czechoslovakia  there were standing  there  over there  so many people there  there was no room  no food or nothing.
The apple  the pear and normal country food was not this time.
And  and the food th at we were given  excuse me  was again  you know  like army portions and that kind of stuff  but of course much more than what we have gotten when we were in the concentration camp.
If I got -- If I brought food from Slovakia  which was easy  they had everything  I got a radi -- a few radios for it.
That went on for 24 hours  and we searched for food  and there was really nothing left.
We lived by the peasants  we went to work with them  we helped them and this is how we had already what to eat and we were there.
You free  enough food  you free  you can go anyplace you want.
Yeah  and they would they would give us bread for exchange things.
So  we did take some food  and the lady next to us gave us some candy.
Yeah  he -- he -- he built -- you know  he could do anything  and he built cabinets for the cooks and chairs for the cooks  and benches and all this for their quarters  and he was rewarded with food.
You don't know for what  and what because you work  no food.
In the tent -- in the tent -- and no  there was food here and there.
There were several thousand of us and hardly any food left.
my father used to buy and sell to the farmers there  concentrated food  whatever they gave us.
And though my parents occasionally sent me some food  it was run over with worms by the time I got it.
From 5:00 o'clock in the morning until 10:00 o'clock at night without food  without water  without nothing.
In the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and get the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people  they brought the food.
I for instance  I had money and I organize myself with food and I was all right.
When we come to a farm  \ We can give you food for 10  eight people.ﬂ But to feed a group for 30  40 was already a big deal.
A nd I um  I didn't know what it is  I came  I came crawling to my father  he couldn't move  he wa s laying like you see on the  in the movies  the dead  dead people laying there  a bunch of skeletons  and I  I told him I 'm going to get some food.
We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they -- they knew who you were  so you get beaten up  especially the older people  not -- you know  and the children started stealing food wherev er they could  you know  to bring home.
They USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 7 7would get their food and most of the time if they didnt finish it  it just sat there.
And after a few hours  we were even brought some food.
He eats a few grapes  and all this kosher food that we brought in  from Columbus   Ohio   nothing.
So I could get a portion of a little water soup  supposingly   but it was more water than anything in it.
My mother had a dream that we didn't have enough food and that we were not well and she woke up my father one ni ght and she says we have got to go get the children.
The food is so...I should take care of Eva...all my love.
And we certainly had problems  uh couldn't raise the money in Europe at the time  (c oughing) and the the food blockade.
27 No  I dont remember of us an incide nt stealing food  but that was  you know  punishable by death.
Then we had 15 minut es to trade  to get some food.
They bought us from uh the vendors at the station in Genoa little baskets of uh food and drink and we traveled there.
We ate as long as it was food  edible and good.
I went back and I told Gusti this will be the only way to get some food.
I said  \ We have no idea who's coming  you know  but we would like some food \  and they let us go by ourselves in the basement that was loaded from floor to top with food.
And then I was so sorry  why didn't I -- hadder  buy myself food and -- and not starve so many years already in Budapest.
One time  I went into a farm to a–the German farmer s used to store and supply their food outside in the storage sheds.
And I was just telling my husband that the woods were so thick  that now I I Im amazed why there were no animals  but thats where we stayed  what there was no food  we werent given food.
What was the food situation up until the time of deportation?
I mean  people from villages  people from houses  pe ople from  from all over  from the city  and mama said to me  you know  we have no food.
I saw immediately that uh uh I have to to do somethi ng to uh to establish a source of food and uh I went to that Dr. Teibers if he could direct to me his uh overflow.
The other person said they traded goods  whatever our parents had  they traded it for food.
You know  before  they were poor  the farms  had not much money to buy those things  and now they have food when people need it  they can get more money  so now they have money to buy things -- Right. --
You know  and they started transporting food and stuff  I mean but anyway  a little later that comes in.
We kids used to go and steal food from them sometimes.
You still could get a lot of stuff on the black market  like food and things like that.
And they took us to the railroad station where we were taken in boxcars  how interesting  locked up  quite a few people in boxcars  and the train started and I think within an hour or so  they opened up and we were in the American sector of Vienna.
A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right  don't you think?
I gave him all my food what they gave in camp I didn't eat.
We knew  we expected the ghetto  you're going to be rationed food.
His business was to lock the doors and for 22 hours every day we were locked in and we had only two hours to get out to buy food.
But they had a pail over there for doing the business and they shared food with us.
It is a  on a lake  just the other side from Germany  and there were so me very picturesque villages nearby  and I remember even though here the food was very m eager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains  and I rememb er that just above our camp  our refugee camp  there was a place  a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just di dn't give us enough energy  but we were still & RG-50.549.05*0001 61 pushing for it  we wanted to see it.
I was in the kitchen employed to give out cards so people shouldnt double up on their food  see because they came twice  if its leftover  they were welcome  but not take away from somebody else the first one.
When I went out from the family I supplied them with food as much as I could.
One day this Katia Ukrainian comes to me and she says look...at that time she had a job as the chief manager of the kitchen  which was wonderful because she got food.
And they had -- they came back to their own house  there was plenty of food and great comfort and they were extremely friendly to us.
She had milk  so the baby had was to eat  and we was looking then that.
So then it became  Laeuferin  we had enough food to dinner.
I mean  great meal  it was pasta and cheese  but to us it was  you know .
The only thing that we could not get was of course  what did we get  flour and beans.
But fo od  yes  there were -- you know  the little boys were smuggling bread and all kinds of food.
After all thes e narrow escapes  the friendly farmer  the farmer that Abraham fed and provide d clothing and provided food for his family and his animals  thus was the end of Abraham  shot by his own quote unquote fr iendly farmer.
Uh  the 300 women were in another barrack and the next morning we were brought to the original Auschwitz camp which we hadn't seen  and we got some food for the day and we were in another cattle train.
Father would bring   at night he would bring some food and take waste down  away.
We walked without food  like every second or third day they gave us a piece of bread and some water.
How were you able -- do you know how your mother was able to get food?
And you know  we we fall asleep  and after next day we have food  and that lady came  how we feel?
And there there was  lets see  very large Jewish diaspora in Warsaw .
Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful  and also to provide food and and support directly uh and I was also the benefi ciary of many of their good deeds and I'll never forget about it.
My mother continued to work with the Quakers and in 1941 in the summer through these connections I was sent to a summer camp at Lake Annecy which was very pleasant for me  the food was good and so on.
At some point in the cellar you decided to come out.
So the only way to have food was to buy them from farmers.
There was some food left in the apartment  which we eventually figured out we eat.
And the friends that you had  were they Jewish and non-Jewish?
I dont think it was ever used  and aside from the police force there was a Sonder force  that meant special police with special orders  with more difficult tasks which larger  with larger food allotmen ts  and some of these men were decent  and some were brutal.
My grandfather was always able to smuggle goods  food stuff  to us.
Of course  I got very sick  because we were eating like crazy.
And he was friendly to us  he brought us the food  he gave us and we ate and at night we came back to this teepeetel.
>> Suzy Snyder: If you had brought the food in  would you have had enough?
They were probably maybe they said they didn't like the food or they objected to something  and they were then taken to a concentration camp.
He lived a couple of houses away from us in Berlin and had been bringing us a little food and was friendly with my mother -- well  my grandmother.
So they were better off than we because they could smuggle in mo re  or -- or they had the better place to make 54 exchange  or speculators who would smuggle in food.
When we went to work  we got our portion of bread in the morning  some people ate it right away  they were so hungry.
A. I don't recall although I remember that that was the time that my stomach was really upset for a number of days because of the food I was consuming or the food I didn't consume.
Then we had to go -- go to g-get some -- for the food undertaking  you know  they call it in Russia bombioshka.
What the kitchen the kitchen wa s supply cooking food for the German [indecipherable] .
So I figure  ﬁI'm going to add a little bit to my every day rations.ﬂ Because once I went to Birkenau I was in trouble: No connections  no nothing no food  nothing to organize.
And at some point  as you mentioned  food for them  even though they had a farm  was very tough to get.
I said  \ I am not used to eating that good kind of food.\
You got a slice of bread in the morning  we got a little bit of watery soup  and you got coffee  maybe a slice of bread at night.
Not a lawyer  not a CPA  not a teacher  just come there every day  some food there  boil their potatoes.
Because they thought I brought something into the camp  like food  or something.
When we came back we had no mone y  we had no food and we just had the clothes on our backs.
So we were on that hill [indecipherable] Fernando will buy the food.
We cooked the whole night and the first dinner was 9:00 in the morning for food and then it was 12:00 and then it was about 3:00  4:00 in the afternoon and then you slept a little.
And they give him so much food  and I have to carry with him all the food back to his house  and we say hello  and I said to him  what should I do?
And the churches again had given them space and that's where they were able to exchange ammunition  health  food  like bandages and vitamins which people didn't have anymore.
No meat of course  just simple seder  but what we lacked in food the kids made up in spirit in Poland and Galicia before Second World War a nd formed many kibbutzim in Palestine after the War.
The Hungarians  they always asked me what do I hear from Budapest I said look you are still sick so wait until you're very healthy because right now my parents write there is not enough food  there is no medication.
R: Well  I remember being marched a little furt her with a throng of people into a warehouse of food  and I remember getting hold of a golden l ooking can and rolling it.
After that man recognized that the food is not the same and they ar e coming in constantly  boys to the girl and I disappear in that time  by the end they will come out  who is she?
There's no way where they got uh money or food or anything or or ammunition or weapons from th e uh Partisans.
And I have had so many debate s about food  you cant imagine.
We were those two  we were the two people who were going out day after day to find some food in the abandoned houses.
And he was the one who warned you about... He was the one who warned us  who brought us then food  some food into the forest.
So you eat some   you you Were you able to get food on the bla were you able to do anything on the black market?
See  then  in concentration camp and I told you that  we only thought about food and never about boys.
Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive.
Also  we liberated--we stole  or broke open--a food supply warehouse for the city of Magdeburg and we  the ex-prisoners and the German civilians helped ourselves.
But there were those what we call haarkeukens  that were kitchens for the people and you went there every day to get some food  just with a little butter -- R-Ra -- did you have a ration cards?
When the Italians came with the big trucks and uh uh food supplies  charcoal supplies and whatever uh military supplies were needed  they took care of them  so that they were living along the whole  the houses on th e beach.
I told them at one time  what would you do if you suddenly didn't have your mommy and your daddy and they say  Edie are you crazy  that's impossible  so I said just imagine that she was without parents  was younger than you and not only that there was no food and clothes and no shelter  but she could be killed any time  any minute  that's how she was growing up.
She was working near the crematoriu m. She was working with the Canadians  the white kerchiefs  ﬁgirlsﬂ. They had a ﬁgood pos itionﬂ. They could get the food  they were separating the clothing and food from the deported luggage. (
And he was involved with shipping aid -- you know  transporting food  eggs  dairy  who knows.
I was organizing the food and giving it away to everybody.
The fact that the food was very bad...this wasn't a big problem because we were able to bring some food from home.
But that essentially is is the is the amount of food that we had.
And she took me into the kitchen  assigned me to work in the kitchen.
Lot of people start talking and people start buying food  do everything what people doing  have a feeling something will be happen  something.
Maybe  uh  the food wasnt as fancy as it is now in the United States  maybe it was better because people werent getting as sick as they are now  uh  and uh  complete freedom  I mean absolutely nothing to be expected what was happening and then  Im not a psy- chiatrist and not a philosopher  but you wouldnt believe what would happen to people affected by hunger.
They got up and they gave us food and they were very kind.
They brought horses  killed them for  for food  and cooked it  they have some meat or something.
And with whom did you work?ﬂ And somehow I mentioned those two months in the office a nd he said  ﬁWhat did you do?ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  I worked on names and addresses and kept a roster of the SS and a roster of food supplies  and how many women went to each wo rk detail ﬂ because the shipyards where we worked had to pay the government for our labor.
Uh some standing on food lines and some uh trying to eke out a living from each other  just like in in the ancient in the in the ghetto of of of former times  of of three  four hundred y ears ago.
Was it--what other kinds of things besides food were a problem?
But then in a little  they gave us something to eat.
This mean where the al l food can be in the aprovasultsia  the -- all the food came in at once [indecipherable] there was a big mess.

Oh  we ate potatoes instead of bread  because we didnt have bread.

It was easy to cross the border and to smuggle so me food.
They were -- they were coming out also to select food or what  but I really did not know where they are.
And I ate it  and you know what  I enjoyed it.
So we were able to buy -- buy some food  even though we had no rationing ccoupons and swi -- Switzerland was strictly rationed.
One German man  a beautiful human being  even though they didnt have much to eat  he gave us two heflling  the two prisoners  the two jailbirds  food every morning.

Yeah  twice a day we would get food a nd I continued working sorting the clothes -- I continued doing that and uh .. we worked no more than eight hours so it was a relatively normal workday.
We had to fight for the every day  for to get the food on the table.
And I remember Leonhardy he was a tall man  sitting on the porch  and I don't know whether he asked me what was I doing there  but I know that they feed me and they gave me food and I brought it to both the Pollack families.
I will take gold and silver  and I will put it around you  and you can have all the goodness in the world.ﬂ And the bird sings to him  ﬁKeep your silver  keep your gold  keep your food  keep everything.
So he came with my nephew and they came to Israel.
But that wasnt the the problem  because we had  for at least for another year or two to eat  we had so much food in the house  whatever they they send us  you know  plenty food  no no problem with that.
I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 69 ate the same food the farmer ate and this gave me some of the vigor back  which I needed when the underground -- the resistance movement in -- in the village when I came back  helped me to get out of France and into Swit zerland.
Even though it was so isolat ed  there was a black market?
He gi ve us food and we took it back to the ghetto.
I worked mostly with UNRRA  which provided food and clothing  and the United States Army  so I ended up being the spokesman for the Jews.
And when we stood the line in line for food  my father gave me a birthday gift.
>> Bill Benson: You said to me  mentioned you didn't have much food .
If this will take another day  nobody will be alive in those trains without food.
And y-you -- you had people who were 50 percent Jewish  25 percent Jewish  whod been in hiding  or they didnt have food cards because they didnt want to proclaim.
And he started to have food  and my youngest brothe r was always very daring to go out at night and bring food in.
I had a little bit of food  but then I had to watch out.
Were there any other such difficulties that she and you had in th in that camp  either with keeping warm  or trying to get food?
And they gave us food  and -- and we were driving -- riding through -- by land  Denmark  and then to Sweden.
They gave us no solid food for the first two days and then they started out with a slice of bread here  a little there and so on.
And we used to take the potato peels  and make a little bowl out of them  and roast them on there to make them hard.
We don't know what the future will bring  but there is s till dire needs that uh uh after we have buried most of of our victims and this is the first thing we did actually  uh now it's the time where we are trying to at least give them enough food that they th at they that they can fill their stomach  enough to wear and and al so work out a program what can be done for the future because those people who are liberated  with a very few exceptions   do not want to stay in German y  and it was very...made very clear and we had accepted already that line that certainly the the emphasis is that people want to go to then Pale stine  but also those who want to join their relatives in England and America  should been given the opportunity as soon as possible to do this because Europe is one big cemetery for us  and therefore we we we we uh we we...the sooner the better we we'll get out because otherwise it will be demoralizing to stay with a population which considers us as 42 enemies just just only weeks ago  and uh to start again what what the generation did for us...establish a career  establish uh uh a business or what...we are not tempted to do that  and uh so uh as I say with difficulties I managed to make that statement and uh I felt...wh at can I say...uh very very (laughter).
We -- he -- he -- he supply us with food before  because he knew he wont be able to -- to come   and he didnt want us t -- let us out.
Q. I think the food at th at point was already rationed.
Because I didnt go for the food ther e. Then they give a room for two people.
When he told me you lucky that the wine and when they gave such a food  all I ate was a little piece meat  not much  and the potatoes.
But when you paid the [indecipherable] which was the German  later on in the day  in - lots of food came into ghetto by -- They smuggled it.
The food was not diff -- any different from the rest of the people s food  but the room was nicer and we ate there.
They were th e lucky one  you know  who were working in the kitchen  they always have enough food.
I want to loot so I went down where the food was.
We send  basically  yard goods  of all kinds  so she could trade them for food.
And there was food  a ll the food what people was bringing.
And I said  \ Could I take the food to her home  when I will be hungry?\
But there were certain things people needed  shoes  pants  things like this   also some food products.
That's where the Red Cross came in to help with food  some clothing  and  of course  the idea for us was to try to get into the American zone  for one thing  and to try to get closer to what was then called Palestine that is now Israel because that's the only place that would accept us.
You could go Oh yes  you could not get food nowhere else.
This hurt me   to see food go to waste hurt me very  very much  and this will never change.
Obviously  it was not within their physique to take it too well  but other than that  they were not deprived of food or any kind of things  which was later very prevalent in the war.
Yeah  uh we were working in the factory uh twelve hours  night or day  and then they promised us they would give us one extra portion for night or uh  I had nothing better to do at night  so I I was working nights.
And in the middle of those of those things  there were these locations of different farms  and like this one that we went that we were  the the cattle farm.
We never heard anything from the Red Cross before and we -- they brought some food  the now -- the -- now we get good food and the baby got normal food and we got clo -- no  we dont get -- ge -- any clothes.
The food was sufficient  but the last few days they didnt give us so many choices.
Try to find us some food  you know  and some clothes.
This Bertha Kollek  she had somehow access to some extra food  and brought me a little bit.
Well  if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN.
You get used to limitations such as rationed food and living in a small r oom.
I know my husband told me that he was liberated by the Russians and they gave them a lot of food and people ate too fast and some of them died because their stomachs couldn't digest the food  it was to the point that your system didn't work right after being so starved.
Black bread and some ersatz coffee  which was imitation black coffee  we had that in the morning  early.
Then we had to walk I don't know how many kilometers  but we walked at least two or three days without food.
And we begged for food; and they did give us food  and told us to go into the barn.
It didnt taste like food at all  it tasted like cooked tree leaves or something.
Well  we had this much food for the wee k  divide that by seven  and then divide by the number of clients or the number of dine rs who would come  and how much each person would consume in grams.
I don't recall them turning on the ones that were trying to give them the food.
What you smell -- they give us the first food  so a bunch of people  they came  call people.
And my mother always took my laundry when I arrived and she wasn't prepared because this was all wrapped in laundry what was coming out of it  I just heard a big scream  and the bones came out and she felt that I should bring back something in return for the favor  so  she was a fantastic cook and baker so I brought good food back.
Waiting for food  worrying about my Muschi  and just worrying about everything  you know  I was always worrying about things.
But it was a very little tiny bit of food  and because my husband was sickly and he couldn't work  I was giving him the extras  anyhow.
And who couldn't walk because of lacking of food or water or something happened to him...he got sick  he get shot immediately.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 17 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AR: Yes  yes we cou--we--we--we ate food.
But on the whole  what I saw later  that Russia suffered from a lack of food  in spite of the fact they ha -- they had Ukrainia  which ha -- ga -- which has the -- had the best land in -- in Europe.
Well  one was  you know  we were Jewish and the Joint from the United States had sent food and things  clothing.
So I didnt pay  but I have to live in town  so they have to pay my rent  and my food and everythi ng else.
And they checked everything  and I remember particularly being outraged that one of them took a piece of fruit from one of the children's food packages  and I thought  How can an adult steal from little children?
The food rations well  if you saw that  they were minuscule.
I came back loaded but -- ab solutely loaded with food.
So my mother sent us to the -- to the cart  you know  th -- to the car  the food car  whatever its called.
Most people got sick from it  because the stomach was so shrink  we couldnt even eat  but -- but people were so hungry  they though theyll eat the whole world  would be enough food.
And people meet -- we meet once a month and people bring food to share and there is a program.
You know  you can be harsh about it  saying they stole from you  on the other hand  they may have traded it for food and needed it.
There were still a lot of people who lived quite well  who had  had ways of getting food into the  into the ghetto  especially in the beginning.
They brought th e food  and th -- and thats about it.
We had no green card  so we were at the mercy of the farmers who did give us food and shelter.
So I took always a lot of food home -- home  where we slept and then I s -- I -- I divided it to Chaim and I had a cousin there and her -- and she had -- and another girl.
And what did you do during the day in the ghetto?
And people who were -- somebody was taken away from the family  whatever it is  after awhile they -- lot of people  when somebody died  they kept the body at home  they didnt report it to died  in order to get the food ration card. [
And we ate  but ich food was plenty  but nobody was able to eat.
Were sort of the local people pretty cooperative with you  in terms of  I guess  giving you food -- No. --
I badly wanted to see that  but your thoughts are heavily preoccupied with food and your discussions are about juicy steaks that did not exist.
She has four children  one of whom is 26  she works as a food technologist at Nestle.
And my mother says to me  look theyre eating food that we feed to the pigs.
And then at night At night they bring the food  and even da ytime sometimes they come in  because they werethey were all there  just a big barn.
At work we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at work.
We must have some food with us but  uh  I don't really recall recall it.
So all of a sudden  out of nowhere  some people came and they started to talk to me and give me food and give me probably money or whatever and make me feel good and tell me that I should go with them.
I learned how to cut wood  take care of cattle and ride a horse  clear a field  corn  potatoes ; how to climb trees to get cherrie s and figs  all kinds of food.
They had good food  because top management were communists so they took care of them.
Af ter she took the food and then snuck back and had a key to enter.
And now that we worked there in camp and the rations were terrible.
We had  we used to keep warm the food from Friday night for Satu rday.
And on the Dutch end  again  I only remember it was hot food  and it was so nice because it was cold  it was winter  and that we had a nice hot meal  and that I thought I could almost understand these women.
Well we decided to jump the fence because we didnt like the food.
We -- we just took  you know  break for the night and it -- everything was empty and things were trashed out because I thin k the Russians already took care of the -- of the better things and left it there  yeah.
You couldn't get ration cards  so you had to finagl e your food using up all resources.
Well  I think I  I took a lot of responsibility on  for that friend of mine who  because we were together and she was two years younger and as I was  I would say essentially  anorectic and she  but not anorectic in terms of throwing up  but just wouldn't eat  I mean I was just not interested in food  but not that I had an image of being fat or what goes along with anorexia these days  just  just so d istraught that I couldn't eat.
soup than the food we had ha d in the ghetto  so we could easily survive on that.
And if the butcher didnt want to wait on us  he had a perfect right to do so  because we had Jewish food stamps.
Well-to-do family  the boy always had a little money  so we got along fine  and the food we got there was quite poor  and yet you could smell  German houses don't have ventilation systems like you have in modern structures  so you generally know whether somebody is cooking a roast a block away.
I don't think there was any Jewish people in uh  in this  but uh  they immediately of course asked us for food.
But we ate enough  I nevertheless was not hungry  didnt go around town.
They gave us food  they -- they gave us car -- cards that I could get a -- a quarter of a pound of butter  all -- o-or a half a pound of butter for a whole month.
In order to to to make it more more visible for you  we had in the ghetto vegetable gardens  free  open space so we built the potatoes so that in the harvest  we worked potatoes  but the people were starving so they couldn't wait until the potatoes would be ripe so they we re...they all jumped on the on the vegetable uh gardens and they took all the unripe potatoes and they ate them.
It doesn't matter that you will have better treatment  better food  better whatever  you stay with me.
And suddenly there was a shortage of water  food  hunger and simply bedlam.
Only inside  inside necessary details for distribution of food and cleaning and so on. [
Kitchen scraps from the guards food  Im sure table scraps from the guards food.
So we were like han ging in the air without food  without support.
Then we went back  but at the same time they called out from each railroad car that people should go out and pick up food for the journey.
And we were allowed to go usually when there was nothing on the market  so to survive from the point of view of the food it was very difficult for us.
In the Russian time my father worked freel y  and food was available  and fe -- they did not prosecute Jews.
Many people uh didn't quite make it because of poor nutrition  poor food and health reasons in the because the way we were able to sustain ourselves  I think we made it to uh--uh perhaps we had a little bit uh--uh my father  mother  my--my brother and I all survived uh the Holocaust and were liberated in Austria and Germany.
My aunt kept a lot of food until it was bad so the food wasn't so good there.
They cant have food  different co -- different co -- diffi -- difficulties at work  with -- especially with different party organization which were very powerful.
But she had milk  the mother had milk  so she give.
And I wasn't thinking about food never  but just to take [indecipherable] I wanted to live.
Well  we stayed in you see  after we we we purchased food  and we also we got a goat.
>> Bill Benson: One of the things you told me  Leon  with food being so short so dif ficult to get  that in the ghetto there were friendly doctors who would give a prescription for potato peels.
But another -- the way that we -- we did get some food  the -- there was a refinery  oil refinery about a mile and a half away from the farm where my uncle Abraham Gruber worked  he was a butcher.
I mean  he accepted that  it was a necessity  there was no kosher food and he need ed to just get back on his feet.
We had the food of... they had plenty of everything  like in peace time  yah.
So your parents and the three of you were concerned about getting the food and the water and did you stay mostly inside or did you walk around cause it was spring and summer when you We had to be outside simply to  to get the  the what we needed you know.

We had to feed them  they were like everybody else  starving.
One day I came to brought some food to them and I knocked on the door in the synagogue  to the wooden doors and two SS came out I mean two Nazis came out to the door with their rifles and bayonets and pointing at me he says  go away  dont come back any more.
In 1944 in September the barracks got more crowded  because people were being pushed with the Russian advance and Auschwitz being emptied  beginning to be emptied  and Birkenau and all these people came west and there was less work and less food and finally we didn't do anything anymore.

No  it was just what the sexton and his wife was telling us and then what my parents had said what had happened  but apparently every able person who had time was there at the school yard doing the same thing that they were doing  gathering things for the Polish Jews that they needed  providing food for them.
We were we were in hiding  I mean in the ghetto  in the cellar.
I survived without medication  without food  and if this wasnt bad enough  while constantly the number of inmates were getting smaller  they were always cutting the fences smaller  so consequently we wouldnt have a little bit more room for ourselves.
They were also in a privileged position to get more food because the 28 transports that were arriving  some people had supplies.

We knew she was hungry  but she wouldn't allow herself to have a little food because she wouldn't take it away from her children.
There was a refugge camp so we could get food - as a refugee camp.
Without the  without a drop of warm water or cooked food  only bread he used t o bring us some onions  some garlic  he claimed that that helps  helped.
So I guess there was sufficient amount of food available  you know  when in the ghetto.
We had in Poland you could get for like $20 a month a young girl that helped took care of the children  helped a little around the house  with the ironing and she got food and she got some money.
There was a scout ca mp for small Polish boys  and ah there must have been about a hundred of them  a nd they came to us to get straw  so they could make shiniki  you know  to sleep  and what they would can give them some food.
We didn't have food  we didn't have medics to help the people.
We had to get the food from the other side to get connections with Polish people and they give us the flour  bread  whatever  from the other side  and I had to give them the money.
He said  \ You can make it three days with no food no water  you're going to make it again.
But she knew my...my um Zayde--which is my grandfather--had no food  and she worried over him.
The two older members a nd my father were possibly receiving some food outside of the ghetto.
We had -- my mother made a lot of like toast  you know  they called it sweebark   what can stay and dried noodles and whatever we could -- that wasn't perishable and we brought it with us  so for awhile we still had our own food  and after that is -- there was from the -- I -- I can't remember exactly  h-how was th-the food situation  but somehow everybody still had something what -- what to eat.
To the men  yes  yes  they gave food to the men.
So each one in his own way tried to get additional food.
And for me to start eating French food when Im used to the regular kosher German kitchen  you know was quite a change.
How the place looked  how people talked  how the food tasted.
I was working at a job with Quaker  which was providing food for the military.
We had also--in made a couple cans and--and--and the--the little food we did have and we spared something and right up make what we call uh Soccerringus.
Oh  because if they got food  their stomachs were contracted to an extent that food would kill them.
So  the first thing  he asked me if I know anybody who was from the corroborate   if I know anybody still around who may have participated in the robbin g and beating and stole food.
And we did walk out a little bit  we had to wait for our food  they give us this little piece of bread in the morning.
You had to be very lucky to eat the food they give it to you over there because somebody would grab it.
There was the girl  the woman what opened  what gives us our food  was  was a very mean German woman.
The Spaniard for some reason had food  and I want to tell you how that came about .
They wanted to take that stuff and ta ke it somewhere else and sell it to somebody so the Nazis could make more money or whatever they wanted to do.
She gave you food  but she also requested things from you.
By the way  my mother was fasting 2 days a week in camp  not that she needed to do it  but she actually did not have any water or food.
BY INTERVIEWER: What were most of the Once some poor people came from Poland and we gave them food and we helped them.
So they gave me a piece of bread once in awhile.
We gave some clothes and the Polish people gave us food.
You live with shortages and then all of a sudden this  [talkover] unending supply of food.
The farmers could not slaughter an animal without notifying the Germans.
>> Bill Benson: Fritz  of course  as you described to me as the war ground on  coming to a close Berlin was bombed repeatedly  food was scarce  conditions got more and more difficult.
We  the food - I remember I took a piece of bread  a tiny piece of bread  and I took it to a lady.
And -- And went to -- to try that Berliner food  which -- which was very interesting.
We didnt feel it that way because first of all we had food to eat and a bed to sleep.
Everyday the kids...he organize d those kids so they put the food which were above the table and put them down because they didn't get any food you know.
I was a -- the busine -- business manager there and I made trip [indecipherable] to my sister in Prague and -- and bought materials and that wa -- that time was the Black Market  I could sell very good  I could bring food.
The British came and dropped us some ammunition and guns and food.
And sometimes  the  the  the once I remember the coo-the cook  they  th ey killed him almost when he was sitting middle of  of the place in the middle from where we  were sleeping  and  uh  we  we  uh  we couldn't get food on that day  and I remember once  an  a young man  he was 16 years old  and he was the favorite of one of the SSs really  and he was sleeping  and one of Wagner came into his room  and he said  \ Go ---------------  \  and he hit a little bit some with his whip when he had this whip laying next to him.
I would guess that I had maybe a week or ten days to left  and if I wasn't liberated and was not given additional food and was allowed to rest and sit in the sun I wouldn't have recovered.
We dug for whatever food we could in the forest and we stayed in the forest and eventually we saw the Russian army come in and take over  and we went out.
The food was there  it was fa rm food  but the food was there.
There were moments  you know  when we got in the piece of bread in the evening  so I ate the whole thing at once.
And -- and you can imagine what the other -- when they saw food  what happened.
But these people were starving  so we gave them biscuits and whatever canned goods we had  we had to open it for them.
We kids used to go scramble  try to steal some food from the farmers  for instance  when they came in  they would have to check in a certain amount of product that they had to bring in.
Things had to go  for instance  for the bread was outside the ghetto.
The only thing what they were concer ned about was the kitchen and the food.
what they were  they -- they were in trouble with their economy an d short of food  so how are they gonna -- if youre going to war  you gotta have -- you feed an army  and certainly they have no -- you ca -- cant feed an army.
So I was in charge of taking food to Mr. Appel.
And we decided during the night to go to a farm  to a peasant and ask for food.
But somebody told us theres  on the side the road  is a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS  and theres food in their pantries.
Yeah so he decided hes going to send us to a pensione and see to that we should have food and that helped a lot and this is what we did. (
That will be in that time that he will tell you that pharmacist   that maybe we can get food together.
We had the maid  who cooked for us -- I mean food was very easy  was very cheap for us -- you know  was available and was a easy life.
And so we could organize food for other people and to help them.
He came to check how the food was distributed in the Polish camp to the Poles.
I was able to get them some food  pray er book and so on  but then in a short time they were...this uh uh home was was cleaned out and la ter then I found out that my parents  blessed memory  were were in one of the first transports which went from Berlin directly  directly to Auschwitz  and certainly in Ausc hwitz uh uh uh they they obviously got murdered the the first uh moment when they arrived.
And the food supplies  y-you know  they had two hand -- handbags in that -- in that they had food and then they covered this with the -- the li-like ma intenance  you know -- Tools?
Where did your mother get the money for you to buy food?
But I was friends with the the children of the owner of the house  and they told me one day  oh they were boasting  oh  we have so mu ch food now.
The young boy again had tremendous responsibility taken on him by getting some food in the first place.
And...and...and no food  in that it...it's a fact was this Jewish uh Gestapo says--one time uh when the German came and picked them--they said  \ Let...let's see the girls what have big mouths going out .
And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of a of food for one partisan  for the four of us to share.
It was a very  very quiet crossing  but we had British food  and the British didn't make any friends among these American troops with the kind of fo od they gave us and the service we got.
And they brought th e f -- some food in here  some soup  whatev -- whatever.
My mother used to cook more food than -- than she needed to bring down to the tenants children because they were so poor.
While you're in school and you come home  you have a clean bed and you have food to eat.
food ra -- yes  which was 50 percent of nothing  right?
He gave me some gold coins to sell in the black market and buy food  and do whatever I wanted to.
You know  we have like rations  it's what they're know n here as stamps  but we could by some food for it.
Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 15 He was back from the labor camp  and he oh yeah  that w-we the table was set  we were [indecipherable] the best food was set up on the table.
They must have been hiding food or something because it wasn't very deep and the old man  the woman's husband was shaking he was afraid to go down.
Did you ever notice a difference in the food  the amount of food you got or the kind of food you got?
And you couldnt give them any food because it was what you need to survive.
So  okay  so we pack our bags  and you dont know that youre ever going to come back  so we took clothing and food  cause you dont know whether there is any food.
There was food morning  noon and night and they treated us to something that was th eir delicacy  but we didnt like it  was fried bananas.
I used to go out and try to find out who wants to sell a watch and sell it to them and buy food.
So he wanted to get cherries so we would have some food.
And I found the two kids th ere  and we started to look for food  but we didnt find any  because those who were ther e already  they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage  and all -- all other storages.
It was not wonderful food  but we were -- I'm trying to remember.
So when you say they were -- they were rationing  that means that everybody in the area was presumably going to get the same food  am I right?
So  we really in Retzow we didnt have a bad day  because she was supplying a ll the food.
So sometimes she went to the walls and they refuse to give them more food or money whatever it was.
With that distribution of food  did you all decide well each take on sip until its all through?
indecipherable] but he used to bring us so and so many bottles vodka  and we had a steady guy who was giving us food  either flour  or various kind of -- various kind of other -- other food for the -- for the vodka.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 15 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: at the workshop.
So they took us to the camp  we have to walk to the camp.
And my mother  you know  how oh my goodness  you know  she was grabbing most of the time  food.
You can see there that at the moment when the food parcels started getting through people survived.
Wer -- were you able -- did you get something other than soup so that you -- some food that you were able to bring back to your mother and your sister and brother-in-law  or not?
Anyway  so we had a lot of food in the house and Im sure the people from upstairs  they took it all.
They used to get drops from the French resistance in England  used to send planes  would drop food stuff.
And also try to tell that -- that w-we -- we had food enough in Denmark  we -- it was not under same cont rol and that it was not an organization.
I think so mebody would come and br ing us some food  I dont know  maybe my fathers worker -- one of my fathers workers  but I dont remember that.
And eventually my mother gave me and there were about seven or eight of us from that place  Polish children  my mother gave me to take me to Polish army  becaus e they promise that they will give us food.
And then every day we used to get what we ca lled potato soup  a la dle of soup  that was all we had.
What happened  we came to Buchenwald  uphill  we can hardly walk  with no food  no nothing.
Gi ve me some food  you know  to fill my stomach.
My my husband knows where is the storage from the International Red Cross  where is the food.
And so I volunteered to go to the machine room and took care of the ovens there because I knew you get a little b etter food there whatever.
They brought me food either in the barn or over there later on in a bucket; always three times a day --breakfast  at noontime and at dinner.
He used to bring in from the food of the horses  he used to bring into the ghetto.
If my children left food on the plate  unconsciously I said  ﬁOh the kids in the Holocaust wouldve really been happy to have that.ﬂ Or saying  ﬁPlease dont waste food  theres hungry children in the world.ﬂ So it does carry over without even thinking about it  you influence your children  your  when my grandchildren was little  I was sitting and watching ﬁThe Wizard of Ozﬂ  beautiful show  right?
Were there facil About food  I dont know nothing about food.
So after we we acquired all these food supplies  we felt very comfortabl e in the village.
I was probably the one who would go and ge t the food.
And there was food  we ate  you know  everybody ate together  you know.
The Mother Superior gave me food to take back to Br ussels for us.
I don't know  but it was a hard walk in the snow and the cold and no food or nothing.
And girls from my town were  one ought to have his hat off to them  they were running all over town and trying to get food together and they cooked soups for these people  like from beans and whatever they could get together and people were torn because it was a holiday and it was not a day to cook food  but some nevertheless relented and these girls did everything possible and they took it out in cans and pitchers and whatever and the guards wouldn't let it on  the guards wouldn't let them give it to the people in the train  they wouldn't open the door  they wouldn't let them give water  they wouldn't anything.
After sitting in this hole  for ten days without food  without water  Ill never forget  the walls in the grave were so shiny from my sweating  from frig hten  it was like a mirror.
You dont remember eating -- I dont remember the food. --
Food and during the summer of '42 we heard that this was the rumor that the of the Gestapo from Stanislow is around in the area liquidating ghettos.
Well  that was a tragedy because that's where the food was.
We had no food so th at one bite had to be enough for I don't know how long.
You know the whole time int eh ghetto there was very little food.
I didnt took it for her  the bread she give it to me.
Our neighbors who used our furniture  who used my aunt's clothes and my mother's clothes  that we recognized not once came to ask if we needed any food or warm clothing.
And we got  my family from Amsterdam where we were sent me sometimes packages  and one of the g-guards that opened the door recognized somehow that I wa-that my brother was in hotel school  and that uh  she knows him  and from that time out we get double food  all of us in the cell got extra food.
So he introduced himself and he sa ys  you know  Im a Im a big farmer  I have a lot of cattle  and anything food  you name it  I have it  he says.
And in fact  there was enough food there that he also announced the distribution of all kinds of special rations.
And because my mother was working  so she was entitled to to some kind of a ability to get food  you know  from the local store.
He was still cooking and food and everything and at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was very connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food.
You mentioned that people were se nding you food packages occasionally.
He told them I cannot give you any food unless you gi ve me the eight Je ws. {
I had the cousin who survived  was liberated by the Americans  and died two days later  because the food she was given  she couldnt take it any more.
When a food ration was announced or posted on the walls  it gave a date when it would be available  and how much  and what items.
And they began to remark that the fact that the food improved.
So you sat there for about 48 hours  without food  without all these thing  and then the German would playing they had the radio  and they were playing the German tunes  and they were cooking steaks.
First of all  you get some time for a change  better food  because you get tired of that -- you know  if you get a little bread  even a little -- with a little garlic -- Yeah. --
Whoever had cars had the car in  had horse with a buggy  whoever buy food; and people try escape the city towards Warsaw.
He was ordained...ordained by the bishop in December 44  and from October 1944  we had already better conditions because of food we have received from our families.
I think my mother worked in the kitchen  and my father uh worked in the factory.
So there were men that said  ﬁListen  why do I have to go and grab food and risk my life?
And  of course  there was always a time  uh  an opportunity  to get an extra food  too.
And they too didn't take me to look over my clothes  but they took some of the other people look if th ey had food with them.
There was a dirt road so we took the dirt road and we got through and I remember  our first night we slept Halle  Germany  and there were some students who gave up their place for us to sleep and  I never forget  it was the first fresh coffee for breakfast and some regular breakfast  and then we went down to Prague and we were brought the Red Cross building  or where ever the Red Cross was  and they gave us money and food and they had already had posted some people survived  so we looked  you know  any news . . .
And he was so nice now that we gave him always something to eat  that engineer.
What should I give her?ﬂ Not that we had that mu ch food  but the food was Russian and so we have bread and we have a jam and saccharin  and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that.
they had more energy  more food in them to even be able to think  not necessarily sex  but be more than human who needed comp anion rather than all thinking of food and immediate danger  I think.
And my mother gave me  with me  such a thing to  if she gives me milk  to carry the milk.
You know I worked in an office afterwards and I was not mistreated  although I didn t have any more food but I  I had an easy  easy work.
So  we went into a building that we didn't even know who lived there  and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady  maybe 100 years old in the bed crying that she doesn't have food  and that she doesn't know where her family is and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all.
Some of the merchants tried to put food aw ay for the...for their Jewish customers under the counter so that we had some food.
Yes  my brothers worked also where the food -- the side by the gate where I told you that's where the stables were.
Oh  my dad -- my dad had a job  so Uncle -- he worked in Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food transport  had something to do with eggs and stuff.
Cattle trucks  I dont know how many men was in there but er  the only food the Italians give us was a tin of so called corned beef  which we were told was made of donkeys [LAUGHS]  and er  er  thing a bread all the time  we was travelling all the time in the trucks. [
So we would take food upstairs but have to wrap it in linen napkin  very well.
And no food and just a little drop of water which went the very first day.
This was Reingold he was a police... No  Reingold was  where they had food  he was in charge of that  Bert.
Actually  nobody going to kill me  nobody going to deprive me of food.
It was a detention center and you know  it was as I say  the food was good  we were kept occupied.
We t ried to dig this out of the ground to eat this because we didnt have enough food.
He gave me food every time I go home in the evening.
Our chef in the mess hall a-at Ca mp Richie was a chef from one of the leading -- I forget which -- hotel of -- of New York or Boston  but he was a super chef and the food was superb.
And the -- and the -- from this time  I was little bit not sure  and many Polish poor people  and young  deliver to ghetto food  b-back of a ka -- kartofel mean the potato or something others.
I mean  the soup may have had horsemeat content in there  but its -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be eaten  and this we knew  I was raised that way  so it became a issue.
Theyll have their house and the  I would say  most of the food and all that kept in the homes.
Uh  my...it's difficult to really say that because the disruption was...gradual  and some things were ve ry drastically different when the war broke out  and then gradually life became more normal  but very different than it was before the war  so that for instance we came back from the country shor tly before the war broke out  and our cupboards were bare  and my mom tried to buy food because she had survived the first world war  and she knew that it will be difficult to buy food in the beginning  but she couldn't get any staples  she couldnt get any bread  she couldn't get any flour   she couldn't get any potatoes.
But  I had terrible typhoid  I couldn't say I'm going to make it really  but soon after I got out of the hospital and got back to my barracks  we were told to go out in the middle of the night and stand in line to give us extra food and we were marched out of Auschwitz because 07:27 30 the Russians were coming  this was in January  1945  and they didn't want the Russians to find us there and what they did to us.
When we got to Bergen -Belsen  we had been told to pack some food and whatever for the journey to the boots  which we never got to.
You asked me how  where the food came from and I sa id people must have brought some.
In Hanover  I worked afterwards in a -- in a dep -- in a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 8 place where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA  U-N-N-R -- I think they said W-A  which means United Nations relief  and we were distributing food.
And did you bring her some of th e food that youve brought back?
She had something in her hand  a little...some food  whatever not  and there was this German standing down there with a red face.
Anyway  and it wa -- they had the storage of food there and ammunition  so everybody rushed there.
>> Bill Benson: So while you're there for one full year  conditions  they are strict  as you said  food is rationed.
The following morning  lined up for the first food in six or seven days which until you had a cup  you took it in your hand.
And in there he us ed to smuggle food on the way back  you know  you know?
We had some food  which we exchange d on the way  from local population.
When you were going around this area looking for food  going to farmers  did they know why?
What happened is normally my mother used to give us packages  not with food  but she used to give us let's say a piece of material that you can make a dress or pair of pants whatever it is and a piece of leather which the farmers don't have it.
And...uh...Then they gave us a rusty tin can that looked like full of rust for our food and they said that was...we have to hold on because our life depended on that  but if we lose that we would get nothing.
Now  at the camp  mostly those who were assigned at the camp -- pardon me -- their responsibility was to go and -- on the food undertaking for themselves and for the family e -- for the family br-brigade  because there was all -- a lot in the families  yeah.
But she used to feed me  you know  just because I was extremely  ex tremely thin.
And there were Army people there and I don't think they knew what the hell they were eating  so they probably thought it was GI food also.
And -- and I used to go out from the ghe tto  used to bring some food  on the risk of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 12my life.
His mother was a gray haired -- sort of gray haired  dignified lady  came with a huge basket of food  which she plunked on the table with a thump and an angry face and said  ﬁListen  you have known our politics for -- for years now.
And I was selling my husbands clothes  and that gave me food.
Other than the fear  were the conditions horrible  did you have food  could you come and go?
I really did...um we went to U[bombard ] U  and they had a beautiful food.
And he says  \ If you played...\ --the guard--\ that I'm going to like it  we gonna give you plenty of food and water.ﬂ Because that was terrible.
What we used to do  when we walked out to work  at night we used to march in and carry food.
And of course we lived a very simple life by then  our needs were very small  you couldn't do very much so it was actually just the food you needed.
If they all obeyed what the existing law was  and didn't steal food or change documents  theyd be gone.
It took a while to sort of sink into our brains that we didn't have to be up in the morning for a roll call  that we didn't have to be scared  that we we re going to get food  that we were alive.
I find food in my place and my friend find food next to her.
Helped the peopl e  he sent in food to them. {
So  one day they came and they picked 300 people from the street to unload a big transport of food  because that's when they opened up at that time  this particular warehouse.
And there was -- the beginning there was a -- th-there was soap -- soap in them  there was food in them  there was all kinds of things.
All I saw is that  ﬁThere are the Germans  dont you see ‚em?ﬂ Then somebody said  ﬁNo medals  look.ﬂ And I stood up  and it is amazing that I had the energy to stand up  before– because we had no food.
We couldn't get the food that they said we should take for four days.
She could have  I should have said earlier  on the black market roughly the pr ice of food was 10 times the regular price control price  it varied a little bit  it also depend on what kind of food  but that was a good average.
He gave me some food and told me where to go.
The woman would bring us the food in a laundry basket and so on.
>> Bill Benson: What was the food conditions like for you?
And a few of the girls got some food from them.
They broke open all the food  the stor storage food where they had all  you know  from the SS.
There was uh ample opportunity for sports and uh food uh like we hadn't seen before.
Over there  in comparison to the ghetto  was good because I had plenty food  as much as I want.
I remember th at the whole night I was running only to urinate  you know  thats what it was  be cause I decided one thing  food was not enough.
She woke up my mother and my si ster to share the food with me.
And this was the first time I brought in food at the ghetto.
It was shaking so much the boat that food didnt stay in anybodys stomach.
I mean th-th-th -- under these conditions  getting food on a horse that is going to go outside of the city  the whole bank can be considered guilty of doing something wrong  as far as the Germans and their collaborators  and there were plenty by that time.
Occasionally they gave us some food; you had to sort of maneuver yourself.
Yeah  they didn't have the food there  the fever ate you up.
They packed you in like sardines and we were riding for a couple of weeks  without food  without water.
They dug a -- a -- a pit and buried the carrots into the pit and covered it so -- some food  right?
We had no food  until we were freed in August 1944 by the Soviet army.
Can you describe how the what the Quakers did in I dont know I dont I have I didn t meet them  but we we did know that the Quakers provided some provided some food into the was miserable  the kitchen was in a open barrack like a big What kind of things did you eat?
8 How did you get your food  how did you -- Rations.
I saw if I will do that with these food what we had  I couldn't survive it.
We got warm food the only thing is what quality was the food we got. \ ]
They also had -- They didnt have a lunchroom  per se  they had a room where you brought your lunch  and -- and you ate in that back room.
So theres an orga nization  a Rachel Table  in New Haven and they picking up -- this is ju -- an Jewish organization really  and they picking up from different places  volunteers  food and bring it to soup kitchens.
My mother had made sure that Annie had gotten ration cards and things like that  to care for me  but the Madna family never asked  really  where they would get food  who would pay for this extra mouth to feed.
If there was a family  they knew they had no food  then they always get so mething from the neighbors.
It were full of straw  of hay  and we were in them.
It was immediately a question of food  because there we re -- the Germans came  the -- the Nazis came too  and took away our  you know  food we had.
I -- I have a feeling that my father  I-I -- I dont know   he either went to the farmers to get food for the underground -- I really couldnt tell you  I have no idea of what my fa-father might have done or not done  as far as the underground.
And we finally came to Grozny  surrendered our food in the hotel  and then we had to beg for food later.
So anyway  we were all 13 there.. 01:43:47 Now we have to organize food and organize th e regime control that we do not do something which can be dangerous to our life.
You will not survive here  there is no food  there going to come and raze all those buildings.
Yeah  we had -- when we c-came to this part of the -- or Socha took us to this part of the sewer that we stayed at  we were 11 people  but it -- during the time that we were there  I d-dont -- after few months  Mrs. Wei ss  she -- she was a elderly woman and she had the asthma  she was sick and she was getting sick eac h time  and he -- he -- her health deteriorated very much  and my mother used to take care of her  you know [indecipherable] to bring her food be -- beca -- when she could and even later on sit and try to feed her and try to always  you know  be with -- hold her hand and be with her and she said to -- to my mother that she -- she is 60 praying that my mother will s-stay alive  that we will stay alive  and she said  ﬁIm sure that God will hear me  and you will s-stay alive ﬂ and wa - one night she -- she passed away  and they ttook her body and -- to the Peltew  and they thr-throw this to the water  to the Peltew.
47 -- learn German  so that when the German come at our house  someone would know how -- what to -- Oh yes  right.
When you said you su you supplied them with blankets and medicine and and food and what have you  what sort of food did you provide?
They give some clean 8 clothing and so on and some food and then I'll find a place for you to hide here.
They set up barracks and gave people food and medicine and let them come to themselves.
Then we got -- in the morning we used to get the bread.
So they took us to the...to a peasant and we told him that we will give him soap  American soap if he would give us some food and...and give us some lodging.

And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said  ﬁOh  we ate in Jordan.ﬂ And one day it was our turn  we stopped the tractor  they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them  but we were already sitting on the other side  we had a little blanket  we put it down  all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there  but it is a totally different patrol.
They say you stay and I would help out in the canteen  pour coffee and so on  but what they did  they would throw the food away  they would dig ditches because they wouldn't...at that tim e they wouldn't give it to the Germans  the food.

No food  dirty water  no hygienic anything which we could be 34 clean nothing but sickness  people dying on the street  they weakened us and they made us like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a lot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first World War or they lived with them in Poland and they couldn't understand  they would not believe that they could do it to us.
They warned us and they gave us food and they said don't eat too much because it's not good for you.
Fortunately  they were able to lead us to the potato  or the Kartoffel storage and that's the first food that we had served...was weak potato soup  the same as they've been getting  but we didn't have anything else.
And I turned to the Kapo  and I said  \ Herr Kapo \  you know  uh  \ If we would give a little food or a little water  this man would  would survive.\
There were a lot of inmates in Buchenwald that did not have a chance to get extra food and I was aware that a lot of times the stronger inmates were trying to take away the food from the weaker ones... and it was like a death sentence because the weaker ones could not defend themselves or could not have enough food in order to survive.
Thats where Panana −imait would come in at the same time to get her ration of food -- I see. --
But then -- course when I -- when I left  and of course when they would -- they wouldnt allow food later on and he made some contacts with some local peasants where he -- they were he lping him out a little bit too  but -- but he had a very  very rough time of it.
Always trying -- first of all we were trying to put food on the table.
Sunday  you didn't work  but you still stood cell block count  got the same food.
The food was so so but compared to the previous camp it was a little better because they really needed us very badly there.
It was a big farm  a lot of farm  a lot of acres of land  and there they brought us all up.
I really blew up like a balloon after getting proper food.
Oh  that -- there was no question  so we got food  you know  theres food from  you know  through the Joint  and s -- there were never a problem.
Actually  when he first came here  my aunt told Bertle  when we came  that Herm an used to hide food all over the house because he was hungry   which makes sense ; he was a growing boy.

We had to wait for army boat  'til it comes  when the army boat used to come with food and ammunition for the American soldiers  their bases.
So  it wasn't a tremendously successful thing for me  and besides which  I didn't work there very long because I got sick again  and I came down with Para-typhoid  and this was the last  these were the last weeks of the camp  and  if anybody ever tells you that you cannot survive without food for a long time  I don't think that we were given any food in that camp towards the end of the  the  the occupation.
Where the money came from to feed us  I have no idea.
I keep saying Quakers because they were really very predominant in this but there were other Im trying to think of some of the other civilian groups in the United States that sent food over.
So we used to go there and have food free  you know  didnt cost us anything.
They would send us Spam  and they sent nail polish  that they -- we would sell  and I dont know what other food product  but I a dored ham  and the Spam had that kind of a taste.
They looked like 14  15  you know  from the lack of food and lack of vitamins.
Nobody came and nobody came to ask us do you have food  do you want to work.
Anyway I ate eggs and the next da y my stomach was sick.
Oh  there was no food in the stores  or so  no  no.
We paid him  he took us  another couple  Jewish people  he used to took  take us out of ghetto and say that they are taking us to work  but they really took us to  we had clothes or something to trade for food  for bread.
I didnt -- I didnt miss any and except salt  I didnt miss any  you know  it was nothing gourmet food  but potatoes and whatever  not -- it was -- it was enough to eat and enough to survive.
Enjoy -- My mother was more religious than my fath er  but we didnt keep kosher or anything like that.
And that was absolutely the greatest joy  because it was  in a way  a miracle  because we were suspecting that we were getting something in the food which will prevent us from being able to bear children.
And they picked up the people and they took them everybo -- I remember they came to my -- to our 31 apartment and Lutas father said  should we take some food  so -- some thing  some food.
He went out and he bought food and he started a kitchen in Pionki to feed the people that were there in the labor camp.
It was only under the threat of fear that those people provided the food to the partisans.
And she gave me potatoes  and she gave me whatever she had.
At that camp  in the better camp  work was hard  and food was the same  but they didnt beat so much.
American soldiers were quite generous and helpful and sympathetic--they gave us food  they gave us whatever they had including Hershey bars.
But one of our buddies was an electrician  was the camp electrician  he was from Berlin  and he used to arrange there was a short sometimes so we could toss some food to the girls.
So one guy was  my friend looked out  and he saw the Red Cross are here  they're try to open up the cars  they try to give food  Red Cross  who cared about it  I was dreaming about my home  dr eaming about my girls  dreaming about dancing  dreaming about everything  I have seen everythi ng what was going on.
And clothes and food and sugar and I dont know  was -- From Holland?
Well  let me tell you  the Germans later on gave us an extra meal because they really needed us.
The food was terrible there and people were  there were no killings  mass killings or anything like that but uh people died from hunger.
Because its food plenty  if you want to work.ﬂ Okay  and you spent -- n-not spending your money on -- on booze  and on -- and on -- and on dope.
Some of the people were on the deck  but a lot of them were in the boats hold and had no water or food.
I protect his health  he brought some food for me  and we were clinging to each ot her un until one time  we were working both in the mines  and we were unloading the cement  and I got weaker and weaker and I just --------------50 pound bag cement  maybe I weigh at that time maybe 75 pounds  and I couldn't carry it  I fell down  and that uh  German came  he said  \ I'm goi ng to kill you.\
And this was a problem  because whatever they have to buy  food for themselves  even with rations  or you want ed to buy something better  was sayvay four or five times as much as pre-war  [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war.
The only thing what they -- they used to bite is our food  our bread.
And so we...we were very...you know  we didn' t eat a lot of things that were put in front of us.
And we came to a  um place where they stored the hay  and everything.
The food was marvelous  the -- the -- the cherries particularly  just absolutely wonderful.
What do you do if you have food and they have none?
The UNRRA is was an organization what they supply food and clothes for you.
Except today when they are in incubators and the food is different.
So they find some  a lot of food  in  in the cars  and now  this the reason why this commando had so much to eat  and so much everything else.
And thats where I met him  and but then I had already I met a German family  because they told you have to Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20  2009 99go and they had to give you food  clothing and shelter.
But  again because of the food shortage in Israel  came here.
What will happen to us if we are not going to have any food.
We would not get any food until every single person was accounted for.
All he wanted was to escape  and it was  like  on the second day or the third day that he came to us and he was very hungry and very thirsty and he asked for some food.
This firm dealt with...uh...with impor ting food stuff  especially...uh...livestock and process meat.
They were on a very  very limited ration  and we were eating high protein food  and as we gave them a candy bar or chocolate or something that we had in our po cket  it was so--their bodies just could not assimilate this high protein food that we had.
And of of course I remember th-the Lithuanian food  really  or pole PolishLithuanian food  because we go back in Lithuanian and Poland for centuries  right?
Was a s -- I remember a little more the food about Terezin -- Uh-huh. --
Father checked on the offices of supp liers of food whether its really going to happen  and he was assured by the Lithuanian officials  yes  we had an order for bread  we had an order for potatoes  we had an order for this  for that.
And you also are very involved  I remember  even in our trying to arrange when to get together  with giving food for the hungry.
And we were assigned to the kitchen to eat there  too.
>> Betsy Anthony: So the conditions in a Spanish concentration camp  do you know from your brother if they were similar to what we might imagine in a German -- >> Michel Margosis: Well  he said the food was lousy  conditions were not great.
They with their animals  because the at this point the Germans had become very aggressive towards the villagers  who at the beginning they were trying to appease  but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with shelter and food and so these th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the villagers by executing them  or burning the villages.
Now they have in in there  in Auschwitz  there was not so bad that th-the the a few days that we were over there we gave every you know  everyth we had sometimes once  sometimes twice a day we had food.
I I used to collect some some berries  you know  from wild berries  and this was my food.
No  once a day we used to get lunch and then they gave us produce products to prepare for ourselves a breakfast  you know  coffee and what else and bread.
One of the waiters said to my father there won't be any food on the road because on the train they don't have food.
I was hungry  and shivering  in middle of the night  and I didnt know  I thought that when -- when I  Polish citizen  come to Poland after the war  they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 50 going to embrace me  they going to give me I dont know -- I came there -- food and ev -- nobody.
I lost my -- I lost that  completely  until I came out of the camps  and then I think it took probably a year or more before it came bac k. So -- and there were rumors that they put certain things in the food  I really dont know  I have no clue what they did.
Always marching  without food  without anythin g. We had--I don't know where they got food but somehow ten days without food  you cant survive walking.
And my older son worked here for three months  at the National Food Processors Organization.
>> Susan Warsinger: Well  my father -- >> Bill Benson: For a while  he had no idea where you were.
They were paid a little bit  tiny bit  given food and shelter and many of them survive.
And when they came down to the mou ntains often  as you mentioned earlier  they brought food stuff.
Every man down to the courtyard till sixty year old with some one day food.
There was no possibility you could live another month in Bergen-Belsen  and food wasnt important anymore not the soup  not the bread  nothing.
They got that because the system wasn't used to food like that.
Because this is the outlet that I have the opportunity to get food.
In the beginning before we were in the ghetto  there were representatives and an administration and you went for your food there  even for your heating material.
And we never di d get th-the food that we needed  so we had to live off the countryside  which wasnt very interesting.
So was pretty good because once in awhile we traded something for some food  you know  e -- they -- they got fed.
And when you are telling kids about the Holocaust -- well they say  well Hitler was a bad guy.
So the Swedish trucks came  and they had food -- canned food  and stuff  whatever they could.
She had five goats  a small farm area where we planted various assorted food  and grapes  and we had the the fruit trees.
And we got food from the Jewish community that they sent food  bread  potatoes we cooked up  that kind of food.
And I was only 24 years old  and I had a big responsibility because I had to see to it that my mother  who was naturally twenty years older than I am  and my sister and my nephew should survive  and I thought  Well  if I were  uh  commit suicide  they would starve to death  so I did the best I could and I felt that instead to stay in the ghetto to work  you know  for the authorities  the Judenraute  if I will go out I have a better opportunity to bring us some food  you know.
Often times  a window would open and they would throw food at us.
Same amount of food that I would get when I worked outside.
>> My question is after years of starvation  when you did come to America   what is your favorite food?
Black market si mply means that people were trading in rationed food  but without ration coupons.
Because you know  during the siege of Warsaw that lasted 28 days  our food supplies were exhausted.
They brought some food and provision s. And I assume -- I assume now that we also had our little bags -- people allowed to bring along one suitcase  or some bag or so.
11 Yes  I was a very poor eater  and the school doctor recommended that I go for summer vacation to a childrens home so I could recuperate a little bit  and my father had to convince them that we went on vacation every year  and it was  you know  there was no shortage of food  and they didnt have to worry.
And we used to eat that every day  that was the food.

Food was also rationed  so they got food -- you would go to a place to pick up food once a week.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 11 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: was food served from I remember that my plate was always fuller than anybody else's.
And a lot of people who worked on the airport get passes to go to the other work brigades  in order to be able to get themselves food; because the airport slave labor was the real slave labor.
We had to put all our clothes and our bundles  everything in one room  get undressed  go to the showers  then go uh through um uh to get our clothes  and the clothes were on the heap  and each one of us picked whatever we could  you know.
I mean they  we call them ﬁchasidei omot haolamﬂ we call them the righteous gentiles who were worried and they 9 understood and endangered themselves  such as that family from a little town Hidveg  coming in and bringing some potato knowing that we cant any more buy food.
And  I had just been through several years with no food on the table and I was very perturbed by that situation.
The toilet was only morning and then the food  when they delivered the food it was very small  but even if we received one s poon of marmalade  he took from us.
My sister had nothing to survive on -- my sister tried to make some food for people.
02:07:13 Why do you think in the Jewish Community Hospital that you were working in  that the food was simply available and you were getting a better diet?
But we...but that time we already had something to eat  you know.
Also my -- my mother was a bit of a -- probably natural food type vitamin person and she had had -- also saved and put aside vitamins and -- and especially calcium pills  which -- I -- I -- I -- Ive had rather tr oubles with teeth  which are thought to have had some basis in the war depr ivation.
And then  my uncle used to go out  and he used to bring something from the farmers.
Now  the idea was that there were adults who would supervise these children  they woul d bring hoo food an d everything.
And the Germans gave me food there...the workers there  some of them.
They gave me the best food what I had in months.
We had no idea what we were eating  probably things we didn't want to eat.
Mom  as I said   was sleeping the factory  and taking food to my aunt and uncle that he had brought into the factory.
And  incidentally  there are times when  among visitors of the camp  I have pictures from Catholic charities coming with supplies and food.
You know  but this didnt matter  you know  as long as I had food.
If you were caught stealing another prisoners bread which was you know our  our you know food was very meager  it meant that this guy  the other prisoner from whom you stole th e bread  he probably is going to die.
So  08:13:30 anyways  and I returned with all that good food and I guess love must have been started with his stomach because we started going out together.
I was hoping somebody would recognize me in the uh kitc hen because I worked in the kitchen in Auschwitz  and um  it happened twice where some body gave me a little bit of soup  and then one time a little bit of coffee  and I would run back to the barracks  and  and feed it to Christian  but Christian could not make it  she failed me  and sh e died in my arms  and uh  when she died  I put her down  and I pretended she was asleep  and I covered her up because people knew that she was sick  and I did not tell that she was dead for after 2 days because I wanted to have her ration and her food  and I pretended she was asleep  and then I was afraid that they would discover that she was dead  and that she would start smelling  and uh  I told the uh  block eldester  the lady in charge that Christian died  and they uh took her away.
My father a t dinnertime -- we always had dinner together  that was the family thing to do -- told us that we had to be prepared ------------ and maybe we should accumulate some more food  because for a certain time things are going to be going on that are going to be bad.
Th en the what I said referred indirectly of any..the end of the uh financial blockade and of the food blockade in favor of the victims.
We were in the field and we had -- there was nothing to eat.
You know  one got beaten because one pushed in the food line  and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back  but nothing really very serious.
We didnt have a car  so it wasnt -- there was a food rationing.
It was very cold and there was no food at all  so one day I walked by and I have seen some Russian carrying big kettles with food and I saw them going outside the camp carrying to somebody  so next morning I got up real early  like three o'clock  and I followed them.
And we were like up under the eaves  and had -- we had no ration cards either  so we couldnt buy any food  and I would go out in the street  and I found this little cheese shop  cheese and bread.
She will tell them that you went to buy some food  you know  in the village  something.\
But certainly  living through the Holocaust  and hiding  and seeing how people suffer  and deprivation that was going around  whether it was food  or clothes  or lack of freedom  this thing certainly ha d a major role in my life.
The peasants didnt --- we went to a village to buy something.
I -- I would go to peoples homes to eat and whatever was on the table and didnt get eaten  was thrown in the waste.
There was no steps or anything  so we would have a string and Father would bring us food  sometimes took the waste away.
And I never fought my way to be first in line or first to get food.
And then a and th en was another guy there  Zagufski   the two  they went to look something for water or food.
We had to stand in line to get food because somebody was nice enough to give us...because we were not registered.
Morsels of food  and a morsel of food was better than none.
No  it didn't because Bert even though he was in a privileged position and he was getting special food  extra  he sent it to my parents  yeah  and there was a girl who used to work for him and she had tuberculosis.
You got something black in the morning which was supposed to be coffee  two 6 hundred fifty grams of bread.
And then  slowly  we came back  and then my mother went onto the corn with more food to find my father.
This day  on the 17th  she came not just to my mother  but Interview with George Pick November 13  1997 78to everybody to beg for some food for he r mother  who who was in a diabetic shock.
Already you got food now  but in the if you think whats gonna be with you  what are you gonna do?
Within a few hours they brought in chickens and all kind of pigs and cattle and goats  you name it  they brung in more than food. ?
And 35 the local forester was sort of a fairly d ecent guy  I mean he got us as Jews  oh yeah  I should have said that with the outbreak of World War II  of course  immediately food was rationed.
We saw on our streets  and was in '39  and uh the Polish troops start to  to get out of the vehicle  ask for more food.
Did you have  tell me about the food that you ate?
So it took less time for me to digest to to to to be able to digest the food.
And -- and this was truck  this was exchange of food for items.
They never worked in their life  so I said...and you had to make a norm  you know  to to get enough food  you know  and I don't know if you know in Russia  you know  you have to make so much  you know  per day.
Somehow...I don't know why  but Simon's brother...first of all  he had the money that I was talking about that appeared and suddenly when they were throwing it out the window  but he also had some durable food.
Just maybe a second ladle of food was given to me.
He came with a truck and he brou ght me some food.
So when you got some compassion again  and could build yourself up  then you were able to -- Not very long -- didnt take me very long to build up  to feel sorry for those kids  and take them food  and take them medicine  and steal from the Russians.
So they got very affectionate with us  and we became friends with the people in -- in the town  and my dad and my brother started to work in the fields  to make  you know  some money  or even for trading for food.
We begin with him together to stay in forest  no clothes  no food.
We got food in the camp  but it wasn't the greatest.
When the Germans came in  my father ...I mean actually we were...we had no food in the house.
>> Bill Benson: And your father got back into the dairy business.
We had to like register  we had to get our food cards.
And through this window they gave us food about an hour later  like water with a few beans in it and things like that.
He -- he p-paid for on his own for -- for -- for the food.
Uh my brothers left and went to the forest and went to terrorize some peasants  got some food and organized a partisan group to fight the Germans  with what  how I don't know.
We had to go eat ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 outside.
She came the next night and brought us some food and told us they took my brother away a nd  from what she heard  he was shot.
These are one story houses in Pleven  very rustic  but we had a roof over our heads and at the beginning  you know  we were treated as guests  always having food prepared by those who already were living there  in the Pleven branch of the family.
Of course  I had seen photographs and incidentally  the family  after they heard that we survived the war  they sprang into action and send us lots of care packages  together with clothes  together with food.
The food was always and everywhere the same  and the f -- theres nothing to say.
And food was scarce because Jewish shops werent opened  they closed them up.
What was that like for you to have your day filled with eating a lot of food and playing?
It was like thing w-we we t ook some food with us from Poland  thank God  you know  we had some well  little food  and but then  along the railroads  the Russians were standing  beggi ng for food.
But we -- we were hungry but we were not starved.
Shortl y after that  my father went foraging for food somewhere and he was in a farmers field.
And there was no food  because the Germans were losing the war.
But this was a uh one of the sustaining things--potato peels that came from kitchens and that way use to be washed  cooked  and all kinds of food made out of it.
Th ey kept you very badly  and the Interview with Lucie Ragin July 23  2009 14[indecipherable] priest who was the one in charge  he made parties  and we didnt have any food  and some of the boys at ni ght would go to the kitchen  they made believe like they were sl-sleepwalking  and bring food for everybody.
She gave me some money  she asked me to go to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread.
We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night.
He thought about this  why you have to keep them and to give them the food and to think maybe the Germans will come and they will kill me  so he killed the whole family  took away everything what they had  the gold  everything.
At that time  you only worked for the food  you didnt work for pay.
But whenever -- when -- when I went to his house for a meal  which was the first time I ever ate anywhere else  his mother was very careful to give me -- give us a dairy meal  dairy foods  she just -- she realized I could not eat traifa food.
In fact  happened a couple of times  people gave me soup or actually some food.
>> Josie Traum: Well  things were very limited as far as food was concerned  care.
There was always plenty of food USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 26 26and my dad was very involved in the Jewish comm unity there and subsequently in Gastonia.
We had to go to the forest to gather something for food.
We didn't ask for anything  39 but they start showering us with gifts  packages  food  chocolates  cigarettes.
If I made someth ing and I knew that the kids are going to like  I used to bring over some food  and they enjoyed it.
You know  they used to come in and they used to be like...people...Polish people  you know  farmers used to come up and bring in all kind of food.
They give us food on the train  I dont remember what kind of food  but they give us food.
02:50:11 Once we get there  they just took our name you know  gave everybody whatever they have  you know  some  a cot and blanket and  and food they didn't give us maybe 1 400 calories a day I don't know or was it 1 800  I don't know exactly.
Would everybody worry just about himself or themselves and to heck with the rest of the world as long as I have my food and I have my job and Im not being threatened?
>> Bill Benson: And a question -- >> Sylvia Rozines: They wanted just if they could get some food.
Yeah  but that food was pretty yuk for a three year old.
And they would tell us  give us information where we could get a little money and how we could get food and so on.
And then there was a big cab -- a sik -- a big place for the refugees to get food.
Oh  there was also a -- a document which has survived  asking my father to bring back some kind of salamis or something from -- from the United States  I guess  I dont know  but there was -- there was a -- a request for  you know  send -- send food back to Lithuania  so -- from -- from a Japanese diplomat.
They wanted them to have a lot of workers  because they were supplying food for the Germans.
Uh  the march to the tunnels was very tedi ous every day  and almost no food.
What ay -- ay - Was your mother leaving the house to buy food at all  or what was going on in those first few days?
Yes  yes  they gave us at lunch time noontime  some meal  so they were we were cooking potatoes.
Yah  we were once put in a train going back and forth 3 days  3 nights and  you know  they filled up the box car to the maximum  closed the windows and the doors  and to go 3 days and 3 nights without having a bathroom  you can imagine  without food  you can imagine what happened there.
When the 49 Americans threw food away  the English couldn't afford to do that.
Maybe there was a little bit kosher food  because this was forbidden by the German  so  and it was very expensive.
And we were hungry  we didnt have what to eat  its so crowded.
And until they stayed in a place for awhile  they had to beg their food  they are receiving very little  beg their food from th e peasants around them  steal the food from the field  eat whatever they could find on the field  potatoes  raw potatoes and any other thing.
There was an opportunity for opening up a gourmet delicatessen food store which I was knowledgeable.
But youd go at night  would you c ook the food special  or would you simply take what was already there?
Uh I had all the food...I mean just couldn't have enough food.
I think the guards -- the Lithuanian  whom  for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us.
So you got no food in th e trains  nobody fed you.
You know  we you had to stay in line for food  everything  but as a policeman  you know  you just pushed them on the side.
That I had as much food as I coul d possibly eat.
I remember as a child  I think the only time that I ever set food in a synagogue was for the wedding of a friend or a relative of my parents and apparently I scandalized everyone when in the middle of the ceremony I loudly said to my grandmother  \ Grandma  look at my beautiful brand new black patent leather shoes.\
that a food should -- And my ex-husband used to say that Im the best cook.
And– But they were not Jewish  were they  or– Yes  yes– & RG-50.549.05*0001 83 ... were... they were Jewish? ...
The first couple weeks was like [indecipherable] then the Gentile brought some potato  some food for my father  and he and I visit there.
Instinctively  you felt that you had much more chances outside the ghetto than inside  you know.
If I went out from the country  its nobodys business was religion I -- I accept -- if I dont eat this type of food or something  but this is nobodys business.
We -- At that time  we still had ration books in England and I remember people were always complaining about the rationing of food and -- and -- and to us  when I say to us  I mean in -- in the dormitory and so on  we always thought it wa s rather amusing  because we thought that th-this wasnt a shortage  this wasnt deprivation in any way.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually food at the beginning was pretty bad.
The rest they didnt tak -- they didnt take  because  see my father used to work brin-bringing in food  also.
When I came home with the goods that she gave me...and somebody helped me to carry it.
It was -- everybody knows it was the lack of food and vitamins.
Probably a food that they give to animals but...uh...you cannot die from it.
And all those things went through...her sister and her little baby and my mother giving the food and that minute everything went through my mind and I went into the silo and she saw that she did a mistake  and she came to the 02:02: door and she said  Maruska  come here.
We had no...no...uh...ration cards for clothing at all; only for food.
So they were like going out to the farms and exchanging food and buying and selling and whatever.
Also  as I mentioned before  food was rationed in Belgium  and because they were a family of three  mother  father and child  they would pick up food for a week in rations  and I was not listed there  because I was there illegally.
We were not religious people  maybe the reason was it wasn 't very easy in Paris in those years to buy kosher food.
We  we had such a small -- and you know -- a growing young person needs their food more probably than an older person and we didn't have that.
A lot of people of the free world don't believe it  so...because she was so good when my father would bring some food from the 01:37:30 Jordan brigade and first it was divided between the family.
What they did they kept you stark naked without any services or without any food.
We have all the food to eat  but you know  in six months we are next to to be cr emated  and th and th ey they knew about it.
Natural food  yeah  and I had to drink carrot juice and lots of fruits and the butter had to be special butter and the eggs had to be from yard  yard eggs  yard chickens who ran free and all these things.
Because the -- the food that came in wasnt as much  and everything was less and less and less.
We put furniture in there  we put food in the cabinet  put your beds up there.
So  there I was by myself and I c ouldn't move too much  but the English were starting to give us already at least food.
And some food was available for stealing because the kapos who in the past protected the supply of potatoes or cabbage was there  were no longer inside the camp  so there we were not knowing what to what is going to happen  and clearly I did not anticipate liberation.
But we were in Halifax  we -- they took on foo -- food  and oil.
They used to pay us  and they used to tell my mother  if shell be kind enough to make them food for breakfast  some for lunch and supper.
That I nearly prostituted myself  meaning that I did everything to get some food for my mother.
She took care of this old lady  and if someone was hungry she was able to give her food to that person  and you know  no one did that because the hunger was to such a degree  I mean  it's unbelievable to be able to be so hungry that you just didn't give what you had  you know  so she was able to be so good  and so  there were such people.
Male voice: \ We forgot to mention–it is do cumented that a portion of the money which was allotted by the French government for food never reac hed us because it was stolen before we ever got food for it.\ ]
My father went out with the children one.... some - food - looking for food.
Bury their food in hopes that one -- they could get out of there.
At least one of your grandparents was absolutely  if I'm correct  adamant that could not go on this journey without kosher food.
I-I-I believe major Tuthill was responsible for sending for hospitals  doctors  kitchens  food.
So really honestly I got food  but I was so terribly overtaken by what I've noti ced  what I've witnessed that I couldn't eat it.
And I brought money around too for one of the little girls that  and for this boy I just mentioned  14 year old boy  I brought money every month there  and food cards and stamps  so that they would have um  at least one loaf of bread you got a week  which deteriorated in quality.
We had been smelling the food that they had been making in their kitchen  the fresh br ead and everything.
And brought them food and let them do all sorts of things.
We supplied the food and we sent them over the customers that the people shouldn't go in like without anything  and I tell you this is the honest truth.
Also  he introduced processing of meat in sausages and things for food industry.
So -- so you were enjoying yourself in school  but the food situation was not very good  right?
It was a terrible problem  but no  we had very little to eat  that is--that was--a horrible thing.
But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another 22building and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to apartment which was all abandoned and th ere was no food nowhere.
And we would give him the food which was left over  but he never ate that  he had it in cans  and he waited until it became moldy and then he ate it.
The people there who ran the camp realized that they could steal all the food they wanted  the -- the people who managed the camp.
I had a hard time at first because I couldn't stand the food.
Is th -- the way  is I smell the food  thats how I thought that thats what probably did it.
And the most what I was connected with was -- was the -- the department wa -- where the food came through.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 15 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: were in the ghetto.
We didnt have a piece of bread  we didnt have anything to eat.
And there was freedom  you know  it was lot o f food.
When I got recuperated  the woman  by cooking all kinds of food.
Because the food situation really was bad and the strain and stress was really telling on the people.
While I was there eating and drinking...he he served me food and really he was very friendly.
There was even no way of getting the food  we were just too many of us into such a small space.
In order words  people that grew up in the city and so on  knew the natives  the Polish people  and in the city  they were able to sort of obtain other staples of food...of food and so on.
She visited us frequently and I remember often she brought us food even  that she had taken from her own not very generous rations.
We just grabbed some food  what was left from the deported Jews  and we went to the cellar.
Very strict and during the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to  you know  to share what food they had with everybody  including the Jewish girls  usually girls  who were hidden there.
I think so  and I knew people who really  tr uly suffered from hunger more than I. I used to dream about food.
There was food until the last day and then the food was over .
We -- we would -- everybody get a food stamp card each week  and these -- so many stamps for milk and so many for meat  etcetera.
I know he was 48 years old at that time and my mother would go every day to some place where many other people stood in line with food to bring their husbands  to whom exactly the same thing happened.
But by the time the food comes here  we're all dead.
And they directed to bring certain implements w ith you  and food and whatever.
Used to go to the market with her and we used to sell something  a little something  and we used to bring food in the camp for my mother and in no ti me  they told us to mo ve.
And so they passed by and he then wi -- with his friend  ran to find food or shelter  or whatever.
When the planes came we just hopped into some ditches  and I guess my parents had some money to buy food.
We had -- he -- his birthday was while we were there  so we went to a very fancy restaurant and we were much impressed with -- with the restaurant and with the food they served and with the service they had.
And  I felt so terrible for them  I felt like I had to do something to make  at least they shouldn't be hungry before they die  so I s--I made up my mind  I didn't te ll anybody  I had made up my mind to steal a bucket of boiled potatoes because we always cooked one day in advance  and I filled that bucket up with potatoes  and at night  I risked my life because I c ould have been shot  we're not supposed to be out of the barracks at night  after a certain hour  and I went into one of--I snuck in to one to  one of those barracks  and quietly I gave a potato to each inmate in the beginning of the uh bunks  as I came in  and uh  not realizing  I  I started a te rrible commotion because all of the sudden they found a potato in their hands  and so people started screaming  they wa-and ripping me apart  they wanted a potato because they hadn't had food for so long  and when I was almost half empty with the potato pail  the lights all of the sudden turned on  and the Block Eldester  which is the uh  the  I mentioned before  the uh  person in charge of that barrack.
He said  ﬁOkay  what else do you need?ﬂ I said that I need some food provision a little bit and so on.
You know  they didnt eat  we literally were scared not to eat  we throw it in the -- 42 in toilet  the food  somebody came and so toilet was blocked.
Cause they want the delicatessen  they know that the food will be that much better.
>> Sam Ponczak: They were forced to do it otherwise they couldn't get any food.
So going through that kind of  you know  typical stuff  looking for food from surrounding villages or peasants.
And to be h onest now  I could say I brought some food home from the truck  fish  cheese  eggs  I brought this home.
When you say the food was indescribable  uh I'm sure you mean it was delicious.
And I remember standing in the bread line  and I remember bringing a bread home  which was a wonderful thing  because we didn't have any real food as I told you for  probably about a week.
Was worst  because there wa s not only food  people are trying to be animal one to other.
And the owner of the apartment 12 told us that his two daughters went to work early that morning and locked the apartment with a padlock and they didn't have any food.
I smuggled the food there  and sometimes they gave me there.
That maybe some canned food came into these k itchens  I do not remember it but it is possible. [\
I got food  normal food with the army and normal...uh...barracks...yah?...with a normal bed  but we had to train with the...with the rest of the army.
For three days they Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 62werent given any food at all  and in prison they were pretty hungry already.
We stayed there  but he was afraid to feed us  to give us food  because Germans occupied the -- very soon  the -- Vinnitsa  and the -- where we lived  it was little bit like outskirts of -- of Vinnitsa  and there were sher -- vou -- where st -- where the military were stationed.
This woman had a garden outside the city  the old mu the mother of the young woman  and I had to and this one day I forgot all about my birthday  and I sh-she always gives me work  extra work and I said please hurry up  because Ill be late for the Russian kitchen  I have to get the food out.
The last 10 days  people like I--I'm not saying there were some peopl e who were still able to get around--I didn't get any food for close to 10 days  I rarely had water.
Oh boy  did we have fun  and the food was delicious.
So you had bread which was this thin  packed with this much of this potato salad laced with a little bit of chicken fat which had some taste to it  and that was a much better piece of food than whatever was floating in the vat.
Well  they came  you know  and they opened a food storage of Nazis.
So the offi cer told us that he will make a favor and permit the local farmers to come on a specific day of the week to give us -- to sell us food.
They said  ﬁHe went for a for to take the food  and he was eating the food by himself.ﬂ That was not true.
But we had a some kind of soup  I think  to we were fed  a little.
Just on education and English supplied the food and it was ok.
The only way to survive was to take our possessions  whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food.
So he was he came up with this story that if they do nothing  they will not survive  because the cold weather  the food  no food  nothing.
There were several kinds of berries growing and we began to pick these berries and eat them and stuff our mouths with them.
Now  if you didn't have rationing stamps  you couldn't buy food.
They had a big  they were taking inventory  and the work that I did  which permitted me to have that bunk  and and some  some  maybe a little more food  was precisely that ki nd of work.
Firs t of all  the the Gestapo said that in ghetto are people who are working hard and there are people who are working less  and people who don't work at all  so we'll know that the portions of food for those who are working is not enough.
And from Patawa I remember we were so hungry  we had no food and we went out and we bought a piece of herring  and we didn't s ee herring all the time from the war  and we ate with bread and then they told us they're sending us to near Mila no.
So we were taken to a farm  German farm  where the people had left already also.
And this kibbutz was built already under fire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...it was a very...it was a very excitable day because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth  girls making food  and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the Mountain of the...the Tree Mountain.
He was working a little bit there and we got food there  we got food from the partisans  that's what it was  actually the fo od was from the partisan s. I didn't work that time  nobody worked  actually.
But they were incorporated  and they were -- given food -- they were also buying food with their fares and with the fixed wage they brought.
The ow ner used to send us food and--I--let's say  like me  I worked in the kitchen.
Just hot water  but there was a place that cooked the food  you know  that cooked for the Nazis.
And we had all the foo d. I mean  there was so much food on this ship because they expected  I don't know  140 soldiers or so  and they never arrived.
We were k eenly aware that we were very much in the way  that we endangered the people we were hiding with  that there was not enough food.
It was like demanded what gave in the wilderness so we felt everything in the man because there was no food but it fell down from heaven.
They would take away their rifles  grenades  whatever ammunition they had on them  take away their clothing  leave them in their underwear  boots  of course  and sent them out.
He was a soldier  and they had like a -- well  a soldier girl from the Army  where they went for food and things  no  like a restaurant  and over there he met a girl  she was from Hungary  Jewish  and -- but he left  it was the +  so he went to Israel  and then she followed him  and he married her.
So  there was never any neither at his mothers house  or that Stanley ever had any food restrictions  or nothing.
And I brought food for him  I had food brough t for him  and juices that was brought to my cabin and everything.
We have cards  and I have number Interview with Sylvia Rosen November 20  2012 24nothing to eat  so you have to go out to look for food.
