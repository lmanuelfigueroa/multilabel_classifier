KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 29 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: before the Germans came.
We were  at that time  reunited with my grandfather  who had survived in Siberia  and he came ba and my aunt  my mothers olde r sister  and we all lived together at the same time  in the same place.
At that time I did not know how many of [my] family survived.
And your mother  did she work or was she at home?
She survived  I know about that  and she is in Israel.
A few days later  I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine  as a matter of fact  and then his brother  describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive.
And while its not -- the numbers are not quite precise  they range between 100 000 and 150  000 who survived out of that total  who were in Poland when the war began.
He survived  his wife and two children were killed and by pure accident he found and I don't know again  know how  th rough the Red Cross I think again.
We were very unique  and I cherish that in my in my head  I I could not believe that as a family unit we survived  you know?
And the man  among the racks and racks of documents found my name  and my grandmothers name  wrote down for me what transport I was on  how many were on the transport  and how many survived.
And -- after the war  he still came to New York to visit them.
Meanwhile you probably didnt know what happene d to the rest of your family  who survived and who didnt?
So she told my mother when my mother returned  where I was.
Conditions varied in each occupied country but the efforts to help Jews in Belgium contributed to better than 50% chance of survival compared to Holland where less than 25% survived and Poland where less than 10% survived.
Half of my family in Israel  whoever survi ved -- whoever has survived is in Israel.
And if I did ha ve one  I would have been pregnant when they arrested us and I probably woul dn't have survived anyway and th e baby definitely wouldn't have been alive today.
You were saying that  for those of you who survived camps  life afterwards  you handled it differently than other people?
From the town  I survived  my sisternot from the surrounding placesand Daniel  who was the Minister Foreign Affair in Poland  and that's it.
01:25:24 By the way  her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland ]  in Israel.
I told her  I never made secret of it  how I survived the war  and -- but nothing that -- the gross details.
And the Russians were already there in October  so if we would have stayed -- hide ourselves for six mont hs we could have survived  but we didnt know where we were going.
These are wonderful memories of that the house  as storied during the war  how it survived and didnt and so on.
And one cousin I do not know where she knows this from  but I had a cousin who survived in Vienna because she was married to a Jew  but he was racially only half a Je w  so she somehow  she   and from her I know that her mother was brought  perished in Lublin   she said.
But my aunts and my -- both uncles  two aunts and two uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
So  possibly  if she had known some of us had survived  she maybe too  could have survived.
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: My sister had her doll that was given to us in 1940  and it survived up to this day.
And since this survived the the the total Interview with Jerzy May 8  2013 71 destruction of Warsaw  is a miracle.
Those who survived  they had nothing  there was no reason for them to stay.
So this is suspicious  how you survived  right  the Germans had the order of killing Jews whenever they found them and children too  so here I tell the real story  I must tell you  I never learn how to lie  I' m very bad at it  so how did it happen and I had to tell them the truth  that the German cam e into the hiding  dragged the parents  killed Edwarda Rorat 32 February 25  1996 Page 32 them and looked at me  thought I was pretty and they didn't kill me  so that sounds too naive and too ridiculous  they didn't believe it  right ?
And all  I think its 22 eventually  all 22  because I read about it from the unirat   went to Auschwitz and two survived from the 22.
And the lives of  of people who survived in that camp un til April 20  most of them were extinguished on May third by the British by mistake.
He said in Polish  how come I survived  why did I come back.
To this day  I'm still looking for my parents and my sister  none of them survived.
And how that came about  I I dont remem I I dont know how she even survived that.
And  maybe another week  I would have been gone  and I would have never survived it.
Oh  there was also a -- a document which has survived  asking my father to bring back some kind of salamis or something from -- from the United States  I guess  I dont know  but there was -- there was a -- a request for  you know  send -- send food back to Lithuania  so -- from -- from a Japanese diplomat.
Can you  can you describe for us briefly  what happened to you wh en liberation came?
In some ways I think it was a relief  because you know  when two survivors get together  the only thing they talk about  what they went through and what they survived.
On my fathers side  his brother survived  because he went into Russia with the Red Army.
In other words  I survived  I made it  Im healthy  both physically and ment ally.
But anyway  we were able to march into the ghetto and everybody was able to...everybody survived at that point and uh we did march into the ghetto.
In my case  my parents decided that  as a form of insurance so that if one person might be taken  deported  at least -- killed  at least the others who survived would have a chance  so they decided that the family ought to split up.
The train that I was in  if 20 people survived the journey  it was a lot.
And he was like 16 like I was and he survived  you know.
And it was -- the -- the war -- when -- is -- was over in March 23  and I thought  I wonder if he come -- come here  or the -- it -- if he survived  and things  you know  and I ke ep thinking about it  you know  if he made it  you know  over there in concentration camp.
And there was an aisle in the middle of each barrack and as -- as we entered on the first barrack that we entered  there were still people in th-their area  these were some that had survived  obviously.
No  no  I mean  thats logi -- that -- you know   they did not survive  because if they would have survived  they would have come bac k. And this was -- you know  this was their arrangement  whoever comes back  goes back.
We survived this because what happened is that a Jewish policeman was there  they were helping the the Germans.
They all were married  had children  and for the -- the two cousin s  one cousin my fathers brothers son  and they -- my fathers sisters daughter were the only two other of the family that acta -- that s -- that survived of my fathers family.
Her -- she had one brother  who is still alive and he and his wife also survived  separately from us  but are st-still alive  although theyve lost their son who was born in Santa Domingo  and theres a story there  too.
One of the e -- es -- asides I want to say  one of the things that always fascinated me is in the forest my grandmother was with us  but she was a kosher and a very observant woman  is how she survived the war never eating anything un-kosher just amazed me.
I just didnt know where I was  what I was doing and I was planning to -- to look for my family  if anybody -- and -- and I figured that if anybody survived  theyll go back home.
And they all had the children  and they were my cousins  and my aunts.
I stood behind the cauldron with the steam  so that you saw me all burning up  but of course I could have been burning up from the steam from the cauldr on  from the laundry and this is how I -- I -- I survived typhus selection.
But both he and my mother  separately  survived the death marches after the Interview with Harry Gelb December 13  2001 34evacuation of Auschwitz in January and then February and then March of 1945.
I felt -- first of all  the family said  when we saw that we are doomed  that if someone survived  some -- th at one should speak.
My older sister and my brother-in-law  they came and my mother came later.

Well  we intended that because Leoni had an a unt in Athens that survived  and she had a big house  and she told us you stay with me  well st ay together.
There are maybe only five or six men of the 150 that survived.
Those that were...few that survived  and others that were hidden during the war  were now decided also to leave Europe.
And uh as far as I can again trace it  my father survived there and went to Auschwitz.

They took them on the train  her mother hanged hersel f  and the father survived.

I do not live with the guilt that I survived and others did not.
They did not ask one of the inmates to move up to shake up the straw or the sawdust  but German themselves di d it  the Gestapo  the SS  and here the high ranking officers with strong flashlights  one had and the pistol in the other hand  to be sure that nobody stays on  and it was by the greatest miracle  that I survived.

And only about three years ago we had a reunion where I invited all the kids who survived from Bad Nauheim  and he was there  Max Bettman.
My -- Luckily  my grandparents  and my uncles also survived the war.
Oh  I left Sweden because a brother of mine survived in Germany  and he married there a girl that he knows from home.
And he was the one that send me pape rs to come  and my papers were made out not only for me  they were made out whoever is with me  because my uncle figured that if I survived  maybe there was somebody else that survived.
I said to him  I have to meet my family if somebody survived in Germany   I have to go there.
And it's lucky because we survived  but we survived  too  with so much hope.
to another  and finally to his actual  we found his own girlfriend  who had survived the war.
She came on the train in Auschwitz -- to Auschwitz  and she was -- she had a baby in her arm.
Well  what kind happiness  I mean Hitler would turn over in his grave  saying I survived that  and I  we create a new family  and a new generation with love and affection and good people  and we came here with nothing.
They took people that could -- they were trained in certain things and they  it was  that's why I think I survived  because I always worked.
So majority  people who survived went to Palestine  later to Israel.
I don't really remember most of the children here in this picture so I can't tell you who survived and who didn't for sure.
She never survived because in the ghetto very many people died.
The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the camps.
Fortunately  he survived  but he had many stories to tell too  as I recall  after that  because he met such strange and different people  and of course was awful  awful.
And at that moment  the only thing I could th ink of is  I survived the Nazis and now I end up like this.
He was later found by his father who survived the war.
And most of those  the ten percent who survived  mostly survived in the USSR Because there were no ghettos.
Dont be lieve that anybody will tell you -- any of the survivors will tell you that they were smart  thats the reason they survived.
No  we dont talk too much about -- sometimes you know  I dont care to listen to how they -- what happened to them and how they survived.
end of side one  tape 2] Did that bring you closer?
My cousins in Holland and  and their parent s  my father's brother and his sister-in-law and their two children  survived the war in a similar fashion than we did.
No  the only impression I have is a very nega tive one  is from the same religious people who believed that G-d will help them but did not see that so much more will be achieved if at least some of us survived to have children and so fo rth.
There were some of us wh o survived all by them selves.
And she survived  because her parents  when they saw whats happening  they put her in a factory  like GE.
And survived and it was only two of us who did that.
Here they found a sist er  here they found a brother after not knowing that they survived  because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world  to Australia or to New Zealand and to Africa and wherever you want  you have everywhere people in the world.
So they both survived because I placed them in a safe place.
And she had gone to a Holocaust s urvivors childrens group in New York for a while and she told me one day that mom  they all have the same experience with their parents and their grandparents who survived the Holocaust.
I didnt know much -- too many British officer songs anyway  but I -- I survived somehow and I played a little bit.
And while chronologically I was 10  I survived for a few years by the wit  and a certain street smartness.
And many of them  by the way  were able  because they were on the Russian front  able to either escape or were captured by the Russians.
And th -the -- in that theres a story  because my fathers pants  with -- the ones that he was wearing when they fled were part of a -- a temporary exhibit at the Holocaust Museum some years ago on a group of about 2200 Polish Jews who fled   who were able to reach Japan  and many of whom  not all  but many of whom survived because of that.
Even that one I was running  if not that I knew that the partisans were around I wouldn't have survived  never.
I do not believe that anyone that survived this holocaust had any 36 desire for revenge at least not from those people who survived the war in the form in which we survived it.
When my husband told them that hes a mechanic  and hes working  [Pause] -- When he told him that hes a mechanic  he told hi m to go right  so my parents survived  and we survived.

They were an organization that was a centrist Zionist organization ; and their job was collect the orphans that survived  educat e them and smuggle them  literally  to Israel because there was no way that th e Jews were permitted  (chuckle) those who survived  were permitted to go their own land Israel.
But had my mother not had a headache  you know  he would have been taken and if he had been taken  I doubt very much if any of the rest of us would have survived.
So when somebody came into the camp with the food  I say you stay here today  I give them something and I took the food  and I wanted to see if she survived.
He survived the bombing of Hamburg  which was pretty severe and did hit some of the camps.
I interviewed someone called Susie Schwartz  and she spoke of the -- her wish that thered -- were another grou -- term for survi vor  just because she -- she felt that she had been in hiding in a farm building in Holland  and her problem was simply with the fact that the -- the common stereotype  or presumption is that survivors survived Auschwitz  when in fact there are many different -- Yeah. --
So  I think Lori knew after that that I had survived but she never asked me anything.
I remember a young woman  perhaps in her early 20s  from Yugoslavia  who had survived with her parents  and they had gone through hell  and she had ch -- tuberculosis  and died  very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it  I can still paint her face.
And he did succeeded  went east on his own  crossed the front line  reached the Russians line  and became a soldie r. And for the entire war in the Russian army  all the way to Germany  survived.
Because he survived in Russia and his wife saved his life.
Had I known that no one is alive from my family  I probably wouldn't have fought to live.
So he had the easier rap -- rapport with the people -- with our school friends  and he saw some of them and -- and he found out that some died during the war  were killed during the war and other survived and they just make a bare living  whic h I dont really care about the ones who survived  truthfully  as far as Im concerned  even thou gh I didn't have any bad experiences during our time in school  they were -- they were fine.
The ones who survived  I came back to the barracks  we came back to the barracks  and I kept on my brother was sleeping in the bunk bed next to mine.
In fact   there was some ghetto  it was not as large a ghetto.
I mean  if you were to find someone whod survived Cambodia  or Rwanda or any othe r sort of mass slaughter of people  do you think it would be the same  or is there something unique?
They survived  and I survived  as a locksmith  but not in the same place.
So his physical was not ba d. What others who survived  they came out  theyre like skeletons.
I don't know how to define the fact that we survived but that it was really random luck  like when you scatter something on the ground and you pick it up something will happen to stay there.
So when you say the return back to believe was easy perhaps at once  but you felt something is missing in our life that we survived.
Yes  first thing I say I am Jew and I am  you know -- I'm very proud of it.
So I immediately was able to get in touc h with my cousin Harold Brenner that lived  that was still survived in deep in the Soviet Union.
At the end -- this was -- they were very brave because the children were very small and they knew what waited for them if the Germans came so they -- so they left with the Russian Army and they also survived.

This is a photograph  when I meet my sister w ith her family after 18 years of separations  and this old woman is Mrs. Borkovska  who saved the life during the Holo caust from my nephew Gregory  my sister Rivas son  and she hold hi m during a couple of years during the German occupation  and he survived the war  and he lives in Princeton.
And I just  I was very happy that I survived it.
He was from my neighborhood who seven and one survived because he pretended he is dead.
But they came into Paris  they wanted to do something and we -- we -- we had to do something -- whatever we could  even if we didnt have supplies  so I organized this team of the Hightowns and Ruth Lambert  who was a French  Jewish nurse and Holtzer  Leon Holtzer  who was a Polish Jew  who had survived and was living in Paris.
She survived the war and the boy went to pales -- to Israel  and she went with him to Israel.
I studied photography with a friend of my mothers  who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my head  even though I didnt even know it.
But anyway  for whatever reasons  he walked  turned around and walked away  we survived that day.
And my father and my mom and I came to the United States along with his brother  the one who went to England with him who survived.
And I always felt that they were lucky because they probably survived easier than we did.
>> Bill Benson : And somehow or another  for a while  you were safe and able to do that.
You know...its....but that's...and I lived in Denmark until l9...uh....let me see....I lived til 1948 and in 48  I...well  we found out in Denmark that my brother had survived Dachau and then he sent for me  and I came to Canada.
You know  we -- when we were separated  we made sort of a pact that if we survived and could get back to the home town where we came from  we would meet there  but I never had a chance to go back.
But in those days I only thou ght of the one which is survived.
I was  I was  really this was  I dont know how I survived.
But anyway  I have survived and I'm not in bad shape as far as mentally.
And I have to tell her I survived and they didnt.
I mean  as much as my life was difficult and I saw lots of horrors  and -- and went through a lot of hunger  and everything else  but the fact that I was not in the concentration camp s  I always say Im lucky  and I really look up to those people from concentration camp that -- that survived  which is truly a -- an unbelievable miracle.
My cousin  curiously enough  could have survived  but again  she principle was used to get her  and this time it got her  too.
And she said if my parents survived  don't tell them how I died. (
But here again  I wanted to live  and I survived that too.
The Kl as-mas music has not survived  the type of pain when I hear  its not good  it s not authentic enough for me.
Do you find you are more comfortable among other people who survived the war than those who werent or did not experience it?
Uh and uh I came down with typhus...not...typhus was on a different level from the yellow jaundice because many of those morning corpses were corpses not...some from starvation and and many many from typhus  so typhus was a disease that gave you very high fever and it had a crisis period and if you made it through the crisis you survived and if you didn't make it  you didn't survive  and I uh got typhus in uh March of 1944 and uh and on the day that I was able to walk again  afterward two weeks of lying with typhus...in those two week  in that two week period heading towards uh was heading towards the end of the war  we uh began to hear bombardments very close by.
And they survived in the apartment where -- where we lived.
03:39:01 I wrote him down for better and for worse and he wrote me down forever yours  and the two rings survived  yeah.
And he survived the Auschwitz and I think Dachau - Anita Frank 81 [Date not labeled] Page 81 Bookenvalt and he says  ﬁI didnt survive.ﬂ And I totally understand that.
So one of my aunts always sa id we survived the war because you were too poor to be of interest for anybody.
I found a cousin that survived; and uh we both decided that we are going to leave from there forever  and not...not make it our home anymore.
And I heard this is just what I said  I heard that only about 11 1800 or 2800 survived and all the rest of them died on the way.
Did you ever try to find any other friends or relatives after the war that might have survived?
His name was Be-ep Shek [ph] and he survived and he went to Israel and he became an am -- I think he was ambassador or something to France.
We survived the war and now we get killed after the war?
As it happens  my father has a ve ry close associate  a fr -- an old -- an old friend who was from -- from Warsaw  Jewish doctor  a woman who survived the war  whose parents did not.
It must have been a terrible shock to arrive and be suddenly separated from everyone you knew and yet somehow  somehow you survived that.
And I survived  and then with better food  you [indecipherable] hoping -- do you know that my friends from Bratislava  from my city -- a gir -- I had a girlfriend who was half Jewish.
So I just had to survive  which I had learned  you know  to survive.
A portion of them who survived   returned to Sialishky and ordered us to leave our buildings because the Soviet army was going to occupy them.
So we said good -bye to our friends  none of whom survived  unfortunately.
And the sons all run away to Russia  and they survived in Russia.
She survived Majdanek with a group of other girls  each one were and I told her to bring others here  I would have all fed them.
24 >> Bill Benson: Did you have any other family I think who survived and went to other countries.
It was so hard for them to believe that Jews had survived as Jews without being taken prisoner or had come to help them.
When the war was over  how many Jewish children did we find?
So  wh atever I found out about my mother was much later  when I connected with my mothers sister  who survived.
The adults at the time they were deciding to go underground made this agreement  that whoever survived would take in the children who  God willing  survived.
But he did  and so immediately after the war  a law came out in Poland that if there is a parent and there is a child that survived  they have to be united.
Because how well the children survived and ho w they actually got through these times.
And of course we did not l 13 -- we didnt look Jewish.
Zdena and Buschi and I wo rked outdoors in transport  and the other girls worked in the factory and I dont think that we three could have survived without the girls in the factory  because they stole flax and -- and yarn  and we made warmers to put in our wooden clogs  on our head  and chest warmers  and I think that was a horrible winter in those mountains  and I dont think we could have survived.
Of course  nothing  uh  nothing survived because German  before they retreated  they destroyed everything.
I mean the -- if you look in retrospect   there are people who survived Auschwitz.
And we  as Jews  especially those of us who survived  have a responsibility  we have a duty  if nothing else  to speak up.
But this was already late  in 1965  64  that two ladies died  one survived  and FDA in Detroit is investigating this case.
So anyway  he survived and then was sent to I dont know if he was sent to another camp like Dachau  before Friedlander.
So my father survived and they were also  he had some access to the kitchen as a help.
And it is a little bit late for me to start searching because  even if my brother survived  he would be 72 years old.
In the meantime  they discovered that Mrs. Feigenbergs deported parents survived Siberia and are on the way back to Poland to join them.
None of the people who -- none of my friends  none of the Jewish families survived.
The boy survived the camp with the  with th e parents  by miracle  and again  I have to say  thanks to Oscar Schindler  because when Oscar Schindler was making the list  he wants to have the musician with them so he put the musician name  and Oleg  in this time Oleg was almost ten years old  you understand?
We didnt really know too much in the beginning  who survived  who didnt survive?
I thought you had said that he had survived the war.
We didnt ask how we survived  but I remember my brothers holding my hands  so I didnt even get to my parents and my brothers were just four and se ven  or something  or three.
She survived in Russia  she was one of the sisters of my father.
We had a bookkeeper who survived the war  we had my brother-in-law  my older sisters  her husband later joined and he had the pr esentation of chandeliers and enamel bath tubs.
I actually was hoping that my brother Hershlite Feingarten  whom we called Lolec  survived.
>> Bill Benson: And if I remember right  you could be accused of being a spy for the Russians.
Then after the word came to us that all the Jews that survived are going to gather in some place in the town and so we all went there and there was about 350 of us.
>> Peter Gorog: Well  what we know about them for those who survived and eyewitnesses and documents  they had very hard lives.
And isnt much worth it  you know  so how my life gonna be  and things  and then I was thinking  my God  Julian not go nna -- he not -- he didnt survived  he didn't make it  but how I can get in touch with his mother  because I know his mother loved him so much  and he was very close with his mother  that Id want to let her know that he was not a criminal  that he was a good man  and that he lost his life because he loved me.
HENNY GURKO: Everybody was trying to find out whether somebody survived because we were so um  you know we were like away from our hometown  and people were from all over Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
And they called us out and told us to line up  and she says that I stood - she put the mother between me and her - her mother was a tiny little woman; we were both taller than the mother and we held on to her and they passed by and didnt notice and she survived.
Well  this one brother who was in the Polish army  was Zachary   I heard -- one of my cousins  the one that helped me the bleeding in the camp  she survived  Ida.
And the last -- youre the last [indecipherable] Actually  the last -- I -- I hear now that some people survived  they were hidden.
And they...uh...whoever  during the war...uh...before the war  three of them went to Israel and they survived the war and two went to the United States before the war  they survived the war  and one went to Argentina.
She was not in a camp  my wife  she survived as an Aryan  as a Polish Catholic.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 >> Susan Snyder: Essentially you're saying that the Nazis would dictate and force the head of the committee or this commite t to carry out their orders essentially in the ghetto.
I know that what Ive gone through doesnt begin to tell a whole story  doesnt begin to compare to so many thousands but I have survived the millions that were killed.
I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog.

And w-we couldnt believe we survived it  or that my father survived it.
Tried to be neut ral  you know  and th -th-they e taking sides  they couldnt have survived  beca use they would also  you know  provoke a lot of hostility.
Many of those survived and they escaped concentration camp and camps.
And  and the reason we survived the war was not because my parents had any money but my  my aunt and uncle in  in Ossin  my fathers sister and her husband who had been very close to my parents.
And our tracing office  run by Larry Lebetsky  this survivor  found a relative in 9 Chicago I think  who -- these were relatives of course  who were delighted to find that this Herman Cohen had survived and the -- but we didnt have his full name  we just had Cohen  I think and we -- Larry put up a notice in the DP camp  on the DP camp bulletin board  saying  ﬁSo and so  will you come into our office  we have located your relative in Chicago.ﬂ And after awhile a person came in and said  ﬁThis is my name and I have relatives in Chicago and Im delighted that you -- you -- youve -- you know them  but how did you know I was looking for them?ﬂ And we said  ﬁSomebody with your name was just here a month ago.ﬂ He said  ﬁThat must be my brother.ﬂ That other person had already left the DP camp and was wandering around Germany to find -- try to find his relatives.
I said  \ Yes  I have it because my has a basket which is full of family pictures in a container and that also survived during the war  interestingly enough  and I can cut out some of the photographs.
Her daughter was married with two small children  my aunt  my mother's sister.
I never forget that I also was caring  and to help people  and if somebody wouldnt have taken me and -- and -- and thrown me back  then I would have not survived  and so on.

Does even having survived it make it difficult to seek help  for instance for depression?
My father has said if it weren't for my mother and her courage we would never have survived the war  because she again and again and again  she would be the one who who said to my father  you know  it's going to work out and she would she would take on the police who came to the house and questioned them and interrogated them  cause see from their perspective they were interrogated many times about who they were and what they were doing.

There were people who were depressed  very understandably  when you found you had a young man who had seen his parents and brothers taken off and some policeman or another had pushed him to the side because they had known each other on the street  and saved him and he found our none of his family had survived.
Th ey struggled but they survived and we were left in the Pyrenees by ourselves with my moth er.
And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation  wait a second  thats w hy they survived.
Well  then it occurred to me that I was very fortunate.
When the day went by  whoever survived they made believe that this would be already the end of it  that they w ouldn't take any more people.
Halina  her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifyin g the family as Catholics.
It was in the middle of the ghetto  the big ghetto.
He survived the war at   which it was a trap for Jews mainly  and that's where he survived.
And had to go through the concentration camp  and only my cousin Mimi  who -- And even she survived. --
>> Bill Benson: Agi  tell us  did other members of your family survive?
He took out the other guy and killed him  and he survived all the way.
But my mother had a very big family and nobody survived.
There were hiding places under the houses yes and many people survived in those hiding places.
And I also want to say that I think I survived because I was 17 or you know  by that time 19.
07:20:00 To have survived to show the world how such a thing could happen  so that it does not happen again.
Obviously I survived because the body cured itself and I was healthy from that point on.
Urban families who so -- survived the war  or came pre-war  so it was not coming into middle America.
Oh yes  I had quite a few cousins  which none of them survived  uncles or aunts or cousins.
Firstly  for them it was very difficult  especially since they had gone in sometimes as a family a father and two sons  and this was the only son who survived  and purely by the grace of God  no other reason.
I'm sure there were many children in Germany who died because of the Holocaust.
And survivors  I think  like to tell their stories   and display their own (if you will) courage or whatever it t ook to do.
If he'd be assassinated  thousands maybe millions of people would  would uh have survived the war and other things  but this  this was not to happen to happen.
My mother  yes she had lost her whole family  which by the way  she didn't know yet at that point  because people didnt know until a few years after if people had survived the war.
inaudible] This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak  this is tape number two  side B. So  y-you were saying you didn't -- you don't know the exact names -- No  yeah but -- but it -- towards the -- towards the end  when they would take either on marches  you know  they would take on death march or -- and whoever survived the death march  survived it an-and who didn't -- if -- if you couldn't walk  then they -- then they shot you.
I immediately found somebody that knew my sister that ca me from the town rejoining me  Slovaki and he was able to send a telegram to my gra ndmother in America and my aunt and uncle and my aunts and that I su rvived and my father survived.
Why my parents didnt leave  I will never know  but they were not alone  I mean  there were possibly a hundred thousand Jews in-in -- in Germany  maybe even more  who stayed in Germany.
As you will hear shortly  Morris survived several Nazi camps  then after a six -week forced March he arrived in the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.
But I did survive  but I didn't survive to fail him; I survived to go on  and I will go on like that.
I met a women there who was in this camp  but sh e survived somehow.
My father  by the way  was the youngest of six or seven  I for -- forget  two of whom survived the war  besides my father  but did not escape  they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in Germany  two sisters.
If he would have come with us he might have been survived.
Uh some two hundr ed  hundred eighty or two hundred Jews who whose hiding place were not found  were uh were uh survived.
Wh en I was laying there already in the cold house and I begin to think my life the way I survived.
So being in ghetto in Tarczyn a lot of people got...the poor got poorer  and the rich ones survived.
It was a place a lot of survivors that came from different cities.
Again lucky that I was strong enough  we survived - you know  there wasn't any penicillin and uh so on.
Once you survived  once you're there  once you worked  it was not worst.
Of that whole group only two survived  and I'm still friendly with them.
And there was some kind of rabbi  all USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 66was hut in there amongst them who survived.
I suppose I remember this even though it was a Jewish school  rather than a part of a regular school.
My mother was the only lucky one  and she doesnt feel lucky in having survived.
>> Bill Benson: And were able to stay at that point?
So naturally some book are not so important  they are not -- but still  its an important thing  because this is written by a survivor  and if he survived  it is important. [
Six million Jewish people and children killed  and plus five  I think or six others  for other reasons that were killed.
I dont know how my family survived  because of me  because I was such a young baby.
And that survived with me all the way until we left Auschwitz.
I said  do esnt matter what it does  I said  there are -- there were families  you know  that not one member of them survived.
So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what she told me  they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work  some remedy that they found  and I survived.
I told them that from the whole town only nine people survived and I told them who and I told them that Rozia didnt survive.
A lot of the Russians were sent back  as you probably know  and I dont think a lot of them lasted.
Yes  and then at the end of the war did you think y our father was still alive?
In every town  there was a big ghetto  and later made it a small ghetto.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 36 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: toes were not getting numbers because from the very first beginning  when the ghettoes were created with intention of being liquidated as quickly as possible so they didnt even register us by name  but  uh  how I survived is also a miracle.
Okay  now  after the war  when I was come back home  I found everybody survive.
And one sister  Magda and I  who survived the  survived the Holocaust.
My mother  my sisters and my brothers...you know  and we survived.
As a matter of fact his brother in Germany  one brother survived from that ﬁMoisha Wexelman ﬂ (?).
My nature is very strong  and I feel that has to do a lot why I survived and others didn't because let's face it  not everybody died in the gas chamber  not everybody died from bullets  not everybody died from beaten up  or from hunger.
But some teachers that survived  they used to participate in that underground schooling.
Well  when after the war  when only my brothe r and I survived  she was real upset when we told her were going to try and go to America.
They were very  very important Jews that I met in my life  which some of them survived.
I  in turn  knew his address and through a British soldier that came back to the Czech army  a friend of my brothers  through him  thr ough the British army  through London  through his mother  I was able to send a wire to New York  to let him know that I survived.
They knew that whoever survived this uprising would want to escape because there was nothing el se left there.
See  if somebody survived in a camp  he couldn't do anything.
When I walked in and I see Jewish people...they were  you know  personally and he survived.
I survived without medication  without food  and if this wasnt bad enough  while constantly the number of inmates were getting smaller  they were always cutting the fences smaller  so consequently we wouldnt have a little bit more room for ourselves.
And by that time we knew that in Berlin there were armies of all the allies and we better get there as a first stop and then see if we could go back to our respective homes  to hope to meet our survivors -- our family who survived.
And I know that there is  well first of all  my father wo uld be 100 years old  so th at wouldn't be possible  of course  but I know that he did not  nobody survived from th at transport.
And they started to get lists of people who survived the war  to be able to match them up with children that were collected in the -- in -- from camps.
But what I'm saying is the condition s in Bergen -Belsen were horrible but terrible in the sense that we survived.
They avoid it because they don't want to take responsibility for their survival  and it took my great many years in  in analysis to recognize that I survived uh thanks not only to the help of others  but thanks to my own activities  which makes me responsible for my survival.
And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department  and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the ghetto  even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them  which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the ghetto  in 1942  that ghetto would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived.
We did find that my uncle  my fathers brother survived Auschwitz.
I mean only two of all of them  and they survived  both.
We  of course  wrote furiously to those who survived the initial deportations to come to the zone in...in whatever way possible.
There were my family and my aunt with two children and my grandfather and grandmother.
And also my father was there and there were -- and -- and an aunt of my mothers who was still alive  who had survived in the most horrifying manner.
I think that this thanks to lend and lease and the...of course the resistance of the Brit ish people that they survived  and with this survival  four hundred thousand Jews in Britain have been saved from the invasion of of the Nazis and would have been victims.
They are not anxious to see  they are not interested to -- to see somebody an-and -- and cheer up those people  to know we are here for you  I'm glad you survived?
I although even my friends even now  when I talk with my c-class Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 115friends  cannot accept that fact  somehow say  well  maybe she s-somehow survived  but there is no chance.
My other documents were -- we re lost and destroyed  but this survived.
And Ill tell you  thousands of thousands of Jewish children survived and they are in [indecipherable] family  they dont know that they are Jewish.
I dont remember the name of my -- of my friend  but my brothers name is James Bachner and I happened to meet him in Dachau   af-after I survived the Death March out of Auschwitz in January 1945.
If they find out  they find out  but the chance that I survive if the plan survived is better than if I say and complain about him.
A. About the whole thing how we survived and what we did and he should look after Wallenberg if he meets him  but I said Wallenberg isn't there yet.
Right ‚t il now  I dont know how I survived  but I know what for.
My brother and I and two brothers who were also from the village  and they survived.
He was there and I think  I  this is probably much better written than in my memory  I think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and what happened was when  when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back  The Germans decided to march them back toward Germany and in  in what is northern  what was northern Yugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918  was southern Hungary  they set up these slaughterhouses  where those who survived the concentration camp were killed and my father was in the last six t housand being marched and they were captured by Titos partisans.
And and survived that that that few months there  and then came back  one of the first  and stood in front of the building.
I think we went with a little bit of stuff and we went to the place where we were into hiding  went into hiding.
>> I visited the synagogue in Budapest  downtown  beautiful  giant synagogue.
By the way he was from Czechoslovakia  he survived the war.
>> Bill Benson: And that was how basically you survived  by doing that.
And he -- he remained there through the liberation  survived the liberation by the Americans  and -- but was much too weak  contracted -- well  what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in Ebensee and still without having been able to establish contact with us  two months after the war  on July 25th  1945.
I just happened  we went and we came to the right place at the right time  and that is really what I'm thinking  it's not  not I was smarter than other people that survived.
Theres one thing Id like to ask you about which is youre with all these other students and people who have survived you living in that kind of big barracks or dorm or whatever you want to call it.
and you know  wondering if you woul d have survived if you hadnt got out.
But we survived  and that is already a little luck  right?
And some of them didnt want to come back  and they stayed in Israel.
I was with a group of young people  we wer -- we survived the war intact.
And he said  ﬁYou have to go -- to come ﬂ -- this was also before Christmas  ﬁyou have to come and meet my wife  and tell -- tell her.ﬂ And I still remember she asked me else  ﬁWhat would have been if you had met at that time?ﬂ And I told her  ﬁI dont know if I 32 would have survived  but your husband would have been dead.ﬂ I said  ﬁBecause every German who approached the place where we were sitting  we kept him on our -- nothing -- he would have been dead.
In Italy the Jews were treated very well  and 80 percent of Jews in ta -- in Italy survived.
One of the ways you survived was by contact through the Museum.
The others survived  as I say  in wonderful  mixed ways  and I You know  when youre this kind of outcome  there are lots of questions  and I understand youve got a book that is in the in the working  and I  you know  its whetting my appetite for it.
So I was never really very skinny because I utilized my fat and I was taught sparingl y so I survived the typhus very well.
I survived that b ecause they took me and I did the sewing with those.
There are people who never did it  and survived  but it just depended how much they they trusted the system  or they needed to eat.
And of course there -- there were then also a number of Jews who had returned  or some of them actually had survived in Berlin as -- as mixed -- children of mixed marriages.
Of course  there was still  and I think now thinking back of tha to that peri od  and Ive done this for some time now  there was always that  why did they have to die and I I survived?
I -- I dont -- I dont believe that I suffered more than somebody who survived Mauthausen and Dachau.
One went with the Palestine transport to Palestine and they lost their only so n and one other sister who went into hiding lost their only son and one sister and brother-in-law survived in hi ding with their two children who are now living in Australia and the United States.
Halina  her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifying the family as Catholics.
They used to call it cannon fodder  cause we came there totally inexperienced  and the people who who still were the 45th or 36th  or third divisions   which would have three divisions that were const by the Fifth Army  cons were part of the I mean  they were the Fifth Army  where all the people that survived  you know  combat wounds or death were extraordinary lucky  or they were skillful.
In charge of this little hospital was a Dr. Kaplan who survived and you must understand that at that time my hair was covering naturally my wound.
And then Jews become successful there  theyre being killed because they did.
The truck just took off and they uh they beat her down to the ground  my mother and uh could do nothing and uh I can imagine uh after the war for all these years to have to live with such memories  what it means to uh to or to my father for that matter  that he couldn't uh that he couldn't protect my brother and that the uh guilt feeling  uh him feeling that uh he had uh taken my brother with him rather than having sent him with me uh and that in turn may make him feel guilty if uh if I was able to survive and uh if he had let my older brother go together with me that he maybe he would have survived too.
My cousin Shay was in Romania and she survived also with her four children and her husband.
And I remember on Friday nights for the Sabbath that my mother covered empty pots on the stove so we don't show anybody that we have nothing to eat  and that we have nothing to cook with  but all in all  my grandmother was making her popcorn and she then she moved in with us  and somehow we survived that part too.
And I dont know how he survived  because he was Jewish.
There were a whole bunch of cousin s of my father's that I didn't really know very well and I don't think th at any of them survived .
Dont dont kill  dont shoot  dont and he would make a he would talk to them and and they never di d  obviously  otherwise we wouldnt have survived.
Two young men survived the labor  the slave labor camps - young  strong men.
And the way my father survived was that before the ghetto closed in July  I believe -- in June  I believe  in 1943  when the ghetto was closed  just before it closed  my father arranged with a Polish vegetable gardener to be hidden.
I survived because they did take me out from e ven Bergen -Belsen  and I told them this at this seder  I said \ With all of the food we 19 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD have  to talk about something like this  it's almost unbelievable what a different -- you know  you found yourself in a different place.\
But he did have in his will  he left for all of the children who survived  for all those  some money.
But -- and Jewish people in Poland  I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 57think there was about three and a half -- three and a half million Jewish people in Poland  you know.
And then  one of my town a boy my age  all of a sudden came I knew he survived  he came over  because his older brot her  and the brother to this girl that I pulled her up to the attic  also survived.
After the war there were a bunch of Jews who wanted to go and kill ex-Nazis.
And they both survived  not 10 together  separately  as prisoners of war.
I -- I was thinking of the -- the people in Berlin  they -- are they -- is there still a Jewish community in Berlin?
And they were our -- they lived in an apartment that we owned.
Uh  my...it's difficult to really say that because the disruption was...gradual  and some things were ve ry drastically different when the war broke out  and then gradually life became more normal  but very different than it was before the war  so that for instance we came back from the country shor tly before the war broke out  and our cupboards were bare  and my mom tried to buy food because she had survived the first world war  and she knew that it will be difficult to buy food in the beginning  but she couldn't get any staples  she couldnt get any bread  she couldn't get any flour   she couldn't get any potatoes.
But they left because thats why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life.
I don't know how I survived it  and I had typhoid.
I was afraid because I wanted to come back alive  I my fathers I wanted to see my father Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 61again and I had also hope that some of my family would sur survived.
We then decided to come back where we used to live.
You dont know of anybody else from Kos who survived the deportation?
Oh  and another family from the village  from the same village  survived probably five  six people  which probably they survived from the Booth family.
My father was  of course  gone  but I survived another time because not very long after that  they again came to look for the young...not young  for the women.
And that those many of us who survived are perfectly normal people.
Yes  they came to Ludbreg looking for me  looking to not just for me; looking to see who was there  who survived of my mothe rs family.
So  my own little cousin  my aunt and my little cousin  two of my little cousins  survived because they could be used a slave labor.
Even when I came back to my town--the reason I went back was because I thought maybe somebody from my family was alive still.
And he told me how I w ill never forget what the Forshan   that's the name of the Jewish family  who survived.
And it's very  very meaningf ul for me to work as a volunteer  because I feel I survived  and so I have to give back.
It was there that I received news that my brother in the Soviet Union survived and that he is in Central Asia.
Many of the people were buried there on the inside of the campsŠof that camp that I was in now.
That one day we were told that a train is passing by town on the way to Vilna and in it there were inmates from camps that survived the concentration camps.
Its interesting that of the 81  he was only one who survived  and then wrote a book about Sobi bor  and it was interesting.
But when she was in -- when she was in -- in Kazakstan  she survived the war over there and in ‚45  she came to Lvov.
And the man with whom I had my long relationship has died and  but  I know  I suppose most people have gaps in their lives  certainly my great regret is not having children  but given that as a given  then for the rest of it  I don't have too ma ny complaints  I have had cancer 14 years ago  I survived breast cancer.
He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust.
She survived because she escaped the Dutch concentration camp and she was there with her little sister.
Because that was the thing and I think our problem still is  those of us that survived and we have children  we became overprotective.
In my case  you know  I -- thats probably why I survived.
And my mothers one brother had lived and gone to the Sudatenlands and he knew that I had USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 26 survived and he was in touch with me.
In a way its not so much the religion as being a nation  being a nation that its another thing that we should really respect ourselves  a people who suffered so much in their history and they survived.
So you imagine  I had almost a hundred years worth of com -- amalgamated documents to look through  that wh ich had survived  and so forth.
We Jews who survived always thought about the Soviet and Russian pogroms under the Czars an d we were afraid once Russian come to Czechoslovakia once again the anti-semitism for wh ich the Poles and the Soviets are so very well known that there will be another Holocaust.
And some people saw us  somehow  and we were arrested and uh... What happened when you were arrested?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 >> Bill Benson: And you remember him coming back.
I think having survived and wanting to survive  and making life as good as possible for me and for my family.
I -- there was -- These are German Jews  or German non-Jews?
If it hadnt have been for the Red Cross parcels then I dont think we would have survived. [
Because if they could have survived the whole thing  thats a different story  but at that age  not many older people could survive it.
Its no -- you know  its different if somebody oh  survived they never went back.
But those who survived and did it well are the answer to Hitler  that in spite of all the adversities they were able to overcome and maintain a connection to their Judaism because my great aunt despite Theresienstadt everything she was very orthodox when she came to America.
02:16:40 And I knew about it because one of the men came to the Verpflegungsamt and told me  ﬁI saw your father and I saw your little brother and they were alive  and they survived the selection in the jail and they are alive.ﬂ And here they said that women alr eady can live  too.
But they survived  and nobody talked about it  but my grandfather told my father that if he looks him up  if he needs an affidavit to guarantee 12 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD the United States -- an affidavit was a guarantee that whoever comes or immigrates to the United States will not be unwealthy for a year.
After the war  a l ong time after the war has ended I found out I was already in Israel I found out that one family was hiding not far away from us and the German patrol was shooting into the forest and the fa ther was hit by a bullet and he screamed the Germans came and dragged the whole family and se nt them to a concentration camp  but they survived the war.
If I think back right now  if I think  you know  it's hard for me to believe  you know  how this possible could be how I survived.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 >> Bill Benson: As you said in the past  you survived because of your mother  luck  and Martial Cognac for getting in so quickly.
>> Marcel Drimer: It wasn't a picnic but it was -- it was a very hard life but they survived.
Uh years ago  BBC London brought me over to uh to London  because they had a show  \ This is Your Life \  of one of the prisoners who interesting enough had been a member of the British army  had survived Dunkirk  had had been had been had been taken prisoner at Dunkirk  had been I don't know in how many prisoner of war camps  had tried to to escape and unfortunately could never make it  and he was a daredevil.

And we had relatives who survived the war in Holland  who were in hiding during the war  in the broadest [indecipherable] were kind of somewhat distant  but in the context of the time they very close to my family  partly theyre -- they were raised in the old country  very close in the same courtyard  effectively  so they were like very close cousins  brother  sister type relationship.
My brother survived somewhat  because...and he had typhus at that time...but evidently he was young and he was able to control himself and he was dressed well in a coat that was twice the size and...uh...it was rather well-to-do looking coat  with a hat and so on.
He survived a nd he came to the office  but I still was working with him.
To my amazement they all crossed themselves to see I survived.
What they didn't say is that everyday transports left for the east and that none of those people survived.
And also  his father and his brother were in my camp.
There were some Jews in Konigsberg who survived who were half -Jews.
My sister and I immediately left th e farm house and we walked back on foot  back to the ghetto to see if somebody from the family survived.
His -- he survived because his mother was not Jewish  his father was Jewish and they sent him -- they didnt send him to an extermination camp  though if the war would have lasted a little bit longer  they probably would have  too  but he was survived in Theresienstadt.
Those that stayed behind  I would -- I would say that about 85% of those deported survived whereas those 90% of those that stayed behind under German occupation perished.
Its a fact  my wife said to me  lets go back to the city  I want to see who survived.

So we returned to Bratislava and a few weeks later  with Marcel who in the meantime survived Auschwitz.
But at this point  in 1992  I still have not found any close relative of mine that survived the war.
She was just an innocent bystander  and I was often  I was  I kept thinking  I said now  how  first of all she said to me  I ask her  I said Mrs. Schimmel  I said how is it that you survived this.
No 100 percent  but a bigger percentage survived and that's what it was the case.
And Im sure  under -- given circumstances  she would have Interview with Margitta Cooper January 4  2002 42 survived.
I must say  at that time I talked to my mother because I was her baby  and I told her what was happening and that it would be wonderful if we would find Jews who survived because even in the 30s  as young as I was  I had some daydream that I could go to Germany and rescue Jews.
Those who survived to a great extent owe this to this concerted action and I uh...this is really the only political effort undertaken during the whole war in which this was tried out from all uh sides.
It seems like a miracle that I did survive and this is what happened to me.
I dont know  if I had Maurice  say -- or if Maurice had me there  whether we would even have survived  you kn ow?
And for some reas on  there were other soldiers that came in and talked to others and somehow we survived.

Well  you know  they had started to round up Jews and send them to camps.
And when I delivered the message  in that time  you see  every day you survived.

So  it was a pure luck the ones who survived and the ones who didn't.
But those who survived  well  they had some arrangements  you know  like I told you about these two doctors.
It was due to that lady that I survived Auschwitz concentration camp.
And then we got to their house  and they had been liberated for a few days also  and they were still in the cellar  because most people s remained there.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
But it's obvious he survived because his name appear as a registered person in 1946.

But that very night when we were in Starachowice  let me finish this is there were about 20 Jews and five children who survived Auschwitz from my hometown  and they were coming back to town   and in the middle of the night a group of radical Poles  and there were many of them in this particular region  the NSZ  the most radical  not Communist  but fascist group in Starachowice  attacked that community  that little group of people who were there  and two of those children that survived Auschwitz were killed that night  two adults  I think I dont remember exactly.

The six children who came to this insane world of Auschwitz and some of us survived  then to America - whatever we are is what my mother poured into us; not my father at all because we were not interested in his world bu t my mother poured so much into us that I feel we have had an education on top of whatev er little education was available to people in our station.
They were from different villages and all  because the only one who survived with me was this Sonia  which has died last year  actually.
But he was in Auschwitz and he was a slave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time.
I'm not even sure that many of the people who were with in the cellar survived  because we were there for quite a while.
So you survived because of his -- Th-Th-The -- the help and him -- the food was a big help  because the rest of the people  they were dying just like flies over there.
And Im sure there were cases  God knows how many  because lots of people didnt come back  especially older people  you know  the young people might have survived [indecipherable] about the older people had no chance.
By m oving to Berlin we moved into a milleure that enabled her to make contact which enable d enabled her eventually to place me with a children's transport for France  and enabled her as a widow eventually to get to England and so we both survived by probably for two reasons  moving to Berlin  number one  and her incessant efforts to get us out of that.
They thought -- and my sister  who left in 39  who survived in Palestine  marrying palestin -- British subject  she thought that I got a nervou s breakdown.

Then I went with Lisa and Ruvke  my fr iend  the one that survived {the one that he survived in the shul with him}.
But still   from my grandmother  she had another sister and she went to Israel.
At that point  we had a small ap artment  a one bedroom apartment that somehow  my mother's brot her lived there prior to the war and so somehow they kept that apartment for him so when we came ba ck and my uncle survived and he came back  we moved in together and we lived there and we stayed there for close to a year  again  waiting for hopefully family  to trickle back.
Interview with Eli Dortort August 3  2005 25 So nobody survived who stayed back in Poland?
And your sister was the youngest one  how old was she at that time?
I guess the answer in my mind is that because  as these incidents came up  they were in my favor  and I survived.
Yes  well they escaped the  the Holocaust  they were not caught and they were not caught and they survived and liberated.
One can be satisfied  one can be happy to have survived or satisfied to ha ve shown resistance and courage.
10 The person who survived  did he survive because of the passport?
Because of my past  and in memory of my parents  28 members of my family  and so many who had to die just because they were Jews  I would always remain a Jew.
And here we...I  myself and another uh fellow  we were arrested; two survived and two escaped--but two of us were arrested  because we just  uh  ran into the uh...uh...set-up  you know  by the...by the police.
That was in '78  and he wrote his sister -- who survived the war also; and she died in Bo-- Boston -- a letter describing Lida.
They would shoot us like we were dogs  and uh  we had no weapons  we were weak  and you  you couldn't fight  fight an army with bare hands  but I feel that every day that we lived in concentration camp and we survived it  to me was a heroism uh by itself  because we made it and we su rvived this terrible life we had there  and by resi--by this we resisted Hitler to show him that we are here to  to stay  and he could not finish the race of the  of the Jewish people  and I feel by that  we resisted.
My parents  yes  survived but they have they are older and they live on a farm and uh they have to give uh uh pigs  cows to the German that come like every month.

So really out of the six people that that started out on the run together in August of '42  uh out of the six people only three survived.
Friends numbers survived  re cords  and some women you cant find.
She was the only one that survived because she is the wa only one that ran away.
Also to let you know that people who survived as a group  not every person  but we made it -- we've assimilated into the -- in this case the American culture  and we've done a lot for ourselves.
And the little daughter  the Lithuanian family who she knows  took her as a daughter  and the family survived the war.
But you would have survived because you could survive without having enough .
I survived  and I have to live to see a little nockis   for my kids  for my grandchildren.
You know  they survived later  they -- they -- they found son of the Majinsky  Stanislau Majinsky and Hilda Majinsky  they were living in Saskacampa  and they survived -- all survive.
And that was outside the ghetto  or inside That was part of ghetto then  yeah.
And they  in a way  they say  oh  this guy survived.
Now -- Also -- also  the children did not know we were Jewish.
As a matter of fact I know now pe ople who survived Studthoff.
I didnt even know -- I knew that she survived  I think  in Russia  i-in the Soviet Union  she was not in  you kn ow  in -- in Hitlers -- under Hitlers regime.
Baby was on the ches t of the mother and I was the only one who survived that massacre.
He was half Christian  but his father's mother  so somewhere along in the background there was on e family that was Jewish  but he was basically Christian and he survived as a Christian.
And finally in August 1945 is when she returned to Holland and that's when I was reunited with my mother.
He was in the hospital and they brought him back to good health.
Probably admiration that he -- he survived and he was a soldier and that he made it  and oh  he fought the Germans  or the Nazis.
And he and his wife bot h spent the war years in a concentration camp  and they both survived.
And he -- in the certain way the effort worked out  quite a bit survived.
She was actually married before the war and had a baby  but she lost her entire family  and she survived by herself.
I thank God that we survived one of the darkest periods in history.
So  in other words  was it an English child saying to the principal that no  I dont want to talk to the German prisoners of war  because theyre the enemy of England and weve just survived the blitz  or was it a No  I just said I dont want to talk to them.
The eldest brother is Moshe and ran away to Russia when the war broke out so he survived.
Now Im talking to you what I told you a whole generation of uncles and aunts and families and people and the whole to wn that I dont know if a dozen people survived from the whole town.
I never had children be fore and I want her to have this child and I want her to be safe  and that's the way they survived in there.
But they were young women  healthy  and they survived the war and died later of various other causes having little to do with the specifics of the war.
Those who are chosen when the transport came  and they were chosen to go as prisoners--I mean to be uniformed as prisoners and go to for work...they usually  uh  survived  most of them  you know.
She sa -- he survive it -- he sur -- all -- survived the riot in Lwow  the first riot Lwow.
She lived she ne she survived the war  and she came to Israel and we did we did get meet get to meet her [indecipherable] Was she able to tell you anything abou t the fate of the rest of the family?
But this dress survived  because I remember it after -- It did survive? --
And she had cardiac problems so bad  she couldnt have walked from here to the front door without taking nitroglycerine  but she survived the cattle car ride to the gas chambers and died at Auschwitz.
I discovered that no one else has survived  none of my family  and the part of Europe  Germany where I was liberated  became...was destined to become the eastern  the Russian zone  now part of eastern rather than East  Germany  and uh the Americans wanted to uh put uh on turn us over to the Russians because they were shipping people that were from France and Holland to France and Holland and people that were from Poland and Czechoslovakia back east and that day the Russians didn't...they put us in a truck and brought us out to 23 the town  outside of the town where the Russian's lines were.
A. We hoped they didn't but quite a few couples in the orthodox and I don't know how they survived.
And even during the war  who were suffering  who were in concentration camps.
None survived   losing hundreds of family members if not more.
That doesn't mean were sh e outside of the ghetto my mother would have survived  but at least her chances would be better.
Well  in any case these three groups  from three groups the transports  the first transports went to a labor camp and a lot of them survived  thank heaven  because they really went to working camps because Auschwitz came later on and naturally we didn't know that.
No one of all this family is around that I know  who survived.
if you -- if you consider how many people were at Auschwitz.
They survived having They survive  yes  they survive that  so yes.
Was a lot of young people  particularly children had to be taken out of convents or hiding places  and was a big battle sometimes  you know  older sisters f -- survived. [
We were trying for a year or two to convince him to tell us how he survived.
My mother  they were -- three survived -- not survive  but th ree -- three sisters and a grandmother  and also -- And they were all married and had children?
>> Bill Benson: You and your family existed under those circumstances.
No one at the school asked any questions about how I had survived  how my mother survived.
And my mother figured if his father would have survived or his brother  they knew wh ere we lived.
And those that survived {Coughs} were buried  were taken to Kiev  to Babi Yar.
Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 41So those -- that started a period of no communications that I really dont know how my mother survived it.
Had we remained in Erfurt neither she or I would have survived the Holocaust.
And my friend Chaim Engel  who also survived  helped me a little bit  I believe  at one time.
Maybe because in Poland  there were -- the Jews were there longer  for over a thousand years  and there were more Jews there.
And one sister survived  she was in during the war I think.
He survived to see liberation by the U.S. Army in May 1945 but his condition was so poor  he was so weak  that he passed away two months later still in a concentration camp in Ebensee .
People look ing and looking for so and so from such and such a place  anybody know whether this person survived or not.
>> Bill Benson: So you and your brother are now with your aunt and uncle.
It started -- this started -- it started this way and we survived.
In fact  I dont know whether the museum ma y have a record of any -- any who survived that way.
So there was a tremendous sense of satisfaction  that of surv ival  unlike what one reads now that people supposedly feel bad that th ey survived and others didn't.
But they didnt kill them  they send them to Stu tthof and they made [ind ecipherable] Stutthof and this -- this girl survived the war.
So there were  you know  thousands and thousands and thousands of people who survived the conc entration camps bu t they had nowhere to go  so they were all just hanging around in some of these camps.
She said if you went back to Stutthof  there was very bad Typhus and nobody survived there really.
Well  that  that was just a lucky 11 escape and  and you know  you never know how  why...if it hadn't been the lace of the shoe  I wouldn't have survived.
He heard the story what had happened in our town  after we got through the war  after we got survived  and why did they do it no w to us?
survive and never   somewhere in the middle  but I survived.
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
They were partisans that had survived and I think that the Russians  the military was also involved to help the Jewish people.
And when we came there  and you know that we are Jews  they didn't believe it  that the Jews looked like normal people  you know.
Now  I said to myself  when I survived the five years  or over five years of war  and Im still alive  Im not going to be subjected to that  Id rather die.
And then they took my cousin -- my cousins  my mothers first cousin  and her husband  and who else from my family.
People who resisted better  who survived easier  were the bakers because they were used to big heat due to their profession  and also strangely enough  small children who maybe are living easier without air survived also.
Actually  the woman survived and came to see us once  in Frankfort.
My mother might have survived as slave labor but she did not want to survive.
And she always made herself  she always thought that maybe mother would have survived  th-that mother got killed because of her  which that's not true because mother could have never survived  they would have taken her to the gas chambers even without her child.
What attempts did your parents make to find family and friends after the war?
They couldnt -- they knew who they gave it  they couldnt get it back  even becau se they survived.
So I would try to go to little villages in the outskirts and grab something from a garden or so mething and thats the way I survived the first months.
The only thing is I found out afte r the war that nobody survived. {
And we finally found a place in a house where we hid.
Somebody who survived in Siedliszcze  that she went over to the police station and ask them they should shoot her and they shot her.
11 Uh uh one of my best friends survived with her whole family which was very unusual.
She had two brothers  one brother and at the time before the war and after the war she had some more sib lings  her parents had some more children and it was quite remarkable because her father was sent to a separate place  separate USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 4 concentration camp from Nomi and her mother and miraculously that family survived and was reunited after the war.
Finally -- I remember my father was saying we survived and now we are going to get killed.
We survived where the crematory was  where the chimneys were spitting out smoke  smelling of human flesh  where our friends' bodies were dangling where they counted us daily.
So  in my fathers fam ily  there were six children  and one sister and two brothers survived  and this one brother was in Bergen-Belsen and then was rescued out of Bergen-Belsen and went to Switzerland  and he married Magda  and they had one child a seven-year-old child or so when I he ard from them.
Someone told us to run to this hotel in town  and practically the whole building fell on us  but  you know  we went to a basement  whatever  and  you know  we survived.
That I had a friend  she was a woman  who had a mastectomy and she survived.
And I think that I f -- we kept saying  ﬁThe Jewish people survived.
how this Ukrainian factory woman who became a Jewish fighter how then she survived and got out of the ghetto and then found you?
Number one  when I came to Warsaw I went to the Jewish Committee  like I said  to find out if anybody survived and I found out there that my two nieces and my brother-in-law were registered.
So but as fate would have it  I survived  she says  so at least I came to see them.
You know  and I was lucky enough that my mother survived.
My family decided  as a form of insurance  so that in case one member was disco vered  one member of the family was discovered  at least the others would have a chance to survive  they decided we ought to split up.
This was -- I was the only one of the child ren from that -- from Kiel ce who survived that way.
So  I should say that you survived the ghetto in Lodz.
Where was your sister -- well  first of all  please tell us your sisters name.
All of you who survived  to some extent  were helped by your grandmother?
In the case of my uncle  who was the father of my cousin that survived  apparently he went east  and because they were supposed to meet and they met  did meet  their paths crossed.
My aunt was taken  my uncle  my cousin and they did survive.
and they survived the war  so they -- they somehow made it to -- to England and my father helped them  but they had a daughter named Christina whos now about three years younger than I  who they left with the housekeeper  their housekeeper and she survived the war in Warsaw.
The people that maybe survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs  to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes  then they took the people  you know.
And wh-what about other survivors  were -- were you living with a lot of other survivors?
She -- you know  when -- when we were in the camps  there -- there came a point  during a low moment maybe or when hope was lost  wh ere people didnt care whether they lived or died  especially if they knew no one else survived  they just didnt care.
All I know is that in a way in his misfortune he was very fortunate to end up in this Channel Islands because if he had been sent to the east  to Eastern Europe  he probably would not have survived.
They were not recognized as Argentineans by the Germans  whereas we  from Salonika  were s -- survived from the first to the last one.
But he survived and came with us to the United States just as well.
And thats when I said to myself  ﬁI live d as a Jew  not very Jewish  I suffered as a Jew as the rest of them  Im going to die as oneﬂ  and I stayed for a while and I left for Germany.
After I found out that my parents had survived I moved heaven and earth to get over to Germany to help them after the war.
If my father would have survived the war  he would change his political views too.
And what was the name of your sister and your mother?
Only I think two people sur Well  I dont mean to s to suggest it was easy  Im just saying it was Oh no  no  no it was simply that  oh my gosh  that the We survived.
But  I survived it  and the lady  let me tell you something about this lady.
And I I probably am somewhat seduced by what I see as people who not its not a matter of adulation  its people who have an appreciation for the fact that I survived  that Im from Wertheim   and and and guilt.
>> Bill Benson: By that time you were  what  9 or 10?
And so it was  I would assume it was considered a public school  but it was a Jewish  ran by the Jewish community.
So when my Aunt Rebecca  who was my fathers youngest sister  and she and her family survived in Egypt  see  because they lived in Alexandria during the war  then after the [indecipherable] took over  and they had to to leave Egypt  they came to Paris.
So if he survived  he had a lot of gold  because each time he was taking a different -- a different area.
And why I was ask Well  th-th there were over  I would say  between hundred  and 140 000 Jews in Warsaw during that survived.
And when I was telling this to people  they couldnt believe that I had typhus in 1945 and survived because Sch wandorf there was a close hospital there.
When um the people who survived the camps...um as they came back home  the Belgian Red Cross and the Jewish um society wrote down the names of the survivors.
The Jewish people who had survived were in certain areas  to wait for the visas.
>> Bill Benson: The question  if I'm hearing correctly  is how your mother  after going through what she went through  how did she handle it afterwards .
If she would be with me -- with us in the bunker  like some other strangers  she would be -- she would survived.
01:44:37 And uh when when we went in to her apartm ent were Christian men that my husband knew  an older couple  and he said...name was Gorn ik I think...and he said  oh Abraham  you survived.
These were people who didn't want to come back  who wouldn't have come back except that we appealed to their loyalty to those who had not survived and the need for someone to come and identify the malefactors.
That if you're not there and you survived it  you have a bet--better chance to stay surviving instead of going to a selection.
But actually after a while the Russians came in -- we were lucky.
He survived and he died I think last year in Israel.
Surprisingly enough  this came out and I never had a tattoo and to this day  I dont have a tattoo and yet the friends with whom I survived together in this camp eventua lly  have this large KL on their wrists.
So later  she survived some time in Auschwitz  and then when they transferred us to Auschwitz  she got sick and when we were in viet -- in -- in Ravensbruck  she died over there after a few weeks.
The last time we survived after we went out from different hiding places and it turns out they discovered  I don't know   not all of them  but most of them were discovered  but the last time is  we were hiding in a place in a house under a bed  a broken bed  what the place was checked and looked maybe a 100 times and that we figured that is a good place to hide.
Later on  if we all came to the same time we wouldn't have survived.
She survived -- no  she survived not in my aunt s town --where she was taken to that Christian family.
The only one who survived was the Count Henkel von Donnersmark.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 22 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: the window.
And in addition to us  one of my cousins -- the uncle and the aunt who we stayed with  they had a son and a daughter.
She was liberated Mauthausen  she survived until the eighth of May. So my uncle came back in May and my mo ther and my aunt came the end of May also.
Well  as it turned out  he was with us for awhile  and when he gain -- when he realized the kind of person Mom and Dad were  he said  you know  I really have a mother  but I was afraid -- a -- a blood mother who survived -- and -- but I want -- I needed to get -- I wanted to get out and the only way to get out was to declare myself as an orphan  which is how he got into Canada   and -- How old was he and where was he from?
If he didn't die of typhus  and he didn't die of starvation  he wasn't picked out in a selection to be gassed  he survived because he didn't have to fight himself...by himself to outwit...to do something.
You may have survived emotionally uns cathed  as you said you had  partly because you were keeping in the present.
But as luck would have it -- and it shows you I was lucky  in many ways.
How one survived this I to this day  when I look back I never understand this.
And they established themselves in this town  and they had a dozen children  none of whom survived who remarried.
I discovered in Auschwitz  and for certain reasons I did certain things without re alizing why I am doing it  but by doing it I survived that moment.
They think  ﬁMy gosh he survived  how many people did he kill in order to survive?
The people who spent two or three years in concentration camps and survived  those people were really affected.
And so they survived as a -- as a community and the whole community after the war  immigrated to Israel.
And then  you know  then he ask me if I know that those ei ght people who survived not the camp  who survived  they have been hidden somewhere  whatever  that they all have been killed.
So that is really  I think some luck was with us.
So we made it right back to the garage and my dad took the whiskey and put some into the  into the water we had and that we were survived and had water.
Uh  in some instances there were people who were alive but barely alive that were laying right next to people that were dead.
This is the only group that did not leave fa -- Lodz  and survived in hiding because the Russians came to Poland just in time.
Are you more comfortable around people who lived through the war in Europe than others who didnt experience it first -hand like you did?
The only people who survived were one brothers of my mother's who came to America; some of my father's older brothers and sisters who had come here also when he was a child  long before the war; my Aunt Masha  who was with us in Germany  who went to England; and my aunt and uncle who had moved to Leningrad.
We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom  but we found out that she survived and five of her kids drowned.
I think the truth of it there are so few childre n  Jewish children  who survived the war  so few -and then were reunited with their family or something like that.
Are you more comfortable with people who lived through the war  than lets say Americans here  who never had to experience what you experienced?
And I was always dreaming about it and at sc hool  I just looked at my classmates who were  of course  Christians and could wear the uniform a nd just  I dreamt about that one day  Im going to have a uniform and the sad thing is that after th e war  when we met for the first time  those who survived in our group  and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden  to most of us  it didnt mean anything anymore.
My parents and myself we had survived out of those 13.
The children  the little girls that survived and  lucky that the men  the two boys weren't home.
We were there maybe a c ouple of days  I dont know  it was very  very cold  freezing at that time.
After the war we found out and we found him in Buchenwald and he worked as a doctor there and thanks GOD the two sons survived and then he went {89} with his family to Switzerland because they opened.
And I recall my father sending parcels to these relatives that were actually  you know  taking ba -- taking it to -- to Russia  and these actually survive d. And I remember them after the war  you know  that they actually survived.
>> Bill Benson: Were you in there with your whole family?
When did your family realize that the war was over for you?
Some died from hunger  starvation but some survived  so it was not as...I had it very well  you know  I I had a good job.
Yeah  from all over [indecipherable] a lot of Polish Jews  and -- and they -- they are the ones who are telling the horror stories  whoe ver survived.
Well  thats the o the only one survived of that family.
And that was the one thing that I would...you know  pictures survived because I had them in my boot  but I lost that piece of stone.
Yeah  on to Auschwitz   yes  yes  he arrived in Auschwitz Yes must have.
Yeah  we survived bu t our families didnt  our relatives didnt.
She has survived it all  she traveled  and she is right here in my music room.
Til a woman who survived under the corpses and crawled out and she came and told the story.
I went downstairs and the st -- intendent -- the supe rintendent of the building told me that two blocks away  or three blocks away  th ere was a office by Jewish -- I dont know if this was HIAS  Jewish committee set up an office  and there were lists of people who came back  or who inquire d  or who survived  and thats where I went.
And then all of a sudden like I h ad this revelation  wait a second  that's why they survived.
And the reason we survived is because a man who worked for City Hall  uh and I don't know - this this is what I was told - I mean that's not a memory I have.
And I would go and meet a train that passed through our little town once a day  hoping that someone survived and people would come back.
The people that maybe 22 survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs  to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes  then they took the people  you know.
One was demolished and the adjacent school  the Alliance Israelite Universelle was torn down  and they used that spot land to bu ild an apartment house for the Jews from Ioannina who survived either by going up in the mountains  or concentration camp survivors.
And my mother had sisters there and other family and so we thought we'll stay there and see if any of those members of the families mi ght have survived and come back.
We put him into the the mattress  covered him with straw and when the selection went on   somebody else went from for him and uh uh when they also checked the the th e barracks  didn't find him in the in the in the mattress  so he luckily survived and he survived al so the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he uh died in New York at the blessed age of ninety-two.
Thank God that some of us survived to tell the story.
And again  as I mentioned  for how we survived overall cold with inadequate clothing  in all likelihood  pretty impressive.
Not necessarily -- not necessarily in Vilnius but they survived in Dachau  they survived in Auschwitz.
And then they made Judenfrei  our town was Judenfrei   but my grandmother on my fathers side had survived  and then an aunt  my fathers sister.
But I have to tell you that this  from the moment we had this first notification that she had survived and until she came to Israel  was eight years.
>> Edna Friedberg: That winter a lot of the Dutch population survived by eating tulip bulbs.
What you were doing when you heard the war was over?
Out of a total  I think  of 70 000 Jews in Greece  there were about a total of 10 000 who survived all together  both in hiding and among those who came back  and I remember some of them having to sleep in the street.
Well  my best friend in high school was Tetsa Fe namo  who uh  survived the war being hidden in our house  my grandmother's apt.
She heads a mentally handicapped brother  and her and her brother went to Belgium and her mother went to Auschwitz and survived.
They were going to take us out and where we were going we didn't know  and my...this lady helped me get my sister out from the hospital and...uh...it's a miracle from typhus that she survived  you know.
I promis ed myself that if I survived the war  I'll help them -- let me compose myself.
And there were about 35 or so -- 35  maybe 40  I -- I dont even count how many -- but I remember a group.
He survived the war  and -- but he went ba -- to Russia and he stay in Russia til he die  I think in 1980.
But they  a lot of people survived even Auschwitz and Birkenau.

I was terribly emotionally upset  and I started to cr y  couldn't stop  and  and I wanted to end it right there  and I screamed that I was going to run to the wires  and naturally everybody stopped me  and uh  the next day I felt much better  and uh  and this is how we made it in in the camp of Auschwitz because when uh you were down  your friends tried to pick you and lift you up  and the next day it was my friend's turn  and then I worked on her  and tried  and helped her to bring her morale up  and this is how we survived  we played it day by day  we could never  we never knew what the next moment was going to bring  a nd we never knew if the next day or next hour we were going to be whisked away by the trucks with the Germans  and the dogs that would come in and chase us on those trucks  and  and then to the ovens.
I mean  they know exactly who was what in the family and how I grew up and -- and how we left and about my brother and all of that  sure.
He survived and I found him again in Israel and we corresponded for a while and then he died.
Maybe -- Maybe I had  but I didnt even -- End of Tape Three  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 92 Beginning Tape Four  Side A This is a continuation of a United States -- United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer.

So he sent back a message with somebody  not letters  because at that time that was too early for mail  and it was such a mix-up that its hard to describe  but everybody just want to know who survived.
>> You said that your dad survived in Auschwitz for a year.
But she says also  ﬁSince we survived  we didnt feel that we had a voice in all of this.
On my fathers side of the family  a few siblings survived  half of them.
But that was one thing  but there was another thi -- instinct in me that said  ﬁThis is going to have to end.ﬂ Whether I survived it or n -- once I got to Auschwitz  whether I survived it or not was  of course  questionable.
But I was always running fast and I was always able to keep up and thats how I survived.
They were married with childre n. Twenty-eight people  that's the immediate family  brothers and sisters with their husba nds and children  none of them survived.
Sometimes I know people who  some who survived two years in camp; and then they were executed.
But all the others  my aunts and uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
So I'm going to just bridge this a bit and say you survived th e assault on Normandy on D-Day.
And the V2 rockets which the Germans sent over; and for six weeks  were slept in an air raid shelter with 300 other people  and we survived it.
>> Bill Benson: And did you have a large extended family?
And we stoppe d and we chatted and we remembered the old times when I was the pupil and he was the teacher   and I asked him what he is doing and he said he just arrived from unit -- from the Soviet Union where he survived the war  and he was working for the Jewish Historical Society  and the Jewish Hist orical Society was transferred 23 fairly recently to Lodz and he is -- he just arrived in Lodz and hes working for the Jewish Historical Society.
I cannot say I'm proud of how I survived  or what I survived.
And how they reunited with their parents  and how my father survived all that.
32 So he survived and then he was kept in Russia after the war?
And somebody sai d  ﬁDieter Rishter died.ﬂ She survived the selection  but she died  sick and exhausted.
One cousin who did survive  his parents and sister both died.
I guess that in those days  I  I  well  let me put it this way  what I realize now in my dotage  is that for every one who died and for every one who survived  there would really be 10 or 20 stories.
And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because she kept them in white.
And now  can you talk to me a little bit about the age group who survived primarily.
No guarantee that I wouldn't have come here ultimately uh because the other two kids at Charbon  the other two from the original four  didn't have relatives in the U.S.  and they also survived the war  one of who is in the U.S.  the other one in Canada  so I can't say that if I had not made that tr ansport to the U.S. in 1941  once again with OSE taking an important...playing an important role in that  uh I can't say that I wouldn't have survived the war  but chances are fifty-fifty  but this way my my problems were soon to be over.
And out of the five girls  as far as...as far I can say  I'm the only one who survived.
And a friend of my -- the closest friend of my brother left for Russia and survived  and he asked  he came to our house and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too.

Its a the only reason he survived  because was very cold winter  it was January  and he froze on the on the front  in the but then he came  after the war  and then soon after was the Polish-Soviet war  which Poland won.
If I didnt  I dont think I could have survived mentally.
After I was liberated and found out that none of my family survived  I was in a great rage for a while.
If it hadnt been for the Red Cross parcels then I dont think we would have survived.
Did you want to have a family at that time  and is that what you wanted your family to grow into  that kind of -- When I survived and came here  this was the uppermost thing in my mind.
We accepted a family who stayed with us till  till the uh German took over Krakow  some of those people survived  some of those people perished   but the hospitality of Polish Jewry to those people who were expelled by the Germans from Germa ny  this spirit of ------- was the best you  in the most humane way  everybody was trying to help  and shelter them and feed them  and protect them even though they were outsider.

I had two brothers  a mother  and my grandmother lived with us.
Having been through the museum  its -- its ha -- very hard to take when you see very graphic pictures and when you walk into a room with pictures of smiling faces and families that were  that are no longer here because the entire town was gone  maybe a fe -- a handful of people survived  thats very hard  but its an important lesson.
So anyway  we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good  but there was the familys story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it wa s the great uncertainty  who had survived and who had not survived.
>> Estelle Laughlin: I don't know how we survived except -- you know  people ask me sometimes was it hope that kept us alive and going.
And how--how did you feel about that  as a survivor who had already survived so much  then participating in fighting?

>> Bill Benson: Once you were able to reunite with your father -- of course  you told us a little bit about the fact that he survived Siberia when the Soviets and Germans went to war.
So how do you think some people survived  and some didn't survive?
You know  a good number of people survived living in Russia.
So she  my sister  and my aunt -- this was mother's youngest brother's wife  who had lost two children but survived with her niece.
The whole collection that Sarah Milo has survived in its entirety yes.

It was okay  were here now  we have survived this  and now the next step is to go to the U.S. We had to wait four years before we got here.
