Anyway  my grandfather and my father  my grandmother -- they all fled to Poland.
I sensed it of course  and I resented the fact that my parents did not trust me  and that was probably one of the reasons I did not join the Russian Yout h Movement  the Young Pioneers because everything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a child.
And then  uh  this was getting into an area that was declared by [the] Yalta Agreement 12 that would be Russian territory.

He was originally from a town near Tarnople  this is near Stanislovov this is near the Russian border  there was a few brothers he was originally from there.
Their -- their language of  lets say of academic educati on or professional education was Russian.
Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian soldiers got me  or whatever.
And but you know  then the Polish zoty had been exchanged  ta ken out  and the Russian ruble came in and and all that  and I really dont know how how that happen ed  but it was just several months that we lived  because we when the Russi ans came in it was September 17 th  and when we were deported  it was April 13th.
So at night we took some shovels and the two of us and went there and we dug up the money in the one jar and the je welry in the other jar and we took that money and some of it we paid border guards between Hungary and Romania so that we could ge t out already and the Russian soldiers were there  so in order to be able to get ou t of there and go over to Romania where my mother's  a lot of my mother's family lives.

They came up to us  and said that were going to Germany because the Russian army is near  and well be shooted by them as collaborators to the Germans because were in ghetto  and theyre going to help us not to be.
He knew -- he was teaching Hebrew  when he was even in Poland before he came to Russia.
And they were wi ld  and they still had weapon  and -- and they came to our woods  but we werent afraid of th em because we were -- had already a backing from the Russian that we knew that the armys coming in the back.
We didnt know the alphabet  we didnt know how to write Russian letters  but we were given ins-instructions every day.
Greek Orthodox  Im not sure  maybe not  but Christmas was Christmas  so maybe they werent  but they spoke with a Russian accen t. They werent born in Wierzbnik; they came from the Russian side.
And then the really enormous increase came after the Russian front.
The Russian soldiers were skilled craftsmen and one of them had made a wooden revolver out of a piece of wood  and I had my uncle  who was at that time 13 married to my father's sister  he was in char ge of that work area over there  and a Russian soldier gave him that  whatever deal they made  I don't know  and he bought.
We found out later on the next days because the pallbearers told us  you know  there were prisoners who had to remove the bodies and apparently  600 Russian prisoners.
And then  sometimes when on the road  it came airplanes  either Russian or the Allies and they bombard and the German would hide under the tr ains.
And how long did you live in Russia before you came to Latvia ?
So pretty soon this Russian officer came on the platform  started ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 talking to my father.
And then he -- and then he -- at the time  he may have also ready been -- he was eventually a prisoner in Moscow  the German army -- he was in the German army and he was taken prisoner.
And I saw the difference between their villages and the the Russian villages.
And we didnt know that Russian are rounding these people and sending them to Siberia.
Since you were under the Russians  some of your uncles even joined the Russian Army.
So I I spoke  when I in the beginning I spoke Russian.
They had good reason to be afraid  but we have to remember what the German Army did to the Russian civilian population when they were over there.
It was a t -- a do -- now  if I say -- in Berlin you had houses which had apartments in front  then a small garden  and then back part of the house.
The Russian presence I remember only in Lignice  not in Swidnica.
I -- I -- I -- I asked him  who are you  a Russian or Ukrainian?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 20 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: everybody a little piece.
We were fou r kilometers from the Russian border  from the old Russian border.
Did you go to a Jewish school or a Polish school?
Most people over there are all Muslims and the nurses were Russian.
And he was he was a graduate of the Russian West Point.
I want to go back to the time the Russian West Point  was that within the Tsarist empire?
His sister  the one we we re together in in the [indecipherable] you know  in the Russian occupied territory.
So when the Russian soldiers  when  I mean  the Russians came  liberated us  our part  you know because I walked with them just like you see the soldiers walking on the highway on both sides  you know  the tank or the pen  pensard truck  whatever it is  and they were walking and I was walking because they were going to my town.
And he was a graduate of the so-called Russian West Point  with the number one vocation.
And then finally we saw a Russian soldier come on the bicycle  a nd s-somebody yelled out of a window  or whatever  and he came and alerted the Russian army.
Then we get into the Russian liberation camp  the hospital and then I get typhus.
So  in 1937  remember that after the Russian revolutions  the white Russians  where were they?
We got recommendations from the Russian doctor to tell us what we should do when we go back to make sure we go to the doctor  which we did.
So after so many years of Russian occupation  the first one  the Tsaristic occupation  that remains.
She came to this country  lets say in -- in -- in 1912  or something like that  so she -- so whatever education she had was -- was in Russian.
And in this respect it was better to be a student in the Polish school than in the state Russian school.
The Russians in one of the towns on the eastern front; his company was surrounded by the Russian army which was coming in fr om the other side.
In February  I think... maybe earlier  Russian took over the whole Poland.
Now my father married my mother also in Moscow and she was studying at the Russian  at the Moscow Pian o Conservatory  I mean Music Conservatory  she was studying pian o. And she was studied then  hist ory.
They had a staff judge advocate over in 7th Army th ere at Vienna that was opposed to our taking witnesses out of Vienna because Vienna was in the Russian zone.
So she g -- I don t know what she did with it  but this how we did that thing -- we did -- she found out where every division  or what division came from what -- where -- plus we had a lot of cape -- lot of concentration camp women sewing strof boots  for the Russian army to put over the shoes  because the winters were very severe.
But the the memory stayed with the Russian army  and and you had to conscript yourself into the army.
And every time the phone rang  and my uncle gave it to me  and he said  \ Oh  this must be the Russian  oh  the uh  the Swedish Ambassador.\
But it didnt mean a thing to me  you know  and I just -- I was pretty strong to -- to take it  and we walked farther  and we came to a city of Kleck  K-l-e-c-k-  and this city was very close to the Russian border.
A nd over there again in some kind of barracks where was the Polish  Italians  and Russian farm labor s in those barracks.
When you started school and you i-it was Russian school  so youre starting to learn Russian  yes?
And they came to Iwje  you are born in Nikopol  so you are a Russian citizen  and finished  and no more discussions.
I mean  this is the [indecipherable] settlement  and a lot of Jews werent allowed to live in other places of the Russian empire.
Jewish people and the Russian people were laying  slaughtered like so many pigs.
After the war  I was  for a long -- some time  very friendly with a Russian girl  then I was quite friendly with the Italian girl.
Next day he came with two Jewish guys from the Russian Army  also from Poland  they put on a full table money  they did n't want to touch it.
So I went with two Russian prisoners to a barbed -wire.
But your mother spoke Russian  so it was -- Oh  she pa -- she spoke perfect Russian.
We -- my brother-in-law was [indecipherable] he used to go over to the Russian side.
There were some more  like my uncles and aunts that went to Russia.
Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 9So I went to the school and the Russian came.
I used to make the   di fferent things  the Russian food.
Interpreter: Now do you want  it says here he was liber ated by first  Russian front  yes here it says the name of the city  Nikolai (Mikolow   Poland or Mykolayiv  Ukraine or Niklovichi  Ukraine)  Upper Silesia and the man who gave hi m the letter of liberation is Captain Ivanov and they had to check him out because it is da ted May 12th  1945  so actually straight from the concentration camp they took him back to th e Army.
So I -- it may have been more than one trip  maybe several trips  bringing in as much as a -- you know  could by -- but by that time you see  there was no help  my brother was already in the camp  my -- my oldest was in the army  the Russian army.
Because my father was bootlegging at that time  and the Russian soldiers got sick from from this drink  and they arrested my father for selli ng bad liquor to the Russians.
In the Russian groups  if you had a wife or young per -- a lover or whatever  you couldnt pick her  you had to go out.
We ran basically toward the front lines because we knew that that's my mother  I didn't know anything  my mother knew that that's where probably the partisans would go and that's to help the Russian armies.
They were Russian prisoners who were captured by the Germans and placed in the camp  also in Brasov.
The part of the Slovak Jewry which was -- was Orthodox but not very Orthodox .
And of course th at was the time where  from what I have heard from the Russians  an the Ukrainians  how horrible Russian and the Soviet system is  I said  even worse than the Germans  than the Nazis even at war I mean  they are just as the Nazis if not worse.
Also freight trains that machinery was taken from Germany to Russia.
And then in 1945  actually it was part of Russia  under Russia.
And it was one morning  I remember  in November and we had two tanks that the Russian boys fixed them  but the Russian army left them.
This was Russian prisoners  was -- were captured from the Germans.
The only thing that intimidated me is that  just like in the German youth  so it was in the Russian youth.
At that point the Russian armies could not supply them with anything.
So I spoke a very good Russian  and we went into this house and I asked the Russian soldiers if we could sleep over.
You could become a doctor  a nd engineer if you studied Russian or Ukrainian because there were universities and institutes  and the schools were in Russian or in Ukraine.
And some was in Russian  not everybody knew the Russian language.
And he at that moment  he said that  I am with the Russian  yes?
Just so happened on this station  there -- there were -- the whole Russian contingent of soldiers were sitting around waiting for this train.
He says the Russian and the Romanian soldiers are here so we are safe.
What was this thing Foster Dallas said  thats an internal Russian affa ir.
And then the Russian [indecipherable] and came in  and took over [indecipherable] from there  pushing.
Now -- so they wanted to -- yes  and as we came to the -- closer to Krakow from the west  so the Russian engineers  if -- f-find out that they already found some installations with [ind ecipherable]  where there were important USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 39 buildings  but they couldnt destroy the whole thing  because its like -- like this was the end.
I know that there were -- I think more Polish  maybe they were Polish Jewish  I dont know  than there were actually just Jewish people.
And -- but all in all  I -- I meet people because I am so involved with it  so to one I can speak Polish  while in -- two se conds later  Ill switch over to Russian  or from Russian to Spanish  or to Hebrew  and people always have -- how could I remember all of that at one time?
We hide like yard goods  so we still had something all the time to tr ade and still live a be tter life than {the average person under Russian occupation  they didnt have it}.
Like for instance  in my home we spoke Yiddish  but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish.
No  I learned first of all  I told you that my parents spoke Russian  and I had But only when they didnt want you to understand.
If I go to the Russian people  I can get the same paper from them.
And and anyway and they all the Russian money wasnt worth anyt hing  I dont know why they ever Did you meet any Russi ans when you were in Dachau?
He was Ukrainian that fighting with the Germans on the Russian side.
She was a doctor in the Russian army  and there was a certificate for Palestine for her at the British consulate  could we help her?
I don't write about that this camp is different from the tent camp and the Russian.
It took about 10 days after the cam p was emptied before the Russian soldiers actually did arrive into the camp.
I do remember many others that may be worth quoting  but the trial itself was conducted by a bench which was divided in four parts  two American judges  two Soviet judges  two French judges and two Russian judges.
I sat at the end of the Russian table  and that table as I noticed again last night was like maybe ten feet from the dock  and from that vantage point  I was ab le to watch them.
Now  this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army  why did you have to bring her into your offices when very few people were there?
And the Russian had examine examined them and and a nd then and then they sent them to Yefraimov.
And in it he wrote of you -- he told stories of partisans around the mountains of Jews and Russian armies.
The female officer was Russian  of Russian origin  but had lived in France many years.
As a result  you would live under Russian occupation until June of 1941.
Well  I think h-her family was of Russian origin  but they ended up in Lwow.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 30 She was liberated by the Russian ar my.
And then  we decided that night we will not go they said  you go there  they that will come the Russian boats in the Baltic Sea  they will take you to Creme.
I think I was 18 or 17  I dont remembe r. I got a job in a Russian -- where they sew uniforms for soldiers.
I think -- I -- when we left Germany  we were sure that Russia was going to attack the world.
Then they would make fun of me saying I was a Russian rabbit.
Lo and behold Columbia took me without restrictions  but with the restriction to study in the Russian Institute.
And we were in the French zone a couple weeks  until they made up Interview with Ezra Sherman May 16  2014 92some papers  and we traveled to the to the end near Bergen-Belsen  on the British zone  but we have to smuggle over the borde r  between the Russian zone.
The fact that we spoke Polish at home  we were brought up in the Polish language.
So the the Russian came to me  he said Im sorry  I didnt know you know how t how to how to the they say Jewish people dont know how to fight.
We spoke German at home  but I had learned to read Romanian and to speak Romanian  and I also later learned some Russian  even before -- before school.
So we you could say he s poke four languages; Lithuanian  Russian  Polish and German.
It was Russian there  like where I was born it's like the bo rderline was.
And then he realized that there must be German prisoners of war on there.
All they had experience was being in Russian forced labor camps -- Right  right. --
I see the ordinary Russian people  and -- be -- being faced with an -- a representative of an ideology that is totally alien to them  and Im sure they will resist against it. [
The Germans caught the first Russian soldiers who came in  and they bind them together and they put a grenade between them and they kill them there  on the garbage there.
And in July of 1944  they took us to Auschwitz because by then the Russian troops were already on the other side of the Vistula River and  of course  it was– by then they were liquidating most of the camps that were still in existence.
You see  there's all kinds...there's there's field commander officers wh at they're fighting and to fight on the front  in the Russian front  you didn't last more than a week or two.
My father  mother spoke Polish but used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
They had a Russian name for it called tolkuchka.17 Tolkuchka  it means ﬁone was pushing the other ﬂ where you sort of  whatever you had for sale  someone would buy it from you.
The next day  Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 16the Russian came in and they first of all  that ca that barracks over there mus was only women.
And this and this bombing and the sh ooting  but that also you had experienced something  must have been that later the territory came under Russian control.
But it was Russian and -- My parents entertained some -- I remember my parents entertained some -- somebody from the comp any  some people from the company  Russians  and the guys were amazed how people lived  you know  the beauty  what they considered luxury.
And just started taking child development courses and fell in love with those like Id like fallen in love with Russian foreign policy.
That wha-wha-what happened  the Russian  they took the whole business  they took -- came to the sto-store and they told my father to gi ve him the key  and they sa -- t-told him to -- to -- to -- to leave th-the business.
Did you -- and -- and did you feel very Jewish?
So your school was Jewish   where you went to school?
she she sees one and she she star ted t-telling my mother my mother spoke Russian  because she was through through a couple  in German and and Russian occupations.
In those three days and three nights  with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day.
What happened  one Sunday morning we hear bombs and the Russian army starts to run away  and next morning the German army came in to town.
So he said to all the people  a Polack wants to kill three Russian girls.
We never made it back  because the Germans occupied that part and from ther e on we did not stop in Lubov  but we got connected to another transport and we traveled towards the Russian territory in the east  by train  and we had  I remember  a open platform train  where old cars were open like platforms and we took that train and we traveled to Rovno which took us a couple of days.
He brought me more bread and he told me  \ I am living with a Russian woman.
His mother was a real German  old cla ss of German and she asked me the qu est use she asked me what  from erman Poles or the Russian Poles.
And to come to Greece  by the Romania to cut the German and probab ly the Russian to go toward west.
The roads became clogged with eastern Europeans trying to get back to their homes  and Russian I'm sorry German soldiers trying to run away from the Russian armies going  west and refugees German refugees who lived in Poland and were afraid of what would then happen to them were trying to make it to Germany.
Maybe few days before because when we came to Pinsk  maybe week later Russian army crossed the border.
Be -- I had a potential knowledge of Russian  because when you put the radio on -- we had a good radio -- of course television was not in existence  that we could listen to all of Europe  and Russia was right next door.
When I start it was not  it was most go -- mo-most Russian people  Ukrainian people.
And th-the fact that  you know  they knew that I am educated  and I will learn the Russian quickly  th -- they -- they also wanted an educated cadre  you know  to work for them  and they wanted an educated cadre which will promote  and will help them  you know  implement  you know  the Communist regime.
indecipherable] evacuate from the Russian front  cause the Russians were coming  they were close by apparently  an d they wanted to get us away from the Russians.
Uh...Immediately in ...in private homes  Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people.
Obviously in charge of them were -- were -- were Germans  and there were always German police  and there were Belarusian police  and Ukrainians.
I spoke German  I spoke Czech  I speak Polish  I speak Hungarian  I sp -- so -- so -- so Ive -- wherever they wanted me  I fit in quite well.
He told us he was in the British Brigade  and while we were in Lvov  he sent us a letter which came to us from Marseilles: to be ready to go to Odessa because his job is to repatriate Russian prisoners of war  to repatriate the–prisoners of war  so if we can make Od essa he'll smuggle us on a ship for us to go with him back  get out of the Soviet Union.
I don't -- I  I cannot remember  because it was in the late summer I 7 intelligence service (Russian) 8 bandolier (Russian) 12 remember  because in '44  at the end of April  the beginning of May  we already were discharged from the from the partisans.
Still people there were li living  or dying  because the Russian organized as much they could  the medical units.
But in Kaunas in Kovno   they started nationalizing the big businesses and they start taking out those people who they felt they are not sympath et ic with the with the with the Russian government and that they had some some kind of history that they were exploiting people.
A. Oh  about a week before we actually were lib erated the farmer came very excited that the Russian front is very nearby and we actually heard artillery nearby and he said that it's a question of days or weeks before the whole front will coll apse.
No  this is this is a de-delicate matter  because the allies were trying to convince us to return back to to remove us from their backs  because there was one and a half million refugees  slave laborers in Germany  and the countries of their origin were already under Russian occupation.
Did he think this was a good idea  even though it was in the Russian zone?
There were about five Russian soldiers with guns no rifles  with rifles and bayonets.
but it was the Russians within weeks they changed it to Russian school.
But in Kazakhstan   did they speak mainly Russian  or is there a ca a language called Kazakh?
For instance  you had to go through the Russian -- Russians were in Czechoslovakia  first of all important -- and we wanted to go over to the British side or the American side was much further.
Then when Zus  he was the commander of the intelligence of the whole forest for the Russian  and for everything.
So a little while ago you said  then one day you met your first Russian soldier?
A lot of them went to Russia  you know  the war when Germany invaded Russia.
She was the most gor geous  beautiful African-American Ive ever -- African-Americ -- at that time we called them black -- African-American girl Ive ever seen  and she came to me  and she said  ﬁWe dont do those things here.ﬂ I said  ﬁI just finished being in a concentration camp  in a displaced camp  in a Russian camp  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 38youre coming to tell me that I cannot take a picture of that woman because she has a different color skin?
But it turned out the people in there  I remember them  devie chesso thats in Russian Thats right  thats give me your watch.
When we notice in a town that there were Russian soldiers  too many Russian soldiers  that they might go out on you know  at night  looking for women  we didn't st ay in that town.
After they attacked Russia  they started there too  they started to do.
And then the Russians  the Russian kids used to attack us  even in Hongkew later on.
This Russian military hospital was dissolved in 45  Septembe r. In 45 September  I was certified (??)
So that if  should have some trouble  they couldn't say I forged the document  this is my me ssage to you  to you the Russian soldiers th e border.
The train stopped at one point  the Russian guard came on board  check everybodys I.D. card and then the train moved on a couple hundred meters and then an American came on board and ch-checked peoples I.D. cards  and a Czech policeman also came.
My father had family in Poland  and my mother had family in Poland.
The Russian military sent some officers to help to organize the partisans into a fighting group.
Unfortunately  the Russian soldiers who liberated this camp didn't pay too much attention to what was going on there.
And  you know  English is the language of the -- of international air  and these Russian pilots had terrible command of the English language.
What they wanted to do was to teach us Russian and to teach us the Communist mantra.
The Russian people - The Russians  they came over right away from America - from E ngland over there.
Now  in 1945  the mother in Stockholm got a phone call from the Russian ambassa dor Mrs. Colontery  telling her not to worry about Raoul.
There were two people  two Oriental people from the Russian army  I came across there.
That the Russians would not give them any arms  enough in the unit  and the thought was th ey met up they told us they already met up with Antisemitism and the Russian unit is separa tely  and they look down upon these Jews that came from the ghetto.
I remember one day in Budapest  I was walking down the stre et  and came these Russian soldiers  surrounded a whole block and took every man  every man from that block  they took into a backyard  into a big backyard  a sc hoolyard or something.
But when they were missing  th-th-th-th-the NKVD  which then became the [indecipherable] who came around and asked questio ns  you know  the Russian secret service  or whatever they were.
Right when the country became a country  should have been taught equal Yiddish and Hebrew   but no to them Yiddish is only European Jews are speaking Yidd ish.
On the 17th of September  Russia attacked Poland and as a result of that you and your family would live under Russian occupation until 1941.
But whatever they could put their eyes on was taken back to Russia.
And the Russian didn't care that I'm Jewish  that I am...I'm not a...I'm not running for the Germans.
See  they were already established with a group from the Russian partisan   so they had already tunneled a hole  we call it.
Well  he was ab le to get over the br idge  together with a group of Russian singers.
I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at home.
They were so protective of even the the men  I dont know what they were doing during the war  but they protected na us against the Russian RG-50.030*0584 67soldiers  because the Russian soldiers were drinking a lot  and ready to rape if they even a skeleton  they were ready to rape.
Some Russian prisoner go to the Lichencomer mean the morgue  go there and pick up the gold teeth  stealing the gold teeth from the people.
So we wound up on the Russian side of Berlin and then we escaped to the French side and then fina lly got to the American side.
23 Son of a whore (Polish) 24 Son of a bitch (Russian) 25 Gen. Wladyslaw Anders 25 My cousin women and and children were bundled up and sent to India and South Africa.
They arrived in -- like a -- a truck or some thing and they wanted to know who was who and we said who we were and we spoke Polish and there was a Russian woman with us too  because that was already out of Radsoff.
And still in this -- in this military clothings -- The -- the Russian -- is those pajamas.
One is the British  one is the French and one is the Russian.
Russian spoken) Came in a strong army and they went in the street it is after my (another language spoken) were playing  and there was a lot of music  and a lot of joy.
Then I went to the Russian school from 1939 til 1941.
Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there.
These were renegades of the Russian army who thought that they will have it better by the Germans; and they were used in this case  at least --as guards against Jews.
And when the train stopped at night and the other Russian soldiers came to look for foreigners  this pa rticular officer  who sat across this -- the bench from me  he said to the soldiers  ﬁGo away  its middle of the night  were all sleepy.
So they must have been Russian s  but probably they were afraid too.
And we -- we sh -- sought shelter  and we stayed with people  and I must say  in the Russian -- wh at is now the Russian -- what used to be the 113 Russian zone  East Germany  people were much nicer to us.
The russians did not allow Hebrew or Yiddish or any sort of education that was other than Lithuanian or Russian so I was put into a Lithuanian school and I didn't know what was going on at all because I didn't speak Lithuanian.
>> Bill Benson: The war  of course  began in September 1939 when Germany and Russia attacked Poland  but your community  Hungary and your community  did not feel the full im pact of the war really until 1944 when the Nazis occupied Hungary and your town.
You know  when the Russian were coming  and it was an hour away  but they stop because the stupid Polacks  they said  were going to fight for our capital.
indecipherable] people from concentration camp  [indecipherable] people from Russia  some from the partisans and the Russian army. [
I said  ﬁCan I talk to Mariashki Supporzhnikov?ﬂ And I said  ﬁIsh bin mya  ﬂ this woman is speaking Yiddish  I am speaking German because I forgot how to speak Yiddish.
And so  anyways  we went USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 10 with this so -- Russian guy and he said  ﬁIm not taking you to the Umschlagplatz.
And those I didn't know they're Ukrainian or Russians  so they and I spoke a little Russian because I was in Russia a few months.
23 different scenario and in fact they want to repeat the same thing that happened in Poland  and so the communists rather than wait for a coordinated army and underground and communists and Russian attack across the mount ains  jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in August in large quantity into Slovakia and these saboteurs without any coordination with anybody  stopped the night train that goes from Be rlin to Bucharest.
Then I made a contact through a friend  a White Russian woman. {
And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw.
Stanova is -- ther e was a Russian word that was used in and among the Lithuanians and I used to lie next to him and he used to tell me little stories.
Just was a Russian girl; but she was...was a Russian camp  too  there.
And whatever the Russian soldier got  I mea n  he was happy to get something for it.
On the train for six weeks  by the time we got to Siberia  my Russian was almost as good as my English.
They passed already  the Russian army  passed already Treblinka and Majd anek and nobody was there alive.
Right  you know  and in and I I dont to I dont think there was any Russian normal person that did not go to some kind of something like that.
I went to school  the Russians decided that the kids could go to school  but they all were dropped one class because they wanted to indoctrinate us into being communists  and they tried to teach us Russian.
which  the Russian name is different  but I I it corresponds to lieutenant.
We walked a little bit  the second house we saw we opened the gate and a priest comes out and greets us ﬁhello who are you?ﬂ We told him we are inmates and that we are going to be here by you because thats what the Russian army told us.
Whether he was a Polish Jew or Russian Jew  I don't know.
And the reason for it being is that the Latvian and Estonians and Lithuanians had great hopes for having independent -- you know  want to be independent of Russia  you know  they always been an -- you know  under the Russian thumb  as it were  you know  and so maybe that -- somehow they felt that that would be some way of -- of maybe getting Germans to give them some independence.
Actually  it was out of all of Czechoslovakia  because at that point the border between the Ameri can zone and the Russian zone was an open border.
And they three people; a Russian  a Lithuanian and a Jew are are this this group  this Police  yeah.
For -- for the Russian was one  this is the -- from the Warsaw uprising boy.
And eventually they went to Zahedan   and they were there in Zahedan   and there was there a Persian general Kava Kavushek   who spoke very well Russian.
Our circumstances were quite different  so 9 it was sort of a degrading of circumstances starting with the Russian occupation  and that proceeded into the German occupation  the conditions constantly getting worse.
And once the rocket was shoot  fire starts and with the words of \ Hurrah \  the Russian way  our men begin.
I stood with him in the Polish [indecipherable] couple weeks there  because most of the officers were Russian.
She was happy to see me  it was a Russian woman  very happy to see me.
I came back not speaking Lithuanian and not speaking Russian  but speaking only German.
In one of those transports that were going out of the camp because this cam p was being liquidated because of the advancing Russian army as we would only hear from rumors .
It was for his bravery fighting in the in the with the Polish and Russian troops.
So their basic Russian was based on the military requirements  you know  in other words  what what do you ask  you know Right.
The other two ca mps in Ashafenberg  Displaced Person camps  one was strictly Ukrainian and one was strictly Russian and -- and White Russian.
They spoke no German  they spoke Polish and Russian  and a few words of German here and ther e. Some Czech children  but mostly  as I say  it was eastern European children  who had either been brought in by themselves  or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them.
They know  and I remember when the Russian arrived  the officer  the first thing what he gave me a piece of bread.
Since Russian was not my language  but I had to study so instead of coming in according to my education  I should have at least come into the tenth class because the Russian had a ten-year school.
We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier  and the Russian soldiers  they went out  they got the seven horses  came back  got them dressed back their uniform  dropped them on a cart  and took them back to their camp.
And I say  \ Well  you know  I re ally know this area very well \  so the uh the Russian who's...you know  \ you can really unde rstand Russian reasonable well.\
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 54 And it and this [speaks Russian] or diploma  because I I graduated as as a one of the first students.
In 39  the Russian captured the west part of Ukraine  in whats today called Yes  west part west part of Ukraine  thats true.
I believe that in 19 I think it was '56 that I read about him  that Gromyko  13 the Russian foreign minister  admitted that he died in Russian prison  whic h nobody believed  but it was in '47.
He was there in the Russian army  which at th at time was stationed in some of the cities in...in...in Manchuria  which was part of China.
He he was in the World War I  and he w he took they took him to he was in the Austrian army  and they took him to bene in the war they took him the Russian took him to Siberia .
So some of the Jews  in great numbers  escaped to Russia and stayed throughout the war.
>> Bill Benson: David  while you were in Auschwitz  you also had surgery while you were there.
At night we would go out together like Russian style to have some drinking.
Later on  uh  they brought about 15 000 Russian prisoners of war.
So instead of having the Russian -- the Russian police  or Polish police -- you know  you had German police  but -- No different.
You know  Russian officer  one uh ...one uh  colonel  you know  I...he...he... Alright  he was grateful.
I had never heard a word of Polish before but I figured if it s a Slavic language like Serbian  then it can't be that different and I volunteered.
So they knew Russian  my father 25 spoke Russian to them and he told th em that we think there is a family living here  if they knew that we would be here  they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown  Saskatchewan.
She spoke French and German  and Italy -- and Italian  yeah.
He says to me -- we spoke Russian -- he says to me  ﬁDo you have a partner by the name of so and so  Danny?ﬂ I said  ﬁYes.ﬂ I never told him about it.
Of course  when the Russian front moved and to Poland  the Russians also established their own government you know Polish government.
And in Kovno  what was happen ing  it was under the Russian occupation  and then under -- under German occupation.
We  as a family of a criminal -- my father was called a criminal because he was sentenced  so the family under the Russian law  we were supposed to be also taken to Russia.
That was at the time when uh the Germans have gotten after the Jews.
And then the reason she didn't want me to go is because she didn't want the Russian soldiers to come.
And many of them  by the way  were able  because they were on the Russian front  able to either escape or were captured by the Russians.
We were 250 men  there must have been 100 SS people with machine guns  everything and we were marched out of the ghetto to a small camp which recently used to be a prisoner of war camp for the Russian prisoners.
I had to start in a Polish school and learn Polish and all the subjects were in Polish.
Next to our ghetto we had a building with Russian prisoners  and they were wounded.
But my mother knows she  and I believe he r  that soon as the Russian -- and now she was alone  my father was gone  you know -- Right. --
I didn't know Polish  of course  because then Russian became my first language.
My brother and the three ladies were smuggled in a different open truck with a Russian captain who was able to get them through and in Berlin we all met.
And we were convinced that they were German but they had the Soviet star  the red star.
So the Russian guy -- there were some Russian people  oh  th-those are ours.
But -- And in that  of course  there were many Jews.
Soviet backed Polish partisans 34 village and I could see the tanks for maybe  like a hundred feet away  only the Russian tanks.
On uh other places  they keep the prisoner to the last moment and the Russian troops liberated them.
My mother could not get over it because when she was a girl going to school  quite young  the part where we lived was once Russian and once Austrian or Hungarian.
And the bodies of these Russian prisoners were stuck six feet high because there was no - they didnt have the capacity to burn the bodies.
And we were in Linz at that time  which was the border between we were wa iting for the opportunity to get into across the Russian zone.
The work was divided into two 12-hour shifts: day shift manned by us  and night shift which was manned by the Russian prisoners of war who were kept somewhere there.
In the morning somebody opened the barn door and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot and he came in.
Sh e was with the Russian girls in a labor camp.
And there was one Russian i-in th a woman  which wer she was in charge of the restaurant.
One road led to Lwow in the direction of the Russian border and one towards Warsaw.
Thousands of miles they used to march when the Germans...the Russian used to advance  so they didn't want to leave the prisoners.
We had enough food  but on the walls  and on the ceiling  names from the Russian who got killed there.
I could not come down because the ru -- there was the Russian zone in between.
There were Russian  there were Polish  and now the -- the German took this over.
He started to make fire and the whole night and over ther e was Jewish doctors too because they came from Russian also...a Jewish doctor and she t ook care of the baby and he had bronchitis.
The Russian soldier came out  and he says   ﬁNo  you cant go there.ﬂ So he took us down from the train.
She he came to the Russian... He...he took us to the Russian Army and he... Over there  I came and I asked...I knew one word of Russian. .
It was supposed to be in a dilapidated section of town where about four thousand poor Russian and Polish families lived.
So youre a high school student at a school that is now a Russian?
The Polish Jews were  I think  the predominant  you know  people  so.
And so I left them and I could not go over to the Russian side -- they didn't let me -- I couldn't go with them.
We we were going to Russian people  those that were previously deported.
Of Russian German descent  who had married a Lithuanian  had moved to Kovno after her marriage  after Memel had been retaken by the Germans in 1939 and my dad had found out that her husband occasionally came to the ghetto on some business.
I had no idea wh at the Orthodox Russian did  Id never been in on of those churches so it didnt -- you know I couldnt carry that.
After the war  particularly  it was so many Russian film s  you know  coming  but I always went  went to see films.
Lotchik in Russian means a pilot  because when I joined the army  I was accepted to the air force  and everybody envied me  because very few people were accepted to the air force.
I remember there was the Polish army which was associated with the Russian army.
I was speaking German and Polish not as fluent and then my father taught me Russian  and some Hebrew.
Her ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 name is Dina but in Russian it was Dorka.
The Russian army will come into the city; they'll take care of you.
We receive d our independence from the Polish -- from the Russian Tsars regime.
And I reme mber picking up a a Russian officer  and we offered him some cognac  and he I think he drank that whole bottle  we just couldnt believe it.
Well  most of my uncles were drafted to the Russian Army.
And -- but I -- I forgot already Russian quite a bit.
In the morning  I went to look for a Red Cross and the Red Cross  Russian Red Cross and I asked again about \ Avery and they showed me a .
I was scared of the Russians  because a -- what I went through with this -- with the raping of those women and -- and the be -- they behavior  that I -- I was scared of them  because I dont know if I said it  when I was freed finally  they drafted me in the Russian army for a few days  where I escaped  because we -- thanks to a -- a bag of sugar.
We found a place on Wulecka street with a Polish family given to us by the Russian government.
So hundred and hundred of Russian people stayed there in Slovakia .
Poland was invade by German and by Russian an d during this time  Polish nation  35 thous -- 35 million people  a-and 10 percent was Jewish  a nd some other nation was in Poland the same time  and we lose six million Polish citizen.
The blitz the German blitz was so effective that they were taking thousands and thousands of Russian prisoners.
And I went to the Polish school to the Jewish school.
Most of my uncles were taken to the Russian Army  conscripted to the Russian Army.
And they s -- the sergeant  Atkinson was his name  Se rgeant Atkinson told me that before the border dividing the Russian zone from the British zone   I should get out of the British car because the Russian soldiers would come and inspect the Brit ish car and they did not like German citizens mingling with the British  meaning a -- I would go into the -- into the car in front of us and pretend to be one of the -- well  I was one of the people.
If you were even a businessman  say  ﬁOh  yeah ﬂ when one of them asked you if you were a business man  might say -- when the Russian came over  my uncle had the flour mill and he was a big business man.
You know  when they first come  they get the minor jobs  then they go -- and -- and we met a guy from Russia which is Jewish  hes a Russian.
Now  many of the yellow starred houses were raided  and many of the people already were deported  but in the middle of December  which is what what was  there were Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops.
The ki ds used to call me Russian Rabbit which I didnt like.
Ukrainian rubles  not Russian rubles  because [indecipherable] at that time  forpa dollars  stack like this.
There was a few Jews in the Russian Army  and they didn't want to be in the Russian Army.
The british came ad put on their trucks and took us to a town called Lubeck.
Uh  their home town was Liepja  which in Russian is Liyepaya [Ger: Libau].
He jumped on this crisscrossing of this lot  and asks of this commander  ﬁWhere you want to go?ﬂ And he said  ﬁWe want to go there  and there.ﬂ So [indecipherable] like aragu -- you like be in the Russian [indecipherable] yes?
And the other side of the Dnes tr was a big city; in Russian  it's ca lled Mogilev Podolskiy.
And those two dots beca me bigger and bigger and then became two Russian soldiers .
Yeah  and he they were White Russians  and so he would give me this Russian newspaper and [indecipherable] I said  I cant read it  and he every time I came he would give me a different Ru ssian letter to print  and to learn to so I knew how it was you know  I could read  but I didn't kno w what I was reading  but thats besi the same thing that I did with this German   that I could perfectly typing and writing  didnt know what I was doing.
Like there was this incident that a Polish priest accused the Jewish star of being equal to the  to the Nazi or the Russian.
Somewhere outside Gross-Rosen by Russian troops in the spring of 1945.
This is tape number two  side A. And before we continue  I just wanted to ask if you had seen any Russian POWs before you went off in to fight to fight with the partisans.
I was very happy to do that for her but the Russian army passed by here and they came into the houses and emptied everything and they took.ﬂ Somehow  looking around it didnt seem that the house was robbed by the Russian army or that anything was emptied from there.
And the second time  a man came to the door and...and in...in Russian: Kto tam?
There was a German population that they moved in and they used to beat up the Jewish kids or the Jewish people.
I wrote by the way - that might interest you - I wrote five letters in Russian  identical letters to my aunt  and I wrote on each letter on the bottom  if you should get all of these letters  please don't think I've lost my mind.
I ran and there was this guy Andrej and there was like  you know  like razvedka7  we call it in Russian.
Then also  the partisans  like Zina was  they was a group of people like -- they called themselves in Russian semeyny otryad 12  they were like families type of things there.
Your treatm -- your treatment by the Russian authorities  or the Soviet authorities in Bialystok was -- Oh  it was good  but they did not -- they probably supplied the food for the various organization to feed us.
And I had...uh...the hot soup and the bread again and he was...he told me he made an arrangement with a Russian Jew who has chil...children that are...uh...manager of a cohorse.
They were -- the Russian were chasing him and -- and -- and bombarding them and they were running away so we tried our -- our mission was to mine the roads  not to let them through.
I went to school  uh...and I learned how to speak German again.
My -- they put my name  my date of birth  and my fathers name  because was a Russian medal  they have to put the father name.
We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good.
It was Polish people  Ukraine people  and a lot of Jewish people.
Do you have do you have sometimes Russian Jews who have emigrated to the United States have felt alienated because pe ople havent understood their experiences.
that those Russian guards treated you better than the Russians did in Russia .
The Russian prisoners of war were marched -- that's what she told me  to the town and even when some of the non-Jewish -- well  the Jewish population couldn't but the non -Jewish population would offer them water  they would hit them with the rifle butts and would n ot let them accept the water.
In French  in Russian  in English  which I didn't speak at that time.
There the Russians were there pretty close so we came there it started snowing already and we came there on top of the mountain *Prashiva[[p h985] is the name of this mount ain and the Russians sent home the Slovakian soldiers  they didn't have confidence in them and only th ey kept the POWs or groups like we that we couldn't go hom e. We were there a coup le of days on this mount ain and then they said they will go east to try to join the Russian army.
All the refug ees were allowed to go back to Poland since Poland was under the Russian ru le anyway so they did not make a fuss.
And after the theater he said  the Russian are looking for workers  and you know whose it's going to be again.
And in -- in -- in school were you being taught in Russian?
And they didnt accept no Russian  no Polack  no nobody  they were just their group  all Russians  anti-Semites.
We find out there is Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 28a guy  a Russian guy  a driver  he had a truck there  his name was Sashka .
And when you were in school  were most of the other students refugees?
>> David Bayer: We didn't know if they were Russian or Germans.
And he became an anarchist  and by 15 or 16 he was living in another town  owning a bakery of his own  hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist movement and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905.
We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good.
So if we would have had money  we would do 20 political instructor (Russian) 21 village administer (Polish) 42 that?
You were saying that they got used to him being a Russian Jew.
And we -- we -- we hear what you saying to the Russian soldiers and please stop telling them that you are Jewish.
And how -- can you say -- Personally  through myself  it was -- well  the change was that first of all my father lost his business because the Russian -- there was no private enterprise allowed  so that -- so ac -- everything was expropriated.
And Russian was there  so immediately some friends of my mother -- she had a lot of friends in Pinsk because she came from the town  gave him the suit.
The Russian sold -- soldiers come here to warm up  to drink something  to eat  and they leave.
Some of them  including my brothers  were sent up to the Russian front.
My uncle thought somehow that he can buy up the German guy  with whom he made friends -- dragono -- I dont know what -- what he thought they would let him do  because many  or rather some from that area went into the swamps  whic h were surround -- which were not too far  with the Russian partisans or with the underground.
So my mother took us every day  someti me in the evening  sometime in the afternoon  but not at dark  and she spoke Russian and she spoke Polish to the other.
I had a uniform  I had a railroad uniform on but not a Russian soldier uniform and behind the tank I just passed  they didnt mind me they only wanted the soldiers and they didnt do anything to me.
Because I decided I was going to go with something strong and the Polish Russian ones were the strong ones.
With those papers my father hired a driver that we had acquainted from NKGB  which was the Russian secret service  with a big truck and that night we got loaded on the truck and wouldn't you know it was a night that I didn't have the stamp collection  and I didn't dare go up  ask for the stamp collection for that night and we took off with that truck.
This Russian officer's name was the same as my last name  Nadich.
40 -- you see  the years when the Russian come. ‚
Now  when we came back -- after liberation we came back home  we were notified by his wife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an informant and -- yeah  he was an informan t and we dont really know what happened  what he did  because we were in Romania  right?
Since since Buchenwald was supposed to be tried by Russia  and since this is the Russian zone  we we had a team of about two  three attorneys and about four linguists  who went through all that stuff that had been collected  and they the lawyers put it into a legal documentation  to turn over to the Russians  that they could use it as evidence.
They were intelligent  wonderful people  Jewish and Russian and Ukrainian  different.
All the -- almost the same German went -- when the Polish.
You know they came from Afghanistan  Kavkaz   they were Russian  very wild  drunken soldiers.
All of a sudden being Russia was Russia  they took us.
They were not Nazi boots  they were Russian boots  and we were liberated.
They were not allowed to meet the Russian P.O.W.s so only the Jewish Hungarian refugees were partners for them.
And it has the name of this smaller - it was just really not a camp  it was an apartment building or a series of apartment buildings in the French or Russian sector of Berlin.
I did what I felt a person should do ﬂ and what he does he blames  36 virgin forest (Russian) 42 ﬁIf I could only point my finger its to the pe ople the ones that did not help.ﬂ In Yad Vashem37 he was speaking he say  ﬁI accuse the people the ones who could help and did not help.ﬂ We have a little tiny bit of time left.
So she would ma ke me go there  and I hated going there because I was afraid of these Russian soldiers-although they were very nice I was scared of soldiers it was a soldier and my recollection of soldiers was not somebody that I wanted to deal with not after Auschwitz  so it was very scary for me but she would make me go.
Well  Yiddish  we spoke  you know  we spoke with my family Yiddish.
And somebody told me that he was whistling  that  it was a Russian song or a French anthem  I dont know  I wasnt there  and they arrested him right there  in ‚43  and they built a gallow to hang him  all night long  and the next day they brought him out to hang him  they made his father sit in the front row  my uncle  Henek Haubenstock  and the rope broke .
against tanks  Russian camp -- tanks that we re -- that were a -- coming soon.
This is tape four  side B. It was so far that even a a neighbor who didnt like a neighbor  or a so he started to to have against him personally  and he went to the secret police or to the police and said  look  this my neighbor  he said the the Russian were stealing our liberation and he praised th e American  it was enough.
So when they had to go and apply for these...for the visas  uh  they had to speak Russian.
Everything was ----------  the money ------ ruble  was a big  how should I tell you  ------police  Russian schools  policemen  the army  the farmers they couldn't sell the way they want the produce.
And she said you be a lieutenant in the Russian army.
My father understood Russian because as a child  Shasnich was under the Russian  and he learned Russian.
First of all  I was dragging with me Polish-Jewish girls who didnt speak a word of Russian to discover on the German-Polish border that it was no longer Soviet Union  but it was Poland.
The Russian army and they took every young  able-bodied man to the army.
Well  Ladino is created that way and I can equate it like Yiddish is a German laced with Polish  Russian  whate -- other language  wherever the Jews lived in those days.
It was 1941 in Ukraine when my father was taken to the Russian army  to the front.
And also because my father was given the sentence and he was a criminal  quote  unquote  we were supposed to be going to Russia as well.
It was before the Russian  but the Germans took it over and they took people for labor.
We learned the word diarrhea in three languages and Im not sure that I can even say the -- the names today and Im sure they would too  because one was Russian  one was Polish and one was  I guess French  because we had a very sweet Frenchman who spoke beautiful English.
Only the Poles would fight after the -- the German -- [indecipherable] the Russian  they organized themself  but not the other  not the others.
And I told them  dont be intimidated  youve got they had Russian speakers there  and they were I I I told them how how to talk to these people.
You stayed with the Russian soldiers For a For how long?
I said  \ I'm a Russian soldier  and I never slept in a bed for weeks.\
What you have to do  the first floor everywhere is already Russian soldiers.
They played pretty much the same game  they claimed that their mother was Russian  not Jewish  and there was a grain of truth to it  I think she had a Russian grandmother  and -- but all the ot her grandpa -- grandparents were Jewish.
Before he was in the...uh...first war  he was in the military in... uh... Russian...Russian military  and he knows very well Russian language.
So again  like in America  where the kids are in there in English4 and the f -- and their parents speak either Italian or Russian or whatever.
And and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime later the same sergeant comes in and he says  do you speak a little Russian?
So yeah we spoke German at home and we spoke English in the world.
I don't remember na turally what happened but I remember when I opened my eyes I saw a big room with a lot of women laying there and some Russian doctor who happened to be Jewish talking to me and telling me that I was unconscious for three days.
The other flights you took in addition  with the Russian prisoners-of-war  or slave labors I didnt take that.
At the end when they feel that the Russian front is coming they changed a little bit.
I don't know if -- and I saw the Americans  but the junction  the Russian took over that part.
But the the Russian command decided that they wanted additional thing  they wanted our labor force.
You have lived under Russian occupatio n. How did you feel about the -- in the early 50s when the -- the fear and the hatred really  of Communism was very great in this country?
And then we heard that that film was  the German film was all in the Russian sector  which made it even more difficult for us.
Well  I spoke Polish  and of course  my 8 parents spoke Yiddish.
When I came to the United Stat es  I spoke Polish  Russian  Ukrainian.
And my mother didnt didnt saw her aunt my her sister since the Russian revolution she didnt see her sister.
And we went around and if they had the calf  we said  we will set a small herd of cows  and we will go into the steppes because it doesnt belong to anybody  we could do it  and take it but somehow we did it fell through  but anyway  my brother was taken by he wa s then 12 years old  and he was taken by the some Russian people who were building the train things to to go and be you know  go-getter  or some how do you call it?
Maybe that's Neu r-rev because that's my Russian name  Anna is Neur-rev .
A. Then -- well  the Russian were coming in too fast  so they did not want to -- the SS did not want to be liberated by the Russian so they start to walk us.
Accidentally I was in the movies s eeing a Russian film.
Were they the only people who were in that camp  the people who were marched from Romania or were there also Russian s there?
Uh now uh about uh...let's see...a few months later  see as the Russian armies were getting now closer already to that area  I had a friend of mine  an older...about seven or eight years older than I was...told me that uh one of these days now  Cornel  he says we are going to escape.
>> Bill Benson: I've read several accounts of the Russian assault on Berlin and then about life in that devastated city in the months following the war.
An d then was whats happened  I went down to the village  and the Russian  the carriages were coming.
And I I...I said I was one of them who was instrumental in this  so every morning when we came  he whispe red to us what he had heard during the night  and in this respect uh we  or I was fully familiar with the progress of uh the Russian army in Stalingrad and of the other defeat of the 6th German army under in Stalingrad and especially when when when it came to an end with the with the loss of approximately three hundred thousand German soldiers  so the questi on came  how long will they be able?
And then Vera Weitzman  who was a very you know a lady and she was with the all the Ambassadors over there  so she spoke with the Russian Ambassador  they're bringing in...in Washington and she was here and she spoke with the French Ambassador there and here.
Some how the Russian soldier  he didn't know how to read it; and he gave it to one of the SS in the wagon  and he somehow explained to the Russian soldier that I'm just coming home from the concentration camp.
I recall going to the opera house  we were involved in opera  and se eing the Russian ladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns  and I recall in our  when they took our store they removed everything so my fath er still removed some di shes for bartering later which helped us for a long time .
From the age of seven to ten I attended a Russian school.
But my mother  when the war started war between German and Russian  didnt want us to to be separated.
But then it started again  actually the main involvement of the Slovak army was in 1941 in June when they started the war  the German against th-the Russian.
Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians  and usually Baltics.
Wh-Who also grew up in Russian   you know  i-in Russian schools  you -- Right  right  right.
My father spoke Yiddish  my mother spoke very  very bad Yiddish.
Ya  on the Russian side because I escaped to the Russian side Przemysl.
This young Russian officer  as Bill described  came on the platform and he gave my little sister a chocolate bar.
Berlin is an island in the middle of the Russian zone of Germany.
The first week we were still going into the office and then some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already  mobilizing some cars or trucks if they ha d. In our concern too  the director was taking trucks and horse and buggies  pu tting furniture and stuff and sending family back to Russia.
And in this place they had a man  a Russian guy who came  the first World War II  he married a White Russian  and his name was Matt Rosov.
Well  saw the Russian soldiers  and the and was interesting  you know  that I remember one of the soldiers told them that  yeah  they had oranges in Russia too  they made them in a factory in Kiev .
The Russian Army hitting the easternmost province of Germany  which didn't exist anymore  which was known as East Prussia  and the Germans were fleeing from the Russian Army.
Your friends  were -- were you going to a public school so that you were with Jewish students as well as Gentile students?
But people the Russians didnt come for communism  be fighting for our Russian mama  but not for s not for Stalin.
In Russia  in the army  not in the army  they survived.
Somebody  appare ntly there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian.
Well  in -- they -- how they treated -- when they came into Russia  of course.
I was born  I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit  but they spoke Polish only.
I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard what is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after Stalingrad and we knows that the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to Hungary and really I know I cannot uh mention what was the front situation  but it was a possibility to think that we had a little uh a little uh future  maybe that we will be the only person in Budapest  the only Jews to survive this with our   without without to take to deport...to be to be deported.
What was your feeling when you heard the war was over?
But when we came there  he was a Russian young man by the name of Bumky Bojarski and he was a leader in the underground already  in the partisans.
Was a group from 40 or 50 people  all of th em all of them deserters of Russian army from Polish army.
But the head of the organization writes perfect E nglish  so knowing that most schools are bilingual  we should be able to communicate to some extent  although when we were there seven years ago in Opin   thats the town where my mother was born  where I found the apartment where the business was and also where the Temple was  which is now a Russian style office building  I couldnt communicate in either English or German.
So my father said  in Jewish  he says  dont leave it alone  because they dont understand the difference anyway  between Polish and Russian  theyre French  you know?
So I say  ﬁyes.ﬂ So she say  ﬁYou want to come in because some Russian come in and they make us some trouble  and we can't speak with them.
In the beginning  we had a Russian colonel -- a Russian general -- living with us.
Well  we went back to my husban ds hometown  which originally was in Germany  but after the second World War was given to Poland   and the name  in German its Gleiwitz and it was changed to Gliwice in Poland   and it was under the Russian influence.
By the end  when the German and Russian army came closer  they wanted to get -- cover up what they did  I guess  and the people from Kaiserwald  they organized groups of 40 men each day.
No  no  it happened that  because it there were they brought they were telling a story  they brought Russian prisoner s of war to dig the ditches for that.
He was worki ng he with them  he he he was helping during the 1905  1905 there was a revolution in Russia  and in Lithuania it took a national character; Lithuanians against the Russian suppression.
So  fo r example  the prisoners of war who had been killed  are not recognized the victims of the war to that kind of some kind of the defense that Russian would  after finally admitting that it was Russians  at first they said th-the the German forces came with the po the Russian prisoners of war who are in Russia.
But Yugoslavia was created so let's use the Yugoslav language which was Serbo -Croatian.
But when he was in a period of depression  he uh just said  fight to the last man  or something like that  you know  and in Russia  an awful lot of Germans died- soldiers died because  the Russian winter  because Hitler was in a period of depression at that time.
And so the Russian Army gave him some shoes and they gave me a pair of bo ots.
I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day  I got acquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in civilian clothes.
The  my father spotted a Soviet soldier and at that point we knew that the Russian army had come into our area and they were pressing forward towards Kovno  and they were  we were 07:28 behind the lines  once we were behind the lines we were free  so we came out of the hole and we no longer had to stay in that hole.
Can you tell me about that  like what kind of preparations you made to run to the Russian side  what you took?
And...uh...We proceeded  the Russian and I  to make a very simple deal.
So then actually  was it all over that only the Russian army and the Russian people liberated Prague and Czechoslovakia .
The -- there were some number of people who we re Communists  they were happy that Russian came  and -- I really dont know   it was -- that was our immigr ation  you know  we live in one room  we didnt have -- we didn t own anything.
They used to say to everybody that they're sending us to work  to the Russian front or to camps  but never they're going to kill us.
And then when the Russians came  then Do you remember seeing Russian soldiers?
So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian -- to Czechoslovakia  to some of the other Russian countries  whatever  and learn how to run a -- an 36 outs -- what I would call a hotel that caters to dignitaries.
If he agrees to this they could let him go and he joined the Army  goes to the Russian front  gets killed.
We also had a young French soldier who fell in love with his girlfriend  a Russian girl  who had to be in the American zone in order to be able to immigrate to the United States.

And after their the show  th at they were putting up a show in the theater  they were saying  the reason we are entertaining  and were going around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking prisoners for work.
there was a big coffee house there  where there were Russian spies  German spies  you name it.
The uprising was before -- before the -- the see -- about a month before the uprising  they came -- Russian Jewish prisoners of war  to Sobibor  from Minsk.
Uh we have some books by Russian  also Maxim Gorki they start to give us  uh some French also if I recall  Jaures  if I recall.
To each other they spoke Yiddish  but to me they always sp oke Russian  and we lived in a -- in Latvia .
Well  the Uzbeks are... Well  first of all  we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian.
>> Sam Ponczak: I went to first class t o the Russian school.
The school was very nicely organized  we had dormitories where we stayed all the time and we were lear ning Russian and also specialty in locomotive work  locomotive engineering  building cars  railroad cars  and after that to work on the railroad.
And another day later  in the morning  there were Russian soldiers with little carriages and horses  and women soldiers --we called them \ Marushas\  --later in the yard.
And then  at that time  the Russian the Germans  yo I mean   they were desperate  you know  I mean  they took just like with me with that German person I asked to lead me the way.

I was  you know  assigned  working with the -- with the -- we call that the internal police -- with the Russian internal police.
Uh  then another incidents come into my mind; and it was on June the 22nd  first anniversary of the Russian -German war  I traded --I don't know anymore what it was --for eight kilogram of flour the day before.
And Babi Yar was babi in Russian and Ukrainian means grandmother  and yar means a forest.
And the stopped the whole army  the Russian army  and he screams in Russian...he's Jewish and he's liberated and he is kissing this cop  this Russian  and the whole army stopped.
But I never went  but they were giving and the Russians told us  if we catch anybody entering on the ship with Russian money  you go back to Siberia.
But at that moment when I was there  the Russian soldiers were there  prisoner  also sneaked out and we went to the forest.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 3 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: And  tell me about-- C: One second. (
And after we got th ose two Russian girls and they occupied Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 81those two rooms under the roof  I didn't have a place to stay  so the old Mrs. Ratzfeldt said I could live in the room where her son used to live.
And this was his greatest and most horrible heartache  when one day he arrived home  because we had these safe houses  what they called the International Ghetto  what it wasn't  it was given to us and not bought  by Christians and Jews who didn't wanted their houses and villas on both sides of the Danube to fall in Russian  in uh  German hands.
But the Russian forces that came so rapid-rapidly they advanced they had to pull out fast.
Uh...There we were taken into an office and we thought of course  it would be right to take the hat off  and he told us in Russian  \ This is not a church.
I didn't spoke Russian  but I understood Russian from my parent s. And I try to explain to him that he's sick and this -- he told me  \ Go there.\
And they were so cold the Russians  so they sat down and they said thank you and uh I picked up naturally a few Russian words then and almost talked  not at that time but after  and they left so then Joseph came down and said I take you up to an apartment.
At the time you left  if someone was to ask how you identified yourself  did you still think of yourself as a Russian emigre  or were you thinking Yes  yes  yes.
So I said now there is a whole -- they've come as far west as the border of Germany and a bunch of them are up in a town called Stettin  that's the collecting point  and at that point these Palestinian guys can't come into the Russian zone of Germany or the American zone of Germany  so there are some of us here who are helping them.
And one Sunday his brother came over  with a pair of horses  a wagon  and took me took me to his village  and he kept me til end of the til til the Russian came in  til 44.
So you were a part of the Russian army in Manchuria.
So ah Moroccan  black guys  Russian girls  and it was an absolute holiday spirit with all these people laughing at not understanding what's happening to them.
And then came two Russian airplanes  and they started strafing the lo comotive.
Nineteen...maybe early 1915  1916; and after the Russian revolution in 1917  he decided to stay in Moldavia.
I was working like nothing would happen  but over there one Sunday the Russian partisan went to the village  they had a good time with the girls.
The army  the Russian may not be good enough  but they'd send me to school to learn how to read and write.
Even though she was persecuted  she would tell us that the Russian people were very suffering people.
And the person was a Russian officer who escape d from  a few POW's were in this village with the Germans and he managed to escape  they were kept in a barn and he was hiding  so I noticed him and I was very happy because you have somebody to  of course it was dangerous  but the Germans were down in the village  I says  uphill.
So we look out  and on top of that farm  a Russian co lumn  military column pass by  and one was shooting the pigs with a machine gun  and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as they ro -- drove by.
And the entire ensemble died  because they -- except me  because they tried to flee on th e Gustloff  Wilhelm Gustloff  the ship that was sunk by a -- by a Russian torpedo.
Couple days later came a order that they have to leave the that the Russian army is going to take over Volary   and the Germa and the American army had to evacuate.
The Russian soldiers  wherever they were  when somebody wanted to come this way  the Russians said go back.
I know what you mean  they were this felt kind of how is it said in Russian  the [indecipherable] so far away I-I dont remember how [indecipherable] says.
>> Susan Taube: And gave it to some of the Russian soldiers there.
Well  the fact that my father opened a store  I remember  and I remember Russian soldiers coming in.
All of the sudden  I hear  there was one morning  like a rattle  like a  like noise outside  and I look outside  and I saw a tank  but  and I recognized the Russian insignia.
21ﬂ ﬁTack sa mycket 22ﬂ 20 No (Russian) 21 Milk (Swedish) 22 Thank you (Swedish) 28 means ﬁthank-you ﬂ and ﬁbrod 23ﬂ is ﬁbread.ﬂ And as he walked in  I started to throw these out at him  ﬁMjolk  tack sa mycket.
That was the only time I was in jail  in a Russian jail for 24 hours  interrogated.
He died -- I don't recall but it was during the Russian occupation and he was buried in a grave yard.
So they ask the government  the Russian government to do that.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
Sometimes when -- My wife also spoke Russian  it was -- it was Leve [indecipherable].
I had a guy  Captain Trusoff   who was in charge of financial department  and he would give me extra coupons because we wore Russian cards at that time.
I remember there was a crown council [indecipherabl e] after the Russian [indecipherable].
You know  at any costs  so he decided that it was worth to run the risk and take us without permission to Romney and during the trip he turned to us and said  this friend of yours who speaks perfect Russian  they'r e Danish Jew  by the way  but born in Russia  he was a corespondent of the Danish state journalist in Moscow.
I'm curious about what else the Russian said  what was that scene  like when the Russian soldier gonged the be ll.
In the middle of the night the Russian soldiers came and said that they are...they heard that they are very nice...was looking girls slee ping here and they wanted to come in there and we started to scream and yell and luckily this time  I knew very well Russian; so I went to this doctor  in the middle of the night  to the co mmander of the Russians and I explained to him that we ar e all full of typhoid and we are going to the Russian hospital  so luckily he put a guard and no Russian soldiers came to disturb us because unfortunately a lot of survivors were ra pped by those soldie rs.
And once we find a truck with -- a Russian truck with soldiers  full with equipment  and full with food  and full with everything.
And I...I just didn't like to see Russian soldiers  to be honest.
And among them was one USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 33 Russian captain  who had -- a Russian captain -- Paturski  we -- Sacha we call him.
Yeah  there were some for instance  there were some some Jewish families changed their house language  their family language from Yiddish to Russian  and Lithuanians resented that  you know  he he they give up Yiddish  why then dont they dont pick up Lithuanian?
But this 03:25army - the Poli sh army doesn't matte r because it was under supervision of the Russian army.
Were you American  Jewish Am erican  Jewish American of Russian heritage.
The Russian  Americans  they don't let them breathe; 24 hours a day  every da y 2 o'clock in the morning  you can see for yourself the lights.
As soon the Russian came and settled their government  I went b ack to school.
A Russian soldier carried me on his arms and brought me to that little house.
If the Russian Jews were still there  I do not know.
Bu t a friend of mine came to the typhoid barracks two days later  when I became conscious and she brought me a piece of  sort of a slice of white bread which the Russian army had brought in for us.
Until the Russian Army will enter maybe  and occupy this territory.
We were taken from Banska Bystrica by a Jewish partisan who was part of the Russian partisan movement.
37 But when the Allies Russian were pushing  then they send us.
And at that time  I dont know I if it was Russians or what  but we we were sitting on these benches type of thing against the wall and wa I I all I remember is my father stood up to  I think it was a Russian  they wanted the watches and the jewelry  and theyre women.
He got the night stick  a piece of cloth which says that he was a Jewish police i n three languages  interestingly enough : Hungarian  German  and Russian.
And Adolf we learned had been in the Russian camp and died.
Now  in the -- there were no secrets from me  so I saw that this will not be a life for me  and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see  in Russia  in the Russian system there were three kinds of people.
The Nazis didn't want to go to the Russian front  so they built and they expand  and they said they need this and they took out more people in order to escape from the Russian front.
My parents spoke Yiddish amongst themselves a nd the whole family spoke Yiddish.
I have one other person that I probab -- I caused the death of another person  probably of a Russian prisoner.
Historically  to put it in perspective  the Russian army is -- offensive is moving ever closer.
But if the Russian soldiers  Russian boys  eh  partisans figured they'll come here wherever it was and they knew there were girls so they figured they're going to rape them a few  you know.
Ours was I told you fabrics  fabrics there were many living Russian people.
It was a dogfight  the Russian planes came right to the place where the pilot parachuted.
The defeat and disarray -- the ray -- the way a -- on that front -- on -- on the Russian front  the army.
For from time to time  because my mom fluently Spoke Russian?
So the people who took Russian passports were later not allowed to go back to Poland.
They came  and I met first military -- first Polish police  who entered this territory  because aha  when the Russian came  and we wanted to go  they say milsha minadda.
And I felt I was really taki ng to Russian  everybody was pleased.
The Russian army  Yugoslavian army  to take us to the station.
This is when I start to realize  Im not French  Im not American  Im not Russian  Im Jew.
Yes  there were Jews in Italy  and we went through exactly what everybody else in Germany and Poland that they -- you know.
I met the Jewish girl  Russian soldier  in a couple days.
And nobody everybody looked in them  and we kept on saying a guy came over to me  he says to me [Russian]?
I was telling them that at that time we had already a part that the Russians soldiers were he was the Platon was the main leader there  his name  I still remember the name  because I was fighting with the Russian  I said  if you do something wrong to me  Ill take you to Platon   I will tell him  that what what you did  you know.
And we worked there a short time  and again the Russian came closer.
I mean  I had this Russian kitchen  that was my main job from f-five oclock in the morn ing til whenever the last dish was handed out and the kitchen wa s clean  okay?
Um  you know we are grateful to every soldier that came in  whether it was French or English or Russian or a wonderful American soldiers that came in and talked to us like human beings.
They wanted my mother to say good  because then they traded us in for the Russian  for Berlin .
But two days later the Russian came  so we came down.
Before I go to the Warburg Estate  a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia  go back to Latvia  go back to the Soviet Union  et cetera.
He says  ﬁYou killed your brothers  sisters  and -- and -- and -- and you want now to escape with the Germans?ﬂ This was my first encounter with the German -- with the Russian army.
Nobody...but uh even if they knew they couldn't do nothing  because I was mostly...I came from the Russian army to the to the Polish army  you know.
So a representative of the Soviet POWs  Ukrainian officer  when he heard that I spoke Polish  for a minute we attempted to converse in Polish.
I went to get some bread  came back  and the Russian arrived at the home.
Here  the Nazis were afraid of the underground activities  of the Russian front approaching and everything  so they came to th e conclusion that they ought to take and break up the Polish work details work units and bring some Jews in for them not to be as comfortable and not to be able to do the work that they were afraid of  as far as uprising.
That was the last time I saw my dad   when he left with the Russian Army.
When he came back from Russian POW camp  he was not a healthy man anymore and he didn't become healthier during that time  except it helped him that he lost a lot of weight.
He picked him because he was not from our town and he said to him  Sholom [Russian words You will go with me] (?) (
So we went from the Russian zone  into the American or the British zone.
The direct  closest country was Poland and Poland would not permit the passage of Russian units across it's territory to 01:21 help Czechoslovakia  under no circumstances.
And I know the incidents of people who was one professor that I read somewhere that small story  one professor at the University of Lvov  they were talking about one of the uprising in in Poland in the [indecipherable] what they said congress was a part of Russian Russian part of Poland who stepped up the activities  and they said  where I where are you sons  they asked the prof essor.
And during the Russian occupation from 1939 to 1941  uh the Russian authorities go after talent and recognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage.
So the Jews were in quite a minor ity at that -- in that part of Germany?
He withdrew Russian American rockets and bombs from Turkey  and Khrushchev withdrew them from this from Cuba  and everything was settled.
Well  of course  the teachers were our old teachers  but at least once a week we would have to have special classes  where they would try to convince us of what a wonderful country  what a free country Russia is  how how advanced  how of course  we knew better  even though we were children.
A lot of them ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war.
We just took off the striped dresses.ﬂ She happened to know a little bit of Russian  but we were in the concentration camp.
And I was inter -- always interested photography  and he was a Russian Jew who had lived in Belgiu m most of his life  who was involved in un -- during World War two  in a spy group  work ing against the Germans  that operated in France  and in Belgium.
So we took -- I said  ﬁWhats going to be if he catch you?ﬂ The Russian is out - downstairs  you could see they working with the car.
But a couple hours later we saw a jeep full with soldiers came  Russian soldiers...and they told us that the 7 war was over right here in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want to.
No  actually I don't th ink anybody was talking about it because  of course  these Thomas Buergenthal 21 November 28  1995 Page 21 people had come out of a Russian concen tration camp  they ha d gone through the entire war  they knew what it was all about.
He was  I gather he got involved in the Russian something or other as well and he had to flee and he fled...it was very early times.
And you think it was because he was Jewish that they–?
We were busy with the Russian Jews and Jerry was busy with Russian -- with Poles  not -- not even Jewish Poles  Polish people.
Germans absolutely unprepared to survive Russian  Siberian type of the weather.
What was it like now that you got Russian troops in control?
For that school year   I had to learn Lithuanian and Lithuanian history.
Ve ry few trees to stop th e wind and the wind was blowing and then we heard the Russian planes over and some bombing by the Russian planes and I said  well maybe they  they goi ng to catch up with us  but  they didn't.
No  this was different part of Poland  that was . . .
That's how my liberation Š I do have to insert  that I do remember one Russian solider  officer on a horse  which to me looked pink.
There were  every few wagons  or yes   yes  I call it wagon  there were guards  Russian military guards.
And  of course  Hitler sounded fiercely enough  was fiercely  and even had a chance in an American view and through some trickery he still could  with the help of Russian  of course  win  you know.
They had taken this  and with them came the Russian Flea Ci rcus  who had been brought by the Germans to Russia to work there.
But the Latvians who had gotten out of Latvia included a number of Hitler sympathizers  as we ll as some people like ourselves  who just want to -- to avoid living under Stali n  who were basically decent people.
And my husband says to him  \ Listen  is there any Russian soldier here that maybe knows Yiddish?
Mother  on the other ha -- hand  came from the so-called Russian part of Poland  so she spoke Russian in addition to her USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 7 Polish.
And we were surrounded by Russian soldiers dressed in white and that was -- that was the liberation.
The Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi Party for anot her reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the street where the Legation was...at the very end of the street...the street was three hundred 44 meters long  there was a Russian tank with th e mouth of the cannon facing the street which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dare d to leave and go on the street.
As a result  you would live under Russian occupation until June 1941.
So  here here were  lets see  girls uh-huh  Russian grab Poland.
No  its ju -- so  I stayed here -- I slept there and eventually we -- you know  they was -- came in -- the Russian took over this -- after a couple weeks  the Russian took over the city and I was still in -- in Proushinna and my job was that Im to try and get all 67 - mostly identify all the collaborators.
So he was the -- he became a different man and he chose later  if you want to finish his story  his story didnt end yet  cause when we entered -- when we came to the parti -- pa rtisan -- we met partisans  Russian partisans  they sort of were very anti-Semitic  but they [indecipherable] you -- you have to -- you have no arms  you know  youre not armed.
Igor  when I came to them was plain Russian  all from Moscow.
I mean it's a. But that was still under Russian occupation.
And I ended up in Linz and I couldnt go any further because there was the Russian zone in between.
Well  when we were with the partisans  we didnt hear either you know  from the Russian side.
But they were like behind the Russian armies who they kept an eye on them  actually.
Was a fight  and where je the village  what we was there  the Russian took over  and we was very happy about it.
I was speaking  I was  used to the Library of Congress to one man who is who knows Russian  not sp great.
Then we drove into the Russian lines  and Terezin had been liberated by the Russians just two days before I came there.
And I remember we coming back  I dont know if he was talking Russian.
He said that this Russian man said to him  ﬁDyadya   uncle  would you share some bread with me?ﬂ So my brother as he was taught by my mom  he took the loaf of bread  he broke it in half  handed it to this stranger.
We were not permitted to get out  it was November  but we sa w across the our train a train with Russian prisoners  in open cattle cars  and we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one bread in each car and these peopl e were starved to death   woul d start fighting and the minute they would start fighting  then SS said mutiny and would take their machine guns and Brrrrrrr.
It was like the small bin that is I've seen here in this country  and a Russian soldier actually st rapped it on his wrist Bill Benson: Like a watch.
They put the Polish people again[st] the Ukraine  the Ukraine again[st] Poland...uh...again[st] Polish people  and each other begin to kill.
Because the Russian who been born 50 years ago is now a man of 50 years.
But its really very  very big.ﬂ Well  this was my opportunity to see this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh  ar -- that was a sunny day and oh  I was so happy.
>>Bill Benson: And since you had been with the partisans  were you -- did the Russian -- regular soldiers treat you well?
Germans invaded Poland   so -- and then the Soviets invaded Poland.
But as I walked down the steps going to the guy whos waiting for me in the house before the car  a Russian soldier comes up the steps.
The Russian found her an d took her to hospital  and she stay in hospital six months.
Because -- Oke -- -- the Russian missile did not ignite the fourth stage  so it never got into orbit.
We arrive in Pomerania and there's cows  sick cows and sick pigs and sick things  you know  and they want  needed food for Russia so what they did is they opened a cheese factory  where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with it  so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the Germans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the stalls from the cows  everything.
She on the of the day I think th e day  a couple hours later  before the Russian came in  a guy recognized her and he called a a German  they kill him kill her.
I wonder though that kind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about seeing the Russian soldiers and the German soldiers and you must have seen many bodies in the camps.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: He served four years  two years on the Russian front and two years in the Italian front.
We  through power of attack  which were otherwise  everyone of us was given a piece  it looked like a white piece  they used to call it in Russian  \ towel \    that's the plastic explosives as we call them of today.
Also  at this time  after I got married  my husband didn't want to wait for the Russian and we should  the UNRA should support us  so he  there was an organization called ORT  it was a Jewish organizati on  they had all kinds of courses and one of the courses was des igning and sewing on a machine.
As soon as the Russian troops go out and the civil government sets in  well start the same thi ng as we lived in 1940.
Let me ask you one question relating to the year during which Bukavina was under Russian occupation.
You know  his plans where to take me with him to his hometown  escape and go to his hometown and  of course  he knew that I spoke Russian.
So -- th e Russian uniforms were cloths of cotton  yeah.
Apparently some Russian soldiers  drunk soldiers came into the apartment and started beating on the door.
And that is  of all these betrayals that were talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government  what was left of it  betrayal by the  you know  small group of lets say refugees from tsarist Russia  who liked the idea of Russian domination  even if it was with their internal enemies before  betrayal by the Jewish community  or betrayal by Lithuanian Gentile Lithuanians  ethnic Lithuanians  who were communists themselves.
And she said  when th e Russian Greek no  when the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox pre prince said to his son  whom he sent to Italy to study  remember son  you are a Pole.
So the Polacks were afraid  so they were quiet  and the White Russian didnt say anything because they wanted to become higher and higher.
Someho w  we managed a little bit better because we didn't have this anti-semitism that used to be before the Russian ca me in.
But I sent these German trucks up to Soldenburg   which was just beyond the American Occupied Zone of Germany and into the Russian Occupied Zone.
This time the Russian war w ith the Germans still friends until 1941 - June the twenty-second started the war.
>> Bill Benson: There's more to it than that  because -- if I can share a little bit  the young women were worried about the Russian soldiers that were around  so -- >> Susa n Taube: We had to protect ourselves very much.
He was working as a medic in the Russian Army  I think  or whatever.
Some were in Yiddish  some were in Polish  some were in Russian and German.
The German people packed their wagons because they wanted to go west away from the Russian army.
Actually Pepi  she saw all kinds of people from  from the Jewish community a nd they were also American Jews  English Jews  French and Russian -- in all the armies.
The Russian doctor came  and without any anesthesia without anything she came and cut  I have marks.
And we were told by some Russian officers to stay where we are because it hap- pens quite often that the Russians have to retreat because all of a sudden the Germans are pushing them back  so we were still staying at the farm for the next five days and then a few days later we decided to go back to see what happened to the ghetto.
So their representative immediately continues in Russian  and the Czech guy in Czech.
Being I was on the Russian side  we had to go to a draft board.
I feel so  that they threw less shells on the Russian territora territory than the Germans.
The parents spoke between themselves in Russian  and sometimes in Polish  but with us they all spoke Polish.
The only thing I really remember from that ride is th at we came to a place in a train station where some Russian prisoners were able to walkup to our train and there were some port holes in our cattleOq # 513 trains and warned U5 to see and try to...try to escape if we could because...uh...they said if you are Jewish and you are .. going to Auschwitz or Birkenau  that's where they kill them Oq » D all.
>> Bill Benson: David  in our remaining time  you're in the woods hiding with the two Russian prisoners of war.
So we left and my sister -- and I was very  very sick  the -- again we met another Russian  because the Russian liberated that area and there were lot of fighting and took me to Danzig and left me on the steps of the hosp ital.
I -- I had in school German  when I was still in school.
When we came into Poland  our language at home was Yiddish but we also spoke Romanian.
How would y ou characterize the American program?ﬂ He said  ﬁOur program is just as methodical  if not more so than the Russian.
And  they also  of course introduced all Russian history and Russian  and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda.
This happens to be a battalion that had just come from the Russian front and they were pretty decimated.
Russian Jews  and I quite active now with Russian Jews  they expect much more.
They said no  they had been forced to do that and in certain briefs...I saw that just recently again...they even trie d to sell  to tell what a kind of a sanitorium it was they had created for us in in Au schwitz  and another interesting facet of that which 52 their lawyers found that if they ha dn't uh taken us as slaves in in Auschwitz  then we under normal conditions probably would have to go to the Russian front and could have been killed there easily so I say this is something which is is unbelievable.
Also  there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border  it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates.
I said we're going to run trucks for 150 miles through the Russian zone  across the Polish Russian border  come down through the Russian zone to Berlin.
So I remember an American o fficer was saying  \ Are you sure you want to go back into the Russian zone?
The French did it in another way  till now  but the Russian song \ Katusha\ .
But I do nt rec they certainly wouldnt write about that  so I just know that we were knew the how the the Russian forces were advancing  and that was our prime concern  you know  how quickly will this be over.
And one soldier says  oh  you are from this region of Russia.
Uh Russian baths are...they give you uh little wooden pails and there's hot water and cold water.
And she met her husband there on the ship  which they got married  they went to Palestine  and of course he went right away to war there when he arrived  cause he was a officer in the Russian army.
In Russia and they started you know he started communicating what us.
Uh  and I... I mean  I graduated from Washington University a Phi Beta Kappa  got a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to Harvard  got a Masters in Russian studies from Harvard--but still as a nonperson.
So I again open my mouth; and I said  \ In this case  if I have to take over Russian village who has to be exchanged for Russian general  so I want.\
But what this means  they must invent -- they must invent a town which is under Russian occupation so nobody can control them anymore.
This is where we were located and they  they told us not to go in groups because the Germans will think it's military and they will start shooting so I ran and all these people ran after me and we came to a small town already Russian occupied.
And from '40  I worked under the Russian regime in a factory.
They now have documentaries  they have films  they have books  they came out with everything  and then they invited Gee and Nina  and they took Peranga with them  because after all  Per was the nearest one working with Raoul  and also they have a secretary who called Sonya Sonenfeld  who is Russian born  and they took her so that nobody can cheat when they talking Russian.
And the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um village is coming here as an exchange for the Russian...for the German generals. \
I mean  I was from Europe  I was Jewish  I spoke Yiddish  and that was it.
And on the other hand  the only one who believed it  accepted it as fact  was Ivan Maisky  the Russian mbassador  who probably had known by his own experience that the extermination of peoples is possible  even by so-called civilized countries.
And Yi-Yiddish didnt didnt bother anybody  Hebrew didnt bother anybody  but Russian  why Russian  you know?
In the beginning maybe there were some Germans who were against Hitler.
In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language  along with the German language  which was okay.
I didn't look  I didn't know him  and again  how we ll do you know Russian?
Over here the Russian com-comi-comisseriate   the police  and over here was a private house.
We knew only this side  the east  the Russian  the Russian army.
So  my father along with a few men  got a bus and a driv er  and decided to leave town  and go to the other side so to speak  you know  to the Russian side  which would be occupied by the Russians  and see what happens.
No  as I say  in the central part of Poland .
Was it the Ukrainian border  or was it because Was Poland .
was a Russian  and he killed him in the st reets of Paris.
And I dont -- maybe they are Polish or they are Soviet.
That what w e had to deal with from then on  for some time  simply bec after finding out that we could leave th-the Russian free labor camps jurisdiction  then we could we still needed assistance  so the army units were op en  fed some of the civilians.
So we stopped the soldiers to ask them  to question about the life in Russian.
Russian  or Ukrainian  its very similar  you know  you can recognize  you can understand.
You know  you you almost address the next question I was going to ask  which is when did you learn Russian?
Renaissance and the Napoleonic era did not come to Russian occ upied Poland at all.
So what the Russian  was a very smart thing what they did  they went -- before Krakow they went to the north  and then they surrounded  and they came into Krakow from the west.
It was supposed to be a barricade before the onslaught of the Russian army.
That's the Russian  from west  you know  all the way from the eastern part.
My husband continued to work with the children home because there was one or two place where immediately when the Russian army arrived here people was running out and left the children without any help.
Lets say  we drew conclusions what was happening in the eastern front  when we saw trains going through Warsaw with the German sol German soldiers  you know  that no ears  no noses  no hands  because of the frostbites  from that famous Russian general.
But in that train with me  there was a lot of Russian I know what they were looking  they were looking for deserters  mostly deserters.
1: Every Russian citizen is now allowed to look for their dead person.
A Russian soldier came and picked me up  carried me  with one hand like a sack of potatoes.
She spoke Polish  Russian  German; I think she spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a couple of other languages.
And now we have like an a different thing in that are you Russian?
I dont know why I was called for -- by such a Russian name  Claudia.
There was still 16 000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp because it was in a Russian zone.
And so did the Ukrainians in their own language and so did the Pols.
He fought on the Italian front and also on the Russian front.
The Russian came from one side  and th e German come in from the other side.
At home we spoke Yiddish  Hebrew and Russian more than Polish.
A. All our books -- that was a Russian bomb and the Russian bomb never went all the way down to the basement like the American and British.
On the west was Germany  and on the east was Russia.
I said  no  no  Im sorry to tell you  but Im a Russian officer.
Polish Ukrainian became Soviet Ukrainian and Polish Jews from there were -- and Poles  not just Polish Jews --.
They brought a lot of Russian bullets  and they were rusty.
Later we complained to the Russian foreign minister  of course  didn't help.
I wanted to ask you too -- did you ever regret that you came back from the Russian border and didn't go to your uncle in Moscow?
So they were talking to the Russian government  and the Russian Russian allowed more freedom  and better better conditions and better pay  and everything else.
But he was Polish  he spoke Polish  he identified with the Polish state.
And in the light of the jeep you saw these Russians  not the  the Russian horses  small horses  these wagons coming back.
I dont know how to I understand Yiddish  and now when I am working with Russian refugees  they are very happy when they hear.
Told me to lie down with my face down and started to inter...who I am and so I told him look  uh Romanian...now I told immediately I'm a Romanian physician  you know  and he said uh...he used the term evrei Evrei is a Russian term for Jews  but not derogatory.
They won't have to listen to the... We always... When the Russian were fighting we were always behind them.
In the Russian time my father worked freel y  and food was available  and fe -- they did not prosecute Jews.
Again  I was in one of my little graves  and I was very ill  I don't know how long  but it was the spring of -- it was spring  I don't remember  and there I was and all of a sudden somebody was shaking me  and there were these two pair of boots  that's what I saw from my vantage point  and these were two Russian soldiers  and they kept saying  \ devushka  devushka  little girl  little girl\  and they shook me  and I finally woke up  and I was very ill  and they took me to a military hospital.
So  we came into the Joint Distribution  and there is a American colonel  and I say  look  Im a a Russian and Jewish officer in the Russian army  and I would like to you should help me to flee  and I I have my relatives in Cuba   and I I just would like to get away  because I explained to him  I say  Im going to be very openly where you open with you  I am truthfully I mean  its I they I have no use any more to be here.
Then he was in the Russian army  then they transferred him as a Polish citizen to the Polish army  and he finished the war  and he survived. [
Til I was three or four years old  I only spoke Russian and then one day  my fath er came  and said ﬁWe have to speak Polishﬂ because Vienna was   you know  at time  it was like in between  it was Russian  it was Polish  now it is Lithuanian and eac h countries brought their language so we had to read  know  a lot of languages  so then I started to speak Polish; and  I was sent to a private school  only for Jewi sh children  but we were taught only Polish  but we had lessons in Hebrew and in the religious instructions so ‚til I went to the ghetto  I only spoke Polish.
And ye hit and the Russian came  and then Hitler came  so So your father was a Zionist  your family wa Oh yeah  he was ma my father was a big mathematical  and a big languages  he was by 18 years he was a bookkeeper.
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
And we were allowed to speak English only with the linguist  with the Russian lang -- And we had two students and one linguist and we changed every hour for five hours every day.
And the Russian  and I spent a lot of time in the Soviet Union and the Russian people are remarkable people in many ways so it  it  intuitively I  I just picked the right country to be particularly interested in.
Crying) (Sigh) See the Russian when they freed us  if they would've come in and take everybody out  you know  like a child.
There were only Brick buildings there  I understand that these buildings were made for the Russian prisoners of war and then  when they were moved  they others moved in  you know.
And he put that for the officers too  the Russian [indecipherable] always a different  for the officers  and for the Soldiers.
We came -- we came with -- previously I told this story  that the Russian smuggled us to his cr -- tr ain compartment  and we arrived in Berlin and he let us off at the station  and we were standing there  and sort of sizing people.
A nd my father spoke Russian very well  because he served in south imperial army  and they became friends  and that Ivan  as we called him  came and went.
What happened was  they had Russian Jews living in there before  and wa and then when the announcement came that German Jews are coming  they killed all those Russian Jews.
So he got me a horse and wagon with a soldier  Russian soldiers  and without a stop that horse and wagon took me about 20 kilometers to the Hungarian border  to Red Cross  to you know  for hospital for Russian soldiers or some civilians.
When that Russian sees that...he was not a tall man  the Hungarian fellow...he picked him up like that and where did you get that coat?
And on the 18th of January  I know that we went out from the house where we lived and the professor who cleaned my face with his hands because we didn't have anything  suddenly I heard him saying and I seen him as now...he says  \  .ﬂ And the Russian soldiers appeared in the building.
Did you talk to any Jewish refugees at all while you were there?
Yeah  I went to Strader and I went to school  public school  and the Russian school  and . . .
As I came close to the rails  I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun from the tank pointing at them and all the Russian s with their hands up were standing in front of their building from that colum n. And I couldnt figure it out that the Germans were there already because I didnt see Germans until that poin t  that was the first tank I ever saw German except in the air  the bombardment.
Before that it was Russian  so I was rais ed in the classics of both languages.
So uh  the more we knew about the news  the uh Russian Army come closer to our border  the more we think that maybe we will escape.
That did you explain to the people where you were taking the Ru ssian refresher course that how you came to know Russian to begin with?
Becau se you know  as Polish citizens were allowed to go back to Poland after Pola nd was liberated by the Russians  parts of Poland that were liberated by the Russian s}.
I didnt recognize him because he wore the partys uniform  the red star  that was Russian.
Well  the only thing I can -- I was never told that it was because of Joseph McCarthys s-situation that my visa was delayed for so long  but it was part of life  an ex-Russian  speaking Russian  must be a Communist.
You have to take [indecipherable] something  thats my mother finished a Russian high school  and a Russian university in Kharkov  in Ukraine.
So we -- we were supposed to go bbackwards when -- when the ger -- ger -- Russian army came.
He was crossing from the German side to the Russian side.
I heard that if...I don't know how many miles...10 miles  20 22 miles from here  there is a Russian hospital and they will accept you there.
So you did you point the the Russian soldiers in the direction of where the Germans were?
And so  as -- as we got there  the Russian guard immediatel y enlisted us to also help carry out equipment from the -- they were dismantling the entire hospi tal and we had to go in and carry out whatever medical supplies and -- and so on.
Between those soldiers was an officer  and he wanted to marry -- >> Bill Benson: These were Russian soldiers?
How far did you run before you knew that theŠjust  you said something about two days  but how far did you get away from your town be fore– Not far  not far because right away we could hear on the radios  the Russian armys coming.
No  no  there was a -- second class cars and -- but I remember arriving in -- the Russian winter  as you know  starts fairly early  so it was the latter part of November  1940  in Novosibirsk where the train stopped  and it was about 40 below.
She was orphaned very early  I don't know if she told you that  but she was about six years old when her mother passed away  mother and one brother went with the Russian flu  so she was very young at the time.
They put me into this thing  into the Russian camp because  not because  I dont know.
And to villa  and there was the British some I dont know what [indecipherable] probably the secret service  or whatever they have and some Russian White Russian  who left Russia when the Bolshevik took over the power.
I start with Russian  Yiddish  English  Hebrew  some Japanese and -- not fluent  some Chinese  not fluent.
And after this  there was a struggle between the fraction [NB: faction] of the underground; between the Russian fraction and the English fraction.
But this [indecipherable] 80 men and he could resist the Russian police and everything  and You we have to no  excuse me  Im confused.
So the Russian driver which was taking said  ﬁYou yes  you can go.
My mother  you know  could speak 16 Russian and Polish or Yiddish  and well  there was the as far as I know there were no Jews in in in that area  you know  I mean the you know  so Yiddish never came up until somebody found out that I was Jewish  you know  and then they started teasing me and stuff  you know.
Yeah  Czech is more like closer to the Polish language  and Slovak more to the Russian.
So he says  you know  this is where the Jewish members of the Soviet Army -- the Jewish soldiers of the Soviet Army -- the war was over and they were crying.
I spoke Lithuanian  and little bit German  and then after the Russian  the one year Some Russian?
I lived under the Russian oppression for about ten years and again food was very scarce.
And it was just happens that it was close to the day  13th of April  1940  when the NKVD  thats the police Russian police  and some communist  local communist and translator came with early in the morning and took us came to us and said  yo u have half an hour to get up and to get down to the lorry thats waiting outside to ta ke you by train to Siberia.
At home we spoke Yiddish and when mother and dad didnt want me to understand they spoke Polish.
He said  ﬁDont you know that that is not allowed in Russian to do?ﬂ I said  ﬁ law   how should I --ﬂ (You couldnt call them   you couldnt call th em .)
I -- and a Russian soldier noticed that  that I trie d and he went -- as I couldnt speak  he went in for me and too -- and took out this suitcase for me.
So  but I -- when I was still in -- I spoke really more than Yiddish and German  because I -- before I came to Sobibor  I worked at a farm and when I came back f -- as a soldier  as a prisoner of war  I went come work at a farmer and it was a Ukrainian farmer and I worked there for two years  and -- He spoke Russian?
Thats why I refused  but h -- I have -- he recorded it with my picture  and him  and acknowledging that I was the comoon -- platoon commander  or commandeers ruddid  way they say it in -- in Russian.
Nothing against him  it was nothing against him  but they were very worried that hes a Russian citizen  whats going to be?
Oh  yes  I didnt never went into the Russian zone  and I never went into Berlin because I was told my name was on a list  and I didnt know whether this was true or not.
We have a lot of Russian emigrants  but the Russians are like the Germans  they dont speak Yiddish.
One Polish army was established in Russia  which the Russian took prisoners  most of the Polish army.
So he he hadn't got any idea  and he never acknowledged  after a year of trial  where the Americans  the English and the French  and the Russian have shown them a lot of documents  even a movie about Auschwitz .
Unfortunately  it didnt happen that way  that the first two Russian soldiers coming into the camp  instead of hugging and kissing them  and feeling free  one said to the other the word  Evrai  which was like a bad way of saying a Jew.
Again  please -- I remember that during the Russian Tsar s time  the Jewish people were not allowed to own land.
The Russian had been there  in Korolovka  since the seventeenth of uh September of uh 1939 when th ey entered the eastern part of Poland  and there was...the attitude of the Jews was not uh friendly towards the Soviets.
I didn't say  \ I'm Jewish \  because if I said the Jewish I go to the Russian army.
The second day  before we went out to the woods  two or three -- I don't remember -- two or three trucks came in with Russian officers and they told us  \ From today on you are free.
I think 15 either it was in October or November  the part of 9 blocks was separated again by barbwire and the gate was put on and on this gate they wrote that a prisoner of war camp and the Russian prisoners were brought there.
Then I went to the new school to continue the studies  the Russian studies.
And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers  and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed.
Til now we saw uniforms  German uniforms  Russian uniforms and now we got Israeli uniform -- Polish uniforms I remember.
You know  when the Russians came in  and finally I we went out and had this empty apartment  I met a Russian high ranked officer on the street  who said to the first thing he said to me is  wher e is your papa?
While I was with them  well  as soon as Brussels was liberated  eve rybody had flags on their houses  allied flags  British  French  Belgian  American  Russian -- only one on the block. [
So the whole family was walking from that town  eight kilometers  already with some Polish soldiers that gave themselves up to the Russian military  and we also walked back and as we came to the city of Rovno  there was a guard checking everyone who came back into the town.
Now why did you want to be in the Polish army instead of the Russian army?
They explained that a border crossing from Yugoslavia into the Russian ....in Austria.
And the commandant told us  look  the Russian Army is coming closer ; I have to take you back to Stutthoff.
I slowly was starting to get a little better and we made contact with some Russian officers who were coming through town and they asked us whether we would like to work for them as interpreters  being that my brother and I speak fluently Russian and German  they asked us to to come with them to help them to deal with the with the civilian 02:05: German population.
Earlier in the war you and your family lived under Russian occupation.
We started immedi ately evacuating the Russian troops  the Russian wounded patients  and I was supposed to go with the Russians  the medical corps to -- they vacated to Sebastopol.
Did they speak Polish amongst each other  or Yiddish Yeah  as a matter of fact  they spoke Yiddish normally  but Polish when they didnt want us to know what they were talking about.
87 I get out -- when I got a job  went to the Russian.
Once you were under Russian occupation during those first few period of the war  what was life like under the Russians?
And we stayed with the grandparents until we  until we went to the Russian side.
Days before the Russian came  the French workers already  you know  let us know that they coming closer.
We use to march--go by everyday a prisoner of war camp or Russian prisoners were there.
I still hear when somebody speaks to me Russian  I understand what they're saying.
But I only know one thing  that on September 1  1943  there were only two thousand five hundred German Jews left and about the same amount of Russian Jews.
`42  but in 1943 wh en...when the Russian hit back already  for good - in April  that was in April.
I know that there were some German soldiers who came on convalescent leave so it was sort of a R & R rest and recuperation place and I dont remember how many but there have been about forty or fifty or so who occupied one or two buildings there and if I remember correctly  they had all been wounded on the Russian front and so forth and they basically just wanted to get well and they didn't want to have trouble with anybody.
And my father started to work as a tailor there for the army  for the Russian army.
And it's the Lithuanian fascists  who were prepared for all the time since the Russian rule was in Kovno  secretly  by the Nazi agents to have uniforms and ammunition.
The Americans are already in   and when we heard this  we becam e alert  because we knew from the signs there that could only be what fifty or sixt y  seventy miles...uh kilometers away  so were ordered into a into a forest there to stay there for the night and a friend of mine with whom I was together from Auschwitz all the time  he had the courage to take some horse...to to get some horse meat and we were trying to make a fire in order to cook it wh ich was not easy because it was pretty wet in this this forest  and we were in the middle of preparations in order to get something to eat when all of a sudden from the back of us  obviously the Russian s opened up with heavy guns.
So  with her fluent Russian  they made her supervisor for that whole group of people who are working there My God.
Naturally  I deserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian  or the KGB would find me  they would probably hang me.
there was a situation when Sikorski met with Stalin and all the other big brass  Russian brass in in in Moscow   I think  and he asked about  where are the Polish officers?
This time  and we are talking about March  1944  and detachments of to the occupants in Russian it's so it can be translated \ Death to the occupants or the conquerors \  in English.
>> Bill Benson: Julius  your father had served in the Russian Army.
And then I went with the Russian Army  we went to Jawiszowice  walking.
The monument  I put in my familys name on the monument down there now  because in 1990  the end of October 1990  I visited Rovno again to the opening of a big monument that the Russian government put up in place where the Jews were killed.
And besides uh Russian planes were coming and bombing the highways  so we went off the road and uh we were hiding somewhere  you know  in the grass and I remember  at one time they said these troops  the Hungarian troops...they stopped on the highway and the Hungarian...some of the soldiers were coming towards us because we were near a little lake or something  and they were coming closer and closer.
And I remember the Polish person  and often when we go to out in the evening in Vienna  we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were not going to defect.
And so she said to me  look  we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who who fled  and who are hiding in our in this in this camp.
S: By now I am still having the Russian way  Sulamit  because I came here with papers  Russian papers  so it was written Sulamit.
Or our native country  which was the Poland that was under German occupation.
And then in 39  Poland was divided  and Wiln a start to be Russian  and wars -- and Warsaw is Poland.
And just so we're clear  pogrom is from Russian word  an organized attack either supported by the government or engineered by the government.
When I came hom e  I told my father that I wanted to go to Russia.
Yeah  I want to m-mention that when I was in Rome on the Romanian passport  I went also to the Russian embassy -- to the Soviet embassy in Rome.
The first World War got 1914  and Lodz was occupied by the Russian army at thi -- this is part of the Russian sphere of interest  or kind of the s -- Poland for -- the country was divided in three parts.
One was a officer and the other was a sergeant or something from the Russian army.
While a man  a German uniform went out and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a  I believe a captain  if higher  spoke to us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were searched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that.
But the Jews  lot of the Jews went to Germany   because Germany that time got a good Yeah.
But that was the start of the Russian offensive  where the front had been stalled for all that time.
And somebody told me that he was whistling -- whistli ng that -- it was a Russian song  or -- or a French anthem  I dont know  I wasnt there.
They were showing  you know  the [indecipherable] Krakow  all the areas that were taken away from the Soviets  they were taking Russian prisoners by thousands  by thousands.
Me and Rubin and some Russian prisoners went out the barbed wire and went through the forest.
23 Where  in -- When you were in the Russian army.
Okay  maybe  but I dont know which patriot they were  but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians  of cour se  because they wanted to help the Germans  but the Germans wanted to mobili ze them to go to the army and to fight the Russian [indecipherable].
And after I saw the first Russian  I went oh  one thing I forgot.
Me -- I mean  we all we -- on Sundays  the Sunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs  Polish partisan songs  Yiddish songs.
But  in 1940  when the Russians came in  I was graduating and they pushed us to learn Russian in that one year.
I deserted in Russia  in Poland we lost  we were going back to Russian  I deserted so I throw away all my medals  who needs it  because the (911) were looking for me all over the town.
Three  Russian  and English four  because I really liked it  and I made a point of really getting it under my belt.
In 1918  he benefited and profited by the...uh... disorder because of the Russian Revolution and the .
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 50 And and a and I d I didnt tell you that  but but when we were being deported  my my little dog Tito  the chocolate eater  the Russian officer that was in charge throws it at me and he says [speaks Russian].
And we started marching  and we marched for days  and  and uh  I have no idea how many days we marched  and also uh  a couple times we went into wagon cars again  and then  we had to get off of them  and start walking again  and it seemed that to each camp we arrived  they were already overfilled with people because they condensed the camps as the Russian were coming closer  and there was no room  and uh  we were just exhausted on the road because um  we had ve ry little food  and we were just exhausted from walking  and a lot of people  while we were walking through Poland  we uh  tried to escape  thinking that they could speak the language  the Polish language  and they would run away  but we used to hear shots all through the marching as we were walking  we heard shots and we heard people being shot  and we saw how the people were falling in the ravines  ravines  in the ditches  behind trees  behind shrubs  on hills  it  it  it was like a war zone  with wounded people  and  and  and dead people all over on both sides of the roads  there were dead people who were trying to escape  and also for people who couldn't keep up w ith the march  because as we walked and we got exhausted  and our feet were killing us  and people were falling behind  and the Germans were shooting everybody who couldn't keep up with the d eath march  and this is the reason why they called that the Death March  because that so many pe ople died on that road before they arrived into a concentration camp  and this is how I arrived in Bergen-Belsen from that death march.
I mean  it was extremely interesting  but -- and by that time students were coming in and graduate students mostly from -- from Yugoslavia to Russian  so I was -- I thought it was interesting  but it wasnt fast enough for him.
But Russian was -- came very fast to me because I -- I heard around me -- a lot of people spoke do -- th-the language  so it was easy for me to -- to get to know the language and I did it very fast -- I did it -- I did it fast.
And so we were down there without food  without drink for several days until we wound up going to L otties fiances home  the Russian Jews.
So he said  then stay here  no dont go out til he til all the all the battalions come in  the Russian.
And I recall like now when was downtown  our town  was a big map of the Russian front showing how deep the German troops and others to penetrate in Russia.

You could see them  yes which we assumed were not Russian planes.
So I was walking around  hungry  without a place to stay  look into a restaurant and I've seen two Russian soldiers and  and two German girls.
He got killed with the first Russian bomb  so she got saved.
And when I came back from Riegenwald after the polkovnik was there  in about a period of three weeks  the Jewish girls are playing the piano and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls.
And th en my sisters married and as Polish Poland citizens we got out from the Russian from the Russia/Soviet Russia in the December of 1946.
We went in the woods and all of a sudden (I was very good in orienting myse lf by the stars or by the trees and so on ) and we all thought that we're going eas t to meet a Russian ar my but I stopped and I said no we're not going east  we're going north and north are the Germans.
When ghetto was starting  some couple which were Christia n and Russian and Jewish  they could choose the at least the wife could stay outside.
You see  there were not too many Jewish -- Jews when they went to the Polish army.
His name was Louie  and he was recruited into the Russian army  a-and the Russians  you know  wanted to convert  and my my Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8  2013 56 my uncle was not very religious  but he wouldnt convert.
Then slowly  slowly  now this was 39 already  close to the 40s  the Russian come in.
Or da it was Russian m oney  or Austrian money  I dont know  but the family was talking that thats st ealing.
The Russian Army liberated us on the 5th of August 1944.
You see  when -- when the war started  when the -- you know  Russian  the Russian-German war  a big army  Russian army in the first days surrendered to th e Germans.
They were sitting in the kitchen with their [indecipherable]  and there in the kitchen were also about four or five girls  uniforms  Russian officers  because they had a field hospital there  and with the fee -- and they were doctors in the field hospital  and we started to talk in between the -- the four or five girls  two of them were Jewish.
So  in Ein Karem also  there was a a its like in a valley  there was a mountain on which there was it was called Moscow B  where the Russian nuns resided since Tsarists time.
I tried to sell the -- rent the building to a Russian bakery  Jewish -- Jewish people and we signed a contract and all and they defaulted.
So I went down with this Russian to the village  looked around and later was walking on the road  not being completely sure that I survived  but I have the feeling  I think this is the moment.
We were with the gi rls  the Russian girls in the kitchen  peeling potatoes  doing other things  and was fun.
Youre being taken care of by the Russian nannies or something and then what happened.
The train  railcar that I was in was mo stly were mostly Russian soldiers  men and women soldiers.
What happened to Ruben  the young man who believed in miracles  he was going with us  with the two Russian prisoners to escape  but he got injured.
And we wanted to hike  but there were -- except for Russian military wagons  there was nobody on the ro -- on the road who would take you along  who could take you along.
And I speak fluently Russian  thats  you know  no problem for me I see.
The burned down the whole prisoner of war camp--I told you Russian prisoners in there.
And so you hadnt -- your knowledge of Russian to that point had been in verbal conversation rather than -- Just verbal  but not during my growing y ears  I didnt have anyone to talk Russian.
And I find myself in this apartment and it's facing a square  and diagonally across to the right is where the Russian soldiers are housed in some big huge building.
In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language  so we kept on going with our normal  normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages.
He special turned off the radio  for me to listen about news  the Russian uh... Then... You were getting the news from Russia through the radio?
I was already 19 years ol d. I wasnt so emotional  but my younger brother  I remember he was kissing the Russian tanks.
And we were like this we traveled for about I suppose about six weeks  till the one point we crossed a a point where the uh town where the that changed hands several times the last few days  and we crossed a little river there and we came out and this was...I still remember...I I remember the date because it was uh the Russian revolution date  of the Russian...November 7th.
So I had some sentiments to Russian culture  to Tolstoy  to to Chekhov.
Later  the Russian in ‚43  the beginning  they were sending them us by plane.
I tried to analyze why the Russian people are drinking so much  and they do a lot of drinking.
I did like the Russian language  because we also took Russian.
As a matter of fact if he said something  you speak German?
But they couldn't kill us in town because it civil people there and they couldn't -- they doesn't want to give us to deliver to the Russian  because the Russians coming from the other side.
This is the original  prayerbushka  made out by a Russian o fficer  and he was wonderful to me  because I didnt understand any Russian  and he talked Yiddish to me  or German a little bit  and he helped me so much when I was in th is lotsarett it was ca lled  in Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga.
Russian curtain we felt would set in  and it did in 1945.
It didnt had -- they portray all these -- the Russian like they would be stupid til the Sputnik come into being.
And towards us came those little Russian wagons with those little Russian horses and on top were women sitting with fantastic head drap ed into drapes that they had taken  that they had looted and it was such a  a unbelievable  colorful picture that you cannot fo rget it.
there were French  there were Russian women there  there were children  many  many child ren.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned to us that your father served in the Austrian Army.
Instead  when I spoke to the Russians  the Russian were telling us  well take you to America  and well give you good life and everything.
I also I thought to myself  it s going to come in a German guard  Im going to show them that I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives.
So what I heard about Russian occupation  I had not in Jaimalas   I havent seen any police  or I mean  soldiers coming in  or anything.
You know  and the French Communist Party were pretty strong in the country and my parents being Russian of course works as a very very big plus.
He was in the Russian army and then they took him to the Polish army.
They concentrated so many troops  Russian and Polish  to get rid of him that it was not very comfortable anymore as a unit.
We were living there for a couple weeks with a border guard  a Russian soldier.
And then we heard th at the Russian are coming  and we went back to Krakow .
In night time  take...take...uh...the wagon with the horses  put full straw on this and we will go under this straw and you will uncover us when you see the Russian Army.
But you always figured a ba -- at first they used to have a lot of people that were originally from Poland and Russia  Jews from Poland and Russia they would deport.
The turning back was not so easy because you had to go out of the Russian zone.
I heard -- he spoke in Yiddish  I could understand it  but this was not my language.
L inz Donau is where I walked across the Russian border from the Russian zone to the American zone and ended up in an old SS camp in town called Wels  W E L S  in Austria and that was the end of the odyssey as it were.
I want to live here  or so I want this for myself.ﬂ I would have gotten it  because not just that  we -- later  a Russian officer came to me and asked me my profession and so on.
The Russian front is coming near because our side only the Russians could have come because that was east.
I never seen such hatreds during the war with the Russian like I encountered in Poland.
And this one Russian sol I remember that  he took his coat  or whatever he had on top of his coat  and put it on me  you know  bi tha tha-that time I think I as I recall  I really felt scared.
They were complaining to the Russian partisans that  ﬁThey took away my pillow.
We knew that had been take n and that that certainly that they came pretty close  the Russian army close to Krackow  and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events   in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the I think  and uh reached Krackow...Krackow was only  I think  sixty kilometers from Auschwitz in the east  then a day before th at uh uh the order came not to wal...not to march out any more to the factory  and the question was what's going to happen  because certainly uh uh without knowing the uh the uh the uh thinking of the of these SS gangsters properly  what are they going to do with us  it was touch and go.
And they had Russian soldiers   and we didnt have enough water  it was hot.
A. The first day -- few days of liberation we were trying to find a place where to live and we were given  by the  by the Russian authorities -- I don't know how to call them  occupation or  or liberated -- in apartment wh ich was occupied by a German general  who ran away leaving a lot of things in tact; a lot of food  some beer  some -- a bunch of other things  which normally we wouldnt ex-- norma l people wouldn't expect to find.
Some survived who were drafted to Russian army and they survived in Russia  because like I mentioned before  we didn't have any concentration camps.
She married a Polish Jew  and she came to Wilna with my -- but she spoke only German at home and my mothe rs first language was German  but because she was educated in Russian schools  so with my father  at home with us  she spoke Russian.
In my concentration camp was 5 000 Russian office -- ar my officers.
We also supported Israel in the settling of the Russian refugees.
And two Russians were started in business  because I was  at that time I think  president of the Jewish Federation  and I went to the airport to greet two im when we took at every community at that time  took it upon themselves to resettle some Russian Jews that were able to get out of Russia where there was a lot of anti-Semitism at that time in the Soviet Union .
He was Russian soldie r. Maybe he was in capture  he was ca -- he was captured  and he escaped and this way he -- he came to this camp  I dont remember  but he -- hes arrived  too  and they got marri ed on th -- a-after the war  and we visited them  we stay in their house.
But I can tell you that after the 23 months  when the Russian army advanced  the [indecipherable] army advanced  and I remember that the first battalion who encountered us was an -- a battalion commanded by an Ukrainian major.
It seemed to me that people just I just knew what I knew of it was that Smetona   the president left  and that now I its the Russian government.
Well  in camp  the rumors were going around  and you know I was there  the war goes on  and all of a sudden we heard that the Russians are mo -- the Russian front is moving down  and how we knew that its really getting close  one Sunday  when the coal mines werent -- the coal mines were working  bu t in our free time  they take us out to dig ditches  for the army to  you know  to dig in.
And the Russian -- the war with the Russians started at that time  when I was in that office.
I think at home  they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish.
The Russian come in and close in the city any minute.ﬂ And I said  \ Where do you go  Havier?\
Once Russian general comes in and he's how dare you be barefoot.
>> Susan Taube: After the Russian front came closer  the concentration camp was liquidated.
Well  when I wasnt in -- in Germany  of course I -- I spoke Russian and I spoke Yiddish and I spoke Hebrew and I spoke a little German and I hated the language.
Do you remember when the Germans came into Lwow -- Oh  sure I do. --
And I would like to tell you  maybe  small story with three Russian officers.
Until 1917 - 1918  I think  the Russian revolution  it was part of Russia.
And they had -- also they had Russian prisoners there  pr-prisoners of war  I suppose.
He had a a charming wife  a wife of a Polish general  but a Russian Polish general.
As for us in the barn  freedom came in the last moment  and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle  leading the way to more Russian soldiers on trucks appeared and pr evented the burning of the barn  with our living corpses in it.
And so somehow she accepted that  you know  and when she was born and until 1914  that part of Poland was under Russian occupation  all you know .
And I worked there in polyclinic  but -- and during this time  when was Russian.
They didn't want to accept Soviet passport so they were sent to Siberia where my wife was born.
When the Russians came in  he used to teach them Lithuanian  and they used to teach him Russian.
And between ourselves  my friends  we spoke Polis h. My mother and father -- I was only 10 years old when my father died  they spoke Russian between themselves.
Rush -- Vienna was occupied by the Russian  so we couldnt go.
But then on on April 13th at night  another three ocloc k  four oclock in the morning or something like that  a banging sounded at the door  and the Russian troops came in  and th we were ordered to pack w ithin half an hour  and were being taken away.
By the time the Russian armies were pushing the Germans out  they had a front line to -- to consider and then the back line.
The Germans attacked the Russian s and they needed the pelts.
And  he took  and Im sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector  a nd then we had to two Leica cameras  one German and one Russian Leica  I remember  and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the house to look fo r things.
That morning I was in the house of a friend of mine for a sabbath meal Friday evening when we knew all the time that the situation was very dang erous for us there and there was a notice that the Russian chancellor had received an ultima tum from Germany for complete surrender and Churchill went on the radio while we were eating just after the lighting of th e candles and said that he had gotten an ultimatum from Ge rmany to surrender and he does not want to shed blood and that is why he surrenders and that was  that was it.
I'm a Russian uh interpreter and I'm working...which was true...I'm working for a Russian officer and he's at this and this address.
My father tried some compensation from Russian s for the ranch so Stalin told him if you want that ranch come in and live on it.
And they...when they looked out  they saw Russian tanks and uh you know  they greeted them and Adam walked over to one of the officers there.
And was he from that part of Poland   or did he come from someplace else?
Did your did anybody in your family speak Yiddish or Hebrew or anything like that?
Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 62 So  then we decided  you know  the Russian wouldnt let us go.

In Polish language and then we had to go to a different school  that we got Russian teacher in.
I couldnt figure out  I says to friends there  I says  thats the Russian?
We had a rather nasty situation where the Russians had a free month of looting and raping in Budapest because of some things that happened somebody told me wasn't true but we heard that the Germans killed the Russian delegation that came to ask for their surrender.
I don't know if you know the felt boots...those Russian felt boots  with the old galoshes that you somewhere  when you had galoshes it was better.
But I spoke Russian with my mother  I thought I could I wondered.
I met my father back when they took him away to the Russian army.
But I went to a German lycee  which was a good school  but I hated it  because after the Russian school  which was on a very high level  the faculty was the cream cup of faculty from Russia   emigres from Russia  whereas here there were how should I define it?
I loved it and I to -- and to this day we employ a lot of -- of Russian refugees and -- and I have no problem understanding them.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.

And then we 34 had a lot of problems from the Russian partisans.
There was also others  they real...they real... But when we...when we founded the kitchen  they sent me to the rich Russian Jews to get them interested  you know.
And this one guy  was a heavy  tall-se t guy and he he he was a Russian.
I went into the kibbutz  in -- to work in the hospital b ecause I know how to give a injection  you know  I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp  by working with the animals  its not that different to give a injection  and take a temperature  and so on.

They put on in the back bottles with gas  and he smuggled us into Berlin.
So then I met a lot of Polish Ukrainian Russian boys and girls who came almost the same time or just about that time.
But this wa s only only few Russian  some Slovak  some even I think about two or three Czechs.
The they dont know that over two million Russian POWs were killed by the Nazis in Buchenwald also.
Even in school at Christmas time when the Communist authorities would come to inspect the schools  our teachers would suddenly speak Russian.

All of them  they were Russian  but Platon was head of the puszcza Naliboki.

He was involved in both insurgencies against the Russians  and provided all of arms and support throughout the Jewish community of Poland to in support of the fight against the Russians  and the Russian anti-Semitism.
And I know about what the Russian say s  and I was right because those who went to the Russians went to live in Siberia and other places.
They didn't care SS  inmates going home  you know...they so...people in that...in the station...middle of washing a nd a Russian soldier came over.

We f ound a Russian Jewish soldier who spook spoke Yiddish.
Then they had the French and the British and the Russian.
We were goi ng to be surrounded  we were going to be  they're going to have Russian paratroopers co me in over.
When anti-Semitism was very high in the woods  a group of Russian  there was a majorŠwh at was his name?
And I went to the Polish school to the Jewish school.
We can't stand it anymore  so we went to the Russian commandanteur and at that time I didn't give them no .
So they took the Russian soldiers and they got after them  but somehow they found out and they all ran away and they dont live in Ruscova any more  they live in .
And they were just a bunch of wild animals  the Russian soldiers.
We were caught between the Germans and the Russians on the front and the Russian dug in all the...bunch of young kids.
I left the Soviet Union  you know  and then came to Poland.
It's a very small kind of town  and that's how I find myself on the Russian front.
So after I saw the first Russian  I came out  and I was so weak.
Can you tell me  you were just talking about coll ecting you know  bicycles getting ready to run to the Russian side.
In the Russian hospital  there was one nurse maybe for 60 or 70 .
After the war  we discovered that he led all the Communist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023 8 of an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk  which was about 10 - 15 miles from our farm.
You stay there til you see a Russian guy coming in  into the camp.
Over there was groups  12 - 15 people groups  and th e commandeer was a Russian officer and the rest was all Russians.
So inside  something told me that these are not just bad Russian officers.
And  you know  I told you that my parents disc riminated against my husband because he had a Russian background  and then the idea that my brother would marry somebody American Indian.
So they start bombarding 24 hours a day  the Russian s and Germans.
We had one teacher  that she was educated  but they were not Polish citizens  that was a Russian family that stayed here in Poland somehow  and that they were not supposed to not not forced to return to Russia.

Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 81 Because the trou Russian propaganda was was telling us everything.
When did you first learn about what happened to the Jews?
We had -- we had a -- we had a m-meetings -- we used to had a meeting and each  you know  from the group  each one worked in different kind of locations and one of our group worked in the warehouses where there were -- you know  there was 50 or 100 people working there  or one or two people from our group worked in the warehouses  where was the Russian leftover.
When we finally -- when our investigator -- our historical investigators  those who could read Russian  finally got access to the records of the Trawniki trained guards in the federal security -- the archive of this Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation in the early 90s  they found the notes of the KGB investigator who saw that file  and the notes that he took were consistent with the type of information that was on other personnel files.
You tried to join the Army  you kind of got caught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your home village of Brzeznica?
I -- When -- When I jump ed in to the train and I saw there were some Russian officers sitting and they showed me that I could sit next to them  so I did.
I went to a Russian school where they indoctrinated the students to love Stalin.
The soldiers that we had seen in the Jeep the night before  they were just having a joyride through the -- what was to be the Russian sector of the town  and th-they have then returned to their own sector.
Like needles stuck in my lungs and I told  I had a friend  a Russian prisoner  Ivan  I don't know whether that was his real name  but they called him Ivan .
So I run over to him and I could see that he happens to be Russian.
So when German came -- oh  th at was also -- before German came  when Russian decided was escape from German  he gra -- they grabbed my father to the army because they needed medical corps.
Whatever...we was scared most of the Russian soldiers; more than of the Germans  because they were more with us.
And we were checked on the end of the day  on on our end of the day check-up  as we were leaving for the camp again  th-the poor Ukrainian  or Russian at that time  whatever was he had a cap  and from th e cap theres some parts of the leaves sticking out.
She couldnt speak Polish but she knew a little Yiddish that she picked up from her parents and we just didnt know -- we communicated by body language.

In Belcy  I met a friend from my home town  and this was in Russian control.
Also  the Russian soldiers that had managed to escape -- and more and more escaped -- organized themselves in the forest.
A lot of them ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war.
And it was a shootout between some Russian [indecipherable] and Friday morning they were in town.
Pret ty soon  we heard some voices knocking  some sound knocking at the door of the farmers house and later we learned that Abraham  his little girl and his wife  at th e last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the village  were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at.
Went to the movies and I went...I studied hard and I didn't 2 knew Russia  so they gave me papers  newspapers to read  and I read newspapers and this when I learned Russian  and uh it was a...the professor told my mother it's a big and I will be .
So we started to hide from expor tation in -- to Siberia  and we had to leave Pinsk  and we went to some small village  I dont remember the name  and later on through Lvov  and later on through Turka  where my father had cousin and her husband was a dentist and he knew Russian -- he was treating Russians and he arranged for a passport -- finally he -- they decided to take Russian passport to -- you know  to -- not to be sent to Siberia.
Because when the Russian will come--which we have heard th at they are very close--there  first of all  they will rape you all...um like not one  but all.
Because  in 1946  when they started the war with Russia  the Second Battalion  you know  the Vlosof  General Vlosov  he surrendered to the Second Army  to the Germans  and he fought against  you know  the Russian army.
The soldiers were right fond of the kids and kids were  well me in particular was fond of the uniforms and the guns and I used to hang around  so I started picking up some Russian  and it wasn't very difficult for me to pick it up.
There were still Russian army coming in and they were not the nicest.
He left Poland at a very young age to evade the Russian slash Polish army  service in the army.
Little by little they start to come from the counties after the wa r. After the war for a long time  Vilnius was Lithuanian but the main language was Russian.
They confiscated that and Russian women paraded in them in the streets.
Whatever they saw the Russian  you had a watch or something  they took it away by themselves.
Hyuss to ask for they even paid for us to go to America and we go t the visa very  after one year  we got the regular visas because we were on the Russian quote  quota  being born in Czernowitz.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about leaving Pionki and going to Auschwitz.
Also  they surrounded the people but supervision was done by Russian P.O.W.s and they were working on -- they were crushing stone to make some kind of a -- to go through some kind of a street.
Lvov at that point was Polish or Russian - I mean German or Russian?
The idea being that I had to converse with the nanny in French and with the maid in Polish and others in Russian and German and so I had -- Ive never had a particularly strong facility for languages  but as a child I did.
Bu t the worst problem was in 1941 when the war started with Russia  so people ran away and the Russian army cut them off  the German army  and they come back  and we were stuck in ghettos.
Oh  we never doubted about the seriousness  but it gave a certain amount of -- I knew a lot of Russian songs  just because listening to them singing and dancing.
Oh  and he was fighting against I mean He you see  he was in the army  then the army went to Russia.
That m-means July 23 rd on my birthday  probably this is when the -- the Russian came.
And then there was another part of the army over on the Russian side.
And going to the Russian zone was quite an adventure and I went to the Russian zone se veral times.
in afterwards  its an interesting thing that as a new country  did Lithuania adopt the old Russian Imperial legal system  and thats why it would have been useful?
And did you -- did you speak Yiddish at home  did you learn other languages?
Send me on the front to white rush to shuko White Russian first White Russian front.
Now  I went out and dressed and went out in the street there was Russian troops are marching from all states--everywhere.
Oh  but that didnt make you -- that didnt bother you or you didnt worry about their -- At that time  my thought was that this -- all this political and military arrangements were against Russia.
15 End of Tape One 16 Beginning Tape Two I understand that you had another language  you spoke Russian?
So  there were  of course  exiled Russian doctors in Peschanka too  but they had nothin g to give you to help you when you were sick.

So they just threw all the rest of the Jews out to this place called Tluste which was the same place we were during the Russian occupation.
Her state of mind at that poi nt actually improved  or she took heart from the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the concentration camps working at Telefunken  but there were also German soldiers who had been injured on the Russian front   many of whom were missing limbs and Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 17were put to work basically  as best they could in the factory.
He brought him -- he went to the Russian zone and brought my Uncle Ben and we ha d a reunion and we met.
And when the Russians needed troops  they were brought back and given a chance to fight in the Polish army under Russian control.
My grandmother and my grandfather  they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.
From Poland  well Poland  I mean that was White Russian  in Poland  it's in the same area but then it's an established part of Poland.
And I walked the street  and there was a Russian standing there  a soldier.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings TAMAR LAZERSON ROSTOWSKI pg 8 Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: and to see how they are thrown into a truck.
But we also have Czechoslovakian visas wh ich when we got into the train on the Czech side you know the Czechs came and they check ed it and apparently they were good because they didnt say so we went to Prague and at that time of course the war was finished and there was a demarcation line between the American for ces and the Russian forces  between Prague and Pilsner you know.
So he said to me [Russian spoken here]  he said to me in Russian  at that time I spoke fluent Russian  I should give him my hand.
I rememb er once we too listened to the Russian radio and they spoke about Auschwitz and th ings like that.
The Russian soldiers holler and said  you can go back  they already in your town.
It was army of Russian volunteers who fought against their own brothers  and we were sitting with those criminals.
I knew some  I pi cked up some Russian that I knew also from before something and I felt quite comfortable not  not enthusiastic but not really very bad  not threatened yet.
And Tory who was  who  who  who was on the  on the  on his flight from Kovno yes through  through Russian communist territory uh had many difficulties.
And in between newcomers were coming in  a nd the -- the Russian uniform were going to an end  and so those clotheses were -- had to be marked with red stripes.
Until they they stopped confronting the Russian army  and what they decided that  lets not fight any more  lets make a revolution everywhere.
I always think that in this respect we were favored  if you compare us USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 57with the prisoners in Russian camps.
And we -- we -- in 45 March we escape  and we run to -- to Krakow  to Poland  because it -- in the Russian says that -- tha -- i-i-it came a law that P-Polish p-people who want to immigrate to p -- to Poland -- because at that time  r-right now  Lvov is already Russia  then y-you can emigrate t-to Poland.
And the first of May  of course  is a big Russian holiday  a Soviet holiday and -- and it was for the soldiers.
What she did was each time there was an opportunity to talk to one of the Russian guards  which was at work  and this she told us in the evening about  or wh en she got her ration cards  or when she whenever there was some contact  she would ask.
As one of my friends  whos a historian told me  he a he a to ld me those were quite likely Russian troops  that had then he describes how Russian troops would be in that area.
The train stopped there by the by th e bridge there  where its supposed to go over to the American zone  on the Russian zone  the train stopped there  and the Russkis came around.
And what happened is is that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers  and the Polish soldiers came  and there came some fliers from Stettlin  and they would bring liquor and so on.
The Russian army  they had a pact...the Russian army came in and we went back to Tuchin to a town of Tuchin that was about thirty kilometers from Rovno.
And one day my mother was so afraid because the predsedatel  thats pres political president of what was Russian  and ultra  ultra-communist ga was away  and my mother couldnt get the permit to go out.
We are spies  and they took us to a so-called Kommandantura where the Russian police was.
The same thing we had Russians that were in fact by myself the Russian people are a nice people.
You said something about when you got there that they had to kill many Russian Jews?
I think around end of June I started to see Russian soldiers coming in  and they said that the Germans are running away already from the territories that I was there  but I couldn't believe it.
One of the incidents that stands out in mind is uh coming to...sort of getting across the border between Hungary and Austria and hitting upon British troops who sent us back to the Russian side because we were in the wrong place.
Now  admittedly I knew how to speak Russian from the time I was a kid because everybody in town was Russian.
So they were all fluent in Russian and I learned the Russian  a bit of Russi an from my moth er  too so -- You did?
So he started to talk Russian and we talked to him also  you know.
We used to make a fire  fi-fires and the Russian [indecipherable] And they would drop supplies?
But they worked with the Poles and Germans  so when they came around  the smugglers and I and the shoes went to a little where German patrol was standing and under their direction we went over to the Russian part.
In Russian part was not so easy  and my father c-come back from the ne -- I call this prison  and start workin g  like I said before  for na -- state  and start educated himself.
I spoke Russian with my grandfather and grandmother and my mother  and French with my father and my mother too.
I: Aside from standing in line  were you aware of any abuses from the Russian soldiers?
And as it turned out th -- these were two people from the border guard s  which was a branch of the Russian security apparatus that was not identical to but closely allied to the KGB  and they were later involved in deportation.
And a -- a otriad is a -- the -- the group of Russian -- group of people.
And I had my own books  and Im still a member of the Union of Russian Writers.
And Except that my grandfather  my maternal grandfather came from a family that  before the first World War  and I think it was at the middle of 19 th century  they met my [indecipherable] through Turkey from Macedonia   and through the through the Carpathian mountains  came to Silesia  Shlunsk   and then and but my mo my grandmother was from Vierkapolska   the up [indecipherable] Poland.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
There was a law at that time  which Churchill made it  that every foreigner in the Russian territo ry has to be left to go home.
I didnt want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name  because it doesnt sound good.
And we told the Russian leader  you know  where we were there  that the -- these guys before  they -- they killing the -- many people come from ghetto  they been killed there -- a lot of people have been killed.
So we stood up  and -- and I remember that they turned -- they thought there are so many Russian sol -- German soldier  they turned toward us  they had machine guns.
And I remember sitting in  behind a bush  crouched with my arms up in the air as this Russian was standing in front of us  not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do.
In 1944 in September the barracks got more crowded  because people were being pushed with the Russian advance and Auschwitz being emptied  beginning to be emptied  and Birkenau and all these people came west and there was less work and less food and finally we didn't do anything anymore.
And so we were in the Russian zone  but then at some point people said well  you know  things are 24 becoming a little more strained in terms of relations.
So  in Teheran  the the Polish school I I had to go I went to Polish school in the city itself.
We were only 15 or 20 miles from the Russian frontier  and our aim was to wait until the...the water will freeze over and maybe we will cross the frontier.
She decided she liked one of the Russian officers  so she stayed downstairs  and she went with him wherever she wanted to.
But my fa Was this the fir was this the first time you saw any of the Russian soldiers  or or Russian military [indecipherable] No  I no  we saw them also coming in.
And so you had th-the you had four  actually four commissioners; you had an American  you had a Britisher  you had a Frenchman and you had a Russian.
And then  one day I was  for example  in a s-store  where the clerk was a young Jewish boy  a Russian.
But as you know  doesn't happen and the Russian came first.
I mean  it happened to have been the Russians  but at that point we didnt know it was the Russian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed.
July  the end of July  we were told we have to go to the Russian headquarters to receive passports.
Also  ve ry vividly  I remember  prisoners the Russian soldiers and the Polish soldiers they were shot.
So the Russian  the general says [indecipherable] he didnt say nothing  he walk away.
You  what the one say  you had enough with everything from the camp  with the Russian  with everybody.
I come into there  come into the office and there's a city dressed woman sitting there with a stack of papers with pictures on it that I could read it  you know  in Russian and in Polish  and the uh captain or major says well Slivka  what do you think?
The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the Russian Zone.\
I mean  during the Russian occupation  only one time  and there was a speaker  and I mean  of course  it was all in Russian  you know  and I didn't have as good a time as I used to at the university.
N-No  that -- the front door seal was never opened  because the guy got killed on Russian front.
And we spent the two years  we were there during the airlift and the Russian blockade.
And with another interesting st ory  I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in Washington .
So in po -- Russian is called Lotchik  so people called me Lotchik.
Collect a few farms or small villages and show the movies in the school  show Russian movies.
I thought it [indecipherable] when I saw the Russian  you know  th-the -- the Russian trucks and tanks  I was happy  first I thought they come as our allies.
And then I-I think through Major Shike or somehow  we got a Russian military truck to take us along  who was going to Berlin anyway  also with all our luggage.
In other place  in other place  before the Russian came  I heard they killed the prisoners over there.
Under this -- before Poland was established  he was -- he was under the Russian Czar  so you went -- you know  you went to the Russian school and was -- became a teacher.
I never knew what 33 they did with the rocks  but the different layers  the Russian prisoners were at the bottom  the French prisoners and we were on top and what you had  you had rails going up and on top of the privileged character  I had this big  big handle that would bring the lorries  a lorry's a flat bed  these had sides on them  get them down to the mill  and pump  and empty one up and he would pick it up and then go the rail and there you had your little areas  whatever area was destined.
And that was when I thought that they -- he -- that Vladya  Russian off-officer would yell one word and the breakout would start.
When the Russians came in of course any of the parochial schools  whether they were Christian or Jewish were closed and everybody had to attend the public school  which was Russian indoctrination.
After 15  10 minutes  another Russian partisan came in and said  ﬁOkay.
to that part of of what was Poland at one point.
Your brother and yourself  did you go to Polish schools  or Russian schools?
So to go to the Russian Zone was no problem because we were in the same place.
>> Betsy Anthony: She knew she would give herself away if they heard her obviously in Yiddish or Russian.
Others lived in  which is called Ukraine and my Postalistichi Novy its man and he learned Russian quickly.
They took us over to a separate unit near the Russian headquarters where the Red Cross was there waiting for us.
I was born  I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit  but they spoke Polish only.
There were camps everywhere  where people worked all over eastern Germany  and from the camps  the Russian army came closer  we were all concentrated in that place.
My other uncle  Zelig was drafted  so after spending two and a half years in the forests  hes drafted int-into the Russian army.
Then I f -- I was finished high school and I used to work in a Russian factory to repair sewing machines.
And bread  they used to make it from a little cornmeal  how you say  the dark  dark bread  mixed with -- we call in Russian language mich .
And so in the station was a believe it or not a Russian Jewish guy so we spoke in Jewish.
They were Russian officers that were in the Spanish Civil War.
So after I relaxed and thought on this moment for a few minutes  I continued to walk by myself on the upper hill of 44 Landowner (Russian) 45 Jew (Lithuanian) 37 the  of the forest-like highway.
And one day they se nt him out to the front  to the Russian front.
They would keep them three months  and after that  they will  each one wa s killed always  and before they would kill them  they would kill them  they would beat them terribly  and they  they died terrible deaths  so I really was just lucky that I had uh  the  for  I mean that I had the idea of  of running away  so and but then later on there was um  the blockeldest told us uh  ev entually that the selections were more often always  and um  and then  there was not anymore going to be any selections  they were just emptying the Auschwitz because the uh front  they were losing on the Russian front  and they were   get  the Russians were getting closer  so they would take uh some camps they would take on death marches  some they would take to the gas cham ber  some  and  and  some ways they  they  of course  didn't want that there should be any witne sses  so they were trying to kill them uh  in any way they designed.
And when the revolution began Youre talking about the Russian revolution?
Yes  because I was vitriolicly anti-Comm unist like my parents  and I sensed it at home  what I overheard  what I understood fr om their Russian  et cetera  I kept my mouth shut  but nevertheless  they had to be cautious.
I discovered that no one else has survived  none of my family  and the part of Europe  Germany where I was liberated  became...was destined to become the eastern  the Russian zone  now part of eastern rather than East  Germany  and uh the Americans wanted to uh put uh on turn us over to the Russians because they were shipping people that were from France and Holland to France and Holland and people that were from Poland and Czechoslovakia back east and that day the Russians didn't...they put us in a truck and brought us out to 23 the town  outside of the town where the Russian's lines were.
So she was fluent in Russian and German and I noticed also she spoke French at one point.
That was my first attempt to escape  but they rounded us up and again they didn't shoot us  because we are strafed  you know  and then when we tried to walk -- By Russian bombers?
He didnt want he he didnt want the Russians  he hated them like What kind of ye I mean  you mentioned before that the Russian authorities prevented a pogrom from happening.
That son saved himself  ended up in the USO of the Russian army.
When we had another one  Fenya  she was Russian  and then my father in the building had a nur se  Maria.
15 moved from one place to another  from one of these homes to another  until we came upon a group of the a Polish division under Russian command the First Division Kosciusko 19.
They was -- they was catch up the -- the uprising in Warsaw  1943  because this was in the old town  what the worst place  you know  because I was -- during the -- I was during the uprising  I was  you know  y -- organizing the Polish home army  you know  that I go through the whole town Warsaw  but some parts of the Warsaw was captured by the German [indecipherable] in the -- in the first so -- in the first beginning  they didnt take a - prisoners  they kill everybody over there.
I said  a little needle  or something  i-in Russian  he sa id  dont talk nothing.
who owne d us  he already owned us there  so what he was doing was already as a businessman or rather as a function to guard himself or hide himself from going to the Russian front because he makes himself useful for the fatherland.
So the Polish boys jumped from the window because they were downstairs  and they ran to the Russian commandantura to tell them that th e ru -- there are Germans in the house.
You saw the defense of course was not in uniform and the bench wasn't except I believe the Russian judges were in uniform.
Well  during the war  there was a dirty old -- dirty old  well  he was -- looked old  he was in his probably late 20s or early 30s -- Russian hiding with us for man -- I mean  for weeks and months  at times.
And while we were waiting for the Visa  the Hungarian government and the political system were taken over by the Communists with the help of the occupying Russian forces.
Now this school was going to be in Russian  and I remember that I they Interview with Riane Gruss April 22  1994 38had a first grade and a third grade  or en ough children to for those age groups  and they were in the somehow in the same room  there was the why they had them in the same room  I guess they didnt have enough teachers  or they didnt have enough children  and I remember that they were and I was in first grade.
She was on vacation and she went with him  my daughter  Elena  shes in Russian and hes Gregory.
I cannot think  because I had all the time -- had to adjust each time  to adjust to a different language  or to -- because in the beginning everything was -- lets say I was raised in Poland  Polish  and after that to adjust everything in Russian  then I was adjusting back to Polish  then to German  and after that were ex -- exa -- to -- to -- to English.
How did you -- there was also  I think  a document you sent to the museum  something from a Russian sergeant allowing you to go from one zone to the next.
And  you know  they was in the middle and all the soldiers  the German soldiers have to be on the side because  you know  they was the Russian soldiers come in  and they took them all to the camp.
Uh  then uh  there were Russians  and it was hard to separate the Russians who were uh  military prisoners from Russian civilians that had been sent back  but uh  they were always hungry.
That we had our pre-World War food obviously is not the case or even the food that we had during the Russian period  but we had enough bread.
One of thems living in Klaipda now  raising his family  thats he was Russian  yeah  ethnic Russian.
Well anyway  what happened then was that  lets see  about 1944  about February  the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian war pr prisoners of war  and they were starting to dig up thats what we heard from other people  I didnt see it that they were digging up the bodies  putting them in piles and setting them on fire.
And that time  it came an order from all the brigades  from all over stretching from this -- from eastern Poland  way up in Lithuania  whatever  deep to the Russian territory  that we have to -- this was impor -- imp -- that we  first of all  we have to mine all the roads and mine all the bridges.
The Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 21 Russian or Ukrainian?
Uh but uh we were in the ghetto for 3 years before we were evacuated when the Russian front came closer uh and uh I attribute my mothers ability to support us with food  beyond the bread and--and the marmalade or whatever we got for rations.
We had just Czech schools and also Russian  because in our town there lived a -- a great many  they were U-Ukrainians lived in our town and they lived mostly in the hills  not in the center of the town.
They had places in various parts of Europe  where they would receive the refugees  they would come m and those this is the period when we had the Russian refugees coming out.
And they wen t; but naturally who... The...the SS men was running away  because they knew the Russian are coming close.
I had one suitcase in my hand and I stopped a Russian guy with a truck.
The German went away  so he told us   now you go to the Russian.
I assume  because I spoke Russian and I wore an American uniform  that they took me for a spy.
They were living separately  out of ghetto  in the vicinity where the Russian wives and children of Russian officers were there -- where they were there.
But -- And in that  of course  there were many Jews.
See Japan was always -- considered herself an enemy of Russian communism.
I am glad this going to some museum and sp ecial the Holocaust Museum and I be glad it be placed there and this way we know was not only Je wish people killed in Holocaust  was French  Polish  Russian  Zigoinen (gypsies) and many othe rs.
Then I realized -- I saw the -- th-the real face of Communism  because I remember them and I wo-work in the coal mine and I figured if I only knew -- if Stalin only knew -- see how blind I was -- what -- what they do to us.
I attended a Dachau trial of SS who were accused of exterminating literally thousands of Russian prisoners of war in 6 Dachau  and in other places.
And in Leipzig there was a whole bunc h of young women  mostly Russian  from a labor camp.
Next thing I remember  opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat on and talking to me in Russian  explaining to me that he is a doctor  that I shouldnt worry  Im in a hospital and he would love to know my name.
We was standing... that was Rozhishche [Polish: Royszche]...from the partisans  and we become Russian soldiers.
Magda had her  her fiance back  took to work  to  in Russian  in Ukraine  Ukraine.
He was waiting few days  because it happen in another cit y  in Tarnopol that after the German left  and the Russian came  the Jews went out and then th e German came back  and they all were killed.
B ecause they had some kind of an agreement that the Russians would go to  to Warsaw  or whatever they had the agreement  and the Russians came  and  and  we had the Russian officer sleeping in our house because he was in charge of the bakery from the man wh o saved our life  and he came to us and he said  \ Listen  you better pack up everything and take your children.\
And a pa -- and Polish  I went to the Polish school .
She was kept alive with her son  as my mother told me  for awhile  because she was a translator for the Germans  translated from German into Latvian and Russian  I know this.
There were no Polish pogroms because the pogroms which were existed you know were during the Russian occupation of Poland.
And and so  they Im Im surprised they didnt have Russian guards on on these things.
The mans camp was gone  there was a -- a Russian military company was there  so I couldnt even go through.
I said Mama was looking for a job  she speaks perfect Russian  when she men-mentions her last name  nobody gives her work.
So I brought it over to the -- to the Russian intelligence  which we -- we worked together  and they had the plans  so they send out engineers and they -- and they did everything that it shouldnt be -- yeah  because when she gave me the plans  so she said to me -- she said to me -- so I said  ﬁI have to run ﬂ took the plan  because any minut e the columns will blow up.
Interview with Fred Gutter October 30  1999 47 We had few -- I dont know on the refugee -- we had few refugees which we knew them from the Russian camp in the same town.
So the majority of those people that ran to Russia or even were deported to Russia were saved by deportation.
We stayed in Berlin for about six months and we were in Berlin we tried to get to the American side because we were told it was best from the Russian side with the Russians  eventually  like with cars  trucks  trains until we got from Poland to Berlin we did a lot of traveling.
Once we were thrown out  and went back to our room  the very next day I said to her  Im not going to st -- there were sectors  American   British  French and Russian.
He escaped to Poland  he gets to Russia  he went to the Russian army.
So one thing that they moved into my office  so I learned a little Russian  I listened to Russian music [indecipherable] little little radios tuned into a Russian I dont know how they heck they got the Russian station.
We were very happy by being occupied that time by Russia.
And I had a bunch of first of all  in the in the army  the Russian army I was paid as a officer  I received a certain amount of money in Russian rubles  and then a double amount in German occupational marks.
And they explained to him that if he allows the American trucks to cross the line  they will they can liberate all of the prisoners  and the German didnt want  obviously  to Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 102 have the western prisoners fall into Russian hands  the way that the western allies didnt  so he agreed to it.
When the Russian came  the Germans ran away  because they had a fight.
And they took us there  and there were some Russian girls  white Russian girls  they were playing the piano.
She opened up the door she sees that Russian guy jump out of the wi ndow because he saw her.
And people who was with me in the same company  know is only right 27 now chance  take our dresses and insignia what was -- because the rifle was already gone  because was taken by Russian  and escape.
And my mother  she was young and she wasnt married  so she stayed with with her folks  and the two brothers went to the Russian army.
She wanted -- she majored in foreign languages  and she knew Italian  and some Russian  and English very well  of course  and she had a job that she had to know English for  and so she interrupt her studies every time she didnt have any money  she s -- worked up there.
Well  they know that the ammunition was losed in this action  was Russian ammunition.
Of course we   we had the rumors of the Russian  they were coming  they were progressing  prog ressing  progressing  they were 200 miles from here  then they were 250 mile s  150 miles  then 100 miles.
German  I spoke already English and Russian and we didn't have -- it was like a hole in the wall.
Where are they?ﬂ And he said  ﬁIm afraid they were arrested.ﬂ I said  ﬁBut why?ﬂ And he said  ﬁB ecause they saw too much of you French.ﬂ And I don -- then later  you know  also through him  found out that the doctor was sent to the Russian -- to the Russian front  and he was killed very soon.
My mother was fluent in Russian  both in speech and writing.
They took a Russi an brain  the Russian brain was -- no  the Polish brain  the Polish brain was the cheapest   five dollars.
So then he takes out from his drawer my thesis  and he hands it over and I see there was written excellent and I (laughing) remember the thesis was and in the Roman and Russian War. (
HK: No  this was not a pogrom.. Pogrom  pogrom  like I said is a strictly Russian expression where the Czar was getting mad because something was going wrong with Video Tape No.
Yes  probably the Russians  the Russians wouldnt let us out becau se was already the city was divided into  into French  English  Russian and American.
Of course  at home we did not speak German  Dutch was -- probably -- the parents spoke Yiddish.
Well  were told by the political officer  by the po litruk33 in a camp that  ﬁYou are going to join Polish forces  you are going to join our victorious Red Army are going to fight the damn Germans.ﬂ 03:25:59 [Technical conversation] End of Tape #3 32 Round (Russian) 33 Political instructor (Russian) 28 Tape #4 [Technical conversation] 04:02:54 This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.

She says  ﬁI don't care if they are the French Army  the Russian Army  the Am erican -- it's a Jewish holiday.ﬂ 10 Pioneer (Hebrew).
I couldnt read Russian  but I was looking at the pictures  you know.
54 Now  there are some Jews in that population that came  but the majority who had came over -- Yeah  there was a large Jewish Russian population.
And the Jews didnt want to take Russian passports because they were hoping that  you know  things will straighten out  and they will be able to go home.
I could speak with my father  my father spoke fluently Yiddish   and if you spoke German  Yiddish was understandable.
They accused him of being a Russian spy -- I mean a German spy.
You could hear Greek and Y-Yiddish and Polish and Russian and French and Hungarian.
And  we were able to exchange some of it into Rubles  but there were price controls in the Russian period.
They didn't want us to unders tand when they spoken Russian.
So my parents realized that I understood everything  so if they wanted to say something that I dont wouldnt understand  they switched to German  because Russian I understood everything.
But -- anyway they --they wanted to know  you know  who I am  which I told them and then exactly as that Czech had predic ted  they told me that they won't believe that I am Jewish and in fact that they have some evidence that I had -- was working under orders to blow up bridges to delay the Russian advance and how I could prove that I'm Jewish.
IS: Well there  I remember the house being just like  like a little Russian peasant house almost.
I knew I couldnt go back to Poland because it was under Russian occupation.
The interesting thing is you know when I was in Nuremberg and after the war in the course of the Russian advance against Germany and my aunt and two of my little cousins  two little children managed to escape to the dp camp in Berlin  and they can tell you and testify as to details of how things proceeded.
But Minsk was the only big White Russian city that I saw destroyed like Warsaw.
And when I looked down  and I saw the Russian tank and the two Russian soldiers with the red star on it  I knew  I knew a miracle had happened in my life  I knew a messiah came.
And my father was also conscripted for forced labor  and he was -- I mean  they surmised that he'd  they'd be taken to the Russian front; and  of course  my mother and him had acquired warm winter clothing  and he had a pair of waterproof boots made for himself to go; and he told the shoemaker because in those days everything was custom made  there was no off-the-rack stuff  and that he doesn't want any hobna ils on those boots.
Everybody -- everything start to be in Russian  Russian -- Russian was the main language  with a little bit Yiddish  24 because it was hard to go through.
It was a Russian Jew  Alexander Beltz   a very tall man  a strong man.
Once we were in Russian in Americans hands like  they show us pictures  and we saw we we ca we couldnt believe it  ah  we couldnt believe it  but and then we start to meet the guys from the camps  and Well  heres another ques tion.
While -- excuse me  while I was riveting -- joining parts of the wings of the p -- airplanes  I noticed a small notatio n in a Russian script  done by the Russian prisoners of war who worked at night shift  i-instructing us what to do and how to sabotage.
Th - it was shortly before the Russian troops marched in.
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 134 Oh my gosh.
And a little while later a green Opel car  those days with the step on the side  drove in  and a Russian officer said zdrastvjete  he 45 was Russian because there were many Russians  so we started believing that we were free.
It turned out the man she had been living with was actually a spy for the Germans.
I wanted to run to that Russian and kiss him from top to toe.
So everybody was ecstatic about it  people were happy  including the Russian s that were there.
So with the Russian and th e German  we were able to communicate.
The Russian soldiers don't know and doesn't want it to be known  and you don't say anything either.
She was bedridden  and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund th at still going back to the Russian occupation  encouraged the boys  there was Zigmund and two brothers.
The borders were watched by Hungarian and Russian soldiers and uh it was very difficult to escape.
But now Russian was like Lithuanian before; they push Polish la Russian language as subject.
We were hiding for a few days and suddenl y we hear guns  guns  guns  Russian guns getting closer and closer.
You know  I guess  you know  I mean th -the the th-the thing from the from Ryevka   the thing that still stands out in my mind is that incident with the kids  you know  of them taunting me and and and calling me  you know  evra zhid  you know  and and Which is a terrible in in Russian its a terrible epithet.
Before the Americans or Russian  whoever come first  before they come in  they gonna kill us all.
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 33 We all went to the same school  and well we we had a lesson in in Ukrainian  or Russian.
He didn't want to  but finally he stop ped practically inches from me and the officer  the Russian officer opened the door  jumped out  start to yell.
I found a printing shop that used to print lines on the paper  then I found someone who that a bound  a bound-- a bindery  and used to make notebooks  with a couple of st aples and a notebook with a cover  and we used to sell notebooks to the Russian soldiers.
And he -- and his sergeant  he was a regular Russian.
So I remember going to school a little bit and learning Russian.
Let me tell you something  look  when the when the Russian Russian offense started from in from direction of course of Minsk  and all of this  direction toward Horodyszcze   and farther  you know.
He was Russian but he became from not th e revolution before the revolution he was k  you know.
Jewish students who were architecture  art and so on and we organize a student group in this town who performed music  dancing for the remaining Jewish refugees that came back from Russian.
The Germans were telling: we need volunteers to go to the Russian territory  we occupied so much land  we need people to work on the farm.
In Russian language they call him Vladimir  but he was Velville.
And then we had also in the Russian language a high`school.
I think -- I think now  the attitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course  they were not in the concentration camps  they were not in Auschwitz  is already different  and they are -- the willingness to -- to help  is also greater  because now  since we are established  and since we are -- most of us anyhow  are doing well  and want to contribute both financially  and with our work  to our -- the Jewish community  and all the others  not Jewish causes  we are respected.
The medic -- the Russian officer cut some -- cut some tree limbs and made a s -- they made a splint  medic made a splint and I was walking with a ar -- marching with a broken arm.
And I remember we went s -- once wents -- went to th e Russian opera -- I mea n  to the -- to the Lvov opera house for a performance  I believe it wa s ﬁAida ﬂ if Im not mistaken  in Russian  you know  because the Russians liked to listen to operas in translation  not in the original.
It seems that they were also advancing towards us  the Allies or th e Russian army  whoever it was  was advancing in our direction.
But then around November of '44  December  we began to hear the artillery  the Russian artillery.
That -- that was the Russian word for bread  but in a very nickname like -- like endearing.
I mean  it was Some the German had by over three million Russian soldiers.
Polish  and Russian  and Czechs  and French  and Italian...gasp... SWB: JOHN KOMSKI: yeah reload SWB: JOHN KOMSKI: yeah yeah...So I came to that eh eh after after that a the the incident with jeeps.
While a in addition  th ey learned Polish  and knew Polish  but Yiddish was the major language.
Now up to this day when I hear boots marching  even on the beautiful parade  I get nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections so there we heard these footsteps and we said  ﬁOh  the henchmen are back.ﬂ But we heard Russian language.
Isnt that enough of blasting  basting the Germans  of constantly constantly he says to me  my father was also in the Russian front.
And he told me that just before the pulcrum erupted a Russian officer came to him and he was from the Cossack brigade and told him that you come with him and take his family.
And he showed me the home movies of Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler inspecting the tiger tanks on the Russian front.
That mean we should make more lines  that they should come more fast in fast over to go to the Russian border to  to Russia.
What should I give her?ﬂ Not that we had that mu ch food  but the food was Russian and so we have bread and we have a jam and saccharin  and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that.
When there were already Russian Jews came  the Russian transport came already and also the Polish Jews; and we had to walk around and sing  Russian and Polish songs  and German songs.
I remember learning a little bit to write the Russian lettering and all that.
Me and two Russian prisoners walked in deep in the forest.
Yeah  they thought they go Im gonna go [indecipherable] to the Americas  and th and from the Russian army.
He he would give me a a no  I would bring my coat to be pr essed  or something like that and in order to keep me Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 68busy he would give me a a Russian  becau se he was a White Russian  thats where the White Russians This is the tailor in Krakow ?
My mother instructed me at this point to tell it was run by a priest  to tell him that I was an Orthodox Russian.
So its -- its a short name from Alexandra in Russian.
But  then came June  1941...this was when the German army came to our town  but before they came  I wanted to tell you that my father was thrown out from  by the Russian  from the pharmacy  and he was made a manager in a little town called Astroegetts  so they had to move there.
He had the elder brother that went to the Polish army.
They  they  they were  they  when they heard that the Germans were coming in  they were rounding up Jews wherever they could find them or went into  to houses and slaughtered them in the  in the hundreds and the thousands.
Wi -- and you are in the -- We were in the Russian zone.
The Ukraine people...it was...they was working in their villages  and  nu  someone it was  nu  when the Russian was...he was policeman.
It wasnt it wasnt pure Russian  it was like English [indecipherable] smi sme they call it something simple  plain.
And was nice celebration  and I learn in my concentration camp  thats was small camp  wa s that 77 000 people  between the peop -- the 18 nation people  because was 18 nation people there  was -- most important was 28 000 Russian officers  army officers  17 000 Polish prisoners  3 200 French  3 200-something Czech  3 100 Jewish people  and many others.
They st opped at our house; my mother ha ppened to speak Russian.
We found ourselves close to a family and they say well they are going to the Russian part too  and they have a maid who lives not far from the Russian border.
Moscow gang or -- or [Russian] gang or some -- from other parts of the city.
I dont know whether that was a Russian saying but Ive heard myself saying that in describing such a person  a kind of tenacious stubborn person.
They -- the -- some of them went home  some of them stayed and worked for the Russian government.
Somebody came in June 41  and told us that the Germans attacked Russia.
Is that where you met the Russian sergeant who gave you this document?
So he saw that I am good friends with Polkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the milk was delivered and were going to the cheese factory  so the Russian soldiers wouldn't get anything to eat  and when we came back  what they did is what they did with the cows that they captured  we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around the lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they would cut  cook it for the Russian soldiers.
Nathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna  the Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel.
Even -- even -- even being  you know  when we organized being in the partisan with the -- all together  the Russian partisan.
The first Russian was of Asiatic origin because his face  the features were Asiatic.
A lot of Jewish partisans was killed in the Russian army because the Russian want them to be killed.
Into Russian occupied territory  and then the Russians  our Russian allies are re quested to be helpful to him in every way possible.
I the only rumors that I heard as a child was that they when they could  they escaped to Lithuania   and in fact  Lithuania is surrounded by lakes  and one of the thrilling stories that we cousins would talk about was that our various parents spent Interview with Al Jaffee May 21  2016 12nights in the lakes  breathing through straws to avoid being recaptured by the Russian military people who were looking for for the young men.
So he said that he will not get in the Russian -- in the German and that's what he did.
You know  I left -- actually I left -- I -- when I was working  assigned to pru -- my town  Pruzana  I was in uniform  Russian uniform  and I have a gun  and I have a -- you know  its just like duty  like a soldier.
So a representative of the Soviet POWs  Ukrainian officer  when he heard that I spoke Polish  for a minute we attempted to converse in Polish.
So our audience understands   so you are in the Russian -occupied part of the country.
He had a piece of black bread in one hand and a chicken leg in the other  and I walked up to him and I don't know Russian.
I remember some some other if I look at the map  Fufond   and we coming to the Ural mountains and then Magnitogorsk   which is a center of Russian industry  steel industry  and and then the Omsk and Tomsk .
It happened in June  but in in si August in August  the Polish government in exile already had an agreement with the Russian government.
When I was a little baby  I remember I used to tell everybody my grandfather was Kotovsky because he was big and bold man and he had always uniform of Russian Army and I remember him on the pictures and what else.
You remember the song that you sang -- th at you started to sing  this Russian song? [
We didnt use too much Russian but those two languages were prevalent  like with my aunt and my two cousins  my sister we spoke Polish.
And he used to live in Russia for many  many years.
So  the very eastern part of Czechoslovakia was very close to Russia   and thats why it was so  later on  during World War II  Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia was ceded to the Russian sphere of influence.
She escaped howe to Russia  which as a witness from my city  they saw them going to the Russian side  and he says  come on  lets go in deep.
So the next two  three years I was going to the school and I learned how to read and write in Russian  and so on.
Learned a little Russian in concentration camp  but Pepi knew languages  but it didn't matter.
ﬂ I said  ﬁAt least I can do for you that you don t get punished  or put in jail  or anything like that.ﬂ So what I did is I -- I still wrote Russian at that time  I sat down  and in no time I wrote him a letter.
Now  we could have followed the Russian pattern and just shot them.
Half the bridge was Russian  half American  the we -- Americans w ouldnt let us cross.
So he arranged with the general  a Jewish general  a Russian  who was taking a whole truck with machinery back to Russia and they had pass from Germany through Poland to get to Russia because German [ Germany ] is on one border  Russia is on the border of Poland so.
I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.
But then afterwards  when I was going home  I would get a piece of Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 87bread  or actually a sometimes it was in the Russian families  the Russians had bread.
They had a Russian leader  and they fi gured that was better.
That thats a from Krasnovodsk   which is the port city on Russian side  Pahlevi is on the Persian side.
And conversely  I mean  I among others saw the planes--American planes with American markings  and Russian planes with Russian ma rkings  bombers--flying in formation towards Hannover and towards Hamburg  which was also a severely bombed.
And the means for that was a nightstick and a and a Swiss beret and a a armband  a white armband which says gh etto police in three different languages; Hungarian  German and Russian [indecipherable] languages.
I said  say  it's a song  it's -- the captain  Russian captain say  \ I repeat it.\
He made a pact of non -aggression w hich allowed  in `39 -- which allowed the German and the Russian to invade Poland from both sides.
The Russian \ girls and the Russian girls soldiers and it is going over there terrible things.
We got in touch with another Russian guy  a Russian pilot who was working for somebody in our town.
Were they sympathetic  were they -- they di -- or what -- No  we were so happy  so when we were sitting with the soldiers and eating dinner  they ask us about -- and a -- as I tol -- told you  be tween Polish and Russian we could understand each other  with difficulties  but we could make ourself understood  and they ask about us  where we come from  who we are.
Did you -- Did you tell them or did they just know -- Oh yeah  yeah [indecipherable] they -- they -- they couldnt tell  because my Russian was perfect  I spoke only Russian there  I lived there for several years with them.
The Russian front wa s coming closer and there was bombing  and Mrs. Ol--and  I have to tell you  I have to describe the basement.
They write in such a way  not to understand that they are Russian.
And I spoke fluent Russian  so I recognized  and I'm very sorry to tell you that eventually when we went to another town  we wanted to be repatriated so that we could find out  because we were completely isolated - this is now East Germany - the Russian commandant  who whoever he was  who was repatriated  and I mean people had no idea yet what was going on.
In the meantime  in in our house was also we were we were compelled to take in some bor some tenants  and one of them was a a was a Russian pilot.
Because I wrote  I translated my articles from Russian to English.
And right away  this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew  but Adrian didnt pay attention to it  but the Russian - the wors t part was that the Russian  when he saw him  he said  ﬁTell me your st ory.ﬂ So  Adrian tells him the story  and he says he was in the Peoples Army.
5 -- when we were liberated  because we were in the forests and the Russian army advance -- it could have been 44  I may be -- it -- it -- it probably would have been 44  passed the Russian army as it advanced westward -- Okay. --
But the captain who was sitting next to me was killed  a Russian captain.
She knew German quite well  but not Russian  and had one time this this this was funny.
That wa s after the Russian put the Sputnik and Kennedy put money  you know -- Right. -- \
And in fact I remember there was a toilet and the Russian opened the door.
And we had learned  like you said  the one word in Russian  chleb   which is bread.
But our group  that were in this Jewish otriad 24  remained with the Russian unit and it was called the Kalininski Otriad and  of course  we met up with Antisemitism.
The last day I went down in to the shelter  maybe the last couple of days  and the Russian soldier came through the wall of the shelter.
So right away I found a a friend of mine  who told me that if I would like to serve to serve in the in the Russian army because  due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium  and I speak the I speak Lithuanian  German  and an -and Russian  so I would be a good prospect.
I says  ﬁYou are talking about Americans as Jews and Russians ﬂ right away I knew  ﬁ–as the Russian Orthodox Church?ﬂ She says  ﬁNo  no.
Swap the cards over no matter where it was  take that card and put it on another train see [DL] So the train would then change direction  and end up at the Russian front with paint instead of bullets? [
Now  you would ask a Russian to requisition bread for you?
We know from the memoirs and testimonies of people who survived that during the winter  the harsh Russian winter  temperatures a re minus 40 degrees  the snow is knee -high  they didn't have other clothes or shoes  and they had to march in those circumstances and many of them just were too weak and couldn't march any longer.
I -- I dont remember too much  I just re member I used to pl ay also soccer in -- with the Russian in the high school  and I used to go skiing with them.
I was able to read and write Russian  but not much  because just I learn a little bit for myself to get along  just to be able to move around  so I could [indecipherable] different thing  but not a lot.
Yes  we were going still to school by ru Russian  yes.
Now the -- the Russian who was shooting at the jars  was laughing like a child.
And they say  we ll  we were raped by the Russian army.
Also  another thing I had in my mind  I knew the relationship -- it was during McCarthy time  I think -- before McCarthy time  and I was Russian born.
And that is the way  according to what I was told when we were together  how he had survived at Theresienstadt and was saved by the Russian ar my and later a group of of  interesting enough  an American colonel  of the family I think  made a special way when they heard about Leo Beck to Theresienstadt to to take him out and by special plane he was flown  flown to London  so uh uh but 61 and there was also something else which I...and it's the last I want to say about him.
And so they they they start they had different thoughts  and the and the punishment for those people that als also in the camps  who were in there guarding the camps  was also to send them to the Russian front.
They were a little cleaner  they come around this  and to every car they say  [speaks Russian] that that much I learned.
Then he turned against the Russian s and thats when England declared war first and then France.
It says... We had to go to Russian headquarters to give us passports to leave the country.
These were weapons that the Germans had coll ected in the battlefields that the Russian army had left behind in retreat.
I said  ﬁIm not going to that class.ﬂ So what they did  very good thing  they gather all the older children that they dont belong to the first grade  10 - 11 - 12 even  and we got into one class  it was intensive study  because we had background in Russian  we already knew how to read.
He talked about the Russian and German soldiers   of the general who fell prisoner and joined the Germans.
In Poland  the Russians were not very great in organizing the -- and helping these surviving people from the camps and a lot of those who actually were liberated under the Russian occupation zone  died from negl ect and not -- not improper care  whereas in the American sector  they -- they were more organized and they didnt allow these half-starved people all of a sudden to be given full meals and just any amount of it  in order not to overwhelm their system and -- and not die from overeating or whatever.
Then finally  I went to the Russian  we went to the country with the Russian and we took the stocking what the two brought us-- [socks] and went to Cracow.
When you see what ha ppens in Russian where they have no food  and they stay in line for hours  and get no food.
Well  from that point to your return... The Russian...under the Russian... Under the Russians... Under the Russia ...all the women put on their scarf and they were hiding their youth with .
I don't want in the last days \  because the Russian was approaching very close to our hometown.
So we arrived in May. In January the Russian front  the Russian Arm y  was approaching Auschwitz.
>> Bill Benson: As the German defense of Berlin was collapsing  you said to me that you and your friends figured it would take 31 minutes for the Russian tanks to get through the barriers that had been put up.
Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 90 I wanted to ask something else: aside from how you were greeted by these Russian exiles  who said you will get used to it  you will get used to it Yeah.
I went to their school for one year  I learned Russian  and I got that coat that the other girls were trying on  everybody liked it.
The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive program of reciprocation  so the language in high schools was Russian and Russian was the language that you had to do business in Poland  in official Poland.
And he was educated there so he was fluent in Russian a remember he was talking a little bit of Russian to me  both of them talking French and Mr. Stanislaw Malinowski was knowing Polish but kind of the broken Polish.
And he was kind of like the -- Was your father known as a Jewish doctor  or because of the Russian papers was he -- No  no  he was Jew.
And that included the -- the -- the ones that ran away to Russia.
So I took the train and I went to the last station before the borderline between Russian occupation zone of Poland and German occupation zone of Poland.
They were a satellite country during the 50 years of Russian regime.
The Russian decided to conquer the Warsaw   but the Polacks say oh no  they were they were their worst enemies.
And they were from a family of learners and rabbis  and -- very  you know  in the Jewish religion very important.
Because mary many Russian soldiers were in concent labor camps and in concent even concentration camps.
Early in the war you and your family lived under Russian occupation.
A few days before the Russian came  somehow a family child came from-- eight years  10 years or whatever years old--he came to this uncle.
They didn't lie that they were on the -- right next to Moscow  that they took millions and millions of Russian prisoners.
But we got out of the Russian zone and came to the American zone and sort of towards the end of 45  maybe beginning of 46.
He came back once with two Russian officers behind him and the only person who saw him was our electoral in Budapest.
When I left the Russian officer  came  it was getting very dark.
So I guess  the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners  whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners  I don't know  but I know there were Germans.
And I could hear the click of the trigger  but nothing came out and he did that two or three times and then he got mad and sort of threw his gun on the floor and shouted to me at Russian -- in -- in Russian  which I didn't understand and pointing at the tree  what it obviously meant  that I should wait for him there at the tree  to be shot when he comes back with a different gun.
And Russian  which I took in -- in -- in -- in Czechoslovakia and Kosheetza  which I had to take.
So a Russian fella came in  and he says  ﬁOh  girls are here   okay  we going to bring my friend.ﬂ So we ran out from the train  and we wait there  the train left with all our stuff  we have to go look for other stuff.
We were a year under Russia  and so when the Russian came there were -- all the stores were -- were taken away from the population  so ther e was no private ownership.
How did you happen to choose Russian studies as a ... Oh my goodness.
Now it was just one after the other  but the Russian offensive wa s really nearing to Auschwitz.
The last  the last bullet  the Russian bullet got his hand  his left hand.
Did they seem like criminal -- Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians  they open the jails you know  the [indecipherable] they were vicious guys  killers.
From the beginning  then I mentioned  from the beginning before the hostilities between Germany and Russia  Im talking 1940  a lot of Jews in the ghe tto were still receiving packages from relatives from the Russian side.
In those times  you know  I wouldn't say I was very proud to be in Russian army  but I actually had no feelings  is what I want to say  I had no feelings.
Uh towards...closer to liberation in early 1944  uh the Germans tried to rid the forests of the partisans because they were already in retreat and in order to to be able to fight the war  they had to get rid of this monkey on their back  somebody that that was inflicting all kinds of uh disruptions and they had...uh in addition to the Germans there were some Russian groups  actually it was a Ukrainian group in our part of the of the country...where a whole military unit had turned themselves over to the Germans and they were fighting on the side of the Germans and uh they were doing the dirty work for the Germans  and those people had what they called the blockade.
Into depending on which was which was Austrian  which was Russian  German.
Came to another town  we looked around what was bat we were very much aware  and Im really surprised you probably heard from other people because you the first one ever asking me really  that Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 12question  how because we were were a lot afraid of being raped by the Russian soldiers.
Drive the horse  and then we were already in Latvia  and then we 4 stopped and they are still with us two days  and then this man stopped some other people and  of course  speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day  like a half a day and they said we should go closer to the water.
And So your first class is actually your beginning school It was Russian  yeah.
He -- after the -- I-I think after th e -- the liberation that the Russian took him back to the army and he was killed in the army  yeah.
One was me  and one was a guy that actually he was Russian  you know.
It was a case which I have to describe that a a a Russian tank failed to when they were by escaping  they they just he was right next to the next to the river  the Nemunas .
And then he told me that the German Jews: W hy are you here?
So he trade the package of cigarettes with the Russian soldier which was wounded and he was in the bed and he sold his shirt.
They were escaped people from the Russian Army deserters  there were Poles in it  women  children  lots of young women all of them carrying around guns  and armed  which was very strange.
And when I went to Belarus   I found out that everybody there speak Russian.
>> Susan Snyder: So during this about two -year experience under Russian occupation  under Soviet occupation  there is this fear that the Germans will eventually invade.
So  then I was sent -- thats was already -- we already free people -- already we -- the Russian army free.
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
Now  talking about the Russian partisans  you see  the head  eh I forgot how you say  groups  okay  of partisans.
We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good.
They opened a conserve factory and send it to Russian and so the cheese  the Russian soldiers didn't get nothing  so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I would give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was.
Anyway  there were a bunch of Russians who hated him  because he especially hated Russians  I dont know why  because he was a Spanish Communist and the Russians were Russian Communists  but he hated them.
My father  mother spoke Polish but used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
You said this Russian girl brought you home -- Yes. --
You see  as a child  I di dnt really  was expo sed to much to the rich because my parents  being students and be ing  and this time with t he Russian revolution  didnt  were not religious at all.
In 1939  the Russians came in  and we went to the Russian school for awhile until the Germans chased the Russians out  and came in  and occupied.
At beginning of the war  some Jewish were deported and some special camps  not in Germany  in the Romanian territory and later on  in uh the Russian territory.
There was a little boy who was somehow able to get food to us and then we stayed for a while with Russian Jewish people because my sister kind of was engaged to the son.

In Memel you could get by with German which is what we spoke and Russian which my father spoke with his sisters.

Uh light haired and uh spoke uh Russian  Polish  Lithuanian  German  and uh she was able to sustain us uh by sneaking out of the barbed wire fence in the middle of the night and visiting farmers in this outskirts of the ghetto. (
There were statements of form er Treblinka guards  who identified Hajda  and there was a whole issue  as you probably saw  about the spelling of Hajda  because the Polish -- the s -- the -- the sound of Hajda  theres no H in Russian  and the interrogations were always in Russian.
If they're not some of them were running away from the Army  which there was a lot of Russian Jewish officers.
They took us and they said we going to go on the track and you going to -- they gave us saws  he says  ﬁYoure going to cu-cut telephone poles and telegraphs and stuff like that.ﬂ The Russian says  ﬁOh  you do  we -- they lay an ambush ﬂ he says  ﬁwe going to protect you  atﬂ -- everything at night.
They didnt speak German  they didnt speak Yiddish  but they spoke this sort of dialect.
But she was afraid and she wasnt  I would say  it was a problem for he r. So eventually what happened  the nun USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 5gave her clothes  and put on a big cross on her  and she took off to a town in central Poland  and there she spend most of -- most of the time til  in 1944 when the Russian moved up to near -- n ear where she was staying  liberated her  and she came back to Pruzana with a nun.
That time my mother she did not have any papers that s he was a teacher so she went to the university in Irkutsk and she graduated as a teacher of Russian language.
But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue  Polish which he spoke totally fluently.
She all a of a sudden came to the -- to ours -- and she didnt speak -- to our camp  and she didnt speak Russian  she spoke Yiddish.
Certainly our leaflets constantly showed the Russian front  which looked much their advances were much quicker than our advances  so we had to focus on  soon you will be occupied by the Russians.
And this is what -- what the -- for seven years he was in a Russian camp and he had a prayer book that was one inches long  somepla ce hidden.
And now it comes out  I think  the only reason he dated me  he was majoring in Russian.
And at that point in time  the Germans took some of the Italians prisoner.
I spoke German too because German was second language in -- in -- in high school  foreign language.
And the the Russi an soldiers came in  and told us [speaks Russian] again  you know  get out  get out.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
Then they used to hold the hand grenades  ready to throw in the hand grenades.
But in Miami Beach  many people be en coming on the beach  my husband (not my first husband) he knew Russian becaus e they lived in Russia so I l earned to speak Yiddish.
Uh   Russian officers; but... but...but he was...he was proud of this.

We are going to be resettled to Poland  and they're going to have Russians -- White Russian  who were replacing us.
the Russian the Russians th-ther they were just trying to organize  apparently  tha-that area  you know  and and of course they they knew they let my father go before  so this time they are taking him for for good  to the to the Wolkowysk jail.
And so we came in a -- in a Russian hospital and we were very  very poor and we didnt have anything.
Then the Romani an army stopped fighting  and the Russian army was already in the east and with no opposition  advanced very quickly and tanks came into Bucharest  and I remember the Russian tanks coming  and me waving them  and my mother waving them  and finally the liberators. [

In in the Russian army  they knew I was Jewish but in the Polish army  a priest came over to me and said to me  I know you're...because  you know  they know...you know  the Polish people are not circumcised.
And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian.
Schooling  since -- since were on the subject of schooling  the last two years that I was in Czechoslovakia  in Kosheetza  the Russians began to take hold and we had to take Russian language as a -- as a language  that was a re-requ-requirement that we all had to do.
Be cause in that time was  Germany was divided to the Russian sector and the rest was called Threezonia  three zones.
If you remember  about four or five years ago  where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo  they showed the Russian Siberian man  who was a weightlifter and a wrestler  how he ran a mile in the snow that deep?
So it was then  and it went to the history that the Russian army celebrated Czechoslovakia .
What happened -- the reason I mention that  who they were  they were Russian  the Hungarians and the Germans had such superiority; they just felt like Slavic people were down on the bottom of the barrel.
He was in the Russian army  then they transfer him to the Polish army.
I recall when I came to the United States at -- at the age 16  well  I spoke Yiddish  I spoke Hebrew  I spoke Russian  Germa n  Lithuanian  studied Latin and failed.

So  are you is there any apprehen sion that theres going to be a war coming to Latvia  that the Germans will do something that this wont stay- No  no because according to the Ribbentr op Molotov Pact  Latvia and Estonia and a good part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently occupation  and that Germans would not dare attack Russia.
Uh  a Jew from Poland was toughened up  or a Russian Jew or whoever they had from the  th e eastern Europe.

Long live comrades who liberated us.ﬂ Disarmed the convoy  gave the Poles in the convoy -- because the commanding officer was Polish  the political officer  second in command  was Russian and he ran away.
A  a Russian  russian officer a Jew who is they find out that he is a Jew so they brought him to the fort and then he  he made this uh this escape  the plan of escape and this Vasilenko came into the ghetto and he sat with him overnight in the (routine?)
And thats how we found out though that the Russians actually came  because he was out and when he came back he 21 reported that there was drinking in the street and he saw Russian soldiers.
They were Russian  released Russian Russian appar Im so rry  Russian prisoners of war.
He work ed for the Russian government in  in buying agricultural implements for the Russians.
So  so the sol the Russian soldier before he finish his all the sentence  we jumped off from the from horse and wagon  said  ﬁYou can have the horse and wagon.ﬂ They will shoot us  you know  the it was  the lawlessness was law  you know  those days and the strong was the weak was the pawn you know and the strong was the rule the ruler.

I cannot do it.ﬂ So they were hidden on a flat car that had a tank that was traveling to the front German tanks that were going to the Russian front and covered with tarps  so they were hidden under the tarps and they somehow made it.
Well  actually  we were on the Death March and my particular group was liberated by the Russian army.
And then we learned  it was a few days later  there was a big fence between the Russian and the German Jewish ghe tto.

for Russian sold so he had like a special store Yeah.
Liberchuk -- Celia Liberchuk and Labe Liberchuk  which was in Russian Leonid  because Labid was too Jewish for -- for -- for sure  to be in -- in Russia.

Family actually spoke Russian at home because it was section of bialo -- Byelorussia  Byeloru -- and I knew them  they used -- my grandmother used to come to our house every summer  and she -- when the war started  we actually went to Pinsk because it was on eastern border of Poland  and we were hoping the German will never get there.
So -- so I ask her  ﬁDo you speak other languages?ﬂ She said  ﬁYes  I speak German  I speak ﬂ -- of course she spoke in Polish -- ﬁI speak Russian  and I speak Hebrew  and I speak English.ﬂ So I said  ﬁEnglish?ﬂ And I spoke a little English.
Of course  we were not afraid  we thought that the Russian are here  that the Germans are not here  but we were deeply mistaken.
2 unreliable (Russian) 3 Yes  with the family and I'll describe you the house we lived in the ghetto.
The second reason in -- in -- was because they wanted to slow down the Russian approach.
First of all  I did try to go back to visit my father  but after the real hard adjustment was over  couldnt get a passport  cause I was not a Czech res -- citizen  I was not a Russian citizen  and I was not an American citizen.
See  when the Germans destroyed the Russian army  they dropped everything on the fields.
The Russian s stood with the rifles  and the Polish with the rifles.

The people  the owners who were ow ners of plantation; they had plantation in the eastern part of Poland but they lost everything because of revolution  the Russian revolution in 1917  they returned to Warsaw and they treated the place they lived like their plantation.
And here in the museum when I meet some people that speak Russian or Polish  I can understand some of it  not all of it.
First  Im sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward Russian territory rather than just taking care of you themselves  and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood  what it -- what this all felt like.
At that moment I was giving Russian lessons to this guardsman  cause he wanted to go to the eastern front  so he was he was he didn't like the he was afraid of the camp supervisor  who was a horrible woman  but he said that if I was cau he was caught with me  giving me this lesson  it wouldnt be so bad beca use we can always say I was just doing something for him.
So I said  this is a Russian name and people cannot pr onounce it and I cut off th e beginning and the head and the tail  like  like a herring and I keep the middle.
So  from the Polish school I had two more years  I went to the Russian school.
In fact  when I came to Berlin and it was all the troops from everywhere  from Russia.
So I put down a list of 103 books  and Russian literature was a very  very modern at the time   to read the Russian  the Russian literature translated into Polish.
So it gave them a lot of motivation to kill Jews  and in the most brutal way  like ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VER BATIM RECORD 12 having water sprayed ont o them at minus 40 degrees weather in Russia  in the Russian winter.

They would not the Berlin the the the Russian embassy laughed at me when I went there  shed say  you high tech Americans  youre cra you think we would be able to communicate with the consulate in San Francisco ?
So it had no impact on me  but when we got in and the ne xt thing that I reme mber after I told you about the radio  and the uvaga  uvaga  the attention  attention  my father had a motorcycle  and the Soviets sent out word  they wanted him and the motorcycle to report to an assembly point  and my father was goi ng to deliver that motorcycle to them  and mother said  no you're not  and she fainted  a nd because she fainted and that's the first time I've ever experienced anything like that  one of his friends came by and he told him  he says  you always wanted to ride my motorcycle  he says here are my gloves  my helmet  my goggles  take my motorcycle and de liver it to such and such assembly point  and the guy got to that assembly point with the motorcycle  and he was taken  a Russian officer got him  right on him  wouldn't let hi m go  and took him off to the Soviet Union with the motorcycle  and they left.
One of the funniest thing this Russian dentist with his boyfriend and my mother didn't know what happened  she was just recuperating from typhus and this guy walked in in a top hat  tuxedo with tails and a white scarf around his neck.

However  I think the Russian Army still is involved in a lot of drinking.
So...uh...I remember one time...uh...we were walking on one side of the street and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew they were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and they let them wear the uniform.
And I remember they were playing the Russian music and dancing to it.

At that time uh when the Germans came   of course  they went to the Jewish Kultusgemeinde --the religious and cultural community --and wanted the name[s] of the Jews.
And they couldnt believe  because oh  the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there  th-the -- ye -- you know  with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live  and he picked up some Jewish  he is not Jewish.
S-So youre describing it almost a -- a kind of insular quality that at some point th-the city was Russian  then it was Polish  but you and your family were -- were simply always Jewish?
And first we went to a place called Stettin in Poland and there we were able to establish contacts with some Russian soldiers who smuggled us over the border also for bribes  smuggled us over the border into Berlin.
And eventually  when the Russian army pushed ahead  and liberated Auschwitz  people were coming in -- people from there were coming -- going east to this town  to the cities where they belong .
I was -- I stop now and then in thrift stores  some might pick up antique or something  so this Russians -- Russian walked in  so I said to the Armenian  which she -- I said is -- one of your friends is a Russian.
During the early days of the Russian occupation of Germany  which was just north of us  I found out that there was a warehouse that had the leather pants that the SS troop  the motorcycle troops wore.
No  this one I ga I didnt [indecipherable] after he after already these people I met these people  then I have seen the German office its a Russian officer in very group of soldiers.
So I was with a going on with a Russian  they needed me like a hole in the head  they didn't have themselves anything.
He broke a vein and at night...I'm lost that that two days after the liberation almost all my 18 The picture of the Black Madonna in the Jasna Gora church in Czestochowa 19 lorry-mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) 15 blood.
You know you couldnt talk any Russian to them but we made a motion that we wanted the ring and we gave them an apple or gave them a slice of bread  you know.
And you were liberated  as you say -- At [indecipherable] by -- -- by some Russian soldiers -- -- soldiers.
Well  to cut a long story short  we were evacuated  and then I found out that he was killed in action on the Russian front.
Everybody had to be ready to uh to wa lk out with the exception of those people in the in the uh uh ho spital who couldn't walk  a nd we were certain that uh they would be killed there because they wouldn't let them fall into the hands of the Russian army  13 of the Red army  and also we saw the day before by the way  that a lot obviously of papers uh uh had been burned  so the SS got already uh marching order with the with the with the order also to take care of papers which could be could be uh uh used against them  and then on the 18th in the afternoon we walked out and also the the the wo men of the of the brothe l walked out and it was approximate...it was a a terrible wintry day  approximately we h eard this...it was minus eighteen centigrades  which I think is less than zero fahre nheit.
But when I started school of course I had both friends and  and school friends so we had to speak either Yiddish or Polish. (
49 beginning  because I spoke fluent Russian -- af ter all I  and a good Russian  too.
33 A In spite of the fact that it was already the Russian period  the religion was not anymore a dominant factor.
The first day  we shoot in in in a Russian plane by mistake.
Germany was a very advanced -- with everything  technologically  and a -- and how could a nation do that to every people in the world  and not just Jews  to Russian  [indecipherable] and Gypsies.
Did you go to a Jewish school or a Polish school?
They had the sa me edition in Russian and I think Arabic.
Russian soldiers with in uniforms  they were runni ng thi stuff.
Some were fighting with  on the Russian front and were wounded.
We got to the point Interview with Ernest Dutcher February 19  2013 81where we were playing Russian roulette  that it would its not going to hit us  you know  type of thing  you know.
The first year at school was in Yiddish  everything Yiddish  but we used to study Russian.
And I knew that the at that time there were some unpleasant meetings betw een the German and Russian people  diplomatic  some conferences or whatever  we didnt know yet at that time.
I've been watching the Sri Lanka phenomenon for 20 years  58 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) 51 now.
And I had  for example  when I was the last few weeks what I was with the partisans  especially I think I mentioned there in the thing  I was a captain  a Russian  his name was Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 77Mosalchuk or something like that.
ﬂ 11 Mother wanted to get across  out of Russia  out of the Russian occupation area.
I learned the English language  and I worked at school and then as an interpreter  a translator at the plant; and tried to become  its not so easy to become a writer in Russia.
Yes  I went to Polish school  I had to go to Polish school.
You see  when the Russian soldier came all the way from Siberia and Agnes Adachi 50 October 14  1995 it was winter time  they came without shoes and they never saw a bathroom in their life.
Not as a Russian talking Jewish person  which was the style of our Jewish population.
You rubbed  you rubbed and dry  only to look likeŠon the road  we met Russian prisoners of war  alone.
Russian language  Russian soldiers  dear ladies  we didnt know you were here  we were  we are fighting the war  we found already a few other camps.
His name now is Oded Amarand  but at that time  his name was D odo  and we decided we would walk to this nearby village -- I have no i-idea of how much of a distance that was  in order to try to get this wagon  and on the way  we were stopped by Russian soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us.
Because I knew about the rush where the Russian industries were.
They told whoever is Jewish  wants to go to the Russian side  is welcome to -- to leave.
As a result  plus that the Russian army had a huge overwhelming victory in January of 1943  where the Hungarian army was at the Danube  large river in Ukraine.
Vlasov give up three million best soldiers from Vlasov in the Russian army gave up  because they didnt like the communism  right.
Lallier  we know that you know languages  we badly need you for your east European languages to be trained as a specialist in Soviet affairs  but you have to learn Russian.
And trucked back of the Russian lines all the way to Asiatic Russia  in order to keep them out of the battle zones.
I  perhaps it was other Jews as well  I'm not sure.
we have a very nice little group of resistance  what Schindler himself created  wa s 15 of us ex-soldiers  who uh  he organized us in special little groups  and everybody has a job to do  he explained to us that there are orders when the war will be over  and we are already close to the  because there was the uh the march 1945  the war was going to the end  is or--there are order to executed all those people in the Brinwitz camp  and already there were a grave dig out by the Russian prisoner of war who were in the different camp  four people from Brinwitz  from the camp of Schindler .
And then in late August  maybe early September  my father came back on a Russian hospital train.
Well  as I said  th-the the Russian and Poland had non-aggression pact Russia and Poland   mm-hm.
But then wa once we were transferred to the other location  and it was already getting into the time when the when the schoolyear begins  I was assigned to go to the Russian school.
The languages taught were Serbo-Croatian  there was Polish  there was Russian.
No  my mother was from Poland but my father was from Germany.
The soldiers  the Russian soldiers were absolutely obsessed wi th getting a watch  getting watches.
At night...the same night after they shipped him  some were caught at the...the Russian army caught the trains and busted the trains up and let the prisoners out.
He and his brother were born in Russia  by coincidence because their father worked there for several years and when they applied for a visa to the United States - they came on the Russian quota which was wide open - and got immediately a visa because they thought they were coming on the Czechoslovakian quota which was waiting list for years.
And so then  when I come th was up there on the 12 th of April this year  they had the ceremony about everyt hing up there  and was greeted by this man from Ukraine  a Russian.
So thats where I get there in sometime November or so  w ith the Russian.
No 42 bread (Russian) 43 Matyas Rakosi 38 food  even for everyone.
Anyway  he used to go out and other people and buy from the Russian soldiers  part of the uniform and later sell it in the market  you know.
They were speaking Yi-Yiddish  I never learned Yiddish  I learned a bit of Hebrew because of the Bar Mitzvah and the gift  but -- but nothing  nothing else  it was French  I wa -- you know.
So I didnt speak Yiddish at that time  I spoke German and these people spoke Yiddish  so you had  Yiddish is a turned around German.
We were sitting in the cellar and uh the Russian tanks came in and there were a lot of shooting  a lot of killing.
So this was a kind of a period that those who were at least in the capital city  they were a little bit freer to move around than obviously those who were in the forced batta lions in the Russian front.
Was there a reason why they would ha ve wanted you to take this Russian refresher course?
And later she got another education and she could teach Russian  English and German.
Oh yes  he is a Jew  or he was a Jew.
Aﬂ It was Auschwitz about what we heard in the Russian radio.
It was in the summer of 1943 and they unloaded us on the main road in the camp where we saw across the road British and Russian prisoners still finishing the barracks.
The only thing I remember is one of the Russian guys was chasing my brother because he had boots on and he wanted the boots.
Did you like these Russians  the Russian soldiers  and the Russians that you -- Well  I didnt really sort of -- I was curious about them  you know.
The inmates -- and it was definitely silence  a nd everybody was shuffling  and I decided I had 109 something to -- I had to do something  and I stoppe d as if to tie my shoe  and turned around and yelled pasnia in Russian  a song.
But so many German girls been -- the parents hiding in base ment the girls in the cold from the Russian Commando.
Well  when I visited the furrier [indecipherable] after the war  he told me an amazing story  he said when the 166 Russians came  you know and he lived  of course in an area of big mansions and they were going everywhere just emptying places out -- Maria went and sort of got a hold of the first Russian officer and had a long conversation in Russian with him.
We had no money  we had no clothes a nd we were very weak and we came there and Chaim started working and they had the -- Chaim had to go in the army  the Russian -- in Polish army.
And then naked  wet  we stood in that freezing cold wintry day 'til we got the remnan ts of Russian prisoner of wars uniforms  which was cotton top and cotton pants.
While we were on the Russian side  the Russian wasnt there.
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
Each had a sector  and there was an international sector  and one had to be very careful not to go into the Russian sector at this time  because you could be arrested.
He said he knows England and was very friendly and he gave it to me and then I got my passport in French - French  English and Russian  not a German word was in it.
And interestingly  even though I was born in Lithuania  I did not speak Lithuanian  we spoke Yiddish at home.
And  underneath it all  they were looking for the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out informing the links between various camps for Jewish DPs  who were coming out of the Russian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of reasons that weve already talked about.
Me  Ruben  and two Russian prisoners went out through the same hole.
So the colonel pulled out a piece of paper and wrote something down in Russian and said whenever in th e future  Russians sort of try to attack us or molest us  to show that paper.
There was no authority  no Russian authority di recting us anyplace  no Czechoslovak authority directing us anyplace.
I I speak fluently because I have kwa I was communicated with the with the Russian people.
A nd there was a third one by name of Piotr  who was a Russian studying in Poland  who was caught up and was deported with the Poles.
I mean  when you and you father left Lodz -- Lodz  looking for a place in the Russian zone that -- that your family coul d relocate  did you -- did you have any idea at USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 9 all or any sense that you would be split u -- your -- your family would be split up the way that it was?
USHMM Archives RG -50.030*0151 13 They were sent in un some camps again in the Romanian territory  in Bessarabia if I recall  and uh later on in uh Russian territory.
Not maybe pe rfect  but I had the beginning in Lwow   and of course in the in the camps  they spoke only Russian  you know  in when we were incarcenated in the camps.
That was his name  he was sort of Polish and white and Russian mixed in him  so either way you would call him Polish would be correct.
Because the woman in the house  t he German got friendly -- the Russian got friendly with the German people there.
We...I was born on the German side; but we wound up on the Russian side.
My husband had a very close encounter with a Russian who told him  \ I don't think you're a Jew  I think you're a spy  there's no more Jews here  we know that Hitler killed them all.\
But he was Polish  he spoke Polish  he identified with the Polish state.
Also then a couple of months la ter  they established everybody from 16 years and a half had to get a passport  the Russian passports with pictures.
And one times we stay in the barracks and they open th e door and we saw the first Russian soldier.
We ran out in front of the barn and those were Russian tanks that were rolling into that particular town.
So the Russian officer says  \ You are a director of the factory 10 and you are barefoot.
Interesting is the fact that they have attracted a large group of Russian Jews to Czernowitz... OK.
So I walked back to give that report and on the way back  along one of the streets  I saw a sizable group of Germans  coming under guard by -- by two Russians  one Russian in front with a gun over the shoulder and one Russian behind.
RG-50.030*0580 8 And do you recall it was  you know  they were going to to the Russian zone?
In the Bible  I have the Bible in English  in Russian.
The Russians came in and of course that school was closed and we went to a Russian school.
They told us that in Poland the Jews were massacred in the forest  that they were dumped into mass graves and that the earth was moving on top of the grave for weeks after the shootings  after the killings  that not all of them were completely killed and the ones who came back from the Russian front  they apparently must have met Einsatztruppen or saw them in action  they said the Jews were taken out from the town to a field outside the town and they were rounded up and all of them were brought together and they were surrounded and then the Germans mounted the machine gun on a truck and they were circling around these surrounded people and they were machine gunning them and as long as they kept on circling them and firing into them until they assumed that everybody was killed.
And finally we did get to  to n earby west of Warsaw and there we got a train  a Russian transport train which was delivering petrol or what you say  gasoline.
I  as a young person  was starting again like all young people used to get together after school in the evening and it was the Russian system  which they called \ Dacadumcrasne ami\    which it means the house of the Red Army.
But and of course in Latvia there was a a certain amount of Jewish population.
But he came back -- he was a prisoner in Russia  but he came back half a year before the war ended.
Very few wanted to be in the Russian zone and very few wa nted to be in the French zone even  but some did.
This could be a from a variety of languages: Russian  Polish  or German.
33 No  no  he was almost as bad as Altov ( ph) by his behavior like when he was coming theyd he also demanded to freeze  people to freeze  and then they were the people  the Sicherheit Polizei   which was the  like - I dont know how to say encavudei in Russian  how do Sicherheit Polizei   they were– Intelligence police?
Just took us away  put us in prison  and later we found out that the reason we were arrested there was one Russian officer  a lieutenant  who was anti-Semite.
This was probably around the time when the Russian Army was beginning to approach and was liberating some camps.
I think there was a period of time when they would have they were looking to get out of Germany because they knew that this was not a place for Jews to be living.
I went to a Russian captain  but otherwise th ey'll think that you come to take revenge on them.
It was everything normal until one dayŠit was about the 7 th of May  7 th of May  yeahŠcame KGB and took us all  took us to a place where it was about a few thousand Russian former prisoners of war  that big villa with a big backyard.
Now  my two older brothers  they were chosen to go in the woods  to fight against the Germans  because they were already with the Russian army.
But my brother  when he got over to the Russian side  guess what.
I went to a Polish school nearby because I didnt know to write and to read in Polish  only in Russian.
Yeah  you know  here is another place that I was during this time  because it was close to this Russian border  and I figure out when I need to run away  if Germans come I can run to Russia .
And he said  \ Oh  how come your German is so good?\
Then  of course  I was drawn back there under the pretext that I want to go to the Russian zone and my parents didnt object.
It was not September yet  it was August  maybe eight -- maybe 20  maybe 25 th August  during the uprising  before you know  this -- when I was oo -- oo -- ooldit -- when I was  you know  under the -- under the bombing  and then the funeral  it was in ‚44  and funeral was in the -- when the -- was a Russian come  it was probably in May  maybe a -- maybe April  maybe May ‚45.
I wonder sometimes what their fate was  if they were ru were Russian  probably a bad fate.
Did you -- just to g -- to go back  and when you were in school you said you had Jewish friends; were there Jewish teachers at your school?
So we went to the mountains  40 miles; from one border to the other one  even after the liberation  to get together  because we were on the Russian border.
Wh en we were liberated by the Russians  few days  and I was fortunate to be accepted by the Russians when I only weighed 84 pounds  was a walking skeleton  but they did not accept as a as survivors because the Germans have even put up the skeletons  that saboteurs  ----------the Russians  so they don't know what experience they have  but was very strongly interrogated  but to my good fo rtune  there was a Russian  a Jewish Russian general  and I give him proof that I'm Jewish  so I was accepted actually  the greatest thing he could do for me  the uniform of a dead soldier was take o ff and given me  a part of it.
13 Located on the Black Sea  very near the border between the Russian S.F.S.R. and Georgia.
You said earlier there was a chance you might be deported also to Russia.
And I threw away the rifle  and the Russian he yelled to me in Russian   stupid.
A lot of ad -- parents had a lot of friends from the army who were officers from the Russian Tsaristic army  incorpor ated into Lithuanian army.
But the group that remained there in this was from the Russian side because they dont they didn't have where to go.
They took from the Russian church  from the parochial house  they took the house and they opened a pharmacy.
So on the end  he had to leave that pharmacy and he went back with my uncle  together  because  you know  there were lot of Russian people.
My parents spoke Yiddish to each other  Russian to their kids  and we kids spoke French.
And so the -- both the Hungarian Army and the labor battalions were very poorly equipped  particularly the clothes for the Russian winter.
So  I scraped the word   ﬁEvrei ﬂ -- Jew  and I wrote in the word ﬁBelarus ﬂ -- white Russian  with India ink  the same color India i nk.
There was a Russian expression that the populat ion -- the Jewish population used.
I see a Ukra inian policeman put an arm on my shoulder  and he says to me  ﬁIsn't your name Jasz a?ﬂ And that was my nickname  my Russian nickname.
He was also in the war  taken to the war  a Russian man.
All I know is that somehow towards the end we wound up in the Saar region dancing  and that's where I was liberated by the Russian soldiers.
And the Russian soldiers saw me  picked me up  carried me like I carry ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 this glass  like a package.
So when I woke up after 3 days without conscious because I lost a lot of blood  being already on the verge of dying because I had typhoid and no food  no water  for the last time before the Russian entered.
Not very well  but they did speak Yiddish and German and sometimes fall into Polish  but not very often.
And we came to the village and we saw Russian soldiers around you  and in we want to be closer to the soldiers.
A. Now  then suddenly overnight everyone in Sweden started to learn Russian.
So here I am in Astroegetts  I just came for vacation  it was June  and Im sitting and reading a book  and I remember what book I was reading...I was reading the book in Russian and it was by the son of To lstoy and it was about Peter the Great.
And he wa -- th-this was a -- a young man who was a deserter f -- he -- he was fighting on -- on the Russian side.
They were on a death march from From Theresienstadt   because the Russian advance d. Okay .
So we were so it sounds that your par your parents were assimilated into Polish?
I had to try and do everything so that she wouldnt be seen  and eventually I got her certificate  and how to send her to the airport which was in the Russian zone?
When the Russian caught me and they thought I am gonna run away.
So the only way to ma -- Franka had some Russian friends  so she found that out.
He hitchhiked on wagons  Russian convoys  and finally made it back to the ghetto.
I translated on confer ences from Russian into Polish and from Polish into Russian  immediately.
And they said  ﬁNo  we cannot do it  because we are not allowed to.ﬂ But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters  that they put us behind  in that little carriage  but they said  ﬁThe first house in Lomborg  you have to get out.ﬂ So  as we came into Lomborg  the first house  they said in -- in Russian  out.
When my parents  when they were young people  they started in the University of St. Petersburg  so they spoke Russian . ‚
I had behind my back a Russian and he wanted to rape me.
Fortunately he went  and he did pick him up and the Russian officer came and he told the commander in the yard that uh he needs me very badly and he has to release me and he did release me.
That was the last time  when my father left on a train and the Russian uniform  that I saw my dad.
The Germans din -- We were come -- We were ra -- We ran away  you know  when the bobocart  and we start to run towards the German -- to the Russian border.
I wa s Russian after World War Two  now its Ukraine.
I didnt -- only after 39  when th-the ration came  and they took Lvov and then the -- the government was like a -- a -- a Russian government  and th-they -- the -- the Russi an [indecipherable]  they -- they opened the kindergartens and I went -- the first time I went to the kindergarten in 39  the end of 39  maybe 40  th -- I -- I remember the date that I went -- went to the kindergarten  how I wa -- I was crying.
Do you remember any really striking experiences with the 12 Russian peasants that either they were really terrible to you or really tried to help you significantly?
Polish  because I learned a little Polish while I was in Poland  and its a Slavic language  and I had a -- I think I have some talent for languages  so I caught on.
But right now is still after Ukraine  what would be next is Lithuania  and Poland   they they were mentioning that at at first.
They had more than 70 000 Russian Jews on the other side  and we were 12 000  after a few weeks  from Vienna   another one from Berlin   another one from Interview with Gary H .
And Moldavia was the first part to come under the Russian army.
Besides being a messenger for him and ma king reports  what else were you do -- I [indecipherable] the same  I had always to receive the Russian commands to prepare  you know  special food for them.
And there was an Italian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house  and her little girl her little daughter was my playmate.
And and tw o prisoners fell in love with my aunts  and they married my aunts  and when the revolution of Russia started  the war with the Interview with A. Zalc  L. Ragin  J. Mizrachi July 23  2009 5Germans and Russians stopped  because the Germans made the Russian revolution  I dont know if you know th at  yeah.
Yeah  there was a school  but my mother didnt want to send me to Russian school.
As I said  it had been u nder Russian influence  and now it seems to be  you know  a -- a -- a great place to live now.
They came in  and as far as I know  nothing really changed for us with one exception  the official language became Russian instead of Polish  because -- and that was no problem  because most Europeans are bi- or tri-lingual because of necessity  our neighbors all around us were speaking a different language  so that was no problem.
There was a German firm; they were putting up structures for high tension wires from the German border to the Russian border all along.
They had a choice  to go either to that -- to the Russian school or to the Czech school.
And I said to my wife  \ Soon or later  very soon  you will have your Russian.
You had  in Krakow   unlike in the Soviet Union  you immediately had Jewish organizations  and those organizations would try to provide as much information as Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 68possible  about the whereabouts of surviv ors  or liquidations of earlier ghettoes  when and where and how  and so forth  which you did not have in Russian occupied Poland .
You also have to re-remember that my parents were a generation th at was educated in Russian schools.
Nathan: Yes  she spoke Russian  Polish  German  of course Yiddish and Hebrew  you know.
And I  I mean this is the experience of the Russian Occupatio n. From my very personal  I to ld you that I had this 16 years older sister and she  shes much more  I was closer  closer to her than to my mother or my father.
I took a train  and I was wearing Russian uniform  everything.
And my mother wouldnt say that she was born in Russia  she was born in Poland and thats it.
78 05:13:16 And then  when the Russian came  they spoke  I could understand what they talk to us  they used to say  well we liberated you  we did liberate you  they said in Russian  and you don't want to love us  so we knew it's going to come for us  so it came at night; 05:13:41 we used to barricade all the doors and windows; all the furniture  there were benches over there  and chairs  you know  the furniture heavy  like oak  heavy oak furniture was the  so we put it against  and we didn't go to sleep first  until the barricade was up the ceiling  that they couldn't open the door.
No t an American professor  but a German professor  or the Russian professor from before the war  which is a different thing.
And the Russian women  they was crazy about nylons  because they don't even know -- for nyl on  they giving away everything.
We should go with a Russian army   where they took  you know  was already occupied from the German territory  when they gave it to Poland  and Stolczyn  Szczecin  all the Jews arrived.
She spoke some English  among immigrants she spoke several languages  fluent in German of course  and in Polish.
There was a Russian soldier holding me  and the rain were the tears from the -- his eyes.
As ill as she was  my mother's lady  she was a very fine woman  but I guess survival is over taken everything and you run like animals at that time  and we started to make plans that one day 01:34: we will meet at the main station and take a train and again to go into a place or maybe we will ask somebody where we will be able to work  or maybe we'll go to the Russian border and maybe we will be across the border to go to Russian that we shouldn't be under the German occupation.
Our teacher o-of the Russian language was a Lithuanian diplomat  he was arrested  there was no Russian class there.
The Russians were actually -- were more sympathetic  because the Russian underground -- the Russian partisans were more sympathetic toward Jews  they -- they accepted Jews on a -- on a basis where you didnt have to say who you were  as long as you were willing to fight  as long as you were willing to do something.
And I wondered if you could tell a little bit more about  well the time of liberation  encountering the Russian soldiers.
But later on I picked up somehow by  I dont know  I picked up the language  not that Im fluent  but maybe because through my language  my mother-in-law spoke Yiddish and Russian and so -- But when you were younger you didnt [indecipherable] No  when I was younger  no  I didnt speak any Yiddish at all.
So  after being there two days  we sneaked out of the Ghetto and continued our trip to the Russian side.
And they said   you have to speak German and you have to go through all this.
I think that he belonged to organization  the underground Polish organization  and he knew wh-wha-whats going on  and we knew that  y-you know  the eastern front is coming  that the Russian -- that -- that th-th-the German lost the Stalingrad and they are now -- now retreating  and we were v-very happy.
The Russian didnt want to give the Poles the honor of doing something for themself.
And uh during that time uh when uh my mother and my sister were liberated in uh Ravensbruck in East...what was East Germany under the Russian influence.
And then  with a group of hundreds of other Jews  they took me on the mountains in a former Russian caserne  a military unit.
So this was now 1946  I was 11 years old and I came to England  to Newcastle  and starte d going to school there and I didnt know a word of English and I had to learn another language and then -- Which would have been your -- how many languages now  by the -- Well  my native was -- was German and then Polish and then of course during the war  Ukrainian and then after the war  Russian.
It took me a whole year till  from the hospital till the support  ti ll I was given the so- called clean bill of health and I was...be cause Vienna was then under the Russian and I was...a Russian citize n: they gave me papers to go back to Vienna.
And I become again a social worker a nd...uh...I am amongst other things  Chairman of the Russian Resettlement Committee of the Jewish Social Services agency here in Washington  and I have been active there for 25 years.
So population there spoke Russian and the Jews spoke Yiddish  too  so my mother  who was born there and her family spoke Russian and -- and Yiddi sh.
And next morning  we were taken to the Russian hospital where I stood and there I was 9th of May. 9th of May 45  when it was end of the war  I was there.
She spoke the Slavic languages  so in Czechoslovakia she could understand some of the Czecho– so  she found out a lot of little things  exactly where we were.
The food was not  you know...food...the Russian army never works on  you know  they used to get their own food.
Why don't you describe that day that -- that you were liberated by the Russian partisans yer.
And we found in the papers that you are a kindergarten teacher  so you will take over this whole um Russian village except the the woman between eighteen 'til thirty-five.
But you had to communicat e when you were in the partisans in Russian  right?
There  I met two girls in Russian uniforms fr om my home town.
When it came to   I said  Im not Russian  Im Polish.
The Russians had already advanced  Russian troops had already moved in.
One was of Russian origin and the other Stanislaw and Nissinger .
Right before our eyes we saw the bridge collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants  really.
The first camp that I was was on Oranie nbergerstrasse in the ru -- Russian sector.
We talked to him I mean  I didnt talk  becau se I didnt speak Russian.
Yeah sure we sit in the basement in the shelters and so when the bombs came and you know the rations and then you know we heard the Russian cannons from around Christmas 44 and they didnt march into Berlin until April 45.
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
So when they had to go and apply for a Russian exit [visa]  then he needed somebody to translate for them.
Interview with Fred Firnbacher September 16  2010 53 under Russian control.
And its very interesting that I escaped from Czechoslovakia act in 1968 and 69  after the Russian came in  I went from I escaped illegally  with two suitcases.
Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 51 He was at Harvard getting his  his doctorate in medieval Russian history and he was three quarters of the way through when we had the opportunity to join the Foreign Service and go to India  so we did for three years.
Bill Benson: Rae  we're going to turn to our audience  but is my memory correct that you -- you couldn't get over here because the -- the Polish quota for coming here was so -- so restrictive so you were able to end up getting on a Russian quota which allowed you to get here.
Ok  so this what happened and Lvov  when we were there a few days there came Russian and the German  they went back and they took the part of Poland and half of part of the city of Przemysl where we were living.
You know  somehow  Russian Jews had also gold rubles from the last time  they had hidden.
And then they would tie it with a rope  and there the guy responsible  supervisor a ma a Russian guy  would come and stamp these pieces.
Political every...in every army...in the army  the Russian army  every battalion  every thing has a...has an officer of the army always and they had a political officer.
The other thing also  which I can mention it  he told me that he also was drafted into the Polish army and he served in the Polish army as a soldier.
And right in the center was the u -- the Ukrainian church  which is the same  the provis -- they called it provis lauw -- the Russian Orthodox church used to be there.
>> Bill Benson: So when you were in the bunker and you realized that these were Russian soldiers and eventually you came out  do you know if there was a sense of it really is over for us now or because there was still obviously war going on around you  a fear that the Iron Guard or the Germans would  you know  counterattack and you would be right back in the same situation?
And another thing is that the Russians suggested to the -- those that came and stayed there to take Russian passports.
I mean  I was from Europe  I was Jewish  I spoke Yiddish  and that was it.
This man was one of this Russian Mafia or underworld or something.
On the Russian rule  under Communism  if you wanted to travel from here to New York  you have to have while you're -- why you're traveling  a permit.
As a partisan -- Bill Benson: She enlist ed in the Russian Army.
And again  at that time for me  to tell me I don't want to fight and all from a Russia n...I expect it from everybody else  you know  but from a Russian I...in my youthfulness  in my   I expected some compassion  something what I went through.
The Russian were b urning everything up for the Germans to freeze to death ; they couldn't fight.
So I flashed back like I saw a movie years ago like the Russian the boats over there.
They were closer to Bialystok Jewry  which was not Polish  but rather Russian.
speaks Russian] And now these Polish officers  in a Polish uniform  is talking to us.
I know that he was two years in the Russian front.
Dont ever buy him a bri -- a leather briefcase  because hell dump it.ﬂ Well  I took it back to class  we laughed ourselves silly  and then I told this Kristen Auwisher  I said  ﬁListen  you already told me what not to buy  now at least tell me what to buy  because I do have th e money available for ﬂ -- she says  ﬁWell  you notice he wears one of those metal watc hes  Russian style  the horrible looking wrist watches.ﬂ I said  ﬁGreat  I already have the idea.ﬂ So I went to Tiffanys and bought a beautiful gift  and here I have a pi cture.
So I found myself in the eastern part of Poland under Russian occupation and my dream then was only one dream...to go back to Warsaw  go back to my family to be with them.
On the train...I shaved on the in the railroad stations and I living and sleeping on the train  back and forth every day seeing her in the hospital  and uh then finally when she was released from the hospital I got another job on the railroad tracks with through somebody th at I met  and in August of 1944 we were liberated by the Russian army in a town...because already at that time as you know  Russia and Germany were in at war  so liberated by the Russian army  and then uh in 1946...in 1945 '45 we escaped from Poland into the German zo...into the American zone in Germany in a Russian ambulance.
Possibly not but I still considered myself basically German probably yeah.
We would sing Jewish  Polish-because this was my language at that... I was educated in Polish.
At the same time  there were trains of people like us coming from Russia.
And we heard that the next day theyre coming to kill us.
Like for instance  in my home we spoke Yiddish  but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish.
Having believed all this German propaganda about how when the Russians came in  they were so wonderful for the Jews  my father set out to the Russian headquarters to find out if it is possible to be transported back further behind the lines.
And it was very bad  and my mother  she start thinking  if we not starve really  to death  you know  in that camp  in that Uzbekistan   then she send two my youngest sister to Russian orphanage  because in orphanage they have more food than all this.
They were Russian women soldiers  who now were in the yard.
She gave  I asked her where she  she what her husband  and she told me her husband is on the Russian front  he's from German descent  and she showed me 2 ch ildren.
Well  Yiddish  we spoke  you know  we spoke with my family Yiddish.
There was a place that had some du g  some big trenches for oil storage  the Russian did that.
So I think that the - the liquidation of the g-ghetto in Wilna was by a Ukrainian SS divisi on  made by Ukrainians  because I remember standing with Rachel in line already  heari ng them talking Russian.
One side -- east -- was Russian  and west was German.
This was -- in that park some trenches had b een dug  presumably the -- the Russian and Latvian defenders expected to fight s -- s -- s -- block by block  so to speak.
Tell us what that time was like for you and your community and your family when you were under Russian occupation.
Only the western front  the eastern front  you know  Russia and the Allies and so on.
Next day they took twenty thousand...the the the headquarters from the army made a big...see Russian like propaganda.
And there was a cerkiew  there was the Russian Orthodox church.
So now its December 43  and you said that Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 75 43  and then we we went and with the Russian army in Krasny Baraki .
And some of it we -- were also concerns because the Russian didnt like it  you know  we had to be careful about that.
There were talks about deportations to Siberia  and that was a different risk  but I know that we did not take the Russian passports because we thought that was like abdicating altogether.
Well  my pa -- my father was a German  in that sense  because he -- he spoke German beautifully.
Well  the first encounter with the Russian s came on October 39  when under the MolotovRibbentrop Pact  they demanded military bases from the Latvian government  including a large base in my hometown  which had been the principle naval port of the Tsarist empire.
And the close I got to the academia  I got very restless with the faculty life and the -- some of the backbiting that I came across  you know  in this  you know  so -- so -- so in a kind of an historical interesting thing too  is that when I got my fellowship for Columbia University  the dire ctor of the Russian Institute was no one bu-but Zbigniew Brzezinski.
Anyhow  when we came to that villa and -- and we stayed overnight and lo and behold  next morni ng or next day  the Russians -- Russian soldiers arrived.
I -- another one -- when -- in the new company  a Ukrainian  who worked in the bookkeeping department  turned to anothe r white Russian  and he said to him  ﬁYou know what?
We took off their uniforms  there were waiting seven Russian soldiers.
>> Bill Benson: At some point  you were told or got word about your father.
And if anything untoward happened and they didn't want us to hear  like a cousin of mine died  my father came home  and they talked in Russian.
As an intelligence officer  the Russians were in had had Vienna at the time and that part of Austria and they wouldnt let us go into the Russian zone.
The job was to dig giant trenches  holes for Russian tanks to fall in.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 6 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ing at--at--at the Russian soldiers in the back.
They were mostly p -- Polish Russian -- mostly eastern Europe.
But one day I got into this headquarters  a Russian headquarters.
Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 21 Did so your mother spoke Russian.
Because he was a Polish citizen  you might say  in Poland became a communist country so they allowed all the Polish citizen to go back to Poland.
And the Russians  of course  they had a big front  what 3 000 miles of front line and they were demanding that the a-allies  meaning British and Americans open the -- a new front  to take some of the load from the Russian front.
And there were a group of Russian partisans  under the name Shapiga  and then Wandervaselevky's group  and th e I  People's Army Group.
And all of a sudden  full of people  was most Russian.
Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 53 were surrounded by the Russian.
And all kinds of noises  and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured  you know  in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders.
tape break] Okay  so it was this one young Russian soldier who was helping to pack up Right.
He didn't want to go to fight so he took work there an d we saw one time came {443} and there was a big place where they sold the horses and they came to the factory and they allowe d them to work  elderly women  Russian  so he talked with some Russian .
And he was liberated by the Russian Army  the 1 st Ukrainian Front in April of 1945.
They introduced  for example  Russian language and Russian Communist history in all schools and universities.
After we were liberated and uh as I mentioned before I had uh run away from the camp when the uh first Russian soldiers arrived and they had nothing on them but uh they were asking us for cigarettes or asking from us where's the uh supplies  and uh we had managed to find some sugar uh that was not burned and we showed them where the uh there was  where the sugar was.
You being Russian  how come you speak such a good German?\
And when the Russian came into that building  we still stayed for quite awhile because there was war...that was a siege of Budapest.
Making a long story short  I found out that two Russian planes came in  seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the area.
And that was happen always  even the Russian army had [indecipherable] I have to fight.
In Russia in those areas  they make they call it lapti 13 in Russian.
Uh you must understand that we were already occupied by the Russian forces.
They took us to a si -- a station  Russian station commandantura  sort of  and they had so many people they were get -- catching on streets  people  Germans  that they opened that -- I remember a large wrought iron gates.
We were going in the same direction as the Russian army.
Trains are traveling east and west  Russian armies were uh traveling  they were uh  uh taking all kinds of machinery from Germany towards Russia.
But he was Polish  he spoke Polish  he identified with the Polish state.
It was near the Russian border which before the war was there.
There was a lot of fighting at that point between Pols and Ukrainians.
Other -- you mean other prisoners were beating them up  or the Russian Army?
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
So we were -- we want-- wanted in the beginning to go with Russian  but they said they won't take us civil people.
There's some Russian soldiers  the Chinese I guess from  they called them in those years  I remember  Ta-tongs   I don't know how you call them now.
There was not much talking with them  because my very few people spo-spoke Russian  and there was not much talking with them.
I sa id  well you don't speak Russian  I said I don't 3 speak Russian  at this point I didn't  I spoke Lithuanian  and I spoke Yiddish  but I didn't speak Russian yet.
If they were Zionists they sent them to Siberia  if they were rich they took away everything.
Was your Russian at that point did you speak much when you were still in Lithuania?
Our family spoke Yiddish -- spoke Yiddish amongs -- yeah my father and mother and they spoke to the kids also in Yiddish.
And I spoke Russian until the age of four or four and a half when we moved to Krakow .
But another thing  the ra the the Red Cross  right  used to give packages for the inmates  was Russian   Polish  Lithuanian  Romanian inmates  you know.
So one fine day when a boy from  a Russian boy  a Polish  Russian Polish boy a nd his parents Interview with Marianne Roberts 15 April 11  2012 had been killed by the Nazis.
To Vienna I couldn't go also Russian a nd without working to be  then I started to work.
So they start to talk to us  \ we are Russian  you're going to be free now  the war has ended  you come out.
The Russian armies eventually when word got to them  some of the escapees went behind the lines and told the story what happened to them.
Fortunately for us  Stalin and the Russian Army -- and the Red Army  came in from the east  went towards the west and they divided Poland and that tim e. Hitler and Stalin  they divided Poland and fortunate for us  my town  Lida  was in the Russian territory  in the Russian area.
First of all  they know already because before they coming to us  they pass already Auschwitz and Buna there  and the whole way that they make from the Russian country ‚til us.
The north ern part belonged to the Germans and the eastern part was Russian.
I was reading French  Russian before then  communism  and [indecipherable] So who did you read in Russian?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 35 Oh  okay  I left le -- I went from Liege to Brussels  war torn -- first of all  I had trouble getting a passport  because Czech -- where I was born became Russia  and we were told we could remain Czech or become Russian  and we found out my father could not remain Czech because he had not served in the armed forces.
He was married to a Jewish girl  Russian Jewish girl  and we were very close.
And I also look like -- like a -- like a Russian boy.
Came in  the Russian officer saw my brother -in-law in civilian clothing.
Because when they stole something  I dont think the Russian would carry  because although  who knows?
But we have a society where she could speak Polish  where she could speak German.
I remember and they  we didnt speak Russian and they didnt speak Polish and they didnt speak Yiddish.
Here appeared  you know  a...and I came [to] a special Russian epidemiological hosp ital  to take care of all the inmates of 24 concentration camps all around.
There were Poles  Ukrainians as well as Latvians  Lithuanians and Estonians.
Russian revolution began  the my mo my grandmother insist that she come home  and she did.
No  there was Polish  French and Yiddish and I spoke Yiddish.
And we saw our  saw them our papers  that we escaped from the camp and that we go -- want to go home.
He was the mayor of the city and he's a Russian soldier.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 36 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: C: And 47 marker 9.
a Russian prisoner of war  he was in this camp too  he escaped.
And they would rather be under Hitler  a -- a --a German Nazi  then under a Russian Bolshevists.
So  to to compare if a young Russian tried something  yes  it is very bad  sure  sure.
And Russian army asked Polis h underground start figh ting with German in 1944  and after we start fighting the Russians never helped us and never asked again start fighting with Germans.
Then  I started in Switzerland  and I had a hard time because I was having to study in French and I had studied English and German before and Russian but very little French.
Let me say this  by the Czechs it wasnt so visible  but as soon as the Hungarians came in  the children were no longer children.
One June the 22 nd  early in the morning about 4 oclock in the morning  being that I was on the border and working on the railroad at that particular town  in the morning I saw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplane s. That was the start of the war.
And at that time Czechoslovakia  on the 118 Russian request  have supported Israel with selling arms  training pilots  and letting every Jew go who wanted to join the Israeli army  th e Hagana.
The German came there in the middle of the night  with trucks  told all those Jews to walk out  put them on the trucks and took them to a prison called Lukishke and al so took them to a place  a big forest called Ponare  it was a place wher e those Jews was lined up and shot discriminately  first they had to make their own grave  and they were falling in those graves.
Then I started to get in contact with the Red Cross.
And my father lived in a place called in Russian obszy zycie  its communal life   communal life like a community in barracks.
So it would have been that they were wearing old Russian  Soviet uniforms during this time?
However  I had one brother  he was on the Russian front the longest  and he doing all of this stuff  the minefields and all  he was there a long time.
Wed see a lot of trucks  tanks  but we didnt know who they belong ed to  whether they Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 61were Germans  or Russian  or American  we didnt know who they were.
His name was and I I remember the name because it was in Hebrew  it was the name of   White Russian uh shirt  navy blue pants with shiny boots and he used to .
And when she came to some organization  there were Russian who working in this organization  not Jewish  Russian.
I went to then I also bought I left the company after I was president and bought an interest in another company  and I s-started another company with a couple of immigrants  Russian immigrants  which they still work still running here in in I in Des Moines  now owned by a large syndicate  and has about 300 employees.
When the Russian army were near th near the over there.
Some Russian soldiers brought her  and he ge t reunited after the war with my wife.
What do you recall of what happened when the Germans came in and being forced into the ghetto?
They spoke four languages fluently Polish  and German  and Russian  because Father was educated in German schools  Mother was e ducated in Russian schools  and Yiddish  of course  they spoke fluently.
>> Michel Margosis: Well  because of my father's training -- he had this teacher back in Russian  a famous poet.
You can take a name  like Russian name  like Vera  and tell that you are Vera  you dont have passport.
And the Russian people were the first ones to get the honor to be declared a free country.
I had six Russian soldiers  seven because we can only get seven waiting on the side...I knew approximately the size of the officers because they came to visit very often  and they send me seven of them...I got them so drunk they couldn't move.
I said to him -- you know  when it -- I remember this time when it was little bit idea that we had to bring American experience to the Russian.
Some ran away  and some did not have to go because if the Russian what  major or whatever he was did not want to take the partisans because they were not fighters  you know what I'm talking  not army people.
And the Slovak partisans  especially the Russian -supported ones  100% sure  I assume that here they are behind the mountains ; what's the big deal?
They needed  you know -- most of the Russian men were on the front  I guess ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 fighting.
But somehow we were fortunate again in the respect that it was a Jewish major in the Russian army and his name was Auslaender and one day they called us to interrogate us and we told him that we went through concentration camp and what they are accusing us  we have we have hundreds and hundreds of witnesses who were with us to dispel any doubts and all we're interested is to go to Israel  on to Palestine.
And we looked out through the window and there they were the tshubarikis 2 the Russian soldiers  and we couldn't believe our eyes.
We went like maybe 20 - 30 people  we were sitting in one end of the [indecipherable] and Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 56they sit on the other side  the the the Russian  the Zhorkinses .
Oh  you are going to be drafted soon  because you see that was the end of the war and they took a lot of those criminals from the concentration camp  they sent them to the East  to the Russian front.
Because two big colossus from German sixteen million and from Russian eight een million we have absolutely no chance.
It was not too far from Alexanderplatz in the Russian sector.
We recognized it immediately and all this   but just to give you one example  most of us  we had to go to Russian instruction every day  most of us either didn't show up or if we did  we didn't listen  we didn't learn anything  and after goi ng through college  at the end you had to take a state exam.
I I I call them in Russian so they know that that they are friends  you know.
The war started in 1941  22 nd June  the Germans began to surround our Leningrad.
A green tank  I quite frankly didn't know and didn't care at that time whether it was a German or a Russian or American tank.
So I decided because I could speak Russian  in the Cold War that would be very helpful.
So the schools that you attended  were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?
And so and she herself was given a post in the county seat where she was working because she knew Russian.
So we learned why we were with England fighting  why we were basically the free French  the Chinese [indecipherable] and the Russian.
Thousands...thousands of Russian people were waiting for their sons to come home from the war and meanwhile they were laying in that ditch.
Because we resented you see  we considered Russia inhuman land  because its the minu te you cross I am not talking about the Russian people  but the land is inhuman.
They call it in Russian kipiatok  kipiatok its like boiling wate r. And we get the hot water and whoever had a piece of bread put it in that water so we have something warm to -- to have for the stomach  you know?
So we met a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian.
Because men were very afraid of being conscripted into the Russian army  which was 20 years  they couldn't get out.
We supposedly don't understand Russian because otherwise would have been a bad deal.
So I remember when I was laying  some Russian got to me and stole my shoe s...he stole my...everything.
Well my mother's maiden name is Butremovitch and the Russian were repatriating the Poles back to their  to Poland.
We had Russian soldiers stopping in the house  we made a prayer  we took one  we were pray ing there.
Something is missing in going from tape 1 to tape 2) Were in Zagorsk and we built that–; it was called in Russian  in Russian.
Luckily we found a woman th at was a Hungarian doctor  and I dont where  bu t she found a Red Cross b and and those six girl and her  we kind of stuck toget her and we went over  ther e was a factory  the place where we were liberated is ca lled Krumall  th is is in east Russia; and it was a milk factory  and they took us in...we went to this milk factory  ac tually we crawled because we were so exhausted and what we saw there  I dont want to see it anymore in my life because hungry people were drinking the creme and the milk and vomiting and just lying down and being so sick that they couldnt even lift a finger  and there were a lot of dead people that were lying ther e. And we stayed there through the night and in the morn ing she somehow found a horse and buggy and she heard that there was a Russian field hospital  they will take the survivors in  so we were decided to go there.
We later on found out from someone in the government in Switzerland that this whole transport of Russians  was killed in Austria by the Russian military  including the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 37 infants  and we had infants.
We were liberated in uh in 1945 uh in the Spring by the Russian Army; and I remember that uh with this army of Russians also a lot of Romanian troops came.
But I know my grand on my on my fathers side  my grandparents came from Poland Im just [indecipherable] my mothers family came from France   and my in -laws came from Poland .
where we fortificate on our fortification and German army start in fight Poland and our unit go back to east to Russian Soviet border and this was seventeen days like this and meantime the Soviet throw from th e plane information all units stop fighting with the Russians and Germans and go.
The big heavy commode  you know  was moved and Ukrainians and Lithuanians and Germans came running and the Ukrainians were yelling in Russian  ﬁGive me your watch  jussy  jussy.
We were taken out and th e Russian army came close.
Local Jews Jew  with a red band just [indecipherable] that he was a one of the commissars that became communist commissar  led three or four  I dont remember now  Russian soldiers with the rifles with bayonets.
And then when they -- it was when the front came near to th e ghetto  the Russian stopped  they didnt want to move in.
My uncle who returned from the Russian Army  he was the only one that survived due to the fact that he was threaten to the Russian Ar my  was the physician for that whole ar ea.
That's mean that the Russian soldiers take a couple persons  a couple men  soldiers and send them to the soldiers  to German to...to catch...to catch a couple German people.
My mothers family were Lithuanian and Russian but she herself was born in Poland.
I have Russian officers who say  \ I am going for...for vacation.\
Well  my fa -- mother family came from Poland   and they were all born in -- i-in Poland   and they came in -- in -- in Belgium.
And uh  they told us to take a few warm things  put all the valuables and jewelry on the table  and as we were getting ready  my mother in those days being uh aware of the Germans and  and  and trying to be ready just in case  had her jewelry in the tiny little sack  and she told me  \ Take this and thro w it in the toilet and flush the water  and I did it.\
Interview with Ezra Sherman May 16  2014 8 He spoke Russian  he spoke Ukrainian  he spoke Polish  Jewish.
The Russians offered passports to all the people who had fled from western Poland into eastern Poland  they could become Russian citizens.
He actually got mad at a Russian that was in the Pogrom.
No  but I met another German  another German  who was smuggling people from east Germany  from the Russian sector  to the west Germany.
Subsequently there was a Polish -Russian war that started in 1920 and lasted until 1921.
3 Not much  we -- we didnt know whats -- wh ats gonna happen  and we just be -- a lot of people were running to -- running away with the -- with the Russian back  and we didnt.
He knew the Russian too because he was in Russia 3 years  4 years.
And we were close  the Russian border was about 50 miles from us.
There were some  but most of them were like -- like -- people like my -- from Russian Jews  and je -- Polish Jews from Russia who survived the war.
You know  and they were mostly uh uh Polish people and they didn't know I was Jewish.
Who was paying when you went to the private school and then to the Russian school  who was paying for your education?
So  after after we got in  a Russian soldier came and naw opened the door  and and told Babcia to to give what she had.
Every time that the Russian took a nother another city  where they took over back  it come a new new new details of all these things.
That same night we heard shots and commotion and we run to the window and we saw the Russian soldiers running with mattres ses under their arm and we knew something is brewing  and that's how the Russians went out  because the Germans came in.
So this was the only school  and it became -- it was no longer 39segregated and they admitted boys  so we ha d boy and girl -- boys and girls  but it was taught in Polish  except that we had two hours of Russian every day.
And is there anything else that...any partic ular stories that you remember from your time in the Russian that you want to talk about?
It's hard for me to explain what..uh...they lose  Germans they lose in the war  and Russian army come...uh...come back to Ukraine.
The war was -- the Russian came already in '44 till the Weichsel -- there was six months no fi-- no fighting in this side.
The Russian  if he would find  would be liberated by the Russian and in his conditionŠ he weighed 65 pounds at 21 years oldŠthey would give him a shot of whiskey  of vodka  and kill him maybe.
They gave me a a rifle  the automatic Russian automatic rifle  ammunition  and a a how do you call it  armband.
That Russian school was at that time occupied by Russian Jews.
And she was very good with the languages  so she speak fluently  she take German in the high school.
Soon that guy comes in and from us there was people from Czechoslovakia   there Jewish people from there  and they speak the language  the Russian language.
So thats the reason also that -- that they pushed it more and many Russian militaire came to camp and he wants to run away the first da y what he saw what is going on and that helped all -- of course  too.
A Russian Jew and a German Jew  we're so far apart because the German Jews were...were very prejudice  solid  integrated people.
How did you feel talking to the Germans  in terrogating them?
Papers to stay there  in in the Russian zone you just dont come in and and and live there.
The main trial  of course  was held in four different languages: German  Fr ench  Russian and English.
The Russian were the most organized and the most military trained.
She was a very nice person  but my mom say  ﬁIm not going to stay in Ukraine.ﬂ I -- she say  ﬁWhy Perlina?ﬂ Perlina -- she was Perla in Yiddish  but in Russian they call her Perlina.
Once the Russian s came  you were  at the time y ou were free to do whatever you wanted?
You see the house the Germans took away and then the Russian people moved in.
It was a Russian...two Russian soldiers and a....I believe he was British because I couldn't understand what he was saying.
31 I had duties  I had to come to my own hus band and give him the reports the whole night  I mean eight hours -- six hours  I dont remember al ready  that you had to stay on -- on parole -- not parole  what do you call this with your rifle in your hands and -- and watch the headquarters  or watch whoever comes on -- on the base  or whoe -- what -- and in the morning I used to say  commander allo-allow me to tell you and get a report to you that this one and this one came this hour at night with -- with the -- with food  this one went out from the base  a Russian came into the base.
At one moment  a  one of the villagers lifted his  an ax  trying to chop off our heads  when a Russian tank rolled by and noticed that and shot the man on the spot.
Maybe a lot of Germans  well they didnt like to do it either  but they had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner  you know?
Some refugees [indecipherable] they run away from the Germans  and some of them they run away from the Russian.

So there -- what Im hearing is there wasnt so much cooperation between different partisan groups  or -- Oh  between -- between the Russian partisan groups was good cooperation  we never had cooperations with -- with Polish partisan.
And I was a little star tled be this because I mean home movies are home movies but this is watching his trip with Hitler to the Russian front.
So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was rather minimal.
And there was a lot of prisoner  Russian prisoners who were -- came home from the -- from the Germany.
He...when the Russians came ...first time I saw a Russian soldier in the other house   I was looking out in the...on the window and I said this is Russian.

And a lot of Russian  Ukrainian and White Russian people  falsify a doc -- their documents as if they were Polish citizens  a nd also came in here.
The minute he came in -- mind you  I spoke Russian but I didn't know the alphabet.
The Russian language came after a little while  it wasn't difficult  and they did not single out one particular group of people  but I guess they did  only I didn't realize it  they singled out the people who were materialistically rich.
He turned around and he says to my father \ Here  Mr. Gitelman \  he said in Russian  \ They killed your family.
There were some Russian groups  partisans or es capees from the POWs  but   but that was not the main thing.
And my and the my my mother supposed to translate them to Belarusian  and she somehow she knew Russian  and you know So she managed.
But the minute there was only one Russian soldier on that side of the train  he would grab the kettle  run and bring me water.
Sarka had this Russian lieutenant  or I dont know what his rank was  she was very happy  and the three of them with the two Polish boys were still in that house.
Because all this time  from 1941 when German attacked Russia  the directions were from west to east.
When we came into Poland  our language at home was Yiddish but we also spoke Romanian.
He organized this way  so on the night of May the 7th  to 9  to 9  to May the 8th  we disarmed 12 o clock at night all the soldiers  and we put them in the cellar  and we kept them till the Russians came in on the 11th of May  we were protecting the camp ourselves  we put our own people on the towers  and we kept the guard the inmate  and we closed the camp because we were surrounded with over 100 000 German sold-soldiers around because they were be tween the American  French and English troops on the West Side  and the Russian troop on the East side  and we were just in the center of the whole mess  and we put a big sign  \ Typhus inside \  so nobody could enter because the Germans were afraid that the typhus could be spread  and we put -----------because nobody---  and they lib--we were liberated by ourselves  but officially on May 11  the first Russian soldiers entered the camp.
We stopped places  they gave us food sometime  there were Russian people who were a on little stations looking and talking to us.
But that that was normal  and i-if in in Russia there is a saying that [speaks Russian] Mm-hm.
1940...yeah...about that  and we got on a on a...they put us...we got a lot of stuff together and we went to the uh the station on the train and were going deep into Ukraine  but it took us like uh three weeks till we got past the Russian border  from Stanislawow to the Russian border  and there we stayed for about another week on the on the   how you say it...on the train  on the...and a lot of people who were running away from the Germans  the Russian people with with their children  and uh  you know  the the Polish people...Jewish.
She knew there were Russian prisoners of war that managed to escape the Germans who mistreated them badly and formed themselves into a resistance to slow the progress of the Nazis to the front lines.
05:12:46 First of all  at the beginning  in the camp  a  a young girl was so excited  and we knew that the Russians are coming  the Russians are coming  and she run  and wanted to greet a Russian soldier in a tank  and she got killed.
Be caus e she has not  she is only one and she has mother who is Russian you know orthodox.
You put galoshes  you know  put the felt boots in the...it was alright.
For them it was only a Ukraine or a white Russian  you see.
So -- and my grandfather  he said  ﬁWell  Im working with Jew -- with Russian  with Ukrainian  I not -- Im not goi ng to keep separate.
And then   must have been about four oclock  five oclock in the morning and all of a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier  Soviet soldier  came through first and then the whole body.
I'm...first of all  I want to say thank you the Russian government....uh  I'm sorry!...American government what they take us to America  and I want to say thank you ...uh...American people; they begin to teach me  my 5 Brynski held the military rank of Colonel.
World War II began in September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland from the west followed quickly by the Soviets attacking Poland from the east.
Sort of a young  rather innocuous looking man who sort of rent the apartment  and was just w-wearing civilian clothes and then one day instead of opening the door with his key  about a month or two later he rang the doorbell  and my mother opened the door and sh e saw this large man in a Russian majors uniform and at first she didnt recognize him  she was scared.
So then I went to Stutt hof  it was -- it was horrible  it was -- we went - we were placed in a block  meaning a -- such a shtuba  a house  a wooden house where criminals were in -- the bosses of the -- of -- of the houses  like a Russian criminal was a -- a woman was -- she was the boss of our house  yeah.
Before the Russian occupation  you mentioned in the first interview that you had been attending school and that you had dreams of becoming a professional and -- tell me a little bit more about your -- your educational experi ence and your hopes before the war began.
I came in at the ninth with an examination because on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into school and it started a new life  sort of  in a way feeling of joy  even though everything was left behind and all of a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat.
The 16th of January 1945 we were liberated through the Russian troops.
He put like wood across and he took one by one on the other side to the Russian side.
We walked out and I saw a Russian officer going through  and -- and I knew Russian  so I told him  look  you liberated us  but we dont have where to stay.
So one was a train that actually did arrive at Theresienstadt  and the second train was captur ed by the Russian Army  and this was the third train that had come from BergenBelsen.
So she claimed she was Russian  made her Gentile childr en were half Jews.
We were heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a place called Weida  Germany  which was in the Russian section.
Whatever they saw they grabbed it and they used to send away to Russia.
And then finally he got a job in Kovo -- th-that was in -- in a job which had to do with -- th-the -- the -- it has to -- had to do with other p-places  you know  you had to go to Bulgaria or whatever  you know  in -- in the -- in the area of the Russian things  he had to travel there  too.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
This is my father in a uniform of a Russian -- of Russian students.
He got back  and he told us that there were Russian str eets -- I mean Russian soldiers in the streets  drinking and dancing and carrying on.
He says to me... Uh  he [ NB: the Amshuler Rebbe] didn't speak any Russian.
It was a Jew  Russian  Jew  Russian  and this when was the liberation.
And so [indecipherable] we lose dead people  three million Jewish  and three million Polish citizen.
And we were dir were directed because Russian ha occupied the territory  and they told us that there is a communist government there  and we should go to the office.
But they are  one girl lost her -- both of her legs are dead  frozen in Russian and she is a cripple  one of them.
So there was some kind of shower someplace in the building in this in this Russian kitchen  so to say for me to take a shower there.
We were very close to the Romanian and Russian border  was like 30 kilometers or something to the Romanian border  or 35  just nothing.
01:06:26 Well  because I was a Hungarian citizen and the Hungarians were still fighting on the side of the Nazis  uh the Russians were rounding up Hungarians to take them away uh and so one day a Russian soldier came to our house and uh said that I was going to go with him  and my grandmother uh who was a Romanian citizen and was not involved in this so they didn't uh ask any questions of her...uh said \ Well  you're not taking him away\  and he said \ Well  we are  so you better give him a winter coat because he's going far away where it's going to be cold.\
So but they only had enough children for a first grade and for a third grade  so I was in the first grade  and we started learning Russian.
You see trucks with Russian soldiers going through and kind of fleeing --?
They have blacksmiths  you know  for the horses  and they have -- you name it  they a -- they -- they used to make -- they had - they had -- they established a factory th ere where they used to make leather from the hides from the -- from the cows  so -- and those Russian -- the top  you know  leaders and some  in order to -- used to come in  and they wanted a pair of boots  they wanted -- they wanted clo -- know  make a sheepskin  you know  clothing and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 77all that.
And Itka came from a a Russian group  so she learned there.
And at that time my gran dfather had a cousin who was one of the one who was kidnapped on the street  and was a Russian soldier for 25 years  enlisted.
We walked this way and the Russian soldiers came that way.
It was cold in the Russian Gora Shchyoki no  the city of Shchyokino  and Tulskaya Obles  Tula like -- like Washington [indecipherab le] Maryland  yeah?
So I  that's when I learned how to speak Yiddish  too.
He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army  but thats the image I picture him  and hes told me heroic war stories and the like  and thats what comes to mind when I think of him.
My brother  who was older  he wanted to go to Russia.
And he was a very tall man  and very A Russian.
Now  I dont th -- I dont think that that was quite as di -- as long on my mothers side of the family  b ecause I understand that from their aspects  my mothers grandfather  m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when Poland was under Russian law  and rode across the border into Germany  into -- into Silesia.
So so that and that is not unusual  but but after she spoke Russian  she talk he didnt know  and he let her And he let her let her gaved whatever he brought She brought  yeah.
Well Then I went to school  to Polish school for two years.
My two aunts  one from Warsaw  one from Krakow  came to our area  to our house in 1939  when the war broke out because they were more afraid of the German occupation than the Russian occupation.
So the Russian wanted us to be in Poland because the Polish people were not communists.
And then we also after a while lived with my sisters fiance who were Jews from Russia.
Because as I stated it before in my recordings to say they were afraid to take them out to the big pits that the Russian making because of the fear of the partisans.
The other brother was taken down to the Russian border; and he was  uh  injured down there.
That was work  it was an army sort of  out of civilians that were not labor  that were not taken to the Russian army because we we re Polish citizens and they only took us from one camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed workers and all kind of different places  from one place to the other.
But the plane the train never got very far; because we were bombed by German planes and had to abandon the train in Poland not  not very far from the Russian border.
So I went to the commander; and I spoke by the time  you know  ve ry well Russian.
For some reason  that one day  they opened the  the border  and the Germans got rid of these people  and the Russian s accepted them.
These were plenty  which left from the Russian army  were drilling a hole  puttin -- put there -- screw in there the -- the handle from the hand grenade  open it  and through the ring  put this -- a wire through shmore -- in German how it is a -- so we were sitting hundred yards away  and we pulled it  it was blowing.
Why  you know  this one this was only one day Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 228 because next day my mother went to the ch the guy that was in charge of city was still so Russian officer.
So I thought maybe they send me to Russia  because my father came from Russia.
Cause wed seen all the low flying airplanes and stuff going  you know  to-towards th e Russian front over there  and wed heard a lot of rumors about it in camps  whats going on.
He worked with a Russian singer  studied with her  accompanied her.
And I made the passport in Russian  out to me  with ju st the undersigned  not the unders igned  the officer William Perl  Serial Number so-and-so  will pr oceed in US Military Favor  and the number of the jeep  which I never filled out  and the bor der date  I had to fill it out.
Ive also -- also one of the sponsors  and sh-she came one day and asked me -- asked me show the documents  the I.D. cards fr-from -- o-off a Jew from -- or a Czech Jew who e-escaped from Poland and Russian soldier.
The prominent people was going slowly out from from Budapest  not uh not remain as long the Russian will will make something.
Im sure I spoke Yiddish but when I started school I spoke Polish.
He told us that  you know  when ŠŠ how he did  the Russians were comi ng close to this  that only says  Do me a favor  when the Russian comes  don't run out  in cas e the Russians come into that village.
Of the uncles that were taken to the Russian Army  two of them fought and died on the front and the others survived  another three survived and came back to Drohobycz.
And i -- we -- we want in  and besides th-the Russian  you know  it -- they wanted to send my father and us I think to Siberia because they found out that we were bourgeois before the war  and this is  you know  terrible in -- under the Russian communist government.
Yes  true  th-the Russian with the bal with the [indecipherable] th-th-they decide decide what to do.
And she spoke to them in Russian  they spoke Russian and he ask her [indecipherable] and I remember he ask where are you from  why are you running  where is your husban d?
There was a bridge over there  and that divided between the Russian and the American zone.
On 17th  when Russian attacked  we were still in Poland  free part of Poland .
The fascist government build some camps in the Russian territory  in Bessarabia and other part of the Dniester  the river Dniester over there.
We landed in Semipalatinsk   where also Zbishu who was released from prison  because the amnesty was proclaimed for all  found himself there  and found a room with Russia Russian couple  and it was the so when we first arrived  Ill never forget  we went to see wh-where we were going to stand and again  quite a few Pole s living together  but it was in the city  Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 95and so on.
And to my shock and horror  he was killed in the Russian Finnish war just a few years after the Olympic games.
He didn't know what would befall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to return to the Ukraine.
But then on June 21  when the Germans invaded the Russian part -- Q. 1941?
With three languages  when we crossed the border on the Russian side  I had to learn Russian.
And he comes across a page of my diary in German on a stone on the heath of Luneburg  where the Pershing weapons on the left  on the west is the English and American  on the right is the Russian.
Fifty when we went we left the east zone  by nighttime we were fleeing East Germany   because by that time it under the Russian it gotten already bad.
And -- because  yeah -- trading  because the ruble  under the Russian  the ruble was already not for -- you know  change wasnt considered [indecipherable] at all.
Only one brother  who the Russian mobilized to their war  and then the -- oh  I -- I apologize -- and then they -- and the -- and then they were er -- I was trying to say something about it.
My younger brother's name wa s Sherman and we called him Cenia   was Russian.
One of the reasons the word rus  the population in our area was mostly Russian -speaking.
Then they had huge photos of 17 Stalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange points  at Lichtenfelds to see that everything was run properly  that they got on these trains.
She did learn some sp some Fren ch  and when she was in school  but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to speak Russian.
And from the Russian point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in  as a matter of fact  for approximately two months  it -- borders were opening  everybody who came  who could -- who took advantage  and cou -- and came  survived.
And here in Minsk  I -- we knew somebody  and the story was  when we were in Rakichenka  I learned fast to -- the language  to read and write Russian.
So the Russian suggested  you go south  and Sikorski   and and ish and Sikorski and the Russian not the Russian  En glish forces  suggested that you go southern part of Russia  and then get out into the Middle East under the British jurisdiction.
And I was stuck in Prujena   which was Russian  under Russian control.
That time this was 1940  I think  when the Russian made a Hitler make a pact with Stalin  they not gonna go to war any more  they go not gonna fight.
Then I administered the office in Salzburg  the one in Linz  which was the other side of the Russian zone  and the one in the French zone in Innsbruck  and then we had representatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to Vienna  which they couldnt do unless they had permits to go through the Russian zone  and that  nobody was keen to do at this time.
Nothing at all until we learned later on that they were being transported by foot to Tarnopol   which was like closer to the Russian border Ukrainian  but actually it was Russian border  and about 200 miles or so  and they were put on the trains there.
But he would never cease to speak his mind when the Russian delegation  th-the -- the -- and then east German delega tion came to the house  the talk was -- of course I kept my -- my mouth shut  h-he said  ﬁYou know  Im a -- Germany -- West Germany is only a colony of the American s.ﬂ And my husband  you know  shook his head and said  ﬁYeah  just like East Germany is a colony of the Soviets.ﬂ Yes  absolutely.
132 Yeah  in the beginning  but then there were no Russian uniforms more  so they have taken -- while sorting the stuff which they have taken away from the newcomers  the good stuff went to Germany  into the Reich  and the less -- th-th -- those which looked more cheap and -- and not so good  were then supplied the beglidinskammer  the clothing barrack  and were stored there  and distributed to other Jewish newcomers  while the non-Jewish newcomers received the striped clotheses.
So  I stayed in that town until when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland after they had that pact.
And but and then we had to learn a lot of poems  Russian poems  everything Russian.
And I slept in an armored car because there was still fighting going on  and as we drove into Berlin  you could see there were Russian soldiers  dead soldiers on one side  Germans on the other.
And she was younger  she spoke Ukrainian  she spoke USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 74 Polish.
Now if they come down  and they looking for Russian  they will find yo u. They will kill you right away.
From Polish Jews and Polacks  wherever they were  and they also joined the Russian army.
And then I helped even more  when the Russian immigrants came.
They came back because my parents  many people around spoke about them very highly  positively  and they wrote to the Russian government that they were not for Bourgeois who exploit othe r people.
They were speaking Yi-Yiddish  I never learned Yiddish  I learned a bit of Hebrew because of the Bar Mitzvah and the gift  but -- but nothing  nothing else  it was French  I wa -- you know.
The Jewish people in Poland had two languages: Polish and Yiddish.
P -- in Poland was 10 percent Jewish people  three percent was Evangelic and German  and couple percent was Gypsy  you know  couple percent was Ukrainian  and also was the Belarusian -- Belarus -- white Russian  you see?
You see the difference between Russian occupational zone and German was that they we re both death enemies of Poland.
And you know  I had no remorse on those women that used to I used to hear in the train station that they are going to kill the Russian  they are going to kni fe them to death or theyre gonna put boiling waters on them.
The two boys slept downstairs and one of the fi ve girls  her name was Sarka  she found herself a r -- a Russian officer.
They -- They -- They -- They emulated them and all that  but whatever they were doing political  I think it was all against Russia.
I don't mean Russia from like deep Russia but European Russian.
And don't say anything  because when you pass by the Russian territory  because ŠŠ you know  Germany was divided in four sections.
There were a lot of Russian immigrants and all kinds of stuff  all kinds of people that were on that ship.
A lot of talk about what had happened already to Jews in Germany and what was probably happening.
My father felt probably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist  not to be too worried  but still  and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now from the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients.
He took th e coffee  he put two -- two cards with our names and registered us  and we never put a foot in the Russian sector again.
If they find a Russian soldier killed  they burned the whole sa village and killed everybody.
One was from [indecipherable] army  one was in the Russian army.
We sang at special Jewish occasions and we sang carnedi-- Carnegie Hall and in the Russian tea room  and at the Worlds Fair  and all kinds of things.
Til in ‚45 when the Russian -- Russian moved further to Berlin  things like that [indecipherable]  so we -- we were freed already  although the war was not yet over completely.
Yes  it was independent Poland   but those those the territory the eastern territory was mainly inhabited by people of Russian descent  or Byelorussians   yes.
He was scared to death of any Russian and every Russian that entered the room  the interrogation room.
The Polacks was right away nah give me a Russian  you know  hes [indecipherable].
10 We -- we spoke at home Polish  and someti mes when my parents didnt want me to understand something  they -- they spoke Yiddish or German.
My dad was very -- first of all we -- the Russian didnt send them out.
I think he was Jewish  but Im not s -- not sure.
That they're going to take me to Russia on a plane and keep my father in the Russian partisans  in the Russian army.
And he found them -- and then were stayed in houses emptied by people who went when the Russian army retreated  they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the Russian army.
You know  the Russian  when they came in ‚39  they were taking the young 5 Aleksander Bielski 10 people to the army for work  whatever.
Then we went out with the Russian army for a while over there.
My father  mother spoke Polish but used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
And so he got a -- a very significant job with the Russian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and its surrounding.
Maybe they didnt hide Jews because -- but as Russian people  they were from -- from her village  from Skundaliena   they were very good people.
And about 20 some kilometers farther  there were a couple of Russian villages  which at time  we were given permission we were given the pass  that we could go to those villages and trade  barter for some of the clothes that we brought with us from Poland for some food.
They didnt know if this is partisan or the Russian army.
Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves  they were POWs  right  and they didnt have no weapons.
A big part were former prisoner of wars  Russian  who escaped from their camps  P.O.W. camps.
I said uh English  German  Russian  and I still didn't say Hebrew.
That's all I had was my Swedish paper and one I guess he was a Russian or a Rumanian and he started to talk to me and I smiled very nicely and couldn't answer.
Interview with Leonard Zawacki 5 And before when the  the we when the  the front came quite near and we knew that any time they Russians would be there  we separate the Russian prisoners who were with us  the partisans.
I know the German invited us when we were in Poland and some how they were even so I dont believe that they will do any harm to me  after all  I am a law-abiding person and I am professional.ﬂ So  we were standing there...as soon as the Russian left  in a few more hours  the maid of t he young doctor  there was a friend of my father came running up and said that the doctor told me to tell you there will be a program (you know what is a program) to night and since you are the most prominential in this town  you will be the first one.
First  '39  after a few weeks  we read a proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army 4 will come for order and safety of the city 'till the situation will be cleared and that we should cooperate.
Your father was he able That was til 1940 when the Russian war broke out.
Uh  so once we got into the Russian zone  then it was entirely different.
That the idea is good and just now again I will tell you about this Russian work I read yesterday before I go to bed.
And then later on he was further into Poland  towards Russia.
So I thought maybe they send me to Russia  because my father came from Russia.
You know  when the Russian came in  they call in the head from the family  to the office  and they ask questions my father.
And we talked quite a bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish  and that's why I was able to communicate.
Under the Russian occupation in 1939  did your father lose his farm?
Anyway  I  as a young boy I remember it even that onc e you are under Russian occupation  or something  its not easy to get away from this country.
And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the war is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life.
So they brought Russian and Polish interpreter  thinking that I was going to spill something.
And so I got the Germa...the Russian village  with the little babies to the old woman.
And no idea what was going to happen to us and the Encoverdare officer closes the door behind him and -- as were shaking  and turns to us and -- and -- and says in Russian  ﬁVeehad sheety zheets  yatazhoy.ﬂ ﬁYou want to live  I also do.ﬂ And so he became part of the smuggling ring after that and he got a cut.
And she spoke Russian very well  I -- I just had little Russian.
I don't mean it in a...I am not putting any...passing any judgment because when you are...when you are brought to this kind of a...when you are...when you are made...when you are so dehumanized  it's...it's very difficult to be human; but very few of us  for instance  would eat dead...you know  dead...would... would...would go in... and...and...and...and eat...uh...you know  some parts of dead people  but some of the other inmates  the Russian women particularly  but I think they...they really suffered from hunger more.
And the Russian  the actual the Ukrainian were yelling  \ Give us your...uh...give us your watches.
The only thing I remember he -- I even had epaulets on me so I could look like a Russian soldier.
I reme mber that Ninotchka -- her name was Ninotchka with blue eyes  blonde hair  Russian child  was beautiful  always playing  she was chubby.
Only this kind of people were  you know  were lucky if you knew somebody or the people who were directed to the Russian army and went on the front or went to the Russian uh  you know  uh uh  you know  working brigades.
Because th e Russian soldiers will arrive and here there are so many women  theyll come and ra pe us and thats what I did  most of us went away and the ones that rema ined  they did get raped by the Russian soldiers.
And a month later  on March 28 th  the Russian occupied the whole Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 39 October 8  2010 territory.
When Hitler came What happened to your f-father during the time of the Russian rule?
So they billeted a whole slew of Russian soldiers with us.
He was drafted in to the old Czarist Russian army in World War I. He was wounded at the battle of Tannenberg  the only battle the Russians really fought in World War I and was a prisoner of war in Austri a-Hungary for four years.
You know  I remember people were worrying about food supplies and sugar and so on  because they were afraid that the Russian soldiers were buying things up and shipping home.
She spoke very fluent Polish  and all that  like -- like a native  of c ourse.
You know Interview with Rose Kamin 15 August 12  2013 youre  in the history was  its a long history of Russian army.
He he he was born actually in the Russian part of Poland  but after Versailles   that became again  it was recu constituted as Poland   so he re he became a Polish citizen.
It was a mixed language: Jewis h  Ukrainian  Russian  not a pure language.
And we have to start to learn in Russian  because ther e was no Yiddish school any more.
There were other things on their age nda because the war was already in the 10s or 12s or 13 days  you know  and the army broke through the Russian row -- armies -- and advanced  and all the news were very happy.
During the Russian occupation  that he was hi ding  his wife was already sent to Siberia.
Some were sent out of Auschwitz to other camps in Germany.
And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever.
ﬂ By the time some Russian or someone occupier would end the war.
I said to him in Russian [speaks Russian] do you know he is Jewish and I am Jewish too?
There is no longer any oil there  o -- today  but he was a oil prospector  he was Russian.
But later on you know the story probably  later on [indecipherable] say that Tuvia made with him friends and so on  and they they were they took away the rifles  the Russian partisans from our boys  10 boys at one point.
We got even a little bit more than the Russian people.
And my uncle served in the army for in the Russian army.
A Russian soldier who was a little inebriated  happened to step off the path and got blown up.
There were seven sons and we had the family  a nd when their it broke out  they went there were a lot of bandits there  because there was no Polish police  there was no Russian police  and people started robbing.
You know  ye after the revolution in Russia  there were white Russian we who went to Poland  to China   to all over the world.
The emphasis in my life was that the language  the formal language became Russian instead of Polish.
The Russian guy tells me  well Elizabeth  dont you recognize me?
No  I would say the Russian soldiers helped me and actually kept me from getting down on the ground  because they knew if I would fall  I wou could be dead  because Id be trampled USHMM Archives RG-50.
First of all  the Russian classified everybody in many ways .
The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in  but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.
What ha say what if you know Lithuanian history  that part of Lithuania   Vilnius and all around there  at one point it was in Polish hands.
If you go touch it here  you would Do you know what its called in Russian?
And they saids to that -- no  there came a rus -- Russian man  a nd they said they will take us to Russia to -- to get well again.
But tha it was the Russian at the border  they belonged to them  but th-they were controlling the border.
My father was born in Ru ssia and he was a Russian citizen at one time.
And the people spoke German  and later they learned Russian from the Russian occupation  or beca the Russian got the got the territory.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 9 And can you tell me this  was Kolbuszowa in the last in the 19 th century  was it the part of Poland that belonge d to Austro-Hungary   or the part that belonged to the Russian empire  or the ger or the Prussians?
I had a Russian -- I had Russian coat which was embroidered with a Russian hat  you know  with the embroidery around and stuff and I said  \ Never am I going to wear this thing again.ﬂ \ You give it away to somebody in Germany.ﬂ I mean I -- I -- it was too embarrassing.
Because they had this tree they called in Russian  Kairda  but it -- it se -- they have seeds.
Monsieur Libare had been called to go to work to Germany  because they were losing on the Russian front at the time  and they called -- were talking Gentiles  Catholic where I was  to go to work the factories.
And that guy who came down  shouted at him  ﬁIf you don't admit the truth  that you volunteer t-to work for the Germans  you'll stay down here until you starve of -- of -- of hunger.ﬂ And -- and th-then he told me yeah  I mean he -- he -- by the way  he knew Russian also  that Czech guy.
I dont know how they did it  becaus e they spoke only Yiddish and maybe a bit of Russian and they had to travel  of course  by horse   and by cart until they got to the train and then from the train they should have crossed the sea by boat  and then to arrive  but they made it.
When I was a little girl I was dancing ballet and my teacher was Anna Pavlovich  a Russian woman.
Nu  in 1940...1944  they take the...the Russian army... army... uh... came back  nu  and the Germans...nu  how to explain?
Just about the same time  since the Russian s were advancing very quickly  a lot of people were afraid that the Russians would take my hometown  and they would be under the Russians again and by then the Germans were sufficiently i ndebted to the Latvians that they decided that Latvians could  in principle  seek refuge in Germany  but subject to political clearance  that they were reliable.
Not very well  but they did speak Yiddish and German and sometimes fall into Polish  but not very often.
Your quota is so far away and were sitting so close to Russian zone of occupation  why dont we go to Australia and thats it.
Im sure I spoke Yiddish but when I started school I spoke Polish.
There were also announcements in the radio two days later  where it said that it was in Lithuanian  in Russian  and in German  what said that but basically highlighting in Lithuanian.
I was tempted to run over to the Russian side  or the Russian -- o-or the la -- Jeshuf townoof  and to shorten my time of expectation  meantime I could have been killed.
But I had a brother  the second one who just missed my mother and missed the family and he did not want to stay on the Russian side until he reunites us.
In other words  in the Russian sector  it was very  very difficult to be around  because we were taught -- even the kids in school  we used to go on -- on these outings and we used to go to the theater with the class and so on.
Well  he arrives in those gulags and in Siberia wherever he was there  I dont know  and then he stands there and you register  register you and they ask him  ﬁWhats your name?ﬂ He says  ﬁManasha Galperin.ﬂ The man said to him  ﬁDo you have another name?ﬂ My brother said  ﬁNo  I dont have another name.ﬂ He says  ﬁIn Russian they call me Misha.ﬂ He says  ﬁDyadya Misha?ﬂ Hes  he figures what can he lose  he will say.
We knew...we want to know...again I must say a...quote a Russian saying.
One of the Russian came and took away our horse and gave us another horse and then on the way to the hospital we went to a empty house and we slept there.
It was a Soviet soldier  he was from Kaukas or somewhere  th-the Russians told me  he is from Kaukas  so he doesnt know a ny Russian.
So when we came to a place in whi in White Russia   when we met when we went out from the woods  we had a a garmonika playing music   we knew we we met we met in the Russian army soon.
In eastern Hungary near–it was very in teresting because it was fifty kilometers from Russian  fifty kilometers from C zechoslovakia  from Poland  from Romania -- everything is very close to this– Except Budapest.
We went through the border  through the former border between Lithuania and Soviet Union.
I did not know a word of Yiddish un til I came to this country and my mother made me learn Yiddish because it was th e only way she could correspond with me here.
He fought in both the eastern part  that is in the Russian sector  as well as the western front.
And wa -- I will just give you the title of one of the songs and thats ﬁPuppyrosen.ﬂ Puppyrosen in Russian means cigarettes.
No  no the school became a Russian school  a school with a Russian language of instruction.
But then I truthfully  I dont know what happened afterwards  you know  because he was called to he was called to Moscow   to meet with Molotov  for a certain for for certain reasons  and fortunately for me  I I was not able to see him when he came back  because I was not in the Russian army any more when when he came back.
No  we we try many things  we went is my mother  she went to the some kind of high officer  Russian officer in KGB  etcetera  but it didnt help.
They were...uh...within about...uh...a distance of about 15 kilometers or something like that and their name was ...uh...Greditz and...uh...Falbruck and...uh...one camp  they used as a Russian POW camp and I...I...I must say that...uh...the camp when we got in there was...was so...so dirty  feces all over and...uh...uh...from the Russians  you know  and...un...unbelievable.
And I wanted desperately to leave the Russian sector and be in the American sector.
We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I  immediately  and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia  and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia.
World War II began on September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland on the west followed quickly by the Soviet Union attacking Poland from the east.
And we have to leave the town because they cau they [indecipherable] was involved with one of the high ranking officer  the Russian.
And had you grown up speaking Yiddish  did you know Yiddish?
And those people who came there  the Russian military  not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating.
Then that summer  it petered out and I went back to sorting clothes and uh .. subsequently  I had gotten a little bit stronger and quite a bit leaner -- I had been a fat kid and I lost most of that -- so one of the guards noticed me and I was sent to a – I went on a fairly extended trip  cutting lumber in what was then Russia in a place called the Germans call it Pleskau  P-L-E-S K-A-U  the Russian name today is Pskov P-s-k-o-v.
I said to him  \ I'm Russian...\  So I never thought about that.
We got a little room  a long  little co -- like the same width  but longer  with one window  two beds with straw mattresses and a stove in the middle  like they call it [speaks Russian here]  the Russian stove that you burn on coal or wood  and no gas.
There was another little town called Tluste where we spent the Russian occupation.
I was walking on the Russian side  yeah  from from Wlodzimierz Wolynski to the Russian side  because I was afraid to go back in same city  and because al they they were so anti-Semitic that we had to run.
However it came in the Polish Army  which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army.
So  I didnt see very much of I do remember  before the Germans came of I was walking again with the well  we either my mother or my ma her mother  my grandmother would take me for walks  you know  in Vilnius  and before the Russians left  I saw Interview with Arvydas Kliore February 18  2013 13some right around Cathedral Square   there there there were a few trucks passed with loaded with people and with Russian soldiers with bayonets standing in the corners of the truck.
Then I have to attend to the gi -- gimnasium  in which I would be learned perfect one of these languages  Russian  or German.
So  what did I say  I said [speaks Russian] Ill stop.
It was -- it used to be POW camp for Russian POWs  and they already evacuated too.
I mean  we didn't even keep track of the Russian and Jewish so ldiers  except some of them were at the Bar Mitzvah.
Later on before this camp was liquidated  these two Russian prisoners were stoned to death by the other prisoners.
Well  I spoke Polish  and of course  my 8 parents spoke Yiddish.
He joined the Polish army later on  went to pol to join the Polish army from Siberia.
Suddenly a terribly drunk Russian soldier walked in and he started to say gold  gold   and I turned around and I said we don't have gold but my super was there and whatever he answered I don't know.
But it was definitely during the Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time.
In our apartment where my father  mother  and sister lived  we also had -- we also had my grandmother whose husband was killed by the Ukrainians  my grandfather who was a widower  you could see his picture here  Isaac Drimer and one of my father's sister's  Ryfka  with her two little children.
The only thing that was different  I looked at my neighbors prayer book  and it was in Russian.
because it was very  very  very strong bombardment  and we saw the Russian running.
My question is did your family say yes to Russian Citizenship or no?
We just said  ﬁWe ll make our way to Poland and from there  well worry about going to Starachowice.ﬂ But we met a Russian soldier who was Jewish on the train  and he told us  if were Jewish  not to go back  because its not safe in those small - he asked us how big a town it was  and we said  ﬁSmall town.ﬂ And he said  ﬁDont go back; go to a big city.ﬂ And we said  ﬁBig city?
I took off my...somebody pulled the cover off my head  and a Russian soldier with a Kalashnikov trained on me  \ Who are you?
And there were soldiers  Americans Russian soldiers  and to me they were great .
These together and one of the men who knew Russian  we explained.
So  we figured very fast way  cut wood in small pieces  and on the ends we put small Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 65pieces  then everything is empty inside  and we cover with the logs on top  and the Russian And theres the norm.
All of a sudden being Russia was Russia  they took us.
And now everybody with any brains  who didn't have any money  who didn't have any who wasn't doing well escaped over to the Russian side.
So  when they saw the tanks rolling  you know  Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 110 Russian  from to Papilys   or maybe it was the other direc no  no  from   they they came from.
And I noticed it wasn't special  to do case work with the Russian immigrants.
I personally am convinced that -- you remember in Warsaw we had a uprising against the Germans  and the Russian s stopped the advance  they let the Germans [indecipherable] the whole lot  and then they came in.
Yes  teacher because they didnt know Russian either  so you have new teachers.
Now  we were in the Russian sector  going into a building and unbeknownst to me  she was meeting we were there to meet with  I guess  representatives of the army  the U.S. Army to see if we could get papers  so that we could begin the process of becoming DPs  refugees  and eventually emigrating t-to the U.S. So she went from one zone to the other?
And was the feeling specially in end of '42 when we know  people know that the war will be lost b y Germany  there's anyway  the Russian or American will come and liberate and Germany will leave.
You look like Russian village woman  so no one cra -- can recognize you that you are Je w  and no one will ask you.
And eventually  I mean after bicycli ng for almost a month  and one incident was we were almost overtaken by Russian soldiers who -- who thought girls were a nice catch at that time  and the Russian officer saved us there.
And we had to go out some out to sit betwee n  because if the Russian come in well theyll ch when they check with the [indecipherable] they gonna get you.
I went there  the was had just been over  it was a long story  I  our lines had just joined with the Russian lines and it was very strictly forbid den to go into Russian territory because of dipl omatic possible complications and so  and I just took   went to the border  I had made so me passports for myself  which I ha ve here  with th is  this officer  Lieutenant William Perl is pro ceeding to so and so and all Russian authorities are requested to help him in the fulfillment of his miss ion  signed William R. Perl.
On the other side were wooded areas where the Russian guards were there.
And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a great extent.
They would take a lot of young people...very seldom Jews because Jews were already rounded up and and they were in camps  but there were a lot of Russian  Ukrainians and Polish young people and they forced them to go to Germany so they could work on their fields  because the German soldiers were not home.
So and most Russian Jews were able to claim that they were Polish  and maybe they were.
But till till thirty '39 when it was the pact  the Russian with the with the Germans  we didn't heard what was going on there.
So I looked at my MOS  my military expertise  and decided that already I was already an interpreter  why send him to Russian school?
And eventually Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 68we arrived in Moscow .
Uh-huh  okay  so she was it wasnt th e first time she saw Russian soldiers.
When he returned  he became a officer in the Russian army  and he traveled from to the and back again.
Marcel Drimer: Right and the generals -- the Russian generals would come and ask him to provide lumber for the front because the front was nearby.
We met a Russian  I mentioned before  we met a Russian in our to wn  he brought logs  wood to sell and we got acquainted with him  and he was a lieu tenant  and thats when it started.
You know  the [indecipherable] was a manifestation of these two armies  western ar mies  and the Russian armies having -- having come together  you know  there must have been millions of such encounters.
17 During the Russian o-occupation  di -- my fath er w-work in -- in -- in two places.
We tried to get through the to go to the Russian side  but it was impossible.
When there was something wrong  she spoke to me in Yiddish  not in Russian  you know?
Initially the Germans didn't come in  did they  first didn't you go under Russian?
Yeah  I think  well  that generally he knew lang uages  and so read various in various languages  in German  in Russian  in Polish.
And so my father visited both but he particularly visited the Polish and Russian temples because  to please relatives and possibly even my mother  because her family had  well she  her family died at a very young age actually so.
Anatoli Sherberkof is when I joined the r -- Russian group  and there were Russians  and again I had to mas querade as a -- as a -- as a Russian  so my name was Anatoli Sherberkof.
And first thing I recall that they requested  like  I think its because of the Russians  its sort of Russian money  but in rubles.
And the Russian  they let them out  so right away  soon it was this  you know.
This went on  then the Russian army came into Lodz  I remember the Cossacks when they 2 came in.
The Russians had a sort of agreement that they would let us through  but they liked to be paid on the border  so they always had prepared money and there was a Polish guy  then a Russian guy  then they kind of closed their eyes to us  but -- but you had to still pay your way through.
We went to Lakhva to a small town and I went to the Russian school there.
If English were being spoken  it would be translated into German  French and Russian  and if Russian were being spoken  it would be translated into the other three languages  and so on.
And there must have been -- there must have been so me people of non-Polish  or non-Russian ethnicity  who probably did not know what was going on  because th e -- the uprising was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 17 entirely in the hands of one Russian office r  and a group of Polis h -- other Polish Jews  and they didnt trust anybody else.
Then the Germans took over the factories the same that the Russian s had  and we start to work there again.
So that I I really dont know what the population of the town would be  but it had a beautiful Russian Orthodox church  there was a Catholic church  as I remember.
But once they took away and somebody told us  so they did the same thing to the Russian.
And we had to move away a 100 kilometers from the Russian border.
They wouldn't touch me because I still had the Russian uniform  you know  if you get as a uh black market you can do that.
They were greeting Russian soldiers marching into Nowogrodek   and they were the orang Russian army was pitiful.
And -- and the interesting part too  speaking I -- I made a -- allusions to German  my German language.
And th-there was th at movement of the Soviet partisans  esescaped prisoners of war  Russian prisoners of war escaped.
The brother was a -- a Russian officer in Russia  and was killed in ninet -- in -- in the first World War.
The heavy Russian fur coats  what the Russian peasants used to wear in winter.
She played the mandolin there  Russian music and worked in the camp that the Russians had sent.
And in order to get food you said you had this folder  this camp folder  the red the red side of Oh  oh  oh  that  yes  most people that were that have survived from a concentration camp  that were in a concentration camp  first in Berlin were given a little identification by the Russian soldiers  it was in German and Russian  indicating that we were discriminated against and have survived a concentration camp.
And his book had the -- probably the task to unite a nation  because I dont know if you know Lithuanian history  but Lithuania was -- 9 the history is quite painful  because you know that the Polish influence  the Russian influence  and -- and the Lithuanian speaker were mainly peasants.
So she got us smuggled out by Russian guard s in crates of china.
He says  ﬁYou know  you are here  wonderful  because were going to be here and were going to need girls to work for us.ﬂ So  he says  ﬁWell be here tomorrow and then you can go with us  well really make it -- and make it good -- I mean youll have -- you-youll have a better life.ﬂ After they left  the Russian women said  ﬁDont trust them.ﬂ And the women -- Polish women said they were raped  that the Ru ssians were raping women.
Acro ss the street from one of the streets in the ghetto  you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs  and they were begging for bread.
When the Russian came in  I was already in the other town.
But I managed to -- to -- my first room I rented  I was -- I rented in a Russian girl -- in a Russian lady.
Is that Oh yes  actually Russian history  Russian songs  Russian poets.
No  no  no  you asking about Russian  no  no  they had some part divided between Germany and government guber guber gubern-nament .
But after a few days you know it  water receded and the ice receded and then the Russian start to build a pontoon bridge.
Uh...My mother is the seventh of eight children  and a family where Russian...they spoke Russian at home  and...uh....a little Yiddish.
Later on I heard that some guys had hidden under the straw and they waited for the Russian and they didn't take the trip to Germany  to Buch enwald .
Did you go to a Jewish school  or just to a Polish school?
So that's when we saw a lot of Russian people there.
No  that time was the Russian occupied area  it wasnt any law like here  you know  you go give him notice.
Just the fact that we had a French school and German school  Polish  Russian  Hebrew and Yiddish schools  just to give an idea of the culture of the city.
And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h-hospital.
My landlady opened the door and said are you crazy bringing a Russian here?
But then we went to Russian Jews who was  my sister was engaged to their son.
I was much too small to understand that  but I do know that when I was 6 years old  I was supposed to go to school  and it was not possible to go to a public school because my citizenship was Russian.
What happened is that a week before the outbreak of the German Russian war  the Russians went to a number of homes in the middle of the night  sort of got the people out of bed  told them get dressed  pack your -- your bags  and come with us  get on the truck.
So he dela yed that call til -- delayed until finally after the raid  and these two fr -- fre -- couple friends  the Russian escapees talked them in and say  he got -- he gotta do something  in other words  so he left.
I was two days before in Krakow   but this was the official date when Krakow was occupied do -- by the Russian army.
And my father and mother  they could speak Russian  German  Ukrainian  Polish.
So we find out about three days before -- we were before Krakow  s -- and this was the front was going  we went with the front  and they -- did the Russian army went forwards  and the German went back.
And we got on the Russian quota and were able to come to the United States  November 17  19 -- November 14  1947.
In Germany  they started doing that  but not to the Russian soldiers when they came to Poland  they didn't do anything to us.
So  and it was ge tting to afternoon  Yaffa's father and my brother and three Russian people in a statio nwagon  they're coming in.

In the camp next to us  one of the camps next to us  were Russian prisoners of war.
And he says he came  explained that the -- we ll take care  and well set up well disperse -- hell take our people and put them in Russian groups  he says  according the Russian law or something -- the Soviet law  no Yiddish -- Jewi sh groups alone  I mean for itself is illegal otherwise.

And so with that in mind I felt that when they opened up the Russian section  you know  and they finally let some outsiders go into the Soviet Un ion in that area.
that flows into the Baltic Se a. So we attack in one  a Russian lieutenant officer killed only.

The farmers were forced to join the underground.

Like for instance  in my home we spoke Yiddish  but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish.
There was no reason  but something...I don't know...no wisdom  no no no shrewdness  no smartness told me not to go  but after then they...the Ukrainians killed them because they were again against the Russian.
By the Russian prisoners  you know  the ones that we re older  not the youngsters  you know.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
There were a lot of German police in the German army -- West German army.
03:47:04 We were liberated and we immediately most of the men were drafted into the army  to the Russian Army.
No  as a matter of fact  some eight or ni ne month and during the Russian Occupation.
So the very first soldier foreign soldiers that you see Its the Russian.
Then  what were going to do is move beyond this experience  into the time after the war when the Russians came  and found you  and inducted you into the Russian army  or the equivalent of it at that time.
And a like like seeing a Russian Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 101[indecipherable] you say give them  give it.

And the of course  the whole train was surrounded by Russian soldiers with rifles  so there was no way to get in or get on of the train.
Hard seats and outside was both sides soldier with a gun  and we were transported through Russian Europe.
In the meantime  in the summer  I was running with the girls  dancing  they had 60 music or they play and dance  you know the Russian folks dances  they -- they sing chastushki  chastushki means like the -- the couplets  like the words that -- the folk songs about girls and boys loving one another and this and singing.
We learne d a few word of Russian which I have long since forgotten  but it didn' t help us really.
And they began writing home letters describing what was happeni ng on the Russian front  describing what was happening in Albania  describing what was happening in Yugoslavia  Croatia  and all those places  and saying  ﬁI am Italian  I love my count ry  but I am ashamed of what some people are doing  collaborating with the Nazi.ﬂ And they were letting their family know  and of course not everything came true  and the censorship was very strict  but we have to remember that among the censorship there were also people who were Italian  and Italian being Italian  and member of the -- letter go through  so that we seems to be aware at that tim e -- not that I understood it  far from it.
But then  we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their so ldiers and so they  they got  they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in  in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people.
Of course  my father spoke German very well  and Mother spoke Russian by virtue of growing up in  under the Russian sphere of influence.
And she dried our clothes  and the next day she said to my mom -- my mothers name was Perele in Yiddish  but the Russian call her Perla.
However  it was -- in the Russian Army to see women  it was no novelty.
So I got to Regensburg  Germany  and there the Army  uh  applied for the Russian zone  to let me come  to let me go across to Slovakia on the train.

Uh  my mother came from the Polish side of the Bug River and and my father was on the Russian side and  uh  they were childhood friends and they immigrated to the United States at different times and met in New York and my father was in World War I and  uh  in the infantry which  uh  I was quite proud of as you'll find out later.
They exported the Jews and the minute they left the borders of Germany  they no longer were German citizens and they just joined the of the Jewish work.

Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9  2001 3Sherbakov  which is a real Russian name  so I became Anatoli Sherbakov .
And the other one was a -- an ethnic Russian from -- from Latvia.
And and then  of course  fin you know  the occupation  we were living in in under the Russian occupation for almost two years until the the Nazis began the war on on Russia   you know  so Did your mother ever tell you about what that was like?
And -- but at that time  which I was really  I wanted to do  I even took the tests  lets see in Russian  Hungarian and Czech and they -- I passed them and they wanted to send me to -- more for Russian  and I -- it sounded very tempting but they asked me -- they had -- I had to sign up for an extra year of service  which with hindsight I made a big mistake not taking it because the 16 extra year I would have been in school anyway  a whole year.
there was a Polish security and the Russian security and so on.
But then I decided its very risky  even to run to the Russian tine  so I will endure  and take my chances to legal -- to be liberated here  in Krakow  where I survived.
And the Russians were so near us  the Russian soldiers  that at night we could hear the music.
There were Russian prisoners  there were there were Pola ks   and there were some not non-Jewish people also.
The Russian army was getting close and the Germans were going to evacuate all of us out of Lithuania.
The Russian front  the expression to send you to the Russian front was like a sentence of death to a German soldier.
And my father was convoked to the army as the officer because he was ordered the school  and did then in the first year of...uh... the battle 2 between German...German and Russian soldiers  he was taken into Russian captivity already in 1915 and he was there  which he knew Russian of course  so his conditions of life were not so difficult there.
People who had children  who were already two or three years old  the Russian collected all children and took all children away.
It was very difficult for me to come back  I had no documents  only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number and with my name  that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army.
who was just a farmer  but he had a lot of experience because he served in this Russian Imperial army during the Ru ssian Japanese war  so he was in Manchuria in China as a soldier  yeah.
When I went with my wife..Anyhow after this whole episode we we nt through the fro nt and in the valley they were shooting and we were on to p of the mountain and went through the front and came out behind the front lines on the Russian side.
Took my belongings  went there and then officer  captain Russian captain came on a motor boat and I spoke to him whether he will take me across.
Actually my uncle  my father's brother  younger brother  died on the Russian front as a member of Slovak Army.
In Minsk we were marched  it was very cold  we were marched into an area which was at one time a Russian school.
Some of our people  even my aunt  she left forrun away because her sons were taken to the Russian Army.
Bur later on  of course  we didnt feel it so badly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this.
Was the first thing they told us to do  to go immediately and to clean  because it's more difficult to say  because the same time we saw the Russian uh troop  Russian army goes to the city day and night.
My husband was a soldier in the Polish division of the Russian Army.
There were some left  British  Russian prisoners  military men   all mil itary men.
Also  there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border  it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if yo u had false birth certificates.
They didnt Poland didnt didnt defend themselves  and the Russian was run just not no t they were not prepared either.
And we hear the Russians coming  and we understand them because the Russian and Polish are -- are Slavic languages  the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand.
And I was in in the school [indecipherable] Majewski and I finish up with the eighth grade and had to go to the ninth  and then broke out the war in 1939 and I had to go into ninth  and the Russian are here.
And then it -- I was in the -- in the house and the artillery -- the Russian artillery  shot aw-away the ha -- the roof.
Th ere was no schooling  there were -- the Poland went out  the Russian  it didnt come in.
I said  because the Polacks is sh har killing Jews and the Russian.
And when the biggest fight was going on where the legation was  we were in the cellar  certain part  a few of us  and suddenly a Russian comes in.
We were going to Israel in 1957  sh -- since you ask me for evidence that I am from Po land  its written everything in Polish  Russian and thats it.
Poland was divided actually into three segments  and this was Prussian  Russian  and Austro-Hungary.
Also was very sad as I was going to exchange  it was a ch -- Russian camp and the Germans would patrol  of course  tried to avoid them.
Uh my parents  right when I graduated Russian school  uh decided to send me and my brother to Shanghai.
Now I was picked out -- in this time they picked out a group f-fo -- of hundred young  mostly officers  and we were assigned to go with the Russian front.
On the way  we saw so many Russian soldiers and we were young girls so it was a very dangerous  dangerous way for us to travel.
Everything is in ruins and if is a car  it is occupied by the Russian or by American  so the only way you have is walk.
So  the Russian partisans were able to pull a lot of the local communities in?
Because were almost out of Russia  and then when we resume  well talk about how you left Russia specifically  and then what happened to your life after that.
We are little Polish  little Russian  we are two girls that are Jewish  the families were killed.
And we were holding hands all the night  until the Russian soldi -- until it was quiet.
And as I was staying  there were two  maybe four young boy soldiers in German in Russian uniform  you could see that they were Jewish.
I mean  there were some Yiddish words that had gone totally into the German language.
There was a russ a lot of Russian Jewish soldier  they deserted and they went to Palestine .
And suddenly it came out a few boys with the armbands and a few soldiers  Russian soldiers and to them  ﬁHands up!ﬂ And they fell down  and they were begging.
So  between her little bit of German that she had and my German  we were able to communicate.
Its completely different now  when the Russian Jews came over  and they were accepted as [indecipherable].
It was a it was also either Latvian or or German or something.
So therefore Im not surprised that we didnt receive the news from all the things which happened under the occupation in the Russian territory.
And he -- when he rested  my aunt -- my uncle  one that studied medicine in -- it was already Russian were there  so he was a doctor already  he arranged for him to work in clinic in hospital  so he went to work.
He came home from the Russian front with the army and he was it was still wintertime and he was already free man there.
No  no  no  this is eastern part of Poland   there were the Ukrainians and ru res ru Russian people  mostly.
And I started to work with a woman who was a white Russian.
Some were children with parents who came out of Russia   for example.
From there we had to cut into Hungary  also during the day it was summer during the day we were sitting on the high grasses  lay down over there  be cause there was a lot of Russian patrols  and a lot of them got caught.
We spoke about it  yeah  sometimes we spoke that the Russian woul d come and liberate us  and well be good.
And then I  then I went to Harvard in the Russian Studies program and I was  and I was right because it was a wonderful choice because its a  its a  has an unbelievable history.
And they uh  start to behave  and that's how we managed to stay  and later on in the end  let's say the beginning of 1944  things were different because there  in the area became many Russian Partisan units  and the Polish Partis an units  and we were  we were just walking around for weeks  staying in one village.
And I started to write Russian  but it was very hard for me  because I never spoke Russian.
So we decided not to show our-our elation  and to take it with low profile  and that was a very lucky choice for us  because sure enough  somehow or other  the Russian had to re- Russians had to retreat  and the Germans came back.
This is a group who took all the arms the Russian left and we have to send it to Germany.
And we got outside and we h itched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next town.
It was also apparent  at that time  it was also learned  that Russian soldiers -- basically they didn't want to fight.
I was 14 or 15 at that time and of course the fellows from Berlin they tried to speak either Polish or Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their Russian language and the German language th ey just don't put together.
Well the Russian -- well  we had -- we had -- this is a shirt and pants  khaki.
I would remain there  because probably later  I was hoping it would change from a Communistic to a regular government  the Russian army will move  and then I was hoping legally to -- Ill be able someday to get to -- to my brother.
And the only way we could do that -- and then they would put them in a special camp that was organized in a place called Beauregard  near Paris  and once you entered this it was Russian territory  it was just like entering a ma -- a Russian embassy  and there you were in a Russian soil  that was it.
05:10:32 No  there was like a room  and I don't know how many of us slept in that room  but that when  then I tell you when  the thing  when the Russian came what we had to do.
There was -- after this  the Russian came back and they was fighting about the city of Przemysl one week  seven almost days.
Once we were out  the very next day  we crossed to the American sector and decided never to step in the Russian sector again.
Uh...I rememb er that we were inform ed by the underground that we should await an uprising because the Russian Army was closing in on Warsaw.
The Russian tanks will come  tank traps  will laugh for 30 minutes and take one minute to get through.
The main thing that they worried about was the men because the men were afraid of being conscripted into the Russian Army  which was the usual procedure what they did and they were basing themselves on the First World War.
When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on  they spoke Russian.
On Friday  the 28th the Russian tanks entered uh Czernowitz and my return could not take place anymore.
But then this Russian came and we were scared of them.
And we did call the Russian and they note and they did pay us for it.
Do I know Polish  yes of course  I'm Polish  I know some Russian.
So the Russians go the Russian government gave a visa  as was already after the revolution  b-because she was an orphan  they gave a visa to go to her sisters.
So  you know  was really funny  because she sounded more German than Than you did.
They were built in Israel  they were designed by Technion  built by Israel aircraft industry and they were launched on a Russian missile from Kazakhstan.
One  that my mother and myself  we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian passports.
And the reason we went to Ellis Island   because thats a a spy ship I came with  some Russian spy ship.
And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them could be up to no good because  you know  the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans  eventually after two weeks  it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under Russian tanks  but I was glad  myself  that the Russian tanks came back.
As I said  later on we did find out that they were Russian soldiers.
My mother didnt want to say that she was born in Russia  and she could come under Russian quota number was empty.
was still controlled by the Russians and we had to cross the Russian zone to go over to the Englis h zone.
And -- Whats it like to put on a Russian uniform?
Did you feel a particular warmth for the Russian people having sacrificed so much during World War II?
And if you put it publicly the Russian embassy gonna make a protest... [END] Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
But Warsaw was a occupied part of Poland by the Germans.
January of 1945 and the Russians are... The Russian artillery is bombarding the city.
Once a Russian soldier spoke to me and I asked him if he can bring me to Lublin and he said he's going in that direction> I was fearless  and I said I'll go and I'll take a look by myself.
The Russian soldier come over  he wanted to buy the bottle.
I tried I I edited the Soviet history from Russian into Polish.
They don't know what to do with.ﬂ There is such an expression in Russian  .
But before the Nazi invasion  even in 1941  even before the Russian invasion  for the partition  what was life like?
He apparently could not follow us  and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him.
When they maybe uh  uh were beaten on the Russian front  so they lets their anger out on us ---------  but there were so many methods.
If you pick up a Russian map of New York C ity  the river is not Hudson River  but Kudson River.
And then later on  when the Jewish when the Hungarian Jews were Rounded up.
Now  I want you to tell me about Bucharest  but one question  did you or your family think that maybe you might be better off under Russian?
I really dont know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both.
And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also  Marxist phraseology  which they didnt believe in   who were Hebrew teachers before he beca they became Marxist  quote unquote  teachers  who were teaching Yiddish instead of Russian  which they ended up teaching for a while  you know?
So I walked back into town  nearly into town  and here was a Russian  and he had a piece of black bread in his one hand  and he had a chicken leg in his other.
70 We knew that the Russian are -- are -- are close already.
The German rifles were capture d over there too  possibly or in Italy  and the Russian rifles were captured in Russia.
There was one soldier he was speaking Russian it was American soldiers  and he says  ﬁWhat's wrong with you?ﬂ I say  ﬁbu55  bu  boli56  schmerzen 57.ﬂ And he took me in the Jeep  and it wasn't far away and drove me in to a town called Muhldorf and put me in hospital new  and I got good you know  cleaned out and the surgeon gave me farina  milk and sugar every day.
They occupied the city...this little town  and one of the Russian soldiers took a rifle and shot a...a German guard  took off his shoes and gave me his boots because the Germans had said if they were very well dressed  and without hesitation.
Well  this -- this -- this picture is -- thats a group of partisans  Russian and Jewish partisans  relaxing in the -- from the -- in the w -- in the woods.
I mean  I especia lly  as a young person  I think my uncle eventually understood that some of this was not good as time went on and  you know  we were under repressed and the Russian rule  and so on and so forth.
As the Germans advanced  and they discovered immediately the Russian propaganda was saying that the Germans did it  you know  and they tried to blame the Russians for this.
He said  Ill give a address  and you will [indecipherable] as a Russian soldier to this place  and youll tell him he should make you a picture as a that you were in in the camps  in the concentration.
So there were no  were there Russian troops around or not in that part of the countr y?
And they were fighting from [indecipherable] they went to the front  the Russian front.
They knew that there are Russian partisans or underground in other areas.
>> Nat Shaffir: Since he dealt with the Iron Guard Army  he tried to make contacts with the Russian armies.
World War II began with the invasion of Poland by first Germany then Russia in September 1939.
So what happened in the meantime  the Russian troops were here  they started messing up all the political parts  messing up what I was trying to do. [
But there were also Polish  so  you know  it became [speaks foreign language] .
So I learne d a lot of basic Russian  and I could communicate with Karowlka   with Anna and Ziegmund very  very easily in Russian.
And Russian soldiers saw it and saved her and -- and put her out.
A few jumped out and they surrounded me and they said in Russian I should lift my hands.
Maybe was and we went to the Russian commandant too  and they give us all kind of things too and it was very  very nice.
T-To-To the trucks  and from the trucks to the [Russian] .
That was Polish school  my mother send me to Polish school.
We see the Russian soldiers and we run up to them.
So one was Jewish  and the rest was NKVD   NKVD  the Russian.
And then the Russian -- >> Bill Benson: Before you talk about leaving Auschwitz  tell us about the surgery that you were forced to undergo.
And he said if he would have his wife  which was in one of the Russian cities [indecipherable] he wouldnt go back either.
But the two dots were two Russian soldiers  and came more and more.
We went there and uh we lived there for a couple of days and we tried to make connection...we knew that Russian ambulances going to Czechoslovaki a are taking...for money are taking people who want to escape from Poland  so we made the connection  but before we  we were able to leave  the friend of mine asked me...Sophie I have to do something.
We had no idea where they are going  but later we found out  they were all going toward the River ---------  and across the border to the Russian side.
And that was -- otherwise you had to go through the Russian zone from Augsburg to get down to Vienna.
When I came to Vienna and I visited the Rothchil d Hospital  which was kind of a way-station for the Brichah  where they housed Jewish 17 survivors who were being brought from Po land across Yugoslavia through Broto...through Brotoslovia   across the border into the Russian zone of Austria  and then into the American zone of Austria  and then into the American zone of Germany.
The Russian army wants him but you're not trained for war.
I dont know how she made it  oh she was so beautiful  I was studying Russian day and night  including some coffee sessions w ith the young lady  right  I remember that.
A Russian grabbed me  and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards  these young shnooks  I think two or three of them or f our of them  I think four of them  few  because some of them run away  lined up along the wall.
When we were...we were taken over by the German  there were...there were...we actually...the part that we were...were...at the Russian occupation  and 6 there was...uh...a truck standing in front of our pharmacy and there were Russian doctors that were asking my father to join him and go back to Russia before the German occupied  but my father said that in a war you have to have a roof under your head and he didn't want abandon it.
So you get there in September  and you leave Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 14 And we left next spring  when the the Russian authorities asked all the refugees who came from the other side  who expresse d their preference  the preferences being to remain a Soviet citizen and stay at Tarnopol  or to go back to the places from which they were ejected by the Nazis  which is what we chose to do  because thats where most of the family was  in Rzeszow   and some even in Jaroslaw  because not all of us were deported of the same day.
I was a youngster  I was dressed nicely and the director was a Russian guy.
Commandature is a Russian word actually  meaning the command office for the -- for the city commander.
When the man...uh...when the...the Russia...the Lithuanian government....the Russian Lithua nian government send a car to pick up my father and it was 12 steps or 15 steps from the second floor to go down  my father refused to...to leave and run to Russia where his life a nd my whole family's he would have saved because he felt he cannot abandoned his patient in the hospital.
But up to 14  no  you had to go to school and And so these you said there was a school for the Russian kids?
People had to live so many Jews  young people to work and they have to work for the Germans.
Even if I was officer  because mostly the officers in the Polish army  the high command  were mostly Russian in Polish uniform  and I had more priority than the the Polish officers who were really Polish before the war.
We lived in an apartment that was for our small family but in our apartment there was my father's sister  Rivke  with two children  whose husband was taken to the Russian Army.
Oh I knew a little bit of Hebrew  Yiddish  Polish  German.
Then Im calling called in the office and they said  would you like to go and be a kitchen help in this mans this is a private firm  but they getting concentration camp people and Russian a nd God knows they had some Frenchmen too.
And this Russian general  whatever  come out and said that the German pig stuck a... What do you call?
Once you know how to speak the Slovak language  you can understand Polish  too  so I understood a little Russian  a little Polish.
But really  it was Radziwi ow  you know  and th when the Russians were there because it was constantly Russian  Polish  German  Russian.
For me  it was a terrible thing  because as ba d as the Russian was  they never beat us  they never hurt us  they never shot us.
They told us they had been marching  that um  Auschwitz  uh the Russian front had moved closer  Auschwitz was being liberated  and they were running away from the advancing Russian army.
Because after liberation  they all -- w-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer  and we were all going to bike to Prague  and the girls couldnt do it.
She said  ﬁWouldnt you come and do some wo rkshops for us as a volunteer for our Russian refugees?ﬂ Which I did  for about four years.
My father  mother spoke Polish but used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
I don't know how  because he was Russian at the time from the war.
And he that of course  he was starting to look because they were talking theyre killing Jews  theyre killing Jews  the Russian  but he never believed  because they said all all propaganda he was talking about.
The city was bombed right at the end of the evacuation when the German planes and the Russian planes were still fighting each other.
The people who we re attached to the Justice  to the Russian delegation.
This was important that I rememb er but   his name was Frank   he had a mother who lived in Vienna  and I make a passpor t out for the three of us to get into Russian occupied territory.
I mean it was probably Russian  whatever  but to me it was plenty.
Now as far as I know  after the Russian revolution in 19 19  they moved to Poland to Gr odno where the brothers and there were three sisters  they all opened a tannery and it wa s a large tannery and they all worked in there.
Also  I was scared  and so I never went into the Russian zone in Germany or never went into Berlin.
Well  Yiddish  we spoke  you know  we spoke with my family Yiddish.
And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.
Sein -- Seindel  yes  Seindel  and her name is in Jewish  yeah Seindel -- Shinya -- no  sorry  her Jewish name is Seindel  her -- the name by which everybody knew her and called her was the Russian diminutive of Seindel  which was Shanya.
Were these people mostly Jewish or not Jewish A. No  not Jewish.
I was that time with him and this wasnt -- this was Russian partisans  they did it to him.
But eventually  you know  the police -- the Polish police  which was  I think  called Enkavide and the Russian police too  together came and they said you -- thats it  you must return the child.
And -- but as we come closer  we could see that they were basically Russian guards and German civilians carrying equipment.
Mili Ribbentrop was a German repres-representative of of the government  and the Molotov was the the Russian like min Soviet.
When the Russian came -- came in  it was ch ange in my life because I -- first I went to kindergarten for the first -- first time.
Russian soldiers  well we were in the basement of the building.
There were battles that the Russian Army waged and summer of 1944 we were liberated.
I was in the Polish army I told you in 1938  1939 and I know the language and I... They take me to the Russian army and... I don't know what's going on.
The camera  he hands amazingly hands back to me  with no film  and points to the house  and more or less  he spoke in Russian  but but he said  I understood  you stupid  you better go back there  you stupid kid.
This boss from the factory was a bor n American man  but his father was a Russian man.
DDuring the Russian  he run away with the Russians  and he lived in Almatta   in in Russia .
The Russian school started out right away an indoctrination and they had a system of progressing children into the communist party.
And he thought that from his experience  he survived during the war first  because he know perfect Russian language.
Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15  2010 56 And asking [speaks Russian] in Russian [speaks Russian].
So you had the wh -- white Polacks  the white Russian.
Like for instance  in my home we spoke Yiddish  but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish.
The the most I got in contact with  at the castle where we stayed  they had converted one of the rooms into a very nice little bar  and in the evenings it was the bar was pre tty well full  and there was one Russian who was a jolly sort of a guy  didn't speak any English at all  but he was fascinated by the different kinds of glasses that different drinks came in  and so he would line up everything from Cointreau to Tom Collins practically  like six or eight glasses  ten glasses.
They send all those poor young men to died  especially on the Russian front  as well as the African front  as well as Yugoslavia  and Albania.
My husband was in very good standing with the Russian generals.
My brother was went with one nice Russian Byelorussian man  went to Wolkowysk   and to see my father and to take some food for him  and they didnt let him see my father.
And then when we recognized that they were Russian soldiers and we rushed towards them like one is to meet the messiah.
And they were still  already incorporated with some partisans  with some Russian partisans.
So I have never been Russian so I try to be American  but Im not American.
So I remember there was a -- I had a friend  he was a major in the Russian KGB  and I went to him  and I told him  ﬁLis ten  I want to get out  and -- and how should I arrange it?ﬂ And now I didnt know that he would betray me.
I have to send them over.ﬂ ﬁHow you will do?ﬂ ﬁI make a conference from all officers  Russian  Polish  anyone  and when I will say I have a mission and I need volunteers.
So  chof-socks and leather coats and our fine porcelain  all of it went somewhere with the Russian families eventually back to Russia.
Whether it would have been Polish  or Yiddish  or Russian  or or German  or or something else.
I tried Russia Russian people  I tried Jewish people  I tr ied anybody I could imagine  if any knows what is breck?
If you went to the to the Russian Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 39border  you know  they call that city Lublin.
And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism is  everybody is even  and its the best system  until a Jewish officer came  a Russian Jewish officer  said  ﬁDont believe a word.ﬂ We were thinking of Communism  because thats a -- was presented to us as a real equal society  a society of equal people.
One of the husbands was killed in a Russian military  on the front.
I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.
We reached the front line and first -- we saw the first Russian  and this was the -- suppose our liberation -- supposed liberation.
This wa he was a Russian  and he recruited the Ukrainians  and Russians  whoever was available  and some some Mongols from the Azure   to put them to work on Poles  the rebellious Poles  and finish us off.
They were making over there an airfield for the Germ ans from the woods.. They should taken off to attack the Russian front.
There were a lot of people that did not understand Russian  but like I say  lucky there were a few people that would translate it.
World War II began when Germany attacked Poland from the west quickly followed by being attacked by Russian from the east.
This was the very first one  it was in the Russian sector.
One of them picks up the vodka  says in Russian to me  \ Drink.\
To me Lithuanian was like a foreign language because at home we spoke Yiddish.
I told I told them  I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires scared of a Russian peasant.
Within about six months  they opened a school  wi-with one teacher  Russian  of course.
And then a lot of them run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police.
And then a lot of times  the Russian soldiers stopped with the trucks and they give you a lift.
We saw with our eyes how the Russian tanks come  and go over the German tanks and over the German soldiers  and over the Germans everybody.
And we took this child  and took it to his godparents who were a Yugoslav a Croatian Jew by the name of Alexander and his Russian non-Jewish wife who were in New York already for a year.
We exchanged goods because the Russian Jews were able to get much more food ‚cause they lived there  they knew the people against us a nd the people would trade their coats and their clothes.
Its sort of a long story  Raye  but I went to the head of the Russian archives  this unusual man  uh  Major Avenerius he was  and I told him what we were looking for  and as I said last night  he  he asked me  well  he said  ﬁDid you come up from the John Ford unit?ﬂ And I said  ﬁYes ﬂ and he said  ﬁWell  thats very interesting.ﬂ And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar.
Instead of learning how to speak English  I took up Russian.
She told us this days -- this day but not only this day as she left oriented -- orientated -- girl or young woman escaped from the Russian in Bialystok  and came as refugee to Lithuania because 5 she was a Zionist and she could not live under the Soviets  even  even Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was very  very much orient -- Soviet oriented  so it was how to tell you  half  half  mixed feelings about Soviet Russia.
So we already 1939  before before a couple of days before the Russian came  we didn't have a house  we didnt have nothing  everything was destroyed.
It was a small group of about 20  they were a forward group  and their mission was to undermine the progress to the Russian front.
And after the war we had a big influx of Jews from -- from eastern Europe from Nort h Africa and -- and the second generation or third generation of -- of the Jews born to Russian immigrants or Polish immigrants because the school system is so open went to higher education and all of a sudden they are engineers or .
I remember carrying one message to a Russian general in Lavesig that  and forgetting to shake his hand  and he was left hanging there as I left the room.
Do you know why your family moved from Poland to Germany?
And he one tim e obviously  without knowing how  that everyone spied on everyone  said that Polish workers had it mu ch better than the Russian workers  and they somebody in that factory denounced him.
The -- the Russian didnt kill you  th -- you -- when the Russian came  you can go to school  you can do anything you want.
I was liberated and the Russian trucks and army came in and looked around.
In the afternoon came a high rank ing officer  a Russian officer  early afternoon.
And in both places  of course  Rossleben and Rudersdorf  we found the same thing that we had found in the Russian sect or.
They were right because the Russian were not very nice to them.
Between the bad people was two friendly American boys who supplied to Warsaw through the air ammunition and guns wa s shot by German and landed close to our house Mirdova and went with us together to concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to Flossenburg what I visit couple years ago are ho w many Polish people died there  was mostly died Polish  Russian  very small Jewish and two Americans.
If you went to -- slept -- if a German woman encouraged young Polish or Russian boy to sleep with her  it was found out  death sentence immediately.
We was on the bad side  we was in Poland  we couldnt go back  th e Russian didnt let us go to the border.
It was really hard to stay alive and dodging bullets  although did some stupid things like watching people shooting at me  Russians  or Russian airplanes strafing me.
And my father remembered the Germans Austro-German from World War I. Then the next day  or days later  he took a wa gon with horses  and he put this all  everything of of ours on the wagon  and we head to the Russian border.
And about a week later I uh  with a Russian transport  I went to Budapest and as I arrived in Budapest  it was one day after liberation.
They're small houses  and so we had Rusisha shul  Russian shul  and a Poylissha shul  a Polish synagogue.
And when we they werent Tuvia said  we are partisans  in Russian  dont kill us  you know?
It was...uh...it was very important for the Lithuanian to teach their children Lithuian...Lithuania so they had to teach Lithuanian and some of them went to Russian school.
So -- Did they know  though  that you were from -- Oh  no  no  they -- they -- in [indecipherable] Italy -- -- the [indecipherable] -- there was a thousand of people  Russian  Ukrainian  Italian  and Polish people  you see?
This was -- you know  when the pact -- unknown pact  Hitler and -- and Stalin made the pact and when the Germans in 1939 pushed the -- no -- attacked  most of the army retreated east  towards the Russian border.
So they put me in a room with Russian Colonels or ranking officers  also which was sick.
But what part of Russia was this within Russia proper  or in another was it Yeah  I think it is.
No w  this was the most illogical  stupid thing to say  because the Russian soldiers had two hands  what are they going to do with a piano?
Russian girls who were in P.O.W. camp  black African  French guys who were working as -- they were not P.O.W.'s and they were not in concentration camp but they were something in between.
So   but in Karmine   you still didnt speak Russian?
One question before you go on  life under the Russian occupation  was that any more difficult for a Jew?
One from our group worked in the woods  sent to cut fo -- for -- you know  for a week and he was work and they left -- you know  they stayed there in the 35 woods for a week and at night Russian couple -- couple -- Russian partisans came over.
We had nationalities here  had Poles and you had -- you had Jews and you had some White Russian  Bellarouse.
So one day  I I became friendly also with the chief of police  and I told him I I say  Im involved in in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one sector now that Berlin is divided four sector; the French  the British  the Russian  and the and the American.
Ruben  me  and two Russian prisoners went out to the barbed wire and people line up behind me.
In his eyes  I was the only one what survived to be to tell the story  so I took...we got back to the same place where we were and we're waiting and three months later the army came  the Russian army.
The only hope for us was this side  the Russian to come.
And did he in Warsaw   did he study in Polish  and then finish his studies in Tartu in Russian?
So she would get postcards in -- in -- in -- in Russian and sometimes it would come in Yiddish and so on.
Sh -- Tatta worked more in Kaunas  where there was a group  and all these people were Russian nationals in Lithuania.
I start a little bit  because neighbors all Russian  everybody Russian.
Because Russian army already encircled them from the  from the west .
Oh  he went when the Germans started  when the Germans came to Russia  he went  was it the Russian Army  different Russia  and he spent most since he didn't know Russian  so he had to work in coal mines.
It was a place  Poking  you know  because they said that...uh...that if the Russian  you know ...uh...soon they're gonna be closed down.
>> Susan Snyder: So at one point the Germans actually invade by 1941.
Maybe the  the Allies and the Russian at that part  from the air  and then  they  they  the closest place was to send us was Theresienstadt.

In our group  the family  my grandmother  my mother's father  he spoke Russian yet because he knew to write and to read Russian.

This house -- this home burned down -- this home burned down after th e -- we first had Polish people there  Gentile people and then we had also again Russian people.
My my older my oldest brother  when the Russian came in  he went back to dub to Mlynov   and he stood with my grandmot her.
And they were all running back to Russian closer to the Russian border  deeper in Russia.
But today if I can find a Russian Jew that I can take by the hand and give him part of my America a nd return him to self-sufficiency as a way 12 of life  that justifies all the efforts and all the hours because it gives you love in return.
We escaped together and when we were in a group to gether  Hassidic Jewish group  and when we were  you know  assigned in the later round  in the -- in the brigades  Russian brigades  he was assigned in a different place  in a different brigade.

In my house  in my apartment  there were my two grandparents and one aunt with two children whose husband was taken to the Russian Army.
That was in the summertime  and the reason that I remember that it was in the summertime is one of the refugees  he was  ju st hordes of people  I mean the roads in Lithuania weren't any good  they were dirt roads  and people with walking and pulling wagons and horses  it was just mayhem  and one man started running around  he had lost his mind  and he started screaming to anybody  anybody that has a Soviet flag  tear it up and make a scarf out of it and put it on your head  so when the Germans come in  will not find the Russian flags on you.
Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28  2015 51 Well  we had two in Russian  and they were pretty good teachers because they would teach us how to write so nicely from one line to the other  the letters had to be.
EL: Well uh we knew that  that everything was uh that the  the Russian army was approaching.
Until the Russian  we escaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away  the Russians were quite practically next to  well they were  the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that time.
Thomas Blatt 28 July 26  1996 Page 28 Tape 2 And so we were talking about when you went back to the farmer's house and you had the Russian soldiers with you?
My Russian wasn't too good  but I remember the speech what I gave.
But you have thousands of Polish troops in the Soviet Union prisons.
I remember the Russian soldier got upset  he took the rifle and say in Russian  ﬁDavai na zad.ﬂ Go back.
And many times I came  I came to a to a plo to a place where I used to run with my horse  like a machine  and d I call a lalka   lalka in in Russian or Polish is a buba  you know what a buba is?
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
Jewish  Ukrainian  Russian  are concentrated in you.ﬂ Shut him up right away.
He says  we just had to give a couple bottles vodka to the Russian guards that they should let us out from there.
Then I find out that not far from us there was a group of Russian partisans.
So -- so there was all kind of groups there in the woods and this is the first -- the first friend we met at two -- a Russian -- they were Russian Bitar  so they said  ﬁWell  try and get some arms  or get some money and maybe we can  you know  if you get some ar -- money we can -- well take you in some.ﬂ But  you know  one of the -- the -- from the - the man from our group was responsive for this man.
This came from the Russian soldiers and they said  when my mother told them she was Jewish  ﬁYou must have collaborated with th e Germans.
My father used to tell a story when he was in Russia.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
A Russian  strong and other theres a special word for this.
So I know they lost a lot of money during the revolution  Russian revolution  that when my mother used to talk about  but -- Can you remember what your grandparents home was like in Pinsk when you were little  but -- but not -- not during the war  when you were little.
I remember long  mile long marches of Russian troops coming through from the east and going to the front.
But then the Russian came every day closer and closer to the camp.
Everybody was in turmoil because everybody was again afraid of the Russian.
It is...we are coming out of the...of the uh  U.S. sector  and then we are again in the Russian sector.
And the Russian soldiers  Thomas Blatt 22 July 26  1996 Page 22 especially in the hospitals  used to sell shirts and soap and this and they did conduct some trade  which I didn' t do  I didn't like it and I didn't feel talented in bargaining and trading  so I didn't do it.
A coupl e weeks later  I ran away too  for a couple of nights  and I came back and it was quiet  nobody ever looked for me  for my other friend and that Russian guy disappeared.
But there was one place over the Mulde River where we had to cross  that was a separation line  the demarcation line of the Russian and the American forces  and the Ru ssians let us go over.
They aske d us so and so and so  and they wanted us boys -- we were three boys that time  ready to go to the army -- to take Russian citizenship.
In '14 the war broke out  in '16  they got him--they sent him on the Russian front; and one month later he died  he was killed.
My father was learning with me  to write and to read to read in Russian; this I learned by myself  I learned this.
Okay  were they th-they werent German soldiers then  they were foreign soldiers.
Well  b ecause we were under Russian occupation already  the Russian didn't give us permission  and we went from Jewe(?)
In the beginning they still kept their farms but  I understand that later on they had to give up their farms to the Russian government and work with them as co-hosts whatever they established at that point.
He joined the communists on the ground with the Russian soldiers also  in the underground.
They were...they ...they... you know  I don't know if you know the Ukrainians were throwing...you could see that after  you know  that they were throwing flowers on the Russian tanks  but the Russians...not the Russians  the 21 German tanks  the Nazis.
When I was in the age of 56  I learned Yiddish myself  and I translated from Yiddish into Russian some novels of Jewish writers.
And they were Ru ssian -- Russian immigrants  those 3 people  who were all first cousin of the Czar  of course  you k now.
And Koppelmann was a good Jew  knows one of the Jewish officials in the Swiss Jewish community  a very fine human being  Benjamin Segalovitz  the type of -- the best type of Russian Jews  in the -- of the old aristocratic Russian Jewi sh type -- who lives in Switzerland for many  many years.
Do you know what part of Russia your family ŠŠ Yes  they came from ?
People who were very intellectual  like for instance  people in our town used to speak Yiddish and Hebrew  Russian and Polish and German and French  it fluently  a lot of them.
And at one time you know the  the Russian  it was then the you  no it wasnt Christmas Eve.
They were picked up off the water  three men and two women  by a Russian trawler.
I cant put it in terms of hours  but then all of a sudden the German sold iers were gone and the Russian soldiers were around us in white uniforms.
Now the Poles went out and the an d the Russian went away in another place in the same  another place  and the German came b ack.
And then...and then I went...I was in the Polish army and uh they took us...we...you know  the Russian army already was...the Germans were loosing the war already you know.
So this guy  the Russian peasant  he took off  and we were left there just like that.
And one of them  the the brother worked as a laborer in in some factory with Russian workers.
Apparently  downstairs  somebody must have seen the Russian soldier pointing his g un at me  so the rumor had spread that both of us had been shot.
Those were the ones who were coming back and they didnt want to stay in the Russian zone.
He was very much against using Russian language in Lithuan -- in Jewish society.
Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 51 A. We continued walking  and the Russian took over.
So  I picked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place.
Jews did not know -- Jews in -- Russian Jews did not know much about religious life  because they were already so and so many years without religion.
Did they speak Polish amongst each other  or Yiddish Yeah  as a matter of fact  they spoke Yiddish normally  but Polish when they didnt want us to know what they were talking about.
And so  you know and the and then the once the this became and and they came in to Poland and and all that  I remember they were al-always saying [speaks Russian] What does that mean?
Well  to begin with  after -- after a little while  the -- Berlin was divided into zones  into different zones.
He told me I have a way to escape  through the forest there's underground armies  Polish underground  Russian underground  fighting the Germans  we can join them.
And we had arranged and I was invol I was included in that with our general meetings with the Russian general.
This is the one who was became a prisoner of war in Russia .
Only when the Russi an came  it wa I I was from 19 I I knew Polish good  but Russian  I didn't learn Russian because I hated communism.
I wanted to follow my education  so I went to a technical school  a Russian technical school.
And we didnt want to go with the main road because there still the Russian Army was moving.
I even wrote to the Russian commissar or something in December .
It was not Russian  but Ukraine was more difficult than than the Russian.
I didn't speak Russian  but they were a year there  and we had to go to school.
Then came 1942  they killed every day  100 peopl e  50 people  10 people of the Russian Jews.
It was in June  maybe July or maybe August  one morning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the offensive.
The 31st day  the Russian officers were shooting their men if they did something wrong  that was the atmosphere.
So  and before Wagner  had to go 28 days before  they brought in a Russian unit from POWs.
As a rule  most of the Russians are a -- a liltz -- some are -- I would say Russian soldiers  majority is not like Germans -- big guys.
I put a terrible c-coat  and a mans Russian hat  you know  with with fur  and I look like a boy  suppose with with the pants  supposed to look.
So a Russian officer walked by  took him by the head  threw him in the..in the...in the yard.
And all those two years they were telling us [Russian] That is not Poland. [
What would come on the radio ther e  what was there  music  or Thered be the the well  yeah  for th e most part there would be first thered be the news  you know  of  you know  the the Russian front is moving  you know  and the Russians are winning an d all that kind of stuff.
We had already certificates  but then I... I can't tell you the story but we had to run away because the Russian heard about it  that there are people from... from Russia from the...from the Baltic States going on the boa t  so we had to run away back and went back to Hungary  back to...uh...Austria (coughing)...sorry...and then we came to...on the border of Austria and Italy and there we passed a border.
Bialystok is still Polish  but any day it can become either Russian  or Germany comes there.
All of the children speak Russian  they came from Russia  different ages   nobody knows to write or read Polish or Russian  and we s -- all speak rush -- Polish or Yiddish  and we speak Russian.
His wife was completely different  very talkative  very expressive  liked to discuss things with with here in with me with my poor Russian  which she corrected all the time.
I do remember Ill go back a little bit during the time when we were there with our big family group  there was a lot of discussion whether to take Russian citizenship or not.
He was writing -- he was writing because he -- he didnt belong to -- actually to -- to Germans  and he didnt belong to Russian.
We knew that if we would take Russian citizenship  tomorrow they Interview with Shulim Jonas 15 will send us to the army without teaching us how to use a gun or a... So this would be our death.
She was a full developed  beautiful  18Stakhanovtsy: The name of the partisan band (Russian).
She says you know  Francisca  when the Russian come and I pretend to be Russian  I couldn't do what you do  so she uh took me in.
But -- but what I did like  incidentally  was kind of interesting is that the -- that the Russians liked opera very much  you know  and they had tran slations of classical operas in Russian.
I don't know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German.
And I am always amazed at what my father would think if he thought that he had a journalist daughter working for the \ Russian Post \  a granddaughter  okay?
That was a little town that we spent the rest of the Russian occupation.
Yes  also in that  uh  period  uh  my uncle--who was a war veteran from the First World War  and  uh  was on the Russian front  lost one eye there and was kept for six years in Siberia.
My parents were Russian Jews  who had come to this country around the turn of the century and I had an older sister who was born in 1913 and a younger brother  who lives in California.
We did speak Russian  because we went one year to Russian school.
So I didn't stay very long  but the doctor in charge over there  the Russian woman  saw that I...uh...must be...some...somewhere...some...she wanted to know more about me.
When the Russian front come near  we will go come we will go back.
And one Russian guy  he came always from Polkenu  he was beginning to make Russian government  we lived in Poland and we didnt know a lot of stuff what was going on.
As it turned out  they were on the Russian front all the years.
The woman will close the shop and he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee from Transylvania  like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee  refugee from Transylvania.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings TAMAR LAZERSON ROSTOWSKI pg 8 Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: and to see how they are thrown into a truck.
It depends whether you read the Polish or the Russian records.
Well  outside is where the we were  at first  living on the in the small they put us with the older Russian family  wh ere she had she had one room  and we had another room.
It was Russian hold the crematoriums and the gas chambers were working 48 hours.
But I -- Im sure they thought that was the Russian army at.
Well  Yiddish  we spoke  you know  we spoke with my family Yiddish.
We find already some collaborators from our town  and we tried to turn them in to the Russian.
And she was married to an official of Macys in New York and felt that during the time that they escaped from Russia  people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah team spoke excellent Russian.
They wanted to send me to Potsdam  because I could speak German and Russian  and I object ed.
So  we di dnt know that the Russian were -- at -- Russians will enter so soon.
So that's basically -- I didn't start -- when the Soviets occupied the Bukovina  when it was annexed  wasn't occupied  they would like to say it was annexed  in 1940  I started school  in Russian school.
Because you know  the Chinese came  the Chinese then came  it was in the war  they were volunteers from China  the Chinese that came  and thats how I wound up in Korea  because the first pilots over there were all Russian  in Korea.
To the British who are precise  cold  correct  he tried to emulate a gentlemenlines because he respected the British  but when he saw a Russian  he winced.
So  would you say your family was assimilated into Polish society?
I have Russian officers who quite frequently looked for my help.
All my uncle s  the brothers of my father  also left Russia and they also settled in Lo dz.
Rae Goldfarb: She enlisted in the Russian Army as a worker and we -- we got lodging in a boxcar and traveled with the train to fix water towers.
Either he remained in Russia where they -- when -- when they were in Russia  you know  trying to -- to beat the Russians  or he actually escaped Germany  and -- and Poland  because of the fact that he was doing all these awful things  and -- and he went to Ru ssia  or maybe there were -- he did some things for the -- to the -- against the Russian people  and th ats why they got him in -- jailed in Russia.
A Russian picked me up and carried me like a package.
I was there for three month probably  in the Russian school and I jumped right away to the 10th.
And what we  I would do when I was going up to Salzburg or to Linz  the other side of the Russian zone  I would get on there was an American army train known as the Mozart  and we would get on that and that was not inspected by the Russians  but you still had to have a permit to leave Austria.
Now  people may wonder over this whole period of time why Jews didn't just get out of Germany.
I had my Russian [indecipherable] certificate in one additional year  which is unusual.
We spoke German at home  and Russian  and Latvian and when they wanted to speak so that we wouldn't understand it  they also spoke English.
He survived then  he was a doctor and he had helped quite a few people over there in Poland and they hid him so he came back with with the trucks  with the Russian Army.
You know  I escape fr-from there in a Russian ambulance from there.
Polish citizens were drafted in the Russian army  and they escaped.
So it started to work the communist propaganda and it just ever ybody to believe that it was only the Russian and Russian and Russian and from excuse me  from this time out it was all thing everything what the American did what everything wrong  and everything they wanted to to take away everything from Czechoslovakia   from the factories and everything  becaus e so  it wa the sta the Russians started the Russian and the communist government started to br-brainwash the people in the Czechoslovakia  and most of the people believed them.
I couldnt tell them that I was Polish so with my pu rest Russian I said (?).
My aunt at that point was working in a Russian bank.
JL: Well there was plenty of anti-Semitism in Lithuania before the Germans came before the Germans came; obvi- ously before the Russian came for that matter.
In August 44 all of a sudden  they came and they said -- because the Russian army came next with -- they took us from Riga to St utthof  to Germany  when in Wilna already were the Russians  were liberated.
First of all  we spoke Russian  so that was no problem as far as the language.
Ukraine people comes to the Polish villages and kill the...the Polish.
By the way  this camp had a lot of Russian prisoners and they had high officers that lived separated from everybody else.
In Neuengamme  esp ecially the Russian and the Ukranian who didn't understand any German  so when they were ill  so they came to the infirmary  when they were healthy  and they were warned.
And the Russian people  that was a very dirty story  what happened to them.
And some of the Russian major and a colonel came and talked to us.
He was not just making statements  he was really agitating and in a very emotional wa y and I was  I just  I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore  not after what happened  just  you know  in the last few years and my boy scout commander  and at that tim e I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement  my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with th e Russian troops already and was one of the organizers.
No  there was Polish  French and Yiddish and I spoke Yiddish.
Then I remember too  there is someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War?
Well  I didn't have the right to give away the s ugar and give away the candies when they got to give for Russians by the Russian government.
So the only thing  you had the front; and the front was the Russian guard.
W-We didnt kn ow what thats -- I didnt know what thats -- this means the American army  I know the five star emblem was the Russian army  so we thought thats the Russian army came.
It was very close to the train station  and when Russian left they -- they bombed the bridge.
I was still lying down on the ground  and suddenly the -- it was dark already  and we heard American planes -- or were -- they were Russian planes  actually.
So every time we heard steps on top  I went under the bed with my watch and bed  it was a kind of cot  and my uncle would run up the steps and scream in Russian  you know  the we there are just children here  and we are friends and so on.
And well  of course  a lot of from the Russian empire also; Polish  Lithuanian  Latvian Catholics.
Somebody was tell in Polish...at that time I spoke Polish well because being there you learn to speak Polish and Russian.
We were on our way to go deeper  we were supposed to go deeper to -- in towar -- in p -- in Poland  because the -- the Russian army liked us to be in the back of the German army  because we did a -- a good in -- a good job  apparently.
So I ha ve very strong sentiments to Russian cultu re  to the Russian people  but not to the Russian [indecipherable] .
With a great deal of luck I got ahold of a Jewish Russian officer who spoke Yiddish.
They giving away and they give to the Russian commander  to Platon  or whatever.
Did you speak with a Bavarian accent when you used to speak German?
In my heart  I was very happy that even if I get killed that I knew it was a Russian bomb  not a German bomb.
But I can give you a room with another lady on my own responsibility.ﬂ I said  \ I'd rather take the lady...the room with the lady.ﬂ And what happened there was that she was really a lovely  lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the German bank in Shanghai and he used to come to visit her every day.
Well  again  I  I sort of  I think Im the kind of person whos easily interested in what goes on around her and so after I married Alan and I was thinking now what am I gonna do with my life and my masters in Russian Studies didnt help me much here in Albuquerque  New Mexico.
We was working like slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other place to work in pieces of assembly of ai rplane.
One was of Polish uh  extraction and could speak Polish and German.
A lot of them ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war.
He was born when that part of Poland was part of the Russian Empire.
They used to bring truck loads or...or thousands of Russian soldiers and...uh...they used to roll off there...ever see  like you know how you see in the United States when they bring a garbage truck to a dump  the opened the back and out.
A lot of them were  you know  bandaged up and etcetera  but they I remember that distinc tly  but th at that point my mother and the Russian soldiers were selling cans of fat  you know  that chicken you know  I mean  animal fat.
And the -- then it came Poland  and a lot of people spoke Polish.
When I woke up  I saw a Russian nurse dead near me .
I was a poor Russian  you know  and I -- you know  and they told me I killed Christ  you know.
Polish Ukrainian became Soviet Ukrainian and Polish Jews from there were -- and Poles  not just Polish Jews --.
So when -- when they picked me out  I m - asked the doctor -- there was a young  Russian doctor  and I asked him how come that I was -- I pass all the tests  when they were such strong Polish boys who never had hunger  and this and that  and they were not accepted  and I was accepted.
Yes  yes  they announced it  they ann ounced it  thats all the prisoners in the camps are liberated because the war started to Germany  which they thought  and they hoped that a lot of the people who were in the barracks and the prison will join the Russian army to fight the Germans.
An d this was December  this was winter  it snows like Russian snows -- they would be taken off the carts.
When we arrived th e Germans had just killed 30 000 Russian Jews to make space for the German Jews.
And so the Russian Cossacks on horses on the highway  shooting apple off th e trees  and all that.
That was a little more difficult be cause you had to go through the Russian zone   you see.
So we we re suppose to go to a town called in Polish where they ha d the Russian war commander.
And also my parents fo the families were in Poland .
But we got them and we were changed over as Russian soldiers.
Then also my father's youngest brother was also taken for the Russian Army.
It was  the normal soldiers had been partly from Russian prisoners who run away.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
Now  Im going to talk about Larr y  that he actually survived all this time  but when they were taking him b ack as the Russian or the --- After the war  you mean?
But we had to study every page and every word of it and the final exam  when they examined me in Polish literature  I had to talk in Russian.
And on top of everything  my husband was reco gnized by one of the Russian [indecipherable] and he said  ﬁOh  you are still alive  you are here?ﬂ So next morning we were -- escaped.
That was another period of great hunger for us  because we crossed the -- we had to cross the river  into -- onto the other side  you know  because the Russian was -- were advancing.
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
And then  in the midst of all of that  periodically  Russian fighter planes would st-swoop down and ra ke the street with machine gun fire and then everybody  like on a -- a -- as even blown away by the wind  would vanish to the sides of the road.
What happened  two Russian planes came every five minutes for about a minute to check on the locomotives  we were not the only one  about 10 in a row.
Then  there is -- what do you call it when you commemorate -- a memorial  a memorial  and on the memorial in Russian it says that Russian citizens  100 000 of them  were murdered here  no mention of the Jews.
So when we we nt into the house  came in a Russian officer  Ill never forget  a very intelligent man.
And he say in Russian  ﬁWhere is your father?ﬂ I said  ﬁI dont know my father.ﬂ I started to cry  ﬁI dont know  the German took him.ﬂ So he says  ﬁOkay.
Then the next morning  they brought me into that Russian officer.
Like parts of Shallote nburg  which is a well known borough of the city  had fallen into Russian hands.
In the general region  were there a lot of Ukrainian people?
Well  my father told me -- I wanted to go  we all go in Russian zone.
There was a lot of discussion because one didnt know whether to do that or not to  because if you did that  it seemed to us at least thats what the grownups were saying  then we would never  ever have a chance of leaving what was occupied Russian territory  or Russia itself  because we were Russian citizens.
So we thought maybe we could go a little deeper away to the towards Russia.
I spoke Yiddish  I spoke Czech  Russian  Hungarian and of course I understood Polish  or a -- I also spoke German  you know  and that helped a lot because a -- when a -- in that part of -- a lot of the -- in that town  I should say  there were a lot of ethnic eastern Europeans.

The same Russian soldier who came in to the forest comes to check on us.

And they were very nice people  Russian people  the peasants or whatever.
I hadŠI became befrie nded with the Russian prisoner of war which by the way was a Jew.
Now I realized that it must have been fermented  and we both got drunk on it  on those black berries and we fall asleep and maybe that's what helped knock down with all the medication that we got  and they took us to a Russian hospital and they shaved our head  because it was all full of thing.

Some of us knew Russian  because they occupied some of the country.
And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp  from a prisoners of war camp.
Do you remember what happened when the Germans came  can you describe that to me?
But the Russian people had their cows  their their whatever  chickens.
Lwow used to be on the Russian... 2 Belonged to Russia but before Germany invaded?
We had -- just when the worst part is happening  the Russian troops were coming close to our borders.
Come and live with us  because the Russian  they're  you know  raping the Jewish girls  the German girls.
But my mother was talking to him and I did not understand Ukrainian -- Russian -- I understood Ukrainian -- Russian -- 23 Russian. --
It was not an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be Russians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army officers who were Jewish.
I would say most of the credit fo r the liberation  1948  comes to those Russian soldier  they were already trained  and they really know how to fight  Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 31those people  thats why I was talking with them after.
I guess ma-maybe because they didnt like the Russians  because the Russian depressed them.
So you say there were two Russian soldiers  and this sh ex-chauffeur Yes.
He spoke some re some Russian  but he was not very good in in the Russian  yes.
Some Russian soldier felt sorry for me  gave me his coat.
And I -- I -- I -- he spoke perfect  perfect Russian and perfect German and perfect English.
We knew that before that the advance of the Russian army already reaching here gonna be near us pretty soon  then -- then -- so we know what was going on  but it was ne -- never mentioned during the war about the concentration camp.
And the Russian soldiers were very friendly  at least to us children.
I think it affected my my father was a so ldier through four years or more  and he knew of the horrible possibility existed  and I mea n  he didnt sit in an office during World War I. He was in the Russian front among going on  this  that and the other came out.
Nice Russian girls  only girls  going to the woods to pick 61 berries  they had white berries  wild.
And just then an officer comes to the door and he says in Russian  \ What the hell is going on?\
That was another thing by the way  my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too  he knew with me -- he was going need the Russian language.
I mean  you ha -- because we might ha ve had a Russian housekeeper  so I would have occasion to speak Russian to her.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
Thats why it was so difficult to s-save sometimes  children  because they spoke Russian and they spoke Yiddish and they didnt speak Lithuanian.
You need German to talk to the German authorities  and you need Polish  Russian  whatever  and Lithuanian to take care of the refugees.
So as th e Russians  which most of the time they were retreating  the Russian army  we were like sort of behind the lines traveling back and forth in case the government would need a transport for so me reason.
And my father got the job because he spoke Russian perfectly.
And for some reason the Russian was nice and left her with her husband.
But there were people from Poland from Russia  my God  even Russian POWs which they were not supposed to be there.
Our is Russia...Russian...uh...Russian...uh ....uh...the opposite the Russian regime in communism  the new army be considered fascist.
In the school was only four children that were Jewish and I  from Russian school from Siberia  I have pictures.
It must have been in Russian   but Russian and Polish is relatively close.
And they spoke Polish on the border  the Russian spoke Polish.
But  immediately there were people who wanted this house and they moved in and then one night three uniformed men came in the Russian uniform of what was called NKVD  which is now called MVD or KGB.
One day they put out of the 250 men were not all German Jews  they were Russian Jews  Polish Jews  but now there may be 200 left.
Ya I remember he taught me al so Hebrew songs  poetry and Russian poetry  he read me instead of children stories  he read me stories tell st ories Thats what I grew up upon  war and crime and that kind of thing  and not Cinderella stories.
So he said: but since the Russian government is..is a good-hearted govern ment  he exonerates us for only [one] reason--because we volunteer into the Russian Army.
But at the back of my mind  I remember -- for example  people  Jews -- Jewish people on the eve of the arrival of Soviet troops in Pleven would urge each other  \ Well  take good care of your jewelry and whatever little gold you have because  you know  you never know with the Soviets.ﬂ And in deed  some of the -- now I have not personally seen that or experienced it  but many  many people were telling of the way Russian soldiers  once they arrived and would start marching down the streets or become traffic policemen or whatever  would stop people and simply rip their watches off their hands.
And I had to recite poetry from memory  remembering -- I learned Russian  Ukrainian  we learned -- and we were told to kiss Stalins picture cause these were -- these schools were run by communists.
Yes  but if he's going to have an image  if he 's going to make this image  remember he no longer is Hitler's number two man  he's no longer on the Russian front lo oking at the tanks  he's no longer doing the architecture or running the armaments pr ogram  which was a huge program  the man did a remarkable job  considering the fact he had slave labor  but the man did a remarkable job in picking 44 Germany up from the ruins of most of the bomb ing and actually turning out the tanks and the planes.
Some people who had spoken Russian  and were enough  so somehow either met some Russian who said you could come here  maybe be a teacher or something  but it this was too small a village for a very differentiated society.
And He doesn't look like a Jew  he looks like a Russian.
phone rings) Well the daughter called the Russian that she walked out  that she was going with and that she was  he was  called him or whatever.
There was a lot of Russian women were there and he says  make sure you don't let anybody bring in any food in the camp.
He knew I dont speak Hebrew  so he spoke to me Yiddish.
But there were some Jews and the times when the Jews didnt hear  you could hear– I understand Russian and Ukrainian  too.
And so they got a new friends  and the pe ople who was here  from -- the Russian people  well  they was not -- they actually afraid to be anti-Semitic  very  very  because actually they should take care about families who was -- came from this -- the territory that you know  like the -- they ra -- ran away from the Germans so  it was -- everything looks not very friendly.
They was in train this pass from Poland and Poland Czechoslovakia and most of prisoners from the Russian front from the German.
To this day I can still speak it better than I can Polish or Russian.
We pushed  uh  into Germany  uh  forcing  naturally  the German army back  or...or just wiping them out.
And of course  he was afraid that he would have to join the Russian army.
So we managed -- the frontier was a Polish guard  and a Russian guard  because there was some agreement that the Jews can be sort of taken out of Poland  if they wanted to.
As I said  the Russian soldiers  the occupiers brought us food and medicine and that's how we were being helped to   you know  to get stronger again.
The Russian was there and we going back  and I was -- we went to Ringelshain in this one -- in Sudetenland  you know  and Czechoslovakia and I was there.
And because of my languages  a friend called and says  Lili  you know how speak Yiddish fluently  and German and a little bit of Russian and Polish.
And what happened is is before I left fo r the other -- good for the other ranch  big ranch  the Jewish girls were playing a piano  and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls.
This time they killed thirty-five thousand German  Vienne se  Czech and Russian Jews.
And when you talk about this Russian occupation  what years would we be talking about?
The next day  we slept in a  that night we slept in a barn we found with the cows and the pigs on the bottom  and the next morning very early - the sun was still shining - I liked through a crack and I saw a Russian soldier.
He was a very frail man  and it was literally about two months before his death and he may not have been thinking as clearly  but the agreement then was that Czechoslovakia would be part of -- under Russian control more or less.
So this only proves that I really didnt speak any more Russian  but of course th e languages came back very fast.
So we were  were now only with our father and we were separated from our second mother and it was ju st terrible  but our whole li fe was up-side-down  from this time  because when the Russian came to Solie  you know  the first thing what they did  they said that my father is a ri ch man.
The only one difference is that in time of Lithuania   there was no Russian as language esp as as language.
The soldier tells me  the Russian soldier tells me  you know  this one is a Jew  this officer .
So I didnt speak Yiddish at that time  I spoke German and these people spoke Yiddish  so you had  Yiddish is a turned around German.
It used to be a Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 5little farm a farm place  but because the Russian the Russian tsar decide that time that he wants to build in Baranowicze two airports and two railroad stations  and since then  the town become very famous.
after a -- after awhile it came with Russian postage stamps.
That was Polish school  my mother send me to Polish school.
And he said oh [speaks Russian]  you know  we are so good  so nice  that we going to take you from here to Krakow.
He didnt even say nothing  because he couldnt get to it  or even if he could  he couldnt do anything  because theres lo many of them  these Russian soldiers  well-armed.
And I went to my Russian exam  and this happened to other people too  and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title  let alone  couldn't read the title  I just  in these years I just never bothered to read  to learn enough to read.
Could speak Hebrew   if anybody  Russian soldiers show up  because they were under the occupation of the Russians  should sit down and pray.
My grandpa was in the Russian army for seven years and he was a reli a religious man  so when the war was out in 1911 to 18  he came to Baranowicze and his gen general give him a permit to become a baker and supply food for the whole army.
HK Well  we never expected that we would be attacked by the German army because the Russian army was powerful and we never knew that what would happen.
As a matter of fact  we had a I remember that I was in a foxhole  and that was the last moment  and I had my last little K ration  it was a chocolate bar  and I fell asleep  and the the Russian probable was very hungry  so he stole it from me.
Im not so brave  but she sat in the car with me and we handed in her papers  and my propesk  my permit to go into the Russian zone  and we put her on a plane.
Q. Can you tell us when in   when the Russian army approached  what happened?
So were talking  was there still a division be tween Russian and German Jews at this point?
I have a feeling something  I said  I have to as I go out this door  the Russian goes by  I catch him by his hand  take him in this door.
And what we saw there was the Russians had come so close that the most eastern Province of Germany  East Prussia  was now threatened by the Russian Army who had every reason to be bitter about the Germans.
Now he said he doesnt know anything about it  he was a victim  he was in the Russian as a prisoner.
For a long time  and then they start to protest th-that they want -- when they have enough people already in Wilna  they came from all kinds of the counties  they start to talk Lithuanian  in the stores  in the banks  in that -- but before it was rush -- Russian.
So and all of a sudden we  we heard  we heard the gate  by the gate  some noise and then they broke open our.... We  were locked  our...our camp was locked from outside with a.... They broke the  the lock  and there were Russian partisans.
And by the way  at each of these intersections  like that also  there were heavy guns and -- put into place  that -- so that in case Russian tanks would appear  they would immediately be subject to heavy artillery fire.
So  the one turned to me in German and he said can you speak German.
And that artillery unit was under the command of a colonel who made a more educated impression than the run of the mill Russian soldiers.
But what what the Germans where we ki there were so many Russian were killed.
And she says  dont be mad  because we had  after the Russian came in  we had many people  Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews  because they knew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in their o-organizations  you know  the Cath olics and all these organizations.
At th at time Poland was partitioned  and Lwow was Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger 4 in the Russian sector  and where we were living was in the German sector.
The rule was set for Poles to take only Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 111the Polish Christians because according to Russian I dont know whether its Constitution or whatever  they the Jews are not Polish citizen  they are now Russian citizens  and they cannot leave.
Then we f -- about a week before the end of war  we heard that American troops had -- were within -- within about 50 kilomete rs of Kometau where we lived  and the Russian troops were still 300 kilometers away  and we knew nothing of the Yalta agreement.
And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.
Yeah -- No  before I nothing -- its never [indecipherable] to the country  I thought that it will be now close to the Russian border  even if well not be recruited  at least well be safer there.
When we were liberated  we were part of a Russian unit  the Kalinski .
>> Marcel Hodak: My father spoke several languages   Russian  Turkish.
I have it  its my [indecipherable] I have it until now and then she was -- a handmade serviette and a lit tle note and -- and then the -- the -- the Russian soldier who was looking after  he was quite kind  he was giving her my note and -- and giving back her present to me so we could communicat e a little bit.
We were three and there was a Russian girl and there was Helen and I think there were two more girls  I dont remember exactly how many of us were in there.
And Russian physicians would be available to provide treatment  to provide medicines.
Q. And Ruth  in testimony  once mentioned a Russian girl Clara.
They were not nice to them because they were Russian  Ukraine  whatever you want to call them.
But many of the  like for example  the typical Jew would speak Yiddish  Hungarian  because that was the dominant culture so to speak.
One son the Russian took aw ay to the army  one son was there  in [indecipherable] with her.
There were rumors that they were doing it in the Russian territory.
And all of a sudden I had nobody  and and then a cousin looked at me  she said  a-already  after the war  I ca they the Russian people say you could go to Poland.
So what happened is is when I went to that good  I arrived  and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory  and at night USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 10the Russian soldiers from all around  from the good that I worked in  the ranch  from all the ranches they would come  and -- and Polis h soldiers they would come  and I would give them all cheeses and milk  cause the Russ ian soldiers werent fed either.
They translated from other languages books and they had in this Tecuci place  they had a huge book store that went like several  all the way  ha d to go up on ladders to  and they had translated from French and English and even Russian books and they were kind of cheap.
Yes  because they had to  because it was Co mmunism in 1919 in Hungary for a little while only and they said that no matter what  every Russian is a Communist  Jew or non-Jew.
And we saw the Katyushas running  the Russian Katyushas at us from Syria  67 -- Right. --
There were they were decisively against it  and they knew that  according to the Russian rule  whoever was taken prisoner  he was a ta traitor traitor.
After I -- the Russian liberated us  I went back and I thought that mine brother is still alive  still there.
And I took a picture of Kaiserwald and then a Russian soldier came over and he took me to the commandanture.
I was born in Kowel  spelled K - O - W - E - L on the Russian border  very close to the Russian border.
And in  theres quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war.
Well  he speaks such perfect Russian  he's just posing as a Danish journalist.
Then from Odessa we went by Russian ship to Turkey and from Turkey back to Palestine.
The excuse was that they are not trustworthy people  and they are taking to Siberia to help build the -- the Russian effort.
And the partisans gathered the leftover Germans  the leftover Russian people who wanted to turn into Germans and work for the German government and they were mean to everybody.
But Americans would have given her a Russian visa right away to come to America  because there was no quota number from Russia  but my mother wouldnt let be put that she was born in Russia  because may be a Russian.
A large portion of my book is about liberation because very little was written about it.
Only the Russian border was not use being used as an army for Germany.
First of all  we didnt know what would come in  but then Hitler made that pact with the Germans and -- Russia make a pact  and we were glad the Russian coming in because they were not such murderers.
Now there were some Russian women in our camp  and some of them may have been older  but again  not that much older.
Anyway  to escape that life and that situation  and probably the Russian draft  he fled to the United States  leaving behind a wife and one or two children.
I understand that he was drafted in a Russian army  and he was figh ting in World War I  and the first days or first week  he was taken prisoner by Germans  and he spent four years in Berlin  in a prison camp.
In fact  someone told me that in the Russian Army she was a gun loader on one of the big guns. [
When evening came -- they call it in Russian -- I will say and then translate kurina slepota.
And he said  I made arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river  the Russian Army was a little bit more organized.
As I mentioned  the Russian soldiers were helping us with bringing food and medicine to this homes  where the empty homes that we  they have places us after the German SS ran away.
If yo ur friends started to run away as much as you could toward the Russian side.
They fought with the Nazis  and as a matter of fact there were divisions of the Hungarians fighting in Russia on the Russian invasion -- the Nazi invasion of Russia.
I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is  I wasnt interested.
But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue  Polish which he spoke totally fluently.
But the main  the -- finally the main -- you know  the Russian  they discovered a trick thats -- in -- in order -- we were supplied with -- just like a bar of soap.
After the war I managed to get out of Russia  I traveled  they told us that we will go to Poland.
So  I can tell only like about this author of the book  and about Russian people  who to ld me what there was.
Russian is four  and German is five  Italian is six  Spanish is seven  and English is eight  you know.
And so we had a lot in other departments  some Russian Jews.
There is...I feel there is a must that Israel must live and also living in this country  I appreciate very much for the President of the United States and the American people that they gave us a chance...not only me and my children.
So I went to him  and I says   \ You know  I am Jewish.
One is to the Russian party  to the Russian facture  and one is -- was to the English facture.
They -- they were -- they were German or they were Polish.
till somebody came from my hometown  and told me  ﬁMark  you know  you have a brother at home.ﬂ So I wrote a lette r  and there he send me that picture  that picture  you know  with the Russian -- Russian soldier.
And I had a neighbor that a Russian soldier that lost a leg.
And so  you know but I Im in a way Im glad that I that I went to school  because I still remember a lot of Russian.
That it was 1941 41 when the Russian  when the Russians went to war with Germany so -- Then he had to be in the ghetto as well.
And in the stables  helping us  were Russians  Russian prisoners of war.
Well  that was one of my questions  is did they speak Russian as well  did they speak any Lithuanian  did they what were the number of languages  what were the languages that they spoke?
You know  the Pole  after the war after the war  th-the Russian took par-part of Lvov  and th-they give the Poles the West Germany  theyre called Farbruck there.
And Theresienstadt was very unexpected  because when Theresienstadt was liberated in late April  and the news came across  it was in the Russian zone.
So my -- my father's father  the one that you saw the pictures  the bold one  he was a widower so he came to live with us and my mother's mother who became a widow very first day and my father's sister Ryfka who with her two children came to live with us because her husband was one of the uncles that were taken to the Russian Army.
For example  one day they said [speaks Russian] Former marshal of Poland escapes to Romania .
I could understand Greek  a little bit of Hebrew  a little bit of German and somewhat more  I was able to understand but not speak fluently  Yiddish.
The next point that I really remember from th is setting that I've described to you  is what happened just as  well the Ru ssians came in first  and in front of the house  that yard that we had was an open  square area  more of a traffic circle  like you have here in Washington  the traffic circles  that you could go around in order to go into Kaunas  you had to cross over  go through the circle  cross over the bridge and then you would head into Kaunas after crossing the water that was surrounding Slobotka area  and I remember that when the Soviets came in and the Russian soldiers used to have the Russian star on top of the caps  a couple of kids managed to  that I was playing with  had some  had gotten one  and I asked him  how did you get it  he said well I went over to the Russian soldier and I asked him for it.
Trains were going east and west and north  and those were trains that the Russian armies were moving from one side to the other.
I read mostly Polish translations of French  German  Russian and American literature  as well as some Polish and Yiddish works in the original.
A Russian thing--I shall never forget--it was long...he had a hat with long ear muffs.
No  we just got want to go back to Poland .
And there was a well  you n as you know  Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 56in Stalingrad a Russian general who actually then organized troops to fight with the Russians against Hitler.
My father spoke Hungarian and then of course in school we started uh learning Yugoslav uh language  Serbian or Yugoslav  so as a kid we spoke uh three languages and then uh we had a governess in the house to...French...we learned French from a Russian tutor.
All of a sudden before that there were Poles that were ther e. The Russians came in and the Russians took over that camp and made it into a Russian military camp.
I was wearing a nice watch  that I had got for my bar mitzvah  and here I am on the tank  and the Russian officer comes in  and he says  ﬁI like your watch.
Were there people in your car  in in your wagon  who spoke Russian?
And they -- she organized here a group of people she knew  and they all went also to the rush -- toward the Russian border.
That one of the dramatic things of my father which took me many years to understand is when my...when the Russian left Lithuanian and the Germans advanced to Lithuanian.
And we were in Doaga when the Russian approaching  approaching  and approaching.
I really don't know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both.
It was a new camp there  a new hospital that they brought wounded soldiers from the Russian front.
The next day you should bring a hundred people  a hundred Jews  and I have a photo where the Jews were building the fence around the ghetto  and this reminds me a very Russian song.
So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews  the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.
So  a-after a couple days we had to be relo reloaded into the Russian train.
The other one was  I guess  either Russian Jewish or Polish Jewish or whatever.
The next day the Germans came and they knew that this Russian group  Russian partisan group did it  and they surrounded the forest  and they searched and searched  but they didn't find nobody.
Many not-well-to-do poor Jews from the East came in as refugees from the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the Viennese Jews and I was act ive in the viacom in the fight  in the fight  for ge tting elected into this Jewish community.
Whenever I would see a Russian  I would run away from him.
There was I would say about 20 % Catholics and 80% was Russian Orthodox.
So Israel will have a Jewish bomb and Russia has a Russian bomb and we start bringing in religion into politics.
We pack  and I stopped a Russian truck and they took us to a different city  me and my husband.
And Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday night  I was dancing in a nightclub with the  with the wife of a Russian colonel -- the head of the Com-- of the whole Russian Army in that area.
He says  okay  I am too  he says  but be quiet  dont tell the Russian soldier that Im -- they dont know that I am Jewish.
The Russian soldiers told us  if you were walking back  they would have shot us.
So I left  and I came to another one and th ey [indecipherable] they remind me very often where I come from  and what I keep in mind  because they knew that my papers every time  when I -- and the last time -- not -- it was not last time  before this -- before this time  I fill out the papers again  and -- and th e director of this  he was a Jewish guy  and -- but he got a Russian name  he -- by documents he was Russian.
We got to the villa  it was a German villa  and we 81 stayed there until the Germans came Thats how we were liberated - except  one of the girls among the ten was a Russian  and she said the Russians rape women  so we should not stay around  which we had no intentions of staying around  no intention.
And also to -- to -- he would tell us on the Russian front  100 000 Germans killed.
No  no  no  they didnt get any place very many people  because many people were aware what was going on because when you volunteer for the job  they know Russian front was next direction.
As a result  you lived under Russian occupation until June of 1941.
I found out later they want to get rid of me  the Russian.
I was born  I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit  but they spoke Polish only.
We were very tired  Luta was sick  and we were going together with the Russian soldiers  with Russian officers.
There was a military  a Russian military  hospital train on the next track.
While a in addition  th ey learned Polish  and knew Polish  but Yiddish was the major language.
Somebody  I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already  they said within a few hours the Russian army is going to be here.
So  we are talking still about 1940  Chernowitz was occupied un -- came under the Russian [indecipherable] and we were blocked in Bologna  we didnt know what to do.
When Hungary came in -- by the way  the population where we lived were primarily Russian.
03:16:47 He wound up in Bergen-Belsen  from Auschw itz  and I came to another place  to South German  that was the part that used to be the Russian part  the East German  Hainichen.
And the White Russian peasantry was a lot more sympathetic to Jews than Polish.
74 No  I -- I -- I -- I started -- I -- I -- I -- You went to Czech school -- -- something [indecipherable] Czech -- C zech a little  Ukrainian good  Russian good  and Hungarian good  thats three.
Bu t when we came into the forest  we made sure 24 military detachment (Russian) 25 virgin forest (Russian) 32 that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the farmers.
Did not want to take their passports so they were sent to Siberia.
He took this thing away...this German thing awa y  gave me a Russian jacket.
Polish  because I learned a little Polish while I was in Poland  and its a Slavic language  and I had a -- I think I have some talent for languages  so I caught on.
And she...she put...she was...she put herself a Red Cross then  and she was collecting those few girls that she knew and I was...my sister was there  and I had a few friends and she said that there is a very good danger because the Russian soldiers are raping the Jewish girls.
Yes  Buschi and I -- the bicycle that -- bicycles that were given to us  we -- by the Russian officer  we -- we avoided the main road s  and we found a German s -- a dead German soldier.
Well  did the so did the soldiers run away  the Soviet ones?
The Russian tanks should not be able to come through the area.

but -- but it wasnt like going to school -- But you didnt [indecipherable] -- I wasnt old enough to go to school  so I would -- obviously I had to communicate with the Russian partisans and stuff to the extent that I could.

One day in the woods they found a Russian soldier was hiding out and they stabbed him.
But I just think they should have just the way they did in the Russian Olympics.
And he was scared silly because it was in the Russian sector which in those days the city was still divided.
It was a Communist party under Russian supervision  and they were taking everybody  like not everybody.
And two  three days later  the Russian tanks came into Bucharest  because the -- Romania came out of the war by -- by politic al maneuver with the king  and the -- Antonescu was arrested  and the Romania shifted sides.
They let me though both the Poles and the Russian s. Not only this but on one corner of the bridge  they were telling the other corner  hey you there.
Of c ourse there was success  but Orlovsky at the end almost -- he got -- had a -- a Russian -- they threw a Russian dynami -- dynamite pieces.
And these words  I could hear the words in my ears to the entire way I reached th e Russian boundary and they were supposed to open the day before.
When we came to Minsk  you have to understand the German Jews basically were much softer than the Russian Jews or Polish Jews because they lived a much harder life already .
I came  I see two horses with a wagon from the Russian army  and the bike and the radio is the same I think this is like the same [indecipherable] the Jewish people had [indecipherable] my friend [indecipherable] .
End of Tape #4 38 Tape #5 07:53 So  we walked on this highway  we left Ne ustadt-Glewe and we went through the Russian  you know  he let us through.
They took guns  they were shooting at them and they were jumping on their ropes  and they were yelling in Russian  this is for my mother a nd this is for my fath er  what you did to my country to my Mother Russia.
So we managed and later on as a matter of fact we were lucky enough to uh 6 get on a Russian truck and uh they took us to his hometown.
The reason they decided at that point to try and deport the Jews from that area was because the Russian front was approaching.
And the artillery  the heavy artillery  they used to I say I ask him I knew Russian  because I was in school two years.
Did you go to a Jewish school  or just to a Polish school?
I dont know how many miles  but yes  Kovel was pretty close to the border  Russian there.
Russian soldiers jumped from a tank  a Russian tank  run to a lying asse ss guard  took off his shoes  and the assess guard had very good shoes  put them on and gave me his shoes.
It's important to speak up when there is a cause  when the Russian people worked  you know  wh en there was Iron Curtain  and we were fighting to re lease them  I was marching.
And as you know  the Russian armies had finally made a stand and started to push the Nazis back.
Difficult because I wasn't certa in that I could successfully keep up with the Russian Nadich in the drinking the vodka.
But -- and I had the love of my mother and -- and her sister and then I went to school and I remember the Russian soldiers looking over my report card and -- and saying  oh youre such a good student [Russian] means outstanding  outstanding.
This is the one who was became a prisoner of war in Russia .
But she lives here a long  long time  and her mother was Russian.
And then  when he came to the last time to tell us that the Russian are all ready in Shedlitz.
Like when I went to the airport  the Germans already were short a few because they use all the trucks on the Russian front.
We did not even know in that days that Poland...that the decision was made that Poland will be divided between Russian and Germany  but we felt that it is safer to go towa rd Russia  especially those who believed in the...in the possibilities of a socialist communist government fe lt that the haven will be found on the other side where we had...uh...believed that ...uh...after all it's 6 a communist regime  a more humanitarian regime.
So being in the army  I was trained during the during the summer and we walked to the fortificati on facing... facing the Russian coming from the northern part of Moldavia.
But I applied to the language school because I wanted to help with the Russian.
And he wrote down...in Russian everything you have to write down a statement  you know  whatever you want  so one day I wrote down I wanted to go to the army.
I'll tell you why  because it was the last house  and not too many soldiers  Germans  came that time  because they were busy with the Russian front.
And each one who applied for a job had to submit his baptismal papers and a Russian ID.
Did you see did you see the children when the Russian [indecipherable] walking with those little childrens?
And I said  ﬁThis is my sister ﬂ in Russian  ﬁRosa  who was born  and you write down -- and give me a piece of paper that she was born this day  my mother told me.ﬂ He looked at me  everybody was laughing that I  a little child 10 years old  go register my sister.
No  other studies  a few of our teachers es caped  and whoever escaped was replaced by the army teachers  Russian army teachers.
He got Was he a German Jew  or a Polish Jew?
The language that 32 we will talk will be Russian and  in part  we will talk Polish.
I went to a Russian public school for a short time  and after awh ile I read an announcement that they are looking for students for a specialized school and I signed up.
What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later  we are reading an obituary in the New York Times about the right hand of Mr. Brandt 22  who was German Prime Minister  and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war  he came back to East Germany  eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities  was in Siberia  somehow when he was released managed to get to West Germany and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt.
The hospital actually was the Russian lager  and actually it was a place where they kill people.
The whole area was under total control of the partisans   the Russian supporters.
So if they drop a group of people  so the Cossacks dont si first of all  dont speak Russian  and they dont know much about the outside world.
You are part of the Russian brigade which was fighting against Russia.
And a man got out and I sai d  ﬁThose damned Russians ﬂ only Russian s were in Vienna at that time.
And one day one my friends  and there was a general system w hich worked probably  he start to talk to me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation  what represent the German war  against become the Russian  how's our situation and start to uh convince me  I guess  we have to do something.
And 1939 I was in Polish army  I know the Russian army  and I know the German army going from the east to Wa rsaw.
And we go to the Russian commandment  and we told that we are we escaped from the camp and we want to go home.
In tent is to say that it was the Russian guard who told my father that Russian authority was prejudiced against Jews and therefore helped my father escape the convoy.)
They Yiddish  Polish  Russian  I spoke [indecipherable] in Russian  German And English.
In the morning  I heard some voices in Russian  and I I watched that  and I saw that there there  a woman came and she apparently two friends  but one stayed with a with a metal thing  you know  what they they put here put in cloth.
And then there was five more months of the war before 1945 May  before the same Russian Army reached us near Hamburg.
And in the Russian school we learned Russian history and there was no anti-Se -- anti-Semitism at all.
So I told...my husband speaks Russian; and I said to him  \ Go.
Far away from the front line and suddenly one morning we see the Russian troops are coming.
When the partisans were organized under the direct command of Moscow.
They call this place displaced person camp  DP camp in in West Germany  and there was under English occupied zone  but there was very strictly...uh we can do what we want but we can't go to Poland because it was uh Russia occupied Poland and was different government under Russian uh Russian  so many people take uh chance and go back to Poland and many of them wait in the camp for uh immigration so meantime I uh start school.
He said  \ Because the Russian Embassy is just beside the Swedish one.\
I don't remember the year when Schwartzmann or Sc hwartz-kopf  the general in Fran ce  the Russian general who had done so many pogroms in Poland and Russia.
After liberation  Germany was divided in four zoning: American zone  English zone  Fr ench zone and Russian zone.
And the Ge-- and the Russian partisan came to us and they took  they took boots  they took for the horses  whatever they need to drive  too  saddles.
Like I say  they didnt have apartments  we rented rooms  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 46 they were -- oh  I think they were about 80  even in those days  and they were ru -- Russian immigrants  spoke very little English and they hesitated in taking in a girl in the room  because  you know  werl washes her ha ir  puts bobby pins  in those days.
Because they [indecipherable] it again too  they didnt you know  was a consume  that everything the Russian made  they confisticated Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 84 ever ything too  and in the meanwhile he had for the Russian magazine  and he sold for the Russian soldiers  and you know  what He had a store for for Russian soldiers go ods.
But when they when they were encountered by him  when they felt this terrible winter  you know  and where they didnt have the supplies  because partisans  and especially in the beginning  mostly Russian partisans have cut off the supplies all the supplies line were just shattered.
It its northeast northeast part of Poland  only about 50 miles from Russian border.
And that guy  the Russian guy says  do you know who  exactly?
There was even a book ca me out r -- r -- out in Russian  its called  ﬁMiore Vihar.ﬂ Theres a Miore Vihar  a Major Vihar -- Vihar  it was [indecipherable]  that he did it  and that was ma de a film  the film was so important that it was serialized on television.
He ran away after Russian revolution to Burma  and then he crossed to India.
I didnt remember that  but she reminded me afterwards that I said  Im you know  like an in Russian I said  Im a steeron kryinka  which means that Im a devoted Ukrainian  and I ran away from her.
People were standing on the steps and there were many Russian soldiers going to Budapest.
But our partisans were a Russian [indecipherable] whatever  and and they were also German [indecipherable] .
One had a green jacket an-and black pants USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 38 and one had just civilian clothes and -- and one had an army coat and one had -- th-they -- they weren't like a -- an -- an -- an army  but then they started to speak Russian  you know and -- and th-they couldn't -- th-they were absolutely shocked.
I wore a German uniform  and four from the Russian partisans  and they gave me a submachine guns for us  and we came to the place.
Somebody said that is a thunde r  somebody said in that a war  or or the third version was that the the Russian soldiers have exercise maneuvers.
And so I learned the Russian alphabet  we -- this is -- this was a must  we had to do all this.
Uh and we uh we lived with that until finally the Russian troops came through in uh in...sometime in the spring or summer of 1944.
The Russian were not bombarding those places  they were -- they were tied up in the east there  you know  chasing the Germans.
Im Jewish.ﬂ S o  the guy says in Jewish to him  ﬁWhy didnt you tell me that befor e?ﬂ So  anyway  he was saved  but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways  trie d to - since Adrian was already there  like the Russian and him were already such frie nds  and so  he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him  but he wasnt.
Its the reason it because that time the allies  they made some agreement with the Russians  that the Russians gonna Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 15come over to Suico and they gonna divide something [indecipherable] I heard something or and and that means  the ne xt day  we will be in Russian zone  not in the American zone.
I have a guy which he came with me  he came til -- a -- a short time because the -- the Russian took us on a bus  me and him  and th -- you know  and they didnt have too much more places us to take.
But the question...they told me I will get ten years if I wouldn't have political inter...help in knowing...they also realized that I didn't know what I was talking  but mostly the political...if a Russian would ask  he wouldn't see the sun anymore because this was a no question.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
He didn't believe that and then...but he put him down and he said keep your coat  but we are here now and you will help us speaking Hungarian and Russian  so he was like  you know  helping out  translating.
So we were four of us from the locals  Surgay and another guy who was a Polish-speaking white Russian  and I and then it was Polotchik .
Why dont I ask you - you mentioned an incident about Russian POWs?
They were going  the Russian army was advancing and just shooting so that the people dont attack them.
We we wont be able to withstand their Russian a-a-a the German army.
I'll come and then I'll tell you the names of the villages or the farms where you can go on the way to Kovno  and I immediately...when he went away I immediately went to the to the to to the farm  to Maria  and I told her  Maria  I just spoke with a Russian top officer and he said here there will be big fightings and there will be the fire line.
Everybody was afraid  and all of a sudden around four o'clock  probably five o'clock  was some noise and somebody start to tell some Russian troops are uh close to our city.
Day and night we h eard this  I do not know how its called in  in Vienna it was called the Russian Organ.
I read a little bit Russian but - we knew it was very bad.
Sakharrov was still alive  so he offered the family to help because he speaks English and he speaks Russian.
Now  whether we were told they were Russians  I have no recollection o-of the I wouldnt know Russian probably  well if I you kn ow  I could guess  but when Id heard it basically.
And Dutch captain say -- say to him that we go on a transport to -- to Russia  because the war was still going on b-by -- in Warshow  inst -- the -- the -- the German -- the Russian was standing before Warshow  yeah.
Tell me that the same valiant soldiers from the Russian army  that they captured Berlin  everything  fought so gallantly against the Nazis  over two and a half million got killed  and they went like sheep to the slaughter.
But she knew German  French  Russian  Polish  Yi ddish  Hebrew and. . .
It was called in Russian  L. So he was not maybe yet seven in 24.
Well  tell us what that lesson with the Russians was  when the Russians had come The Russian was when everyb ee you see  to me  it was the first occupation  the first army  the first war in my but to the parents  it was the second  at least their second.
He -- he was very good l-looking young man  and the only place -- and they knew the Russians are co ming  and they knew that Russian will kill him because he fought with German against the Russian.
It was not anything 33 military detachment (Russian) 34 production group (Russian) 35 dragnet  round-up (Russian) 40 special  but we survived on this particular place  on an island.
They were talking about that the Russian released some papers  way after the war  maybe four or five years ago.
Now  we had heard since there were women from the Baltic sea among us th at women from th e eastern state would be sent home because the war there us over alre ady  but the German Jews would be shipped off to Siberia because they didn't really the German Jews and  you know  these soldie rs must have notified the Russian authorities  so 24 they were constantly after us.
Lithuanian  or Russian  people before Communi sts and they were parachuted into the forest in order to establish this detachment.
He was in Russia for a while and then returned to the same city.
To give us some papers do not the Russian Army do not stop us somewhere.
And I would say that same day  all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that subway station with Tommy guns machine guns in each hand and everyone everyone down in that subway tunnel started clapping.
It was close to Russian Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 66border.
And it wasnt just Jewish kids  it was a mixed -- Well  it was Jewish kids within a week after Hitler came.
So the Russians -- the Russian prisoners had more guts  more strength.
You see  we were worry about Schindler in a  during the last month of war that when the Russian will come in  we will be liberate by Russian  they di dn't ask question.
Uncle Norbert was my fathers tutor during the Russian occupation of Warsaw.
I went over to the Elbe River and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the river because the Americans were on the other side.
So finally it was my turn  I was ushered in and was in some sort of a front room  entry room or waiting room  whatever and was told to wait and then one  from -- behind it  apparently  was a real office and then one officer came and took a look at me with that star and sort of shouted something in Russian to the back and then an officer with sort of more star s and so on  who seemed to be the commander  came out.
And fortunately they were not treated nearly as badly as the Russian prisoners of war.
And then little by little  you come for yourself  it takes you in  in a big zoll and sitting over there a general and why wha-wha-wh at you what were you doing against the Russian?
I learned very fast Russian  to write in Russian and read.
We both were from Germany  and we smuggled ourselves at a Russian troop train  which was going northeast  and we got out.
But we didnt think that they can take Russia  that part  back  you know?
The baker was like a god by the Russian - you know  bread.
Under the Russian people  you are not a person  you are just like I said.
Also after invasion of the Russian on June 22  1941  I dont know exactly.
You asked me before how it was when the Russian came in.
When Polish was destroyed and occupied by the Russian  a part of the Polish Army was evacuated in Romania.
When we enquired what had happened to him because we wanted the Red Cross to come there they said theyd sent him to the Russian Front. [
Once you get into Berlin  Berlin had four zones: The Russian Zone  the French Zone  the English Zone  the American Zone.
I remember only it was in winter in January 1945 there was so because the Russian front was  it was 1945.
This is tape number three  side B. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 86 The soldier whom we met in the train  coming out of Germany  I mean af -- when the war ended  who happened to be a Jew -- a Jew in Russian uniform and who asked us on the train where it was we were planning to go to -- in Poland and we told him that were going home to Starachowice and he asked us wh at size town it was.
He had a very big position and he let me go to the office and learn the Russian typewriter.
So when we tried to smuggl e the border  my mother tried every evening to -- there were the booths  and there was a Polish soldier on this side  Russian soldier -- you know  they like -- on the border they had a booth  yes  one Polish flag and one side the Russian flag  and soldiers in their uniforms.
And one of them was the Hungarian accent  and of course we spoke Yiddish.
Anyway  th-the Russian -- the Soviets  if they didnt want them to come  they wouldnt co -- you wouldnt come.
They were a -- they were having hordes of German soldiers coming from Russian prisoners camp  and priority was for the older ones  not for born in 26.
my Russian visa in this Was this during what year was this  when you were at Alexanderplatz ?
Were sitting -- after the Russians were [indecipherable] Russian ha -- soldiers liberated us  they went through on the village  and the most of the girls -- as I said  there about 200  a few less because they passed away  went to the town to look around  but begging for food  and I think they went to see [indecipherable] later  you know  there is a big town too.
A man who speaks Russian  and who shoots 29 from 30 possible theoretically Points.
I guess my father wanted to get to Vilna or actually get close to the Russian border so if ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 necessary to escape into Russia.
Later on I learned  actually much later on  when the Communism collapsed  that not every Russian soldier was nice.
All the  the rest of the family got passports that they were capitalists  and they were banned from Lida  because Lida was too close to the 6 Jew (Russian).
Except  ventually  when the Russians start taking it over  they ask me to join the Russian army  which I said  ﬁWhy should I join the Russian army?ﬂ Ac tually they wanted join the Russian Air Force.
So when we found this jewelry and the money  we paid the Russian guards at the border to get us out and get us through into Romania from where we could go to Vienna and from there on wherever we can possibly go.
But the sentence that came out  Polish words but they came out in Russian  you understand?
And the Russian took Bornholm  and stayed there for so and so long time.
He found out that I had a cousin in Russia that was a colonel in the Army.
If you speak English and you speak German  this is it.
The Russian  how do you call  the Russian prisoners  you know  there were lot of prisoners of war from Germany that came home.
The American and the British  I don't know about the Russian soldiers were extremely nice to us in th e beginning.
My father could not get back there  because it was then in -- under Russian contro l  and U.S. and Russia  and you know  it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 78was a catastrophe  youd have to go through Moscow  and the [indecipherable] now  you dont.
So I - my -- the special mission was  when we came closer th -- because we went with the Russian front  and we were attached  hundred of us were attached to the first lines of the Russian front  because the front started offensive like I said  January the 12th  and we were attached  and we were like -- like -- not like zion officers  but we were part of the -- the -- the front f-fighters  but we didnt do the fighting  but we went with them  they had to be straightened out with the local people  with the administration  yeah.
And ther e was this young woman who spoke Russian and she also sp oke Polish.
The White Russian used to tell them things that I am ashamed to t-to say it  what what wh at they did to them .
Why is she sending the Russian books?ﬂ But all  you know  Dostoevsky  whatever.
All the furniture  everything stayed back which we have never found  needless to say  even after the Russian came in.
We also built barbed -- barriors across the road that were suppose to stop the Russian army from advancing.
Uh at the time it was about four kilometers from the Russian border.
There were a couple of former Russian prisoners of war  Jewish.
An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian  who did not know from Russian from a hole in the head.
But if your father or your grandfather was a Russian Jew or a Polish Jew  even if you change your name  even if you get to be a priest  you are still a Jew.
Yes  my father  he was studying in Russia because when he was young  the country was under the Russian the so the Russians rule  the Russian Imperial rule.
And when I arrived in the Russian Embassy in Berlin  they said  \ Look here.
And I was sitting on my desk  you know  I put the on the leg  and I said  now I saw everything  but I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 91afraid of a Russian peasant.
So  we s -- two part-partisans -- Russian partisans  they used to come in in the ghetto and be in contact with our group.
I know how during the German occupation  the German and th -- cannot win the partisan  and the -- the Russian  which is a much stronger  much [indecipherable] would try -- try fighting with the Afghanistan and they go away from the Washingt -- Afghanistan they cannot win this  and th-the problem is he -- not simply -- not easy.
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
When the Russian or the Hungarian soldiers were shooting at us  we had to lie down in the snow with our dark winter clothing in order not to be seen.
And So you say the stores emptied out  is th at what youre saying  when the Russian army came in?
So they told them they could register and go with the Russi an Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Army--to fight against the Germans.
Then what they did  they had this arrangement with the trucks would take us out just past the frontier  between Germany and Poland  and they would bribe the guards with some vodka  and they allowed -- there was a quiet agreement that the Jews were going to be allowed to leave Poland  if they wanted to.
And life was quite good 'til one day they come  a y ear later; and they decided they want to draft me in the Russian Army.
It was not -- i-it was not the Russian zone of Germany  this was Poland.
And so you were in the Polish army when you were in Russia  also?
So  they didn't leave so she sent away her sister  the 18 year old with white blonde hair but me and my brother my brother is in Israel now  he's younger  four years  than me and a sister two years younger she sent us away to the Russian side  so the border we couldn't go through so at night we went through because it was already closed  the border.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
To the German she spoke German  to me she spoke Polish.
The White Russian popul ation was different  a quieter people than the Polacks.
And then after my parents got used to my marrying something of Russian background  and they loved Art because he's a wonderful man.
Then it was belonged to Poland  but the Russian invaded this part of the country  of Polish country.
Every night we would stop in a village  Russian village  of the people that were also deportees from the first from the revolution Really?
When I came hom e  I told my father that I wanted to go to Russia.
Here hes giving -- this is such hypocritical -- hes giving us a lecture that we should help the Russian Jews -- being je -- make them Jews  and -- and -- and -- and 20 or 30 years ago he refused me to jo in his temple.
They were letting just a trickle in and I'm sure if we would have waited for the Polish quota  I don't know when we would have gotten to the United States  but because my mother knew  you know that we were so close to Russia and convinced the Council that uh she actually was born on the Russian side  that uh we were able to come on the Russian quota which was open because very few people immigrated from Russia to the United States over quite a number of years  and uh so we came in November 1947.
So my husband  who again  had a lot of freedom in Magdeburg and the camp  knew some Russian women who were wo rking in polter too.
So he looked at me and said  how come you speak such good German?
I mean  was not far  about 50 kilometers from e from the Russian border.
Yeah  the all the time was Russians to Krasnovodsk   and after Krasnovodsk   was Russian all the time.
Well  when it was -- when I saw the Russian soldiers  it was a moment of joy that I was liberated.
She just came back from taking them clothes and food  and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about  they were talking in Russian  and I understood Russian.
They had taken out the Jewish and Russian prisoners to Ninth Fort and they dig...dug trenches.
What happened to the Russian guy fr om then on  we dont know  he disappeared.
So they had their Polish friends  which they communicate only in Polish.
However  not like Russia  like deeper Russia  this was like European Russian ; like most of the people there were Russian.
Even I met already Russian partisans  already I thought they have certain salvation  there's no end  there's no help for nobody.
They said that by coincidence  a sheer coincidence  there was a Russian officer who was an aid to the Russian commanding general in Vienna.
In Russian language it was called bougadena   where they used to house poor people  you know.
There they were changing the tracks from European width to the Russian.
That was a Scandinavian country and yes  thats about it and yeah  he was in control of just about everything and he was now starting his Russian front.
Here is you got to know is a Russian system  a communist system.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 15 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: closing gates and the rest of the Germans who were there eh six hundred and forty or five hundred and forty I did--I really don't remember.
There was a man sitting in a middle and a big  Russian officer overcoat and a big hat  with a face  with a face theres a little Russian saying  ﬁMorda kirpicha prosit.15ﬂ ﬁA face that asks for a brick.ﬂ He had a face like that.
And there was we were in a camp where where Russian men  workers  working only in the summer [indecipherable] and so on.
So I can say that I am an assimilated Jew in the Russian culture.
That man that was goi ng to report her  got killed by the first Russian bombs when the Russians started to invade Budapest.
Well  as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through  were driven through the town and the treatment of them.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
There were the British line  there were the Russian line you name it  there was somebody.
For many Slovaks they replaced the German occupation with a Russian occupation.
I am finished with the Russian they say you are not  you don't want to go to Russia.
Well  I spoke Polish  and of course  my 8 parents spoke Yiddish.
But at that time did you understand Russian -- at the -- before -- When I wa -- we were liberated -- You -- you -- you -- -- an-and we lived -- and we moved back into town  I learned Russian.
I said  thats good ta for him to stay here because the Russian are close.
And our camp was Minziret in direction to Breslitoks  to the former Russian (?).
What my mother did when the Russian occupied us  she says  oh  we finally have something  we staying here  what they can do to us?
You know  unnecessarily sending people into the Russian zone  just to -- to put an F on the wall somewhere  which mean frimins -- Freiheit  freedom.
indecipherable] town and there we were working  following our yes  thats thats difficult  that [indecipherable] for were coming very many Slovaks who were work who work in the [indecipherable] on the side of the of of the front  yes  and went over the front to the Russian.
Only two of them applied for German  because on e was a daughter of a Russian officer who was in Germany.
02:18:46 So it was a Russian partisan that warned you and saved you in that case?
So  a nd I remember  they were very cute old men  we had no  I mean we had sign language  we didnt speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother  of all these su fferings  had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept.
We went they shouldnt catch us  the Russian  because if they catch you  they were controlled with Russian  [indecipherable] Russian they get you  then like they said  they take you to Siberia.
In Lithuania  oh  this one let's  drink and  you know  opened up a bottle of some vodka.
This was been when the bombardment started by different uh units American and Russian and so on  they would uh join the group  our group  in civilian clothes  and pretend to be one of the refugees.
And I remember that once we had lost the way and a truck came to wards us and the Russian asked the truck  we had lost the way  how to go and the Russian told him.
And Russian people excuse me  the olde r people  when they made sure that nobody is listening  they would made the si gn of cross  and tell us how they believe in God  and how they feel sorry for us.
I still felt that I could withstand the ordeal s and whatever took place because they were talking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were moving in closer and closer.
When it came to my turn  he asked -- the questions were asked by him in Russian  by th e way and the civilian next to him was an interpreter  then he gave it to me in German.
And one of the big shocks  when I finally got into this Hopkins group  was the split between the Russian Polish group and the German group.
Our  uh  German the  the Hauptscharfuhrer who was  uh  the after a while he became very mean and we  we heard rumors that his son was killed at the Russian front and he took his frustrations out on the Jews of course and  uh  but we were  we were -uh  in the midst of all our troubles we were trying to cheer each other up.
The Embassy people were already on and suddenly the Russian said  ﬁNyet  20ﬂ for the other eight and we couldn't go.
Not very well  but they did speak Yiddish and German and sometimes fall into Polish  but not very often.
Course my Russian friend liked the dog so much  he said  ﬁStepka  get another one.
And finally I walked all day I suppose  because I remember about one and half or two kilometers you know and came to this artillery position this Russian artillery position  and this guy  and this Russian saw me the yellow star  yellow armband.
Not not so much from the White Russian  but from the Polacks it was terrible.
World War II began  of course  with Germany and Russia invading Poland until September 1939.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings TAMAR LAZERSON ROSTOWSKI pg 6 Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ever.
So anti-Semitism was  amongst the Russian soldiers was quite predominant and at that point I was very scared because I was small  I c ouldn't really do a whol e lot about it and the soldiers were drunk  and they carried on and I was really afraid for her life and mine too at that point.
Maybe they thought they are not ready  that they arent going to accomplish too much  that the Russians are at that time already in Poland and will be in Warsaw in a mo nth or two  and at that point they will -- they 39 will stage an uprising and -- and join the Russian ar my.
You said they were Polish  but those sound like very Lithuanian names.
There was this other case that a Russian woman run into our house  this little house that we had.
They were starved to death and worked to death  thos e Russian prisoners of war.
She is sick  shes just had a baby.ﬂ ﬁOh  you dont tell a -- a Russian soldier what he [indecipherable].
While he was there  with the Russian system  with the Communists  while he was sitting that he went out of his way...he took us in  you know  it was a line...people stay there three days...he took us in because me and my father  without the line  without waiting  two times a day.
Okay  now tell me a little bit more about the Russian occupation.
They had about 4000 Russian prisoners and they still celebrate it or celebrated that.
They were always mixed  a few Jews in the Russian partisans  thats where Itka was.
But everybody in town knew that something terrible was going to happen  because a few months before  there were a lot of people from Silesia running to the Russian borders  and wa and that was even before the war  before 1941  and there were some peopl e that stayed with us in our house  because any you have to offer hospitality to any strangers that c-come through the town.
So  when I came to the Russian army  I found people who speak almost so well  how I am speaking Russian.
So  until the until the Germans unearthed Unearthed that Katyn Katyn and they announce it  America  and England said it was done by the Germans  and Stalin [indecipherable] the exploitation  and he had Polish Jewish fellow who was a general  what was his and he formed communist army in Poland   and that was another army over ther e. And they went all the way to Berlin  too  with Russian army.
And  as I said preceding this here chapter  while I was speaking of the attack that we had on the Russian and that there came back reinstalled a new now garrison in the Russian.
That picture where you see my baby sister and me and my mother  that was where we spent the whole Russian occupation.
But because she's Russian  and the people are Russian  so she also bring food to them and...and befriended them you know.
So the English guy said  ﬁOh  youre going to bring some of ours.ﬂ He says  ﬁYes.ﬂ He says  ﬁRemember  dont speak German -- er  Russian  when you go through the Russian post.ﬂ So since -- after all  we had experience for five years how to fib and do certain things.
I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.
And then they retreated because Russians were supposed to  according to Molotov-Ribbentrop   Biaystok was supposed to be in Russian.
I was liberated by the Russian  and I been in a hospital  in Russian hospital.
I wa -- I was fluently -- I na -- I was speaking fluently Russian bu -- and was reading Russian newspapers.
There was a Russian man that said to my father  this Russian.
And so  from we were at Shpital on the Russian line  and we were we furnished guard duty fo at [indecipherable] Goering and Hitler and all had the paintings and all 26 of the beautiful things  artwork that was done  but I never got to go inside until 25 years after that  the wife and I went back and I got to go inside of the Neuschwateine castle there.
Well  according to the latest arrangements  Przemy l is almost at the border  the Polish-Russian border  because Lvov has become a Russian city  its not Polish any more.
Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 37 I have to learn Russian language in school.
He told the Russian captain the story and one day we took a truck with soldiers and went to arrest this farmer.
We heard that the Russian czars were saying they were Christians  tried to compel youth...Jews to become Christians.
The old Bulgarian gratefulness to the Russian people for their liberation from the Turks back in 1878 is a thread that really passes through Bulgarian history.
We were...on our...we were traveling with this...with this buggy  and the Russian...the Russian took us on our horse  so we were actually walking and we stopped in a house.
Before the war  it was a Polish city  belonged to Poland.
So  ﬁFrom where are you?ﬂ I said  ﬁFrom Saint Swabof  from where are you?ﬂ He said  ﬁI am from Krakow.ﬂ I said  ﬁKrakow  we had many refugees during th e Russian occupation  and one of them I befriended was in my Jewish gimnasium  by the name Oskar Margolies.ﬂ Lo and behold  this Oskar Margolies was his first cousin.
He was a white Russian and he was running away from the Communist  and when I met her in Rome  her parents were with her in Rome and how they got out of Rome  because during the war  you know  as it was -- Italy was one of the axis members.
Then when the war broke out...the Russians  when they went in  so they took us from this camp and they sent us a camp a few miles away from from there because they brought in the Russian war uh PL... No.
The only general in the Russian army  a four-star general  so the wife had a daughter  again my age  and I start...they took me in.
But when the Russians  when the German invaded  he went with the Russian back to Russia and there he joined the Polish Army  which was orga nized there by the Poles after their agreement  the Polish agreement in exile with the Russians  which allowed them to organize their Army  which was affiliated to the Russian Army.
Then  the Polish armies became alive  too and so on  and there were the Polish armies from the Russian territory  the Polish officers were from the Russian ar my  and is all kind of thing.
They establish a governor who work American governor and the Russian governor altogether  and they establish peace and harmony  whatever it is.
Everybody was learning Russian in Sweden--it was the only country there  it was the only country there  and it looked like the Russians will run them over any moment.
No  no  she was Jewish and she -- a lot of people did -- Russian?
With -- you ste pped out from the basin  and they gave us a Russian military [indecipherable] uniforms  summer uniforms  summer  with under -- long underwear  Russian military -- a little girl  and a -- a -- a shirt  an unde rshirt  and then we had to take care the pants wouldnt fell down  so we had to bind them somehow here and so and turn and turn and turn and fix up.
Even after the war  you know  was nothing that as was the Russian zone  they traded us we got liberated from the American  and t hats when they found the papers  we were ready for transport.
Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong  th e camp had a big bell in the middle of this field  and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell saying  ﬁYou're free.ﬂ Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28  1995 Page 10 In what language?
Even though my first language was Russian -- well  as you know  we had a very diverse family with my parents being born in the Ukraine and my siblings in Persia and I was born in Belgium.
The Russian at the time would keep quiet because he did not speak Polish.
If he was born in Poland or not  I don't know.
And he wrote hes ashamed being a Russian  that th ey did not allow to put up m-monuments in these places  so they did allow  finally they did allow.
I took two ŠŠ there was a lot of Jewish Russian soldiers.
What happened is that he asked my father  what do you plan to do with my sister -- >> Bill Benson: The uncle did  who had taken care of the Russian.
But we came  we came near near to the Russian we start to scream: Yivrei  Jewi sh.
And in the front  approaching them from the fr -- opposite side was a army truck  a Russian army truck  and the driver was probably drunk  and Socha saw this and he s-start to pedal much faster  that he came in front of his daughter  and in the last moment the -- th-the truck hit him and not his daughter.
Some dropped dead but most of them 95 Crook from Rostov (Russian) 96 I walked in pockets (Russian) 97 Runner (German) 58 were killed by the Kapo.
And then came a Russian -- Russian soldiers  you know  on -- on -- on trucks  they stopped  and they asked us  they said wh at -- who are you?
But somebody was always the Russian soldiers because there was no other vehicle on the road.
The next thing  it was a matter of I don't know -- the next thing  we hear bagging on our barn doors and Russian spoken.
And in order to to get back in into Poland after the we welma when the Russian revolution started  they had to f get her a false Polish birth certificate.
The Russian invited the press because they wanted to show theyre open  you know  and This was organized through the the World Jewish Congress?
So uh this is all Russian Fortresses where the under the Czar they built it for military purposes.
Yes  I was 20 years old at the time  yes  I and there was one woman  as I say  and she spoke a little Russian.
And beside that  in Banska Bystrica was the first actually Czechoslovak socalled Czechoslovak government in exile  and many high ranking officials came from London   and then the Russian started to drop munition and weapons from the air  first from the air and then even many times they landed in Banska Bystrica   there touch outside from Banska Bystrica   or they brought a we-weapon the Russian  or [indecipherable] for the uprising.
He came there and they surround   they were looking for people they did not have White Russian passports.
With Germany and Russian Red army was totally destroyed  which is invading not only Poland  but invading very weak German.
The people were willing to go into Polish army  soldiers  of course  you know  because they prefer that then something else.
There was an or der by the Russian government to take all these railroad people that were working  hundreds  maybe thousands that were all around Russia  around Moscow  excuse me  to ship them  and they were getting ready in Stalingrad and this must  I dont remember the time.
Now  during the Russian occupation  t hough  your father isnt earning a lot of money  really.

Russian -- Actually  the manager went to Vienna  to the Gestapo  he wanted to keep us.
So when the Russian gave me the [indecipherable] maybe this was psychol ogical  I always felt that might as well leave.
The beginning of World War I  which st ared on September the -- well  actually  my father was a Russian.
Also because of the three people that I told you that had escaped our ghetto  word came that the underground was being formed  that the Russian prisoners of war that escaped and a few Jews who managed to escape had banded together and became a resistance.
I lost my job  because start already the Russian immigration and they not keep open the jobs.
This applied -- there was a very high percentage of Jewish population  but also non-Jews lived there.
Was he in the Russian Army or was he in the German Army?
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
So Russian prisoners were there   cut the barbed wire and we went and I went with them.
They and they would ope n everything  and you know  ward its called wardrobe  I think Yeah  a wardrobe Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 48 inste because not not a closet  and Mother had dresses there  and then  you know  we were not exactly rich  but I since Mother didnt know this is the story  Mother didnt know Russian  when they said to the wi portnikha   my mother thought that portnikha means you belong to some party  and my mother was trying to Mother said no  no  I don t belong to any party.
They had all kinds of preparations  invited us to the Senate building  gave a coup le parties  you know  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 4 cocktail parties  where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals.
But a commander in Russia  a Russian commander  a Russian partisan  he knew that we are staying there.
Oh  a couple couple men that were fl uent in Russian and whatever  they wrote they took piece of paper  they wrote similar format  our names  and we could we could buy or they could buy bread.
speaks Russian here] A Russian folk song  the -- the Volga -- the Volga boatman song  some partisan songs.
In Russia ﬂ he says  ﬁthe government dictates what the people should do  and in Poland  the gover -- the people dictate  not the ﬂ -- which we all almost laughed  they were under Russian regime  and -- but we felt  how can they even say that  not being afraid to say it  but they probably felt nobodys going to go tell the Russians what they said.
They had a machine gun and this crazy \ Batko\  stood in the middle of the road with his uh PTS  which is this this Russian uh automatic with the seventeen...it looks like gangster...it's a knock-off of a Al Ca pone gun.
Some people came in injured who reported that just a couple of blocks from us there were already Russian soldiers so it was that  that  that tension that kept me from doi ng anything else except just waiting for that final onslaught when I can see that our area is liberated.
So anyway  I decided to escape  I -- I didnt have money enough  I gave him my watch -- to the peasant  and for this he took me in a rowboat over the river  and we somehow were able to omit  you know  the border patrols  the Russian and German border patrol  and I took a train back to Warsaw.
And I was down there  and you had t o have per you know in the Russian zone  you know how it is under the Russian s?
It was the Russian actually  at that time it was the Russian German border.
And somehow we knew that was a family Russian family Dynin in Russia  my father was there  you know.
The next day came out an oldŠbrought a little desk and started to make a list of people and the names and so on  and I saw right awayŠI knew Russian.
Yeah  that that part was Ger-German  but after the war  they became Polish.
Because  when you are drafted into the Russian army  your career lasted 25 years  so all your life  basically.
And while we sing th eir praises  we also sing the praises of the great Russian nation.
Already 19th of June he had the Russian passport -- passp ort  and not passport but papers.
And when th e Russian people used to get cards  card system.
I mean  the Poles had to fight in th-those armies  that were either Russian  German or Austrian.
Theres a different accent if youre a Russian Jew or Lithuanian Jew.
And he -- in Pinsk  pe ople  they spoke with Russian accent  with this different accent.
And again they told her [speaks Russian] cannot be a nurse  because theyre going in to cure patients.
His family got completely destroyed and he says  and I remember it like the day he was  I was fascinated with what he had to say  he said that one particular night he got drunk  he was a commander of a unit  and he started crying and he said when he stopped crying he said  let's go for yaziks  that's a Russian word for tongues  and they attacked a German outpost and cut everybody's tongue out.
We thought that maybe  because she was so clos e to the territory that it was eventually occupied by the Russians you know  in 1939  when Poland was divided between the German occupants and the Russian occupants but we couldnt find her.
And then they was smuggling sugar  so while we we re working with them and the Russian said they got long bags with sugar.
First with the Russian occupation because the Soviets considered us \ bourgeois\  I guess is the word in French and we did not have the -- the same type of life that we had.
And one girl was very smart and took couple bottles of drinks  I would have never thought of it  which was very helpful to us because right after the Germans liberated the town  two days later it became the Russian 36 zone  and the Russian soldiers were totally ungentlemen-like.
you have Kaluszyn  you have Wegrow  you have S   you have more to the Russian side  to the east.
But the way it was  there was a Czech part  Slovakia  which the language was slightly different than the Czechs but considered themselves a separate people.
And I will say the Russian incidentally  they treated me well  and treated my brother well after they liberated Berlin.
She became hysterical a nd she started to scr eam  so the Russian took a candle  put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water.
Th ey were -- the Radom ghetto was eli -- of course  as I told you before  all -- with the Russian offensive coming from the east  all these camps w -- and ghettos and whatever  were being shipped westward.
So he said ﬁno.ﬂ He was speaking very nicely Russian and speaks beautiful Polish.
But they were very scared of being caught by the Russian Army   the guards.
Like a loudspeaker or [indecipherable] And a loudspeaker that we heard that our armies did this  th ey -- they killed German  they occupied this city  in Russian.
speaks Russian 164 here] The attached wife of Mr. Glassman sits in the first row  and my wife sits in second row.
I went with the Russian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that still had anything  I went with them.
And I do remember very  very  very clearly that it was Christmas morning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood.
And that was a Russian I think Russian officer  but an anyway  is Russian.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 11 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Tuesday afternoon  the city was occupied by the German army already.
As a matter of fact  we liked it better to be under Russian s than the Poles  because the Poles were anti-Semitic.
So the first half a hour after the outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might  the Lithuanian fascists -- they called themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists   I don't know exactly -- the very same organization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities  they were within one half an hour in uniforms.
And he had a partner because his diploma– I have still his Russian diploma  was not certificated  so he had an American partner.
From that time and I talked with German people and they told  we dont like Russian government but we like Russian people here they told me.
And there was a young man that I knew that I really knew yet from the Russian occupation because he went to the same school that I did  but he was older.
And a pa -- and Polish  I went to the Polish school .
At that time we did not know what was happening to them  but they were chased through certain 01:15:30 sections of town into the forest  a place called Rumbola and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large graves  mass graves  and when the people got there they were told to undress  put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile  clothing in another pile  driven to the edges of this mass grave  and machine-gunned.
When this Russian soldier arrived  we thought we are freed  but it wasn't like that.
No  that was u Soviet Union   and of Ukraine   yeah.
So  and I thought myself  yeah  six oclock  but I heard the ger Russian can be here in an hour or in a day.
Yeah  okay  th-that we finally got a couple of the two two civilians came in one evening and they to ld us that if you wanted to be smuggle across the border  across the Russian border not crush Au-Austrian Russian border  you will have to pay so much money.
So there were these...their homes  and the Russian soldiers took us in and gave us these homes to stay in until we are recuperated a little bit.
First of all  we lived in Courla nd  which was once upon a time German where you had the German and also subsequently the Russian aristocracy congregating over there.
But then I was taken by a Russian soldier to meet Leo Baeck  who was in charge of the Jewish community.
So another meeting takes place and the idea now is to make a deal with the communists  who also have an army running under the Soviet comman d from the east  and say we are going to make this join and in order to cooperate w ith the with the uh Soviets we are going to put the communists in charge and so late in Ma y a meeting is held where the communists are going to go Kiev where the headquarters of the uh Russian army is headed by a man by the name of Krushchev  Nikita Krushchev [ NB: at this time  acting as Commissar of the Soviet partisans]  and the timing of the Ru ssian attacking is the mountain pass and the communist leadership now of the Slovak underground will be coordinated so we don't have a situation like in Poland.
We were supposed to speak only Russian so in case we passed some places where they could recognize.
Russian Jews was hoping a -- the Red Army will come back  and viddle will maybe save them.
Well  the Russian Army came close  took over just about all of Poland.
But in the Dead March  when the Russian was behind  we have to run together with the Germans.
But the Russian and Polish  of course  he knew full of fluently from his from his days in the school.
What -- What -- What was the situation  who else was -- was it just Russian soldiers in the camp now  or was -- were there others as well?
So I said  ﬁHow did you know that I speak Polish and that I speak Polish well?ﬂ He says  ﬁI hear you talk to your friends on the subway.
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 47 Yeah.
My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got married.
He ran away from Russian revolution  you know  because you know  they have been kind of aristocrats  etcetera.
I -- I talked to all the Russian soldiers there  and some of them were Jewish.
>> Bill Benson: What did the Russian s do when they liberated you?
And today came a day they found us and they sent  during the occupation of Russian  they sent us sometimes [indecipherable] some fruits from inta Israel.
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 84 Stu in school we were learning Russian in school  yes.
Right after the war broke out before the Germans came in yet to our hometown  we were trying to go to Warsaw.
Russian army  with the Polish army  which wa s fighting with Russian army.
It's not that bad  this is better than being on the Russian front  so just behave and you'll get out.
And it was... You had that one... They... One thing  they took away the Russian uniforms and they gave us one dress.
That's what the Russians did  they used to conscript the men i nto the Russian army  and you were 20 years in this kind of prison.
I tried not to speak Russian at all  to understand English.
We said oh  they are coming  they are coming to murder us  and then we heard Russian language and this was the fighting unit.
We went on the way to...we went on the way to the Russian border.
And then I went back and I forgot  either the same day or the next day  all four of us went there and met Major Shike ag ain and he award us a piece of paper in Russian.
When we didn't want him to get in the hands of the Russian because they will not have any mercy on anybody  and German particular when they fi-find out that he was the owner of the factory who was using the slave labor  so we decide that we will prepare getaway car for him and his group--his wife and his friends and who was there  what he wants to take with him  and we would assign a group of our people will protect him and take him out from the camp  and five minutes after 12  12 o clock midnight  on the  on the day of uh May the 8th  you know  between May 7  May 8.
the German army swept through the Baltic states  within eight days occupied the Baltic states and there was very little time to make up one's mind whether to stay behind or to leave with the retreating Russian army.
Well  da -- that was at -- when I still was in Auschwitz  at the end of ‚44 and ‚45  that was when things started to get rough in Auschwitz and the Russian army came and they were so -- sort of fi-figuring on liquidating Auschwitz.
So I describe how the gate opened  how we shuffled out  how we saw the Russian soldiers  how we ran up to them saying  oh  like messiah was here.
It didnt say  for example  if somebody was Orthodox  were they Greek Orthodox  Russian Orthodox  Jewish Orthodox  ﬁA ha!ﬂ I thought.
There was -- were one or two of Russians  Georgian Russians or Russian Georgians  who  who had been incorporated into the German army after the Germans entered Russia  took them captive.
But then  you know  once we left there  w-we ca -- first we came accidentally into the Russian line.
And th en they were almost a year -- yeah  then the Lithuanian were -- they started learning Lithuanian -- the Lithuanian language at school  and -- another language.
The Russian school did not enjoy any special privileges and the Polish school did.
There were Russian girls  and Polish girls  because this was really such along way out of Auschwitz  and out of all these selections  that the group was extremely mixed.
But they didn't know that in American law your nationality where you were born and not what passport you have so these two were born in Odessa and my mother was married to a Russian.
Do you -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 48 CE: We were at the farmer and -- matter of fact  a day before the Russian came  is -- is the children -- not the children -- SE: No  d-day before the Russian came  there was some birds and they flying up where we were hidden.
They used to have the Russian Hebrew congregation used to have something one night a week where all the German Jews  somebody had organized them to come together  they tell each other wha how they got a job here  how they got a job there.
I mean  I was from Europe  I was Jewish  I spoke Yiddish  and that was it.
There were also ladies who walked down the street with strings of bagels  shouting [speaks Russian] Thats in Russian.
That will be a good way for us to talk.ﬂ And he involved me a nd it was decided that because my father was a policeman this house wasnt likely to be sear ched  so under my mattre ss there was some old Russian magnum (?)
So uh the situation was tough  and many non -Jewish people took out many special fascist organization  took advantage  took all the Jewish business  all the Jewish factory  all the big Jewish house  or small Jewish houses  so the only hope of the Jewish people was to  to get out of the war and we know that there be USHMM Archives RG -50.030*0151 9 or due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our territory or to the Russian army  start the offensive about the Germans over there.
But -- but -- but before that  were you still -- Oh  I was in a Russian -- I -- I mean a German lotsarett  which is like a -- a field hospital for soldiers  which the Russians took over after they liberated this area  and made it into a Russian hospital  and took in some refugees that were sick  and I stayed there for approximately six weeks.
So we realized we were now in the same town as we were during the Russian occupation.
I saw Goering  Keitel  everybody and when I saw on television the things I was looking if I can see my brother-in-law there  because he had good connections with Redenko   which it was the Russian prosecutor.
Then  my father befriended this waiter and told him we are going to Odessa  which is the Russian city on the Black Sea.
There was the president of the camp  people were in charge of cultural affairs  they started to have  some people started to come uh that were in hiding or in the Russian occupied areas  and they had some little children  schools were organized and uh  different organizations  uh-uh  Zionist organizations.
The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war  so they brought them into concentration camp and never gave them any food.
it became part of Polish  because [indecipherable] I cant re-recall how many miles yet to the Russian border  because it  you know  was se veral hundreds of miles to the Russian border  so it was still well in well in Poland.
Russian weapon  I had the Russian nagant  and Russian nagant  you could bury it in the mud  pull it out and it would not malfunction.
Although my parents would have a tendency natura lly so -- also to -- occasionally to fall back into Russian  but -- but Yiddish was -- Yiddish was really the language of that -- of the population.
So the two of us were with a different linguist and the sixth hour was with the linguist.
The s y-youre not allowed to be taught in Polish  schools were taught in Russian.
So  sadly enough  I was brought up in the German language and German wa s the language  but certainly I spoke Polish later and  with my girlfriends it was always Polish.
But when the -- the organizations made -- were making plans to get us ont o a train to go to Grodno on the Russian border and --.
Later  with the Russian -- in the beginning  they were fighting together with the Russian  the Bielskis.
There was an American  a Russian and I was sent from the Polish government.
So  I stayed another night at the household of that woman  and the next morning I got into his office and he said  okay  put me at his desk  wrote the Russian alphabet out for me and says you learn Russian and in the meantime I'll give you a salary.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings TAMAR LAZERSON ROSTOWSKI pg 5 Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: TAMAR READINGS (This is take 31  roll 89 marker) TL: (Russian????
And the -- and the Russian accepted them in the beginning  but there was such a flood later on  there was a lot of -- came -- came over with a flood  so the Russians sent them away up sisib you know  was too many  they send them to ser -- to -- to -- not to Siberia  but you know yur  theres a Azerba-Azerbaijan in Russia  they try to make -- now under the Russian  this was under Stalin  tried to make a Jewish re-re-repull like a Jewish state in Azerbaijan  you had the Jews there.
And I get there and she kind of laughs and I look to go to the Russian kitchen and it says  all food has been given out  its all done.
Since all the applicants for permission to go home were not Poles -- they were Russian and Ukrainian  and all  all other people and all nationalities.
They were fighting  but nobody even mentioned them because this was a Russian partisan.
Some people came in injured who reported that just a couple of blocks from us there were already Russian soldiers so it was that  that  that tension that kept me from doing anything else except just waiting for that final onslaught when I can see that our area is liberated.
Seems like it was terrible there  because the Russian soldiers...uh soldiers practiced cannibalism.
When I got to work  I used to [indecipherable] a Polack or White Russian  my shirt or pants and or shoes  when he get some  to make something for soup.
You were special because your father got a year long trial  and afterwards  he wasnt shot by a Russian in the war  or by a French  or an English  but he was hanged  so that was special.
We should have nothing to do with funding from the allies  or somebody said that we -- the Russian are sending tons of money for the -- for the Communist  for the propaganda  for everything.
I never forget that day  because even though the -- the Russian front was on the east side of the Oda river  which runs north-south and about 50 to 60 miles east of Berlin  so it was pretty far away  but the artillery barrage was such that the ground under Berlin  under the city  was rumbling and slightly shaking.
And he told us right away that there is a truck going to be available if we want we want to go  but we were so confused  and everybody we saw masses of soldiers  Russian soldiers running from one place to the other one.
I am fluent in this lang and I am fluent in Russian.
They both went through high school  which was no t a very common thing in those days in -- in Russian.
And for eight months it was a fantastic experience to this day for me  because she was a first rate teacher  she was the wife of a white Russian diplomat of the League of Nations  they were in -- after 1917 they were in  you know  from -- from Russia.
And it wa -- it was from this camp  which happened to be between the German and the Russian front -- we were in between -- that I escaped into the Russian side and to Poland.
When you refer to the partisans  are you talking about Russian partisans  Lithuanian partisans  Jewish partisans?
And when we went back the second time  I went in and went into the headquarters and the Russian major who had been a prisoner in the camp.
We had a four room apartment and that was still in the...in the Russian time.
There were Jews from all over  from Poland -- I met a young little girl my age in school who did not speak a word of Yiddish.
Well  thats what th -- worry we -- we reached the point -- Well -- -- as the -- -- as the Russians -- -- the Russian was approaching  we fear -- the fear thermometer  Id say.
Quote  He told stories of partisans who roamed the mountains and of Jews and the Russian and Romanian armies.
But it didnt last long  because only after two weeks  Russian came.
I know there was also a lot of Russian influence too  you know.
Russian and Jew so you were able to study in Yiddish  or in In Yiddish and Russian  yeah   they were Jewish teachers.
Well  lets face it  there were were some really Ukrainians didnt like the Poles there.
They were Polish -- not Polish  but German partisan German -- Russian partisans.
We had a base  and they came to Chiel and they told him they said they will kill all the children 38 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) 39 Jumpers (Polish) 44 and women.
This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar .
We spoke basically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something  my sister and I would go get furious about that  and she would speak Russian or French to each other.
>> Susan Snyder: Did you weigh which was better  Russian vers us your -- >> Halina Peabody: We had no choice.
And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in  they took my scarf off my head  and they gave me a bottle with medicine  and they send me out in the front room  and turn on the light  and the Russians  as drunk as they were  they start running  because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already  but still looked like a musselwoman  you know  sick with the salve on my head.
The first thing the Russian came in they said  if you people dont behave  we send you to Siberia .
And we came to a little German house  and an old person  maybe for 90 was along -- around  and the officer  the Russian officer came  ﬁOpen your house and let the people in.
Russian ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 officer woke me up  rushed me off with a little water  put me back to the back  and there was only 12 people.
He says  just go over and tell him  [Russian spoken here]  which means  hello friend  give me a marking  or your emblem  and those were my first Russian words I learned.
By her it was more in home because it was a cellar  and they were talking Russian and this was the partisans and they took the older boy away  and this week was a terrific day because the boy came from church.
We already liberated  we are in the -- still in the woods  but we had to stake you know  and 66 join -- thats for our mission is to help the Russian army to disarm and to da -- day -- you know  and to -- to -- there -- it was a disarray.
Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the Russian front.
I used to call him uncle and Frieda  and uh he worked  you know  and this was already in the Russian  because the Russian was on that part of Poland.
And as far as me as a child is concerned  I did play with chi Russian children  you know.
And since it was an open community that we lived  and I was going to school  and there were also Russian propaganda  and they were telling about concentration camps  I knew a bout Auschwitz  Dachau -- Really? --
One of the most the things I remember most distinctly  and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming interested in history and politics and so on  cause I remember when when the German Russian non-aggression pact was signed  I prin I announced that this means ya war in Europe .
And like if the mother would wouldnt want you send the child to school  Russian school  then she will be arrested and put there.
Then I decided that because I didn't care for what I was doing  checking on products  on the pharmaceutical products  but because I could speak Russian  even though I could not read nor write  I would be a better help to the government during the Cold War.
So did you speak Russian all through your childhood  as well as Yiddish and Hebrew?
She knew Russian because she was from Kovel (Ukraine) (394)  a nd she spoke Russian very well.
In the morning of the holiday a Russian guy came before we came and said  \ Go to work \  and we had to work.
So when you were I I I I learn so good that some people  they didnt know that I am Polish  or or Russian.
So we got out and we saw the Russian people right there.
American prisoners and Russian prisoners and Polish prisoners-of-war; they had it a little easier  a little better.
But Georgine was shipped to a Russian camp from Auschwitz .
Over was over there  Majdanek ... The army  th e Russian army went to the... to Warsaw.
I decided that I will go to the State Department in Russian.
I remember there came Russian soldiers and they said  \ Y ou have good grades.
your mother  but had no did you have contact with these Russian deportees and exiles?
I wasn't a baby  you know  but I used to make pancakes and I used to make things and I used to bake and if the Russian soldier were coming  you know  from one side and to the other side  I don't recall from where they came  I always had food to give.
And on the way ther e was  they call it an ablava the Russian were checking all the people on that station and checking their passports  their names.
It was very cold and there was no food at all  so one day I walked by and I have seen some Russian carrying big kettles with food and I saw them going outside the camp carrying to somebody  so next morning I got up real early  like three o'clock  and I followed them.
And only the same time these bombs was falling and  of course  the Lithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming  they're sabotaging the Russian Army tanks  putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them.
Now  her brother was drafted into the army and sent to the Russian border and he perished there.
And after the war he went into the Ru ssian army  when the army -- Russian army freed the people in the camp  and then even visited us in Romania.
And every evening they were -- they were trying to -- to keep up their spirits and they were singing -- there were Polish people  German people  Hungarians  all mixture.
After all  my scholas tic background was partly Polish  partly USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0037 20 Russian  partly Ukrainian  partly Italian.
I said I'm going to Kielce because my mother's Polish and I want to...so she said  you know  this spoke to husband in Russian  this Pole  I like him.
She didnt survive  her brother survived because he was in the Russian army.
So they were very friendly towards Russian  because they were mostly of of Ukrainian they speak spoke Ukrainian at home  and and of course  at school we we had a regular classes in Russian  or Ukrainian.
She was happy that I was there because she was scared of the Russian soldiers.
But  what saved me with my aunt is I spoke Yiddish.
Polish  because I learned a little Polish while I was in Poland  and its a Slavic language  and I had a -- I think I have some talent for languages  so I caught on.
I had my final exams  they had to be in the Russian language.
And you know  of course later on was all Russian  you know  so And you picked up ru you know  a five year and a half year old will pick up a language fairly quickly.
He was fighting for three and a half years in the Russian army  and can you imagine that he came ri this no  no  no  it was later what I am talking.
But in the first years when it wa s Lithuanian  the main language was Russian  because the population was not Lithuanian  the Lit huanian was otherwise.
If his father was born Jewish  was he considered a Jew?
I tell you  the Russian people that we met  a lot of them were very  very nice  you know?
And the Russian answer was that we never heard of him.
And my mother spoke mostly Polish amongst the population because they either spoke Russian or Belarus and very few of them knew of cultured Polish.
So  I knock at the first door  and a woman comes out  and speaks Russian  kto tam   who is there?
And the Russians res in respon se to that we are already out of Russia   so we dont know exactly Russian news  bu t the Russians are insisting that this is Goebbels and Hitlers policy to break up the friendship between Russia and England  who are now allies.
He took us back and we heard still in Jawiszowice fighting because we heared the...uh...how they fight Germans with the...with the...with the Russian s. And I...he went back over there to the Russian Army.
And they are  they were running back to Russia  because Lithuania was full of Russian people.
I broke into the warehouse with a bunch of Russian soldiers.
And suddenly Sam was with out his friend and the only thing we could find was an old book in the Russian  which we ha d to study  a dentistry book.
And we approached him  and we asked -- we knew the few words in Russian  Ve evrai means Jew in Russian.
With re verence and with   we take over the task to judge the Jews in the ghetto and we'll do it to the best of our understanding  to the best of our...taking into consideration the specific conditions in the ghetto that nothing was alright  and also their rulings...their rulings they took into finding any law book in the world  and I I... You know and you know Hebrew and you know Russian .
teasing people that we spoke Russian  they they should ge learn Russian  you know.
It wasn't until 1944 when he came over one day to us -- he was coming quite often to us because he was lonely; and he was telling us that there's going to be an uprising  a Polish uprising  in October 1944  that the Polish people are beginning an uprising because the Russians are coming closer  and the Russian front is now on the Vistula River which was dividing Warsaw into two parts: there was Warsaw on one side of the Vistula and on the other side of the Vistula  and what was happening that the Russian army was advancing up to the Vistula and there were rumors that they're going to stop.
In that particular apartment was also a Russian judge  military judge  his name  I remember his name because it was such a romantic kind of name  Ivan Ivanovitch Ivanov  that was his name and he had a daughter named Luba  which means love  she taught me Russian  and he lived upstairs from us  he also had a son  and his son and I jointly had a stamp collection.
So the work that had to be done that could not be done by the Russian male population was done by a force that was organized by the Hungarians  labor force of Jews.
And he touched me badly  the way he said it in Russian  \   \  which translated into English  means  \ Are you still alive?\
And we had Russian prisoners  and you know  all kinds of prisoners walked alongside of us .
We brought this in the -- to our place  our home there and on the way going -- youre going -- going to our place -- to the bunker  call it a home  we stopped another little farm  we got some bread  you know  the way the Russian did.
But my father was -- could read Polish very well  you know  and he was actually quite -- quite fluent in -- in his own way  you know  with -- with the Polish language.
So he give me two days to come back and take an exam in Latin in the Russian language which I did and I passed it.
And we was there maybe a half a day and they met  and the Russian was already there  pa trol no  what's the name in English what you send out  you send out patrol yeah  patrol.
That is a very offensive in the Russian in the Soviet system  to belong to organizations which are not within their framework.
I was...I was a sergeant in the in the Russian army.
So Lodz had been under had be en under the Russian occupation  earlier in the century?
But Russian soldiers  Soviet Union soldiers were marching through the forest where I was dying  actually.
You had a lot of hand grenades  especially they had type -- the Russian type ha -- hand grenades.
My -- I mean  had I grown up in normal circumstances I would have also spoken Ukrainian or Russian or whatever.
At home I spoke Yiddish and outside when I went to school I spoke Polish.
You cannot stay here.ﬂ So the woman  that Polish woman told Mom in Polish that -- dont be af raid  these Russian soldiers they dont want any spies in the border because Russia was not at war then -- Right. --
Russian I have to start to speak in 1939 when the -- when Poland was divided  and Wilna start Russian for a short time  and then they gave it to Lithuanian after two months.
We dont know Russian security personnel  maybe there were  maybe there were not  but nobody established that any Jew ba that Lithuani an was is in command  you know  at the sugar factory that wo So  another betrayal of a of the wors t kind  is a it is a Lithuanian who is a communist Right.
Because the Russian army that was there  and they had their their their arms  and they were not resisting  because they saw the handwriting on the wall  they saw what actually happened  they saw the might.
So the officers  the Russian officers  told them to leave otherwise they will get killed. \
Then later on in the Slovak  they even the people Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 28did realize  it was like  in the beginning like secret  but then they started to bring back injured or dead soldie rs  then the Slovak people started to know that the actually the Slovak army is in the war against the Poland and Russian.
And in turns -- for the Russian soldiers this was still paradise.
Take them  let them do with them whats -- whats ﬂ -- so  the w-were 10 people guarding this hundred German soldiers  there were also White Russian policemen.
What was your feeling when the Russian soldier came and told you the war was over?
He didnt know that I am I am in in the Russian army  and Prather ca utioned me against that  he said  dont tell him that you are in the army  because then he is not going to do that  and then he is not going to help you.
When he asked me about   I understood he's Jewish too.
What happened to you when you were libe rated  when the Russian on the pink horse came?
You know  in this time we become...uh...the Russian comes us  and we become  you know  police by Russia.
Yes  they had the cerkiew   which is a Orthodox church  and the school was common.
They all had the Russian machine guns with the round disks.
Now since the si nce historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there.
Now  my mother happened to come from the Russian quoteunquote zone.
And and and Gorbachev admitted too  and he sealed off that this was the Russian doing.
But when we got there  our home was occupied by the Russian military  and they used it as a warehouse for grain.
We came with the Russian soldiers  with this  to Bial ystok.
Ill se Ill serve 20 years.ﬂ 02:30:06 End of Tape#2 15 A mug that asks for a brick (Russian) 20 Tape #3 03:00:00 [Pre-interview conversation] 03:00:44 This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.
Once -- the demeanor of the Russian soldier is very difficult to describe now because we see them now after all these years of changes  these were people who were fighting the war.
I needed to understand a little bit of what this meant  and and if I understand what youre telling me  is that this Russian  who was so tall  and strong  and able to cut down the tree Yes.
who was very brutal  beat my father once very badly  and this Russian (?)
So this was in the wintertime when it was col d. And also  the food situation was very bad because the Russian system applied to them  too.
All the other schools were can -- had -- transforming to Russian speaking schools.
As a matter of fact  it is essentially all the c -- all the Jews who wa s [indecipherable] name was -- was supposed to be Cohen  and lived under the Tsarist rule  ended up being Kaggen  Kogen  Kaganovic  because the Russian alphabet does not have an H. Uh-huh.
One day they came to us and said : Well  we cannot stay here  the Russian Army is coming closer.
SE: In Odessa  there is the camp for -- for -- vacation camp for Russian people that go there.
7 Why dont you talk a little bit about that  your memories of what happened when the Russians came in  whether there was support for the Russian s  whether there was local resistance  and what -- and how that changed your life.
We didn't hear from my brother for a long  long long time and when we finally did  which I believe was months later  he was uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone.
Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops  and the German army  I guess they were forced into th e service.
And I said  ﬁCommander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich  that son of a dog says this and this and 21 Polish watch (Russian) 22 Interpreter (German) 24 this.ﬂ And in Polish its skurwysyn 23 in Russian  its sukin-syn.24 In English  of course  you know what it is.
She maintained  as did her daughter  and I believe it to be so  that when the Russians came in to where they were living in eastern Germany  they were both raped many times and in front of each other and that -- that was not su rprising  the story of rape was very common  both in -- particularly within the Russian zone.
I arrived at the...in the zone in the Amer...in the Russian zone in Berlin.
I went; and if somebody  the Russian came with the trucks and wanted to take me  I say  \ Not me.
And a Jewish officer  Russian officer came over and was talking to me  so  are you Jewish?
Kolbasa is the Russian term for salami  for kilbasi   you know  and he brought a piece of bread and uh...terrific delicacy for us.
Lets go ahead to -- to the time that you were liberated and you described seeing a truck full of Russian -- Russian soldiers. --
And I remember one of the Russian soldiers who came in  and I wish I could remember his name  but he was a tailor and I wanted a uniform.
And I was on a transport from -- fo -- after the Death March  we came into a camp which was close to the Russian border -- not Russian border  but Polish  Germany border and this cam p would have been liquidated in another week or so  and they started to liquidate  having transports going out there  which  it was wintertime and yes  wintertime in the eastern section of Europe is pretty strict  is temperatures below zero constantly.
And also I learned  the one of the people who 1 The Taduesz Kosciusko Division  a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command  appeared in July 1943.
I said  two two and a quarter million Interview with Morris Rosen August 5  1999 83250 000 Russian soldiers  Jewish soldiers got killed fighting the Nazis  its a fact.
But really  we were told if we caught on the German side  tell them we came from th e Russian side so they throw you back on the Russian side.
5 I I you know  I dont know if its an original memory  or or you know  pictures and stuff  but I seem to remember or or stories that my mother told  but I seem to remember very well  when when the war started that he he was putting us on a train  that we were leaving Sarny for the Russian you know  that the deeper into Russia  I seem to remember him waving goodbye.
In the summer of '44 I d ecided to join the Polish army and uh I was brought by the Russian  uh one Russian to what Poland...where the front was now in uh...Lublin was free.
Theyre going to send me back to he said  look  were sorry  but we cannot do anything  because we have a very good relationship with the Russian  theyre our allies  and we cannot create a a a a international conflict.
We been caught  we would have wound up at the Russian front.
But on the other hand  if I would have been with Russian partisans  if -- if Commander Proch would have tried to break a barrel of liquor  they would have killed him.
But we didnt understand about dead too much  b ecause they said -- they were very religious  the people  the Russian and they said that they go to heaven.
There was some Russian Jews  there were some officers  who didnt go advertising themselves Im a Jew  not a Jew  their faith was the same  and the hell we were fighting the -- the same enemy at that time.
One Russian commander  he took the rifle and wanted to shoot to Alex  so Alex took out his revolver and Panchenko came in between and he pushed them together.
It was one church  Catholic church  and was [indecipherable] A a a Russian Orthodox chur dox.
You lived in the part of Poland that fell under the Russian occupation.
And we were marched  and I knew  from here  by train  well end up in Russia.
But it just so happened it was the Russian Army that opened the doors for us and that was the end of our  what should I call it?
And the Russian army came closer and we evacuated  the whole army  Riga  the German Army  so the ghetto was eliminated and old people disappeared.
We looked out and there were the Russian soldiers and the liberation of that town took place on March 31.
But a lot of these Russian Jews  they werent very Jewish  you know  they -- but he said he was really born a Jew  too.
So when the  when the boat came you know with th e captain  he took  took us you know the Russian officer  he was I think a leftenant and myself and he drove us.
So they found a little guy and this guy came over and says  in Russian -- my husband speaks some Russian -- \ You think you're a Jew?\
I remember one man  in fact  one of the soldiers  a Russian soldier  pulled up his sleeve and he had watches.
Russian people did not care too much of us because they still were searching for Germans .
And how did the Russians treat you ap -- ther -- Ive heard some stories that some of the Russian troops were always respectful.
They used to get  they  to be like a Russian guy by the name of Vanka .
And then in the early in the morning  suddenly and more drinking  was drinking  suddenly the guard came immediately  because the Russian are close  so then the Russian and the German was running back.
So it must be something to do with with Russian  but I think it was absolutely that there be many Germans living in .
So  h-he -- the -- Zigmund August Porniatofsky  there are rumors about him  that he was a lover of the Russian  and -- the czarina  and then -- and Poland didnt like it so much.
Only deserted of Russian army -- Went to -- -- would go  or adventurers  or gamblers were going to America.
Poles were not there  but there were -- they had a group of Russian prisoners of war which turned on the Russians.
And when it came to May '45  and when the camp was open  she came to Vienna on a train was full of Russian soldiers.
Only he was  you know  wanted to tell us all about Russian union.
You know  teachers were very important  you know  you could -- they had -- you remained the Jewish -- Jewish schools  the worn clothes  you went to a Jewish school  you went to Russian school  or the Polish school.
>> Bill Benson: So this is one of the pilots in the Russian planes?
Some people dont realize  they think its not a Jewish name  that it is a Italian name  but I mentioned that her -- her husbands is the fifth generation Am erican  and -- and it used to be Dezubinsky  which is a Russian name for a dentist  something.
>> Bill Benson: You were sent to Auschwitz in 1944  as you just described.
And he was davening one night and a Russian soldier saw him and said  Im Jewish too  Ill get you enough food.
And we start to hear the sounds of the artillery from Moldavia --from  say  city of Iai [ Ger: Jassy]  or closer --because the Russian army start to come closer and closer.
About a year later  they were asked to a big party by the local Russian army people  because they discovered what we did and especially what we did for them.
So my parents spoke already -- except English probably  all European languages  French  German  Polish  Russian.
How my mother used to love to read books  and wa -- a lot of the books were in Russian.
Uh on the fourteenth of January  1945  the Russian offensive started and that was I think from Warsaw towards the   and we knew that contrary to the landing of the of the of the of of the Allies in western Europe or in Italy or some other Russian victories  this time it's us.
We was in the woods  came in  the Russian on a horse  on the horses.
I'm waiting  waiting  when he comes closer  I recognize the Russian uniform  clean uniform.
But Mother's idea was  she knew at that point from the news from the Russian Army that they were squeezing Germany from both sides and all she wanted was to get out of Poland.
He walked over  he spoke perfect Russian  he went over to this Ukrainian  he says to him  \ Sir  can you let me talk to my son for a few minutes.\
Now  if you want to go to hell  that's where you went  the Russian front.
And we particular the Russian literature  the Soviet literature we had we had to read  you know  some of the Sholokhov s novels  and there is about de-depor tations.
until 1917  Ru-Russia  or [indecipherable] whenever it was  until lets say  the -- the end of 1916  the beginning of 1917  when the -- the revol ution started and the Russian armies were pulling eastward  Wilna was -- was under Russian rules for -- for -- for over a hundred years.
Was born in 1843  and I suspect that he was fighting in this 60 in 1860s in this one of these crazy insurrections  where the Polish-Lithuanian area a gentry actually arose against the tsarist  you know  with pistols and sabers against the Russian army.
Well  I spoke Polish  and of course  my 8 parents spoke Yiddish.
So Moma Kopelowicz and another friend  Eli Zaryckevicz   he was from Russia  a Russian officer  was a young man maybe Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 3725 years old.
Yes  we spoke Russian but because we lived under the Russians two years already.
We had -- the farmer had a horse and the Russian found  in another farmers place  a little carriage  which they took.
And the Russian military people came in  and they saw him  and they saw him being wounded  and they said  well  well well send you a doctor.
In our apartment where my father  mother  and sister lived  we also had -- we also had my grandmother whose husband was killed by the Ukrainians  my grandfather who was a widower  you could see his picture here  Isaac Drimer and one of my father's sister's  Ryfka  with her two little children.
I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.
But all that changed when when the war br The Russian came in  everything changed.
and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived  the Poles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans.
And then I went to school  it was a public school  where I learned Polish.
So every day came a Russian guy and took over how many trees we did cut today  and tomorrow I had to cut more trees.
The moment we had no more Russian uniforms to supply  then the -- some of the Russians uniforms appeared again  because people were killed in the gas  and we received the business back  only the numbers had to be removed  because they were the numbers of the dead people.
This is when we were still living in the apartment to which we m oved during the Russian period.
I had connections  you know  through the -- in a Russian ambulance  to Czechoslovakia.
The peasants were -- did hide all kind of ammunitions which the Russian army -- the Red army left when they were escaping.
Did you think of yourself as a Ukrainia n Jew  or a Russian Jew  or just Jewish?
So  what people did when they got their luggage if they got their luggage  many people didnt get their luggage they would take what the belongings they had  they would go with something to the Russian  where the Russian concentration camp was.
I dont remember anything  but we used to re -- wr ite and read Russian  was Russian language mandatory.
So we came to America  its a -- and a -- and a -- but -- but -- But it wasnt that simple  right  because Brauslav or Breslau was in the Russian zone  was it a [indecipherable] No  it wasnt Russian -- No.
Bill Bens on: And several of your uncles joined the Russian Army at that a time  is that right?
Two Ukrainian policemen were there; there we re no Ukrainian police before  all of a sudden  theres Ukrainian police  uniforms and rifles.
28 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD So they had these trucks going over  and in our case the guards  of course  the Russian guard wanted more watches.
She was old en...for many many years after hopi ng oh  she got lost someplace on the Russian side and she couldn't get out and maybe someday...and this is so mething that I must admit even to this day even though I know  I know  I know...there is a trace in me and I've never said this to my son...there's a trace in me that keeps telling me she's alive someplace. (
He first he beat the hell out of him  and the Russians came around  there wa a lot of soldiers  they came around and they seen wh ats going on  they didnt intervene at all  til the guy got ready  and then he s he says to the Russian  he said  this is the guy  when we were in the ghetto in the and boxcars used to come in Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 20with potatoes or other kind of food for the ghetto  so this guy took away all the food  he gave it to the local people and to us  when it in the bottom on the train there was dirt  he said  this is for the Jew.
They were not prepared because the Ge rman with Russian  they were friends at that time.
But we walked in the German pavilion from the Russian pavilion  and in the entrance hall had life-size picture of a German no-Nobel Prize winners.
The Russian come in there and this was May 1945  and I was with my friend from Holland.
And when the Russian came in– in the beginning he was a very big shot.
And his son was de deported to Russia  but then he joined the arm Polish army.
So Prather told me in his letter I mean  he mentioned that he is going to that he has a a hunch that that he has already somebody that that will be able be in thats going to be helpful in my in my defection from the Russian army.
When he got I guess this must have been on the Russi an/Polish border somewhere  he said that a man came to him who was in the Russian ar my and surrendered  and said that Im Jew soldier   and so he -my father took him home to Pozega along with his horse  and the man stayed I dont know how long with the family as a prisoner of war.
We were told they ask you who you are first of all  you dont speak no Russian  a word  even the people who speak Russians  they shouldnt say a word in Russian.
They had Pols  lots of Pols  lots of Ukrainians  lots of Russians  Russian POW.
There were some that came from Russia that were deported and came back from Russia.
At that time  they shipped Russian  uh Hungarian Jews to our town  and when the Germans entered  they kept the Jews on .
I-I dont speak a perfect Russian  but I manage to speak.
But my parents  unfortunately  my father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish quota.
Interview with Esfir Brodskaya 12 August 11  2014 Did you know when you were very young that you were Jewish or did you just think you were Russian?
There were Jews in other Russian partisan  but not like the Bielskis brother.
He had the sister and the brother  and his sister was killed in the ge -- during action in the ghetto in Lvov  and his brother  1941  the -- when the Russian a-army retreated from Lvov east  he -- he joined the Russian army  and we never heard from him.
And he was later on he found out through a friend  a Russian major  he says  Tom his name is also Moniek   after my grandfathers name  but he changed his name.
And then we heard the Russian language  and there was the Russian army and the soldiers were telling us that they took over the area.
Even the Russians  the Russian front had stalemated  been stalemated for a while  so this was middle of the war and it could have gone either way and we were pretty fearful at the time.
When I was liberated  I went to a hospital and I got operation.
So my lieutenan t tries to speak to them  he doesnt speak Russian  and I dont speak Russian either.
He was a -- a 19th century man who lived under the Russian oc cupation.
My mother did  my mother spoke Polish and Ukrainian and Russian and all that.
But  it was different  the Russian came closer and the Allie s  the places that I were  on the way from Hainichen  then we went on a trip.
We didnt do too much  I would say  like the Russian  they reward  what do you call it?
When you first started to learn -- how did y -- when you first started learning about what had happened in -- in Poland  primarily  but certainly west of where you were -- Yeah  this was when I was in the -- in the Russian army  started to read  and -- and I came to various cities  and nowhere were Jews.
So once when we did walk  once a day we did walk  I've seen a Russian officer and I recognize  say he must be Jewish and I stepped out from the walking pattern and told him  \ Listen I'm sitting here so long and I'm Jewish and I know it.\
So  as they were waiting in the forest  the Russian group came by.
In your book I think you mentioned a friend of yours who was attacked by a Russian soldier.
So that anybody that thought  believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of people made that choice and then they went.
These was the Russian  through the canalization...through the canals; and uh they were shooting in.
I read   and other people have read   accounts on the Russian assault on Berlin and what life was like as they came into Berlin and what life was like in that devastated city in the months after the war.
Almost at th e end  because finally Russian troops came in Budapest on 15 th  whatever.
Raoul said look behind me  there are two Russian officers on the motor bike and I'm invited to go back to   but I don't know if I'm going as a visitor but I want to give you all the money that I have so that you can help the people that we already helped.
There was my grandfather  grandmother  my father's sister with her two children whose husband was taken into the Russian Army; and of course the four of us.
And uh this people most of them managed to flee Lithuania to Russia.
They probably did know that Im not Christian  even though I keep on saying that I was [indecipherable] What was -- and what was the Russian presence in your town at that time?
So we crossed  I guess  the Russian -- that used to be Russia.
I had no money for a ticket  but it was -- I just went so quickly and I yelled something  I think in Russian or in Polish  when they wanted a ticket -- I didnt give them.
Anyhow  he escaped to the Russian side  and while my mother decided to stay because family ties  brothers  her parents and so on.
When we came in 1938  in 1939 came the Russians...the Germans marched in  so he runned to Russian.
So I said to them -- I knew a little bit Russian  I said I was a Gypsy and I looked like one.
He related how Russian soldiers and officers were executed by the hundreds and hundreds.
The communist party to ok over the Russian partisan movement and the democratic government had a branch in London.
Her  my mothers youngest brother  he and his wife went east when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland.
Russian) 30 To be called by name (Russian) 26 were wash-outs  little bubbles.
I still have this passport  provided for the Russian who let me in.
Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.
Much of the community that you see here  that came from Poland and Russia had Yiddish in their homes.
uh...follow that appeal  but most of my friends left on th at day and they went east toward the Russian side.
Then I went to a school  you know  and I become know...to know Russian language more.
I was in the Russian army  it was September 1955  I think.
We have involved with the Russian Army and then  of course  the Germans were bombing the streets and we were going through the hole.
Uh anyway uh maybe an instructress to some of the uh Russian uh noblemen  one-time noblemen in St. Petersburg  and uh anyway Madame Richter  she really pounded French into us .
The Russian po-- the local population  the Ukrainians  they ran away.
I did a USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 20 good cleaning  but after that we got two big loaf of bread  the Russian bread.
Some Russian and some White Russian people were forced to re patriate to their respective countries.
Some spoke Russian  some spoke Polish  some Ukrainian  Lithuanian  Estonians  Latvian.
And the first act is -- you know  he -- he's playing  and it's marvel -- he's a real -- he was fantastic in typical Russian with -- with the flowing hair.
Yeah  he was teaching -- a teacher  not -- not only Hebrew  he was teaching Russian.
When we came  there was a Russian man in there  and they took him pretty soon out because a big part of the people 4 were Jews that fled Poland from the other side where the Germans came and they took them prison...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either.
By the way  in Auschwitz I was helping a Russian to pass soup to the officers who were in very bad shape.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
But the Jews of Germany who were integrated Jews  and my gr-grandfather kind of Jews  clashed.
He believed in the Yiddish language and the Yiddish culture and he used to speak to me in Yiddish too which sounds like German and so it was easy for me to understand.
So I'm coming again when the truck stopped and we hear again voices  here and there  talking Lithuanian  talking Russian.
Something is fishy  so I asked one of the Russian officers there  what's happening.
So were you very conscious of being Jewish  or somewhat conscious  what do you think?
But the Russian was not very easy to live under either.
And he was going to their -- to the -- to their building and one day he comes in and -- and one day he comes in there  and a Russian prisoner says  doc  I gotta tell you a secret  but dont you dare tell -- tell that I told you.
And each time I had to change languages; from Russian first to German; from German then to French.
The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of Siaulai.
No  the Russian prisoners were prisoners that were used as slave laborers.
Well  this i this is very complicated  actually  th-the the home language used to be Russian.
My parents had gone to Russian schools so they would often speak Russian to one another when they didnt want us children to understand.
5 The problem was  we went to the school -- I spoke Russian.
Now  to me  I thought it was Russian  because -- It's a star -- I was used to seeing the star.
And one of them was the Hungarian accent  and of course we spoke Yiddish.
He  of course -- you could tell he was a Jew.
S everyday eventually l My times  most of the high schools and regular schools had to have Russian.
And in two minutes a Russian officer come with a re a red band here  with a tomaht  leave everything alone. [
So the Russian officer gave my father some military b oots.
And the Russian doctor came in and was tending to his wound.
Oh yeah  oh yeah  I knew that -- and when the Russian came  I didnt -- I didnt expect it  I thought its a miracle.
We don't know who  whether it the Germans or whether this is the American  or the Russian  we don't know.
We didn't have any soap  and we take the ashes and we put in a piece of cloth by Christian people  like Russian people and we put some cloth and we had warm water  you didn't have water.
Number one  she's five years younger than I. And she lived in -- on the other side  on the Russian occupation Dugna  Poland.
The Russian soldiers came to eat  to us  because they didnt get food like that.
You were  you were  you told the story in the first interview about how you went away to the Russian front.
Ega even Yugoslavia  it was in even this time more liberal and many people escape after the Russian came into Yugoslavia from Czechoslovakia .
But we saw the German running...German soldiers running  and got killed also from...from this soldiers...from the Russian.
Well  in Pleven  of course we  on the date when the Russian Army finally reached Pleven  they had  of course  come to -- from Rumania and to the Danube  through the Black Sea  but troops obviously entered every major Bulgarian city.
Okay  when came to the border  the Russian guards went off  the American [indecipherable] came in for passes.
If they are Russian tanks  fine.ﬂ Sure enough -- and I told to the Germans  ﬁYou sit quiet  all.
Among these people that were sent to Siberia were my wife's parents.
While he was sitting on the train  there was a man  a Russian man sitting next to him.
And right smack in the middle was one car reserved for the British -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the British who would accompany the train and tried to -- would try to protect us against the Russian soldiers.
In the beginning they had the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 46 German guards  but then they start to bringing in the the [indecipherable] the Russian Ukrainians  and then brought in Hungarians.
So that was Berlin and that was the camp at Schlattensee and that was the camp at Templehof  and then the trick always was to organize trainloads to go out of Berlin southward through the Russian zone and come down to Frankfurt which was in the American zone  and go into one of the 64 permanent camps that were in the American zone and there catch your breath and sort out whom you wanted to send further south to the Mediterranean to the French and Italian Riviera  both of them  where the Haganah ships came in to take the people who were willing to run the risk of the British gauntlet and most of whom were caught out on the high seas in contravention of international law  it didn't make any difference.
Now  later on  it was in the late ‚42  in the be -- in the l-late -- no  ‚42  in beginning ‚43  Russian planes already used to drop off a lot of explosives.
So it was a very long interrogation in German  Hungarian  Russian  Czech  whatever else before I was accepted by the leadership by the resistance organization.
There were many Polish partisans and Russian Partisans  and they were groups like we were.
Lvov took am Russia Do you [indecipherable] Okay  so that was part of the Russian territory.
So I didnt speak Yiddish at that time  I spoke German and these people spoke Yiddish  so you had  Yiddish is a turned around German.
It wasn't unusual at that time you know  because the  the Russian was coming.
My father used to tell a story when he was in Russia.
44 Oh  I remember that because when -- then Russian grab my father and maybe few hours later  we had just period that nobody was in.
And a Jew was nominally -- most of them were nominally Polish  Polish nationals.
These the Polish army  but it was in Russia   and under Russian jurisdiction.
I was born  I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit  but they spoke Polish only.
In this time when the Germans came to Russia  it was only when I was in the family.
And because he was the only one not in Russian  not in the Soviet Union  so he inherited his business  and it was the stu -- h-he was the owner of [speaks Lithuanian here].
Yes  wi I still will when the Russian came over  I went to school.
It was the place where they collected arms  the Russian arms and put them in one or two buildings.
They have been they told us in Russian [speaks Russian] So I What did they ask you  to write something?
My father leans around this soldier and in perfect Russian says to him  \ This expletive deleted  expletive deleted is trying to teach me a language that was my mother tongue before he was just an idea in his father's mind.\
Because the Russians...the Russians uh uh set up this station where they had a Russian 10 Rabbi Shimon Kalish.
And was that the He was going with the Russian army.
And since she was an educated person  they must have know n that she knows some German.
We had a young doctor who was wounded at the Russian front.
>> Halina Peabody: The thought was that they were basing themselves on the First World War where the men were conscripted into the Russian Army  women and children were not touched.
40 So this was part of  lets say  the ri -- White Russian -- White  white Tsaristic -- -- Russian refugees who had -- -- refuges  right  right. --
I mean in this house that we lived in the back yard Russian soldiers were quartered and once I knew enough Russian  and a Russian soldier calls me over and he says you want to have a smoke in Russian  hochet pokurete.
Here on this side having having Belarusian police  and some of some German police  etcetera So from this side.
Besides the Russian soldiers being of help to you  did you sense that people were helping others?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings TAMAR LAZERSON ROSTOWSKI pg 4 Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: INTERVIEW IN RUSSIAN (sound roll 54  camera roll 88  take 30 mark) Tell me why you kept the diary.
Yes  so I was good in Russian and I was a learning type.
It simply seemed unbelievable that these names  these place names  where I had been sometimes only days be fore  were already in Russian hands.
The Germans by that time had lost a lot of people on the Russian front  and they were drafting 17  16  some times 15 year olds into the Army.
And I do remember that she used to send me to there with some kind of packages  which I really don't know what any USHMM Archives RG-50.549.01*0004 9 of this was  but I have to say that the Russian soldiers were very nice and very loving  and I liked going there.
till one day  one day we heard there was also in Lublin -- it was a bigger place -- there was also a lot of Dutch prisoners of war what were freed by the Germans  so there was some more Dutch people in Lublin and somehow  either through the Red Cross or 11 Shlomo Podchlebnik 21 whatever  they organized into bring them back to Holland  bring them back from the Russian -- I don't know from where  but it went out.
And so later on  my mother would take one of the chicken when it grew  to ask some Russian to kill that And then youd have some food.
Here's these women  and they speak Russian  and they speak Polish.ﬂ And they said  ﬁWe're going to be coming back in two days  you're going to work for us.ﬂ Meanwhile  the word got around they were raping the women.
This was in middle of December and till we were combatively uh pushed away the Russian army will come back in March.
I ventured to pull out my German rather than Russian  and I think I made the right decision  you know.
Have you come across -- do you know German  or -- No  I dont speak German.
And in addition  you know  my mother was able to talk to the Russian soldier who are [indecipherable] -- Ah  cause she can speak Russian  yeah. --
We had Polish uniforms  you know  and and we had uh Polish instructors  you know  and we had Russian instructors  and you had to do  you know  like an academy  like uh uh you know  West Point  because they had different uh...and that that was a city that mostly was uh uh you know  officer's school.
So it was German and Ukrainian at the time in Slovakia.
Because when the Russian came in  I was [indecipherable] the whole summer in Mlynov  and then I came back for another month maybe  or two  I dont its very hard to remember this.
Uh... someone who was...they had Polish  they had Jewish policemen ...uh...in our camp...  in our ghetto actually  to keep order amongst us  and they were evidently...uh... helping the Germans keep order during this ordeal of selecting the people.
Well  the word went they taking us probably to Russia  Siberia.
But we -- we were staying in the Jewish house in the Russian zone.
Many people who were liberated at that time had to go to the Russian army and still in the last few months were killed on the Russian front  after surviving concentration camp for over four years.
By the Russian government  because there were a lot of Saint Petersburg was the capital Mm-hm.
This I only find out later  but anyway  the camp was full of all kinds of nationalities  there were at that time when we arrived there  maybe 5500  there 44 were Russian POW's  Soviet Red Army POW's  there were Polish civilians  Russian civilians  there were Frenchmen.
Half was -- the north part went to the Germans and the east part was Russia.
That quote  camp  thats a group of apartments in the -- pretty sure it was the Russian sector and they took care of people as they -- the Breecha brought them in at night from Poland.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 32 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Partisans  underground.
It was the first time  actually  when I -- and later on when we already left the -- during the war  went to Pinsk  and Russians came to Pinsk  that was a first -- you know  this region of Poland was occupied by Russian.
We had it in school the first year that I was in school  we had catechism in school  which is intere sting because before the war  there was there was religion was taught apparently in schools  and I have this picture of my grandfather teaching Jewish children  and then there was there was a Russian there was an Orthodox priest teaching whatever.
The Russian Army was very poorly equipped  and he lost his toes on one leg because of the cold weather and inadequate clothing.
And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.
How did -- how did -- was that a -- an ex -- an exhilarating moment  an exciting -- Oh  it certainly was  because hey  the Germans are defeated  and we are not under the Russian jurisdiction.
It's a former Russian POW  prisoner of war  camp maintained by the Nazi Army.
Well  they had to have been Russian   which my mother referred to as not liberators  but occupiers  again.
Speaking Rus -- speaking  they spoke Russian  and the boy made accqua-acquaintances and we were close to Berlin  very short distance to Berlin and he would go to Berlin.
The first question 1 Simon V. Petlyura was a Ukrainian journalist a nd military leader during the Russian Revolution.
Some prisoners  especially I remember there were Russian prisoners  too  from the war  they came in much later and they 05:24 were much stronger.
However  the Jews  western Jews and Russian Jews  embraced a movement called the Haskallah  if youre familiar with it.
Its like a monument of the Russian occupation of of Poland.
In a week  he came back  and that's how I know the story  because the Red Cross had--the Swedish Red Cross had--I met later on in Sweden  and he said Raoul came back  and behind him there were two Russian officers on motorbikes  and he said  \ As you can see  I have some Russians behind me and I am invited back  and I have no idea if I am invited back as a visitor or as a prisoner.
There were four  when the war ended  there was the English  the Russian the American.
He was a native of   so he was a Jew.
And we are running the streets with the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia.
The Germans also went through with their army to the Bucovina to the Russian front.
Like we spoke -- a widow of some Russian person told us  she said -- her husband was sent to Siberia.
They spoke Yiddish when they didnt want me to understand which was e nough so that I did understand Yiddish.
Because we had to run away from Poland  the Russian were there  and that was a very  very bad time.
They were learning German  they were learning Polish  they were learning Russian  they were learning French  so that theyd know how to handle the DPs when they got to Europe.
Actually it was -- the Lithuanians were Catholics and Jewish people  we had a few Russians -- Russian Orthodox  but thats how it was.
And and af ter we received food and everything from the Russians  we then this Russian soldier  I dont know what his rank was  or what  but he was this Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated and we became the guide to his officer  and showed him where to go in Berlin from point A to point B  because we knew it so well.
Said this late they're going to send to the Russian front.
Well  most of the other soldiers and officers had been in Russia.
You have to realize Hitler was loosing at the Russian fronts and and all the Germans...the the German citizens were in the army.
And the German Department of Agriculture had brought these mares and some stallions and othe r horses of a different breed  Caucasians and some were from the Russian steppes.
Th-The the regular way of the Russian lies that are even now you can s listen to [indecipherable] and and and and see how nicely he forms certain ways of how to do the right thing the Russian way.
And he was very strict  very in the beginning he didnt want to take the job  but the the other people from the I mean  the head people from the ghetto came to him  and they pleaded with him that he should he should there they need him  because first of all  his perfect German  and his perfect Lithuanian  and perfect Russian  and he was already educated   very cultured person.
Also  during the brutal Russian winter  they -- some of them had regular clothes when they had to march and they had to march a lot.
And on the 5th of March  the Soviet Army liberated the camp and we were suddenly free.
He wanted to volunteer to fight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took  ‚cause they needed people to fight  and he was a ccepted.
You see  because it was...I asked questions which normally  in normal time you don't...you don't ask  but there was a question that I knew they do  you understand  and I asked him that question how come you don't kill today  so he said because we are now negotiating with the Russian partisans to fight against the Germans and it will take about another three days  and we better not catch you.
And they needed more people to registration  people who know a few languages  especially German and Russian and Polish.
And we stay in Kostovitz from -- it was in 44 yes  til end of the war  which was actually when German army passed by  because -- German -- Russian army -- because you know  during the uprising  the army was on opposite side of Vistula  and they didnt want to take any action because it was different group figh ting  that was London group fighting in Warsaw.
I mean  Im a -- Im a Czech  I went to college to Hungary  my parents spoke German.
On July the Russian came in and we was free after this.
And he saw me on his hand  his hand  that \ We are -- around the city is already the Russian Army.\
And then we went in ninet in April 1944  because it was actual ly a few hundred kilometers  the Russian f the front was approaching.
So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitchen  and there were three Frenchmen.
At night you could hear already the Russian guns were coming closer and closer.
>> Bill Benson: Now you see the Russian troops  they're here.
Matter of fact   one day  I walking in the street in the daytime  and there were many invalids - Russian invalids [and] they want to fi ght me.
In 1917  his father  Ike Fol  his name was Folchuk   he escaped from Russian revolution in 1917  he came to United States  and he was unable to get a job as I Ike Folchuk .
I mean  there was probably a foot and a half difference between he and the officer  but he grabbed the horsewhip  and started horsewhipping the the Russian.
It was on the Russian side of the divided Poland  from the -- after ‚39.
And th en apparently I got very sick and I was like in a little grave covered with leaves in the forest and the Russian soldiers found me th ere.
And as it happened  she said yes  here  go to that place  and my mother knew a little bit of Russian  so she could converse.
Although you were not yet 4 years old at the time  tell us what you can about the circumstances and what your family's life was like under that time of the Soviet occupation.
And they was working  you know  they give them the -- the hardest work  you kno w. There was Russian  Jewish people  and Polish people was treating the worst.
But deep down I heard that the German...the biggest mistake  we were talking in the army  that they're killing prisoners  Russian prisoners  in that time already that the Russians knew that the Germans are killing thousands of Russians and you have to fight not for...we're not fighting against Russia.
Were there accusations of people  such as yourself or your colle agues who were in volved in the  arranging the transports at  people who were in it for themselves   trying to make money  did that accusation  did... Not an accusation  accusation that anybody has stolen money or abus ed money  but I had of course enemies  particularly around Jabotinsky's  there were a few people who were just   German Jew and ther e were Russian Jews and who were big people in the organizatio n  so now the whole organizat ion didn't   only it.
You know  in the early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi.
Yeah  I mean  there was a ki-ki-ki -- mail was -- mail was still going -- going across from -- by that time -- I mean  that part was already under Soviet control  but that doesnt stop a postcard which would -- which essential -- essentially would come in Russian to my -- to my aunt  I guess it would be  to my fa-fathers cousin.
How did you then come to join the uh Russian army?
Because of course  since it was -- since Russia  Soviet Union was on the Arab side  Polish people on the -- were on the Jewish side.
Im trying to recall whether I stayed actu ally with my mother for long  because I know that I ended up with youngsters even younger than myself  including some Russian children that were separated from their parents.
And at that time  the Jewish brigade of the British Army was operating in the occupied area  Russian occupied area  trying to get Jews who are returning out into Israel.
And this happened in all the part of the Moldavia when the Russian came.
So I was talk with my sisters  my brother  I says to the I says  you know  this is too close to the Russian.
A-A-Af -- one evening after the -- the Russian came to -- to Lvov and occupied the -- this -- the city  my father came at evening home and he said to my mother that right now we dont have anything.
How did it end up working out that -- The Russian and the Jewish partisan?
They threw a can of bloodwurst-- meat into the masses thousands of people got killed because amongst them was main ly the Russian prisoners who were a little stronger than us.
So they spok e Polish  my mother spoke German and my father  of course  spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.
Now  at the same time  Poland  the western part of Poland was under German occupation.
They came later on with tanks and so on  but  the neighbors were saying the  that some of our men were speaking Russian.
I dont know  the Russian ghetto actions were every day  and our ghetto th ere were two more actions  I think  I cannot tell you the amount of people that were killed.
On hundred years ago  in 1874  they migrated to the United States because the Russian who had promised them exemption of military service  wanted to force them to do military service.
When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939  my father's wife said to him  escape to the Russian zone  you can do that for a couple of months in September  October  November of 1939; you go escape.
My older son is married to Russian woman  a Russian woman and it was very difficult for me from the beginning  not because she is a Russian.
And before they come in to clean up all the rest of the units of the people which are  which you will find in the forests  whether it is Russian partisans or other kind.
Th is was in Bittem  and we called on the telephone the Russian military which was stationed in that town  and the Russian military told us on the telephone that they dont interfere with the Polish government.
And then once we got across we were ge we got all kinds of sandwiches and hot milk is they said youre safe here youre gone  youre no more on the Russian side  your se youre free.
So  when we came to China  I was three years old and I -- when I was about five  I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian language and all the other subjects.
Now the bars stayed  but once the Russian s came in  you know  th ey put like some boxes over the windows  so th-they couldn t see.
So they attach me  they put me in a uniform  some American soldiers uniform  and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat ( ph) and I say  before you go we have to cross Russian borders.
The superintendent of the building was a Russian  a old Russian with a big beard.
And they explained to us that when we come to the front frontier that Russian soldiers will come.
>> Bill Benson: I know there are some things you could have told us that were really terrible  where you were afraid of marauding Russian soldiers until you met men that would marry you.
He joined the Polish army later on  went to pol to join the Polish army from Siberia.
One time he was really [indecipherable] Germans  but by Russian -- by Russian people  sniper went through right here  and he died with the scar.
At the end -- this was -- they were very brave because the children were very small and they knew what waited for them if the Germans came so they -- so they left with the Russian Army and they also survived.
And then I got on my bike with a knapsack and -- and bicycled to the -- to the freight yard and I saw already people streaming there from all over and -- and then the -- the freight yard was periodically raked with machine gun fire from deep diving Russian fighter planes.
But first of all  I have no recollection why I kept it  how I kept it  where I kept it  because the first thing when the Russian soldiers saw us  th in what filth we were  they stripped their shirts and they gave to the women.
The Russian  the area that you had come from  was that still part of Poland at the end of the war?
But  on September -- September the fourth  over the radios  there were announcements that all military age men should leave Warsaw  and recruit in a certain city near the Russian border  in the eastern par -- eastern part of Poland.
And that time  when there was the German  the Russian got the pact  there was letters coming  you know  they let you so he se nd us a package we know where he is.
Yes  the Russian army  we went to pass the Russian army.
So then one day we saw marching in a Russian unit of POWs.
They were sitting there and I was sitting separately from them  and those Russian girls were picking that.
And you were able to pick up the ru Russian language?
Th-There is a risk Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 83youre gonna get killed by the Russian border guard  but its up to you.
We lived there for a little -- a very short time and Mother found out she could enlist in the -- with the Russian workforce and we got on a train that was rebuilding water towers.
Then we both realized that Russian is -- Serbian is much like Russian and neither is Polish and switched.
Because when Poland was attacked from the Russian side  and the Polish army left everything there so the farmers took a lot of guns and ammunition  they used to bury in th ere  in their places  and the Underground find out where those  some of the farmers  you know  they'r e patriots  and they will give us the ammunition to  to bring back to Warsaw.
And I came to Matrosov [indecipherable] but he was a Russian  he came in the first war took  and he he married a White Russia n shi goya and we went to I went over there and I told him  Mr. Matrosov  we got to find out  your neighbors who some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to destroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him.
We dug for whatever food we could in the forest and we stayed in the forest and eventually we saw the Russian army come in and take over  and we went out.
He joined the Polish army later on  went to pol to join the Polish army from Siberia.
They had a big choir  and...and... So  in...in other words  there was Russian Jews; but many Jews came from...from Iran  you know  the...the...the...the original Jews that lived there.
The next day  as Schindler promised  we did not hear about any announcement of surrender but we did see a Russian soldier  a single Russian soldier that looked like he was 20-foot tall on a horse that was extremely small.
Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 10 In her family  German and Russian were the language.
The other  I dont know  dont write what it was Russian or Jew.
My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of me for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist  and then be arrested because a child had said something.
I am telling you I I I was uh I was...I lived...Lithuania was under under these Russian czars and I studied law  the Russian law  not the Bolshevik law.
My father owned the high school  it was a Russian high school.ﬂ This secretary told.
Well  we lived in the Russian section; and my husband had a sister what she lived this time in Israel.
But you didn't know the Russian army was on the march at the time.
After the ghetto experiences and hiding  I sort of saved myself by going to school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat.
Another family was moved into our house to vacate their home for some of the Russian hierarchy.
And Russians took all our -- 17 September -- couple of days we were fighting with small group  pro-Soviet group  Communist group in this area close to East Polish border and near the Lithuanian border in {Orani} that was less small fighting and Russian Soviet tanks was surround our group and we was forced to surrender.
He fought in the Russian campaign; but unfortunately  he had a Jewish wife and two children.
Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didnt speak Polish  or they spoke it with an accent?
So you didn't quite believe it when you first when the Russian soldiers said the war is over?
I did not really  although I myself felt if I had been liberated in January  like some other people did  I'd have been volunteer for the Russian Army and I would have been the first one to go in to fight.
The Russian zone  I'm sorry  the French zone  English and American zone.
It comes about evening...late in the evening and we go to the Polish...uh  go to the Russian side.
So we h ad to take over their machinery and they sent them away to the front lines  to the Russian lines.
We also had to study Russia -- Russian  and Yiddish before we spoke Hebrew  because what I was [indecipherable] was that Jewish or Yiddish is a jargon  its part of German  which is not true  but I mean in the -- and you have to learn Hebrew  which -- and that was the modern Hebrew  not the religious Hebrew like [indecipherable].
Tell us what life was like -- what it was like to be under Russian attack  and then to be liberated  what that was like for you.
Oh  he took me once to one of the villages at the border and I remember we overlooked the Russian -- their collective settlement.
And I got the Russian  too  but I didnt -- they started always  ﬁDeath to the occupants.ﬂ This was their beginning.
So I had to go to school and learn Lithuanian and Lithuanian history.
In the meantime the brother of Mr. Frankel went to Belgrade to talk to the Russian embassy.
And then you make ee-ee noises and dance and youre like this  like that  you know  the Russian folks dancer  have you seen sometime Russian folk dancers -- Really [indecipherable] -- or th-theyre -- theyre very like country songs.
I -- I -- I ca -- I seem to be able to absorb it because subsequently when I was in the Air Force  and there was a sign down there  and that was specia lized training for to -- to study Russian for -- for eight months.
The Einsatzgruppen are  when they took over the Russian territory  they didnt send the people to concentration camps.
When the Russians occupied Bialystok they took the young guys  like 17  18 years of age  they took them into the Russian service  19  20s they sent us to school.
When the war broke out  the first day in 1939...as soon as the war broke out  the second day we had trucks that my father took the family  us and my uncle and another twenty people...whoever wanted to go...and we run away from Kielce to the Russian border to get away and I remember that my grandmother...t his I saw with my own eyes...took out  at that time she had twenty thousand .
But then I found out that they are allies of Germany  and they divided to this -- to this -- to -- they decided with -- you know Stalin and Hitler signed a non-aggression pact  you see.
And we alrea dy saw a lot of dead people on the ground at this time  Russian Jews that were killed by the Ge rmans that didnt evacuate the building fast enough.
Now the Germans had incorporated into their army some people from Russia  from the  from the Eastern Occupied Territories--the Georgians especially  the Ukrainians.
And he got to m -- he was POW  the German t-took him in prison  and he - he was a POW for -- for -- i-i-in the -- Russian POW in the German  and they treat them terrible.
He decided to volunteer to the army and he escaped from that particular town into the recruiting place of the Russian army.
One day– she sent  before she came  she sent a hundred and twenty packages to my name  because she didnt know where to send it and they were all Russian books.
It -- it was a Polish camp and a Russian camp.
Was a Mrs. Cherniak  she was a -- a retired teacher  Russian teacher  so we got together in group again  like in Poland during the war  there were four of us  were studying with Mrs. Cherniak.
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 42 Yes  we were ti we were fed apparently  you know  the the famous Russian thing that you can get on a train.
And then -- now unbeknownst to me also  by the way  the -- the Russian commander in the area  had ca-called on all German forces to surrender and furthermore had  i-in that order also  had declared that any German who tries to eva -- a ny German soldier who tries to evade captivity by putting on civilian clothes  will be treated by the Soviet armed forces exactly the same way as he would have been treated by the German forces.
And at that time apparently  the Polish government in Poland The communist government.
And they hated it  to be taken back to Russian lines  they just hated that  because once they got to Russian lines  they communicated with the flight crews that they had to walk all the way back into their country  back to the ar Red Army.
With them we found some others a nd eventually were liberated by the Russian Army.
I mean  I -- Yiddish I speak fluently  I would say.
So we was there  and then the Russian start to come again on German territory  you know  from the Ossen.
But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone  and I dont know how long we were there.
Hey toots  said he  and proceeded to talk to me and discovered because I spoke Russian and he was in charge of the PW and DP camps.
Eventually it became part of the Russian sphere of influence and the communists took over.
I dont know  she was very nice girl  and maybe she saved my life  Ill tell you  because I got mumps  and Russian doctor  they open the door  and they gave me in a glass I dont know  it was enclosed glass here  there was medication.
Yeah  I dont know if they knew  because the allies  this was later on  you know what I mean  when the Russian reached there  to the Auschwitz and before  you had USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 91-- most of the camps were in the Polish -- in the pa -- in po -- in the Polish territory.
What I remember of liberation...the Russian soldiers came into the bunker and uh somehow a few hours later there was some muddied soup which they gave to all the survivors.
It was Russian school and Polish school  so somehow I went to Polish schoo l. They allowed to.
We wo rk over there until... ya I receive a package from Poland when the German were together with the Russian were friends  you know  until 1941 they started the war.
So I took the horse as a shield and I started to walk slowly toward the Russian side  and I call...yal...I bent down  and first thing I took out the revolvers again.
So [indecipherable] What did you speak to your parents in  Polish?
And this was a Ukrainian lady who built this house  but she herself lived in a a really very poor little kind of a a home  and so we we rented it  or my parents rented it from her  and she very often then would take me to to a Russian Orthodox church  especially at Easter  I remember that again  because there were birds in cages  and it was an elaborate production  with flowers and so on.
That one was not thrown away by anyone  in fact I still have it among my souvenirs an d in fact I never knew 155 what it really said and of course  with the Russian immigration to this country here during the last decade or so  we also -- we made some Russian friends in Ann Arbor and I had that guy translate it to me  for the first time -- what  40 ye ars after Major Shike gave it to me.
When the Russian took over Proushinna  they build a big airport -- right outside from Proushinna.
Yes  because they were French  and the Germans were coming and occupying the Russian held territories in 1915.
indecipherable] finally run away  because you know Russian right away sentenced him to death  too.
And then  must have been about four oclock  five oclock in the morning and all of a sudde n the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier  Soviet soldier  came through first and then the whole body.
And the first Russian soldier was on a bicycle  believe it or not.
Then when I walked on the highway  the Russian didn't take me anywhere neither.
You could have easily pointed out somebody and said  Nazi  and a Russian would pull a gun and shoot him.
To the extent you know  what was life like while under the Russian occupation?
Except the Russian tanks were very small and they went through all the side streets and never hit any of these things.
Gods hand in all this  because you see  another little detail was that when we did this thing in 23 rd of August  the Russian advance stopped  or slowed.
She thought her husband was one of those taken by the Russian constricted.
Do you feel American or do you feel Russian or do you feel Jewish?
I saw in Dubno  when I was in Dubno  they near the cemetery they kept Russian prisoners.
But he said  \ Yes  I want to go to the Russian headquarters because we need help for the people we saved.\
I was called Maria  I am Maria in short; it is in Russian  Marsha.
Was there any -- did you know people w ho tried to run to the Russian side?
So those Russian people would welcome them  with flowers  and they would throw flowers at the soldiers.
And when the he I have lessons that time with he teach us  he he spoke to us Russian.
I went to Russian school there two years  I learned Russian and -- and -- under the Germans  you know  I learned Germans a little.
In the later years we didnt see Russian prisoners brought through Iasi any more.
A. And got pushed into the line of uniformed people guarded by just a few very young looking Russian soldiers.
