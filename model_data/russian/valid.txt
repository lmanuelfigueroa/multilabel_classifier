KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 22 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Russia a thing like that.
I went to the man of the kitchen  in charge and he was from White Russian  a Polish citizen from White Russia and he wanted to learn how to speak German.
She said in Russian [speaks Russian] Will I stop or not?
But one evening--night rather  mi ddle of night  the Russian Army came in.
There were Pols   lo ts of Polish   lots of Ukrainian   Russian POWs.
I was  uh  near...uh  two or three kilometer fr...from  uh  uh  small city--the name is Hera--which  uh  which never was  uh  in the occupied by the Russian.
We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the ghetto too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening.
It was one day when the Germans left  and the Russian didnt come.
41  exactly one week before the outbr eak of the war  on Sunday  suddenly Russian trucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave.
Theres a lot of closeness between the Russian language and the Polish language in a certain way.
And I have no idea what happe ned  but the next– my aunt was with me in the room and the  th e Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few hours later and she said  ﬁDont worry  everything is going to be fine.ﬂ And the next morning  we were given back the cart  the ho rse  the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go.
This woman had a garden outside the city  the old mu the mother of the young woman  and I had to and this one day I forgot all about my birthday  and I sh-she always gives me work  extra work and I said please hurry up  because Ill be late for the Russian kitchen  I have to get the food out.
He knew of no posture that would 12 impress a Russian.
And I said to him  by the way  do you know that I was Jewish?
So I was shipped  for three weeks of Russian refresher course  in Oberammergau   Germany  and you probably know Oberammergau is a place where every 10 years they give the the Easter thing.
There were many Russian partisans  well organized  who have gotten drops  military drops from Russia.
And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the camp and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up.
World War II began with Germany and Russia's invasion in Poland in September 1939.
And when we came out we were just pale and green and  and there were a few Russian partisans  maybe boys of age 13 or 14 who ca me and they looked at us and they said  in Russian    \ And who are y ou?\
I thought we were talking about the Russian p-prisoners of war.
I lived in Russia with the Russian people in the coal mines [indecipherable]  they wonder how come you are -- you are the only one working here and the -- the director of the mine is a Jew.
Now  at what point did you decide to go over on the Russian side?
The same day they were sitting a restaurant  a drunken Russian soldier killed my sisters husband.
Father took me along to view an orchard which was right on the Russian border.
I was in hiding and then the Russian army came and I went back -- I tried to go back to Czechoslovakia  but there was still war  yo u couldnt go back.
But later when I went to the Polish school  we spoke only Polish.
So the Russian soldiers  officers were from the honor guard  and marched in unison  a group of about 30  to every block  saluted and had a speech  the captain spoke  and when he came to our block--it was very moving--he said  the officer  he said he knows what happened to the Jewish people  knows what the Germans did.
After war -- after Germany take Poland and Russian take firs t all guns  all radio  all instrument against the enemy  and in Poland was not -- you ca nnot buy gun  you cannot have some ammunition  because everything German took out.
When it was quiet down  two boys  Russian young soldiers  18 years old  kids  come over to me  I should help them to take out Germans  surrounding the white flag from the trenc h. I said I have no right to leave my cannon.
A younger girl  she was Russian  she was real Russi an.
We came in together with another family  and in the middle of the night came a p easant  a Polish peasant  or a White Russian peasant  I dont know  and said you have to run  because there are German parachutists already here.
We saw the trains coming from the Russian border and there was a lot of trains with soldiers and some of them wounded soldiers or German soldiers  so we realized that the war was coming to an end.
My father understand stood Russian too and we moved over  right where we could in the corner  and the night came and wagons and the machine guns and the airplanes and the bomb.
And I wa s in those Russian quilted suits  you know  I had.
And then I would always go with them  and -- This would have been ‚40 -- This was ‚44  beginning of ‚45  really ‚45  and I would go with them and on one occasion we were coming back and there was a street photographer and so he took a pho -- they asked to stop  and they took three photographs and one of those photographs of me and two Russian soldiers is hanging on my wall in the dining room.
And some people  because the population was mixed  some were ra of Russian descent  lets say  or Ukrainian  and some Poles.
When suddenly the shooting stopped  and I said to Julian  am I crazy  or did I hear a Russian words there?
And I went into the line with them  hung back to the end of the line  and when we got to a bridge that was going across the railroad yard  it had a Russian anti aircraft gun and placement right there on the bridge  I ran.
Not only that  you see  the Russian law was if one person was a criminal  again  my father  then the rest of the family was also going to Siberia.
Of c ourse  other s radio stations  German  Russian and others were available  but we didnt we didnt feel like we have to use that at that time.
So they grabbed them out and shoot them and shot them and...and then they went to liberate the Russian camp.
The boys were learning Russian  but the the girls  three girls were not learning Russian.
We have to go to Russian schools  which was fine but -- if they sp oke Russian but we can't know the alphabet.
When you we re with these -- the Russians  and youre sleeping on the tables  and the Russian soldiers are sleeping on the floor  I mean  were you then free?
There were the Russian  a couple of Russian officers came in with vodka and caviar and everything you can imagine.
So th ere were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitc hen and there were three Frenchmen.
Millions of people killed and although we had interpreters  Russian interpreters  we had a meeting ta even before V-E day  it it was in late April  we were on the Elbe and we stopped  and the Germans stopped on the other side  that was agreed that we would that Elbe was the the the border between the two zones.
And any house that you want  you go in and you say that the Russian occupying army said to put you upﬂ. We had no strength to walk.
There was a Polish military outpost because it was so close to the Russian border and he also engaged in some exports of orchards were nearby so he would export apples.
One day a young doctor came in  a medic from the Russian Army came in into this place.
And the Russian soldiers every day came for a few days  they delivered a little bit food for us.
And they said  ﬁWho would like to stay in Austria?ﬂ And I saw those beautiful mountains  and that b eautiful scenery  and like I told you  at the Russian camp I was boar hunting  and I was riding  and I loved sports.
He give us one room in the cellar  and after the people came in this cellar  when the front came  the Russian ca me and the German was there  and the Russian came  the Russian get there  go back.
So she got the restaurant and she give me food and she says  I get you some money  and I and this time th e Russian was there al-already  you know  in Poland.
So  they had a large -- established a large Russian garrison in -- in Li bau and the town was full of Russian soldiers  and in the f -- as a kid  at first its a little exciting to see all these strange uniforms and so on  but we soon learned that these were really quite unwelcome people.
I remember even seeing the Russian soldier and I asked my father how come they dont have shoes on.
There was a Russian in which we were  English  French and American.
So now youre s-seventeen years old and you have Russian Right.
Hank pointed out in his -- in his memoir about that  that just the distinction between Kat -- Katyn -- tyn -- Katyn  K-a-t-y-n  which is where the -- the off -- Russian officers were.
And then what happened finally...finally  the Russian army started advancing closer to...to Poland because the Americans helped them out with arms  with trucks because they were really in bad shape.
That was one  you know  one person who -- who couldnt bear the -- who -- looking how we were punished and how we were beaten or -- then a group of girls run away  and from the same place where the Russian Latvian guy was working.
We were invited to the Russian parade which was across the river.
First you -- you will be killed.ﬂ And then we listened  and then I saw it  it was a Russian tank.
If it was dark bread  it was Russian s. If it was white bread  the W estern powers.
So when finally -- the Russian front and Russian Army did approach the area  the German guards disappeared from their guard towers and cautiously watched to see if that was for real or whether they will come back.
My aunt Rose  very sick  but she did make it until the Russian Army did come and did open up the big gate.
December of ‚44  I guess the Russian were getting too close  and then they just moved everybody out in the street.
And then -- course we talked about my brother and everything  and they were in good shape  th ey were lucky  and then -- of course we invited -- the Russian commander stayed there in the apartment  he s -- he lived there.
This person is with the Nilos and he was a little way uh friendly together but I get this letter from my husband that this person must be Jewish  very elegant  Nilos but Jewish  and I run up and I open the door and I am shouting at the boys...here is the  here 34 is the Russian army.
I went with the Russian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and th ey broke into every store that still had anything  I went with them.
When we went we come in the station  and we see there is bread  there is herring  there is whatever you want for eating  brown from dusk  we thought people we didn't see it in Russian for the last last time  you see?
But the civil Russian popula-- government in every community  including Kovno and Vilijampolis  disintegrated within a half a day of the first outbreak of the war  which was the night of June 21st  1941.
While a in addition  th ey learned Polish  and knew Polish  but Yiddish was the major language.
And now after so many years my fight was right  Po land is free  Russian Communists is dead.
Also uh then realizing especially in December that the Russian front had become very close.
Clear majority of the civilians taking care of that  except the Russian soldiers  of course.
And when the Russian la take over  her husband  president  and his assistant vice-president  they putting them on a truck  they were emptying the latrines  you know  like in the old days.
So on one side the -- the grandparents spoke Russian  and on the other side German?
What happened  we went to the Russian soldiers and we found somebody that spoke German no  we even found a Jewish soldier.
And so  since there were so many of them  I think 32 or something like that  they had to the th ey the old lady and her maid originally were the bosses of this Russian kitchen  but then they couldnt manage it  so his wife became the boss of this kitchen.
As the Russian front went  we went right with them  and from the hundred  soon as a town was liberated  some of us remained in the town to establish a Polish presence  and to start to organize -- organize security  and -- and civil offices.
They spoke Yiddish  Polish and Russian because it was on the border.
If that property would have been converted successfully  at the time of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might  it would have been worth millions.
That was his first jo b. And his second job when we were married  he work ed for the  the as a translator since he knew English and Russian and French  so .
So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even listen  so what they did is they gave me a 02:05:30 little bottle of medicine that the hospital gave me  and every time a drunk Russian  no matter how drunk he was  came in or something  they send me out with my all that green stuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman  and when they saw me coming they start running.
Polish Ukrainian became Soviet Ukrainian and Polish Jews from there were -- and Poles  not just Polish Jews --.
So -- but the base -- the language they spoke at home and the language we communicated -- Was Polish.
Fisiek ran away when the Germans were advancing  he ran away towards the Russian border.
And I ran over to him and I said to him actually in Russian (Russian word) I knew that meant friend.
So  that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet  and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans.
Because  you know  the front -- you know -- theres so many -- was terrible on the fr -- the -- you know  for the German -- Russian  it was so brutal.
He spend a n extra two years after the war  extra two years  in a Russian prison  in the coal mines.
I was given a pause.....a stretch jacket  prisoners trousers and hat you know...laugh..and a a Russian boots  winter I mean winter boots  you know.
And this Russian ammunition is this in this camp  which belonged to Gestapo Bialystok .
So he was part of the partisan group in Banska Bystrica.
We spoke -- at home we spoke Russian and on the streets we spoke Polish.
He spoke Polish and hardly any Russian but he tried to find some Russian words and said finally  finally you are here  finally you come  and we heard from the other side  out  out  out  you damn...the Germans were back.
And even the area was reduced and I believe in 44 when the Russian army got closer to Lithuania  X for sone reason and just evacuated us and took us to theconcentration camp.
You know I spoke Russian and I...so I went and I sent a telegram.
No  my parents were both -- I guess they both felt -- especially my dad  that they belong to the Russian Italian Embessy.
I say  ﬁI can't buy from you; I have no money  but if you hang around here for a few hours  I'll sell it for you.ﬂ And those were can  cans of American ham and beans  like C-rations  but big cans that the American  that the Americans supplied the Russian army with.
I mean  for example  one day L itvinov  the -- the -- the Russian  first foreign minister  the Bolsheviks  came -- came to the house  a party or something  and I was allowed to go into the drawing room downstairs  which as a rule I was not  of course  yes?
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 55 Yeah.
I went over there  and as I came closer to the woods  and I saw a few came out  is a -- Russians  said to me to lift -- to raise my hand  and they looked at me  and they ask me who I am  so I said  ﬁI am a Polish partisan.ﬂ I spoke Russian.
>> Bill Benson: When you arrived at Auschwitz  as you told us  your father was selected for work.
He said  ah Buby   we got word that he was killed in uh at the Russian front two weeks ago.
So when the Russian soldier carried me  she said to him  please  I  don't separate us  that's all we have each other.
This whole area was occupied by Russian partisans  so really there was no Germans there.
It was a really a huge army barracks that were built for the Polish Army way before the war  and there they collected all the surplus of broken up  damage d arms from the war  Russian arms that they 14 warehouse of confiscated goods and valuables (German) 16 collected.
So soldier Russian soldiers tried Soviet soldiers tried to come into your house  too?
So anyway  um  that is our  till the Russian came  and they freed us  and then he brought us to Helm  which was in Niederstow  and we thought that the only survivors in from the war  but there came there more survivors from different places  and we  Esthe r Raab we met there  you know Esther Raab  and uh  and some other people  and then we moved up to  to Lublin  and uh  because Lid  uh Selma was Dutch  so there was already  there was a lot of Dutch prisoners of war happened to be  they wanted to send them back  and all the Dutch people.
And a Russian soldier woul d stand with a gun over you.
No  they dont understand that  and as I said  I was in Polish army when we fought Germans  and we were attacked for Soviets.
Put on the black uniform  and with the French through several Russian controls  as a matter of fact  I got through Czechoslovakia to the American zone of occupation.
We didnt encounter any Russian troops  because Theresienstadt was pretty close to as far as the Russians got.
To Patesha   to my grandfathers hous e  some Russian soldiers came over and they said [speaks foreign language here] Pani  you know  when are you going to come back?
And they couldn't understand how come I... There was no reason I wasn't getting better; because not realizing I was drinking alcohol constantly with those Russian soldier. '
So then the British picked us up and took us in a on trucks to a town called Lubeck  Lubeck  or Lubeck was pronounced in English which was right across the line between the English and the Russian zones where I stayed and waited to come to the United States.
When you were with the Russian army  you served primarily as an interpreter?
So in your class  there were Jewish students and nonJewish students.
After the -- when the Russian occupation was -- was you know  equality was then -- then -- you know  you are -- everybody supposedly  you know  the minority  the -- we didnt have no problems at that time.
And as we were walking  I with a little friend of mine holding a hand  we sa w two Russian soldiers  and I -- that I will never forget  and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers  and we asked them to take us to Lomborg  and you know we covere d our head with -- with scarves  and we -- they shouldnt notice that we have typhus.
So  you had groups  people who worked fo r Russian  for them  with the clothes.
One  the American  the British and the French  but once you go into the Russian sector  you really -- if you have to  absolutely -- and sometimes we did have to  because the -- all c ity -- Berlin city  that had all the theaters  was within the Russian sector  so that you really had to just mind your surroundings.
But like I say again  I jumped off the train and then immediately followed all those Russian soldiers which was crossing the train going the other direction.
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 48 There was Szepetowka   there was thats as far as we went on the Polish  and then they switched to the Russian cars.
Immediately they arrested me and they put me in a big yard  with the rest of Russian prisoners  a schoolyard.
How little I knew that the firm was assigned to build the barricades in Krakow to slow down the Russian approach and also to destroy historical buildings from Krackow and all the bunkers around the German buildings because this was after the Warsaw uprise from the Poles and they expected it in Krakow.
So my two Russian friends came  \ Take the book \  and I cowardly said  ﬁI don't dare because I understand they're going to do it.\
He began the partisan when the Russian people -- the soldier run away from the German  so he had the couple  and he began to be bigger and bigger and bigger.
I was wearing a fur coat but in fact I was wearing a rain coat over it and took me to a school for Germans they brought from the Russian part of Poland to clean for them.
And th-this -- you see  we had in the beginning  Russian uniforms  you know that.
You know  even...even uh anybody in the Polish army  the Russian army  ...I got lots of guts  and no brains maybe  you know.
Because nobody wanted to hire somebody who come from Russia [indecipherable] and they call him Russian communist  with the name Folchuk .
He runs into a couple of Russian soldiers and asks them  where is the headquarters.
So you were -- were you learning Russian at that time -- Russian -- Or had you already spoken -- Yes  I knew the lang -- I knew Ukrainian a little.
And soon after that we kept going and we crossed the border to Austria and -- and there we were.
Now  this was the most illogical  stupid thing to say  because the Russian soldiers had two ha nds  what are they going to do with a piano?
What was it like for you to see a Russian soldier in a Russian uniform?
