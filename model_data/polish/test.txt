And the intelligence work  which is not very nice as allies  was to send people to investigate what was going on in the British  the American and the Russian sectors.
And he was he was a graduate of the Russian West Point.
How were you treated  or how was the atmosphere in the Russian hospital?
Actually my uncle  my father's brother  younger brother  died on the Russian front as a member of Slovak Army.
They had a very rough deal because they were against them  so they had to bring Russian people to fight the Germans  and those were the the true partisan uh to send out  you know  from .

I ran and there was this guy Andrej and there was like  you know  like razvedka7  we call it in Russian.
What happened is that a week before the outbreak of the German Russian war  the Russians went to a number of homes in the middle of the night  sort of got the people out of bed  told them get dressed  pack your -- your bags  and come with us  get on the truck.
We knew from the Russian people who worked in the Soldiers home.
Then it was belonged to Poland  but the Russian invaded this part of the country  of Polish country.
The train stopped in Italy  in Krakow  from the Russian front.
I went to a Russian captain  but otherwise th ey'll think that you come to take revenge on them.
I regret it deep ly  but I cannot converse any more in Polish  I cannot converse in Russian.
He was he must be a white Russian like we used to say [indecipherable] anti-Semitic  and later on  I f I feel sorry  I mean  it was a captain  and I thought always that he must be Jewish  because he was all the time so nice to me.
The only hope for us was this side  the Russian to come.
I had one suitcase in my hand and I stopped a Russian guy with a truck.
In our group  the family  my grandmother  my mother's father  he spoke Russian yet because he knew to write and to read Russian.
And whatever the Russian soldier got  I mea n  he was happy to get something for it.
It was also apparent  at that time  it was also learned  that Russian soldiers -- basically they didn't want to fight.
And then the next morning  I went home and I found that there was a Russian family living there.
While -- excuse me  while I was riveting -- joining parts of the wings of the p -- airplanes  I noticed a small notatio n in a Russian script  done by the Russian prisoners of war who worked at night shift  i-instructing us what to do and how to sabotage.
They said  ﬁW e can't send you to language school to learn Russian.
So some of the Russian army got ahold of them and shot them right on the tracks and some of them escaped  but some of 20 them most of the Jews were shipped to Buchenwald.
And when the train stopped at night and the other Russian soldiers came to look for foreigners  this pa rticular officer  who sat across this -- the bench from me  he said to the soldiers  ﬁGo away  its middle of the night  were all sleepy.
I know there was also a lot of Russian influence too  you know.
Because -- Oke -- -- the Russian missile did not ignite the fourth stage  so it never got into orbit.
Course Polish and Russian were my brother  my older brother  he was very intelligent  looks like it  but course when we get the paper I knew sometimes we got the newspaper somewhere by chance.
My husband was in very good standing with the Russian generals.
They came later on with tanks and so on  but  the neighbors were saying the  that some of our men were speaking Russian.
The -- there were some number of people who we re Communists  they were happy that Russian came  and -- I really dont know   it was -- that was our immigr ation  you know  we live in one room  we didnt have -- we didn t own anything.
It was the Russian actually  at that time it was the Russian German border.
The Russian didnt want to give the Poles the honor of doing something for themself.
And he was later on he found out through a friend  a Russian major  he says  Tom his name is also Moniek   after my grandfathers name  but he changed his name.
By chance  sheer luck  we were together with the Russian prisoners who worked in the same place with us.
We...I spoke very fluently Russian  my friend Kronzon spoke very fluent; and we told them everything. \
And that is  of all these betrayals that were talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government  what was left of it  betrayal by the  you know  small group of lets say refugees from tsarist Russia  who liked the idea of Russian domination  even if it was with their internal enemies before  betrayal by the Jewish community  or betrayal by Lithuanian Gentile Lithuanians  ethnic Lithuanians  who were communists themselves.
Our teacher o-of the Russian language was a Lithuanian diplomat  he was arrested  there was no Russian class there.
And very shortly after I would not say that I myself as a ch ild suffered much under Russian occupation.
And some people  because the population was mixed  some were ra of Russian descent  lets say  or Ukrainian  and some Poles.
Because listen to the Russian sound of the bullets  the noise.
So every time we heard steps on top  I went under the bed with my watch and bed  it was a kind of cot  and my uncle would run up the steps and scream in Russian  you know  the we there are just children here  and we are friends and so on.
The fascist government build some camps in the Russian territory  in Bessarabia and other part of the Dniester  the river Dniester over there.
It was a Russian Jew  Alexander Beltz   a very tall man  a strong man.
Have a you see  if I would be on Praga  I would be liberated in August when the Russian came.
We heard that the Russian czars were saying they were Christians  tried to compel youth...Jews to become Christians.
And  about a month before the uprising  there came a transport of Russian prisoners of war  Jewish Russian prisoners of war fro m Mins k. Well  in this  this transport  they picked out about 25  30 people  and they were all soldiers  all  one was a captain  that was a Sasha Pechersky   and they wanted anyway  the first day they came that we told them what's going on they want to run away the first day.
So it would have been that they were wearing old Russian  Soviet uniforms during this time?
It was apartment with a basement  with a -- with -- and it was very  very  very  very ni -- it was not bad  according to the Russian standa rds  because it was a separate apartment.
And when I arrived in the Russian Embassy in Berlin  they said  \ Look here.
JL: Well there was plenty of anti-Semitism in Lithuania before the Germans came before the Germans came; obvi- ously before the Russian came for that matter.
>> Bill Benson: What did the Russian s do when they liberated you?
Initially the Germans didn't come in  did they  first didn't you go under Russian?
It must have been in Russian   but Russian and Polish is relatively close.
No  I saw one Russian woman officer  having a piece of sugar  she was eating it with water.
Rampant typhoid  hardly any food  Russian plans attacking us  didnt know that it was probably a camp or so.
He broke a vein and at night...I'm lost that that two days after the liberation almost all my 18 The picture of the Black Madonna in the Jasna Gora church in Czestochowa 19 lorry-mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) 15 blood.
As soon the Russian came and settled their government  I went b ack to school.
Accidentally I was in the movies s eeing a Russian film.
Now  they were itching to re-establish this after the war and what better thing to do than to sell out these Russian people?
Then uh it was...I changed it  because Leib didn't sound too...uh modern  so-to-speak  wh en I went to Russian school in Harbin  China.
I think that he belonged to organization  the underground Polish organization  and he knew wh-wha-whats going on  and we knew that  y-you know  the eastern front is coming  that the Russian -- that -- that th-th-the German lost the Stalingrad and they are now -- now retreating  and we were v-very happy.
So what happened is is when I went to that good  I arrived  and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory  and at night USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 10the Russian soldiers from all around  from the good that I worked in  the ranch  from all the ranches they would come  and -- and Polis h soldiers they would come  and I would give them all cheeses and milk  cause the Russ ian soldiers werent fed either.
The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in  but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.
She took me her home  and she says I'll introduce you to pe ople who might help you and at that time that was the Russian part now.
For them it was only a Ukraine or a white Russian  you see.
They played pretty much the same game  they claimed that their mother was Russian  not Jewish  and there was a grain of truth to it  I think she had a Russian grandmother  and -- but all the ot her grandpa -- grandparents were Jewish.
And ther e was this young woman who spoke Russian and she also sp oke Polish.
So we were  were now only with our father and we were separated from our second mother and it was ju st terrible  but our whole li fe was up-side-down  from this time  because when the Russian came to Solie  you know  the first thing what they did  they said that my father is a ri ch man.
But two days later the Russian came  so we came down.
So  I scraped the word   ﬁEvrei ﬂ -- Jew  and I wrote in the word ﬁBelarus ﬂ -- white Russian  with India ink  the same color India i nk.
Well  that was one of my questions  is did they speak Russian as well  did they speak any Lithuanian  did they what were the number of languages  what were the languages that they spoke?
It was in the summer of 1943 and they unloaded us on the main road in the camp where we saw across the road British and Russian prisoners still finishing the barracks.
And in -- in -- in school were you being taught in Russian?
Not... And suddenly  we are overrun by Russian units  one after the other.
>>Bill Benson: And since you had been with the partisans  were you -- did the Russian -- regular soldiers treat you well?
You said this Russian girl brought you home -- Yes. --
And the -- for example  my mother spoke a lot of Russian.
Cause the Russian actually did allow native languages  you know  in -- in their republics and all that.
I was still in school because I had to learn Russian.
I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard what is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after Stalingrad and we knows that the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to Hungary and really I know I cannot uh mention what was the front situation  but it was a possibility to think that we had a little uh a little uh future  maybe that we will be the only person in Budapest  the only Jews to survive this with our   without without to take to deport...to be to be deported.
The 31st day  the Russian officers were shooting their men if they did something wrong  that was the atmosphere.
He possibly thought that shes Russian  and she was [indecipherable] and whatever  Polish.
At one moment  a  one of the villagers lifted his  an ax  trying to chop off our heads  when a Russian tank rolled by and noticed that and shot the man on the spot.
They came up to us  and said that were going to Germany because the Russian army is near  and well be shooted by them as collaborators to the Germans because were in ghetto  and theyre going to help us not to be.
But a couple hours later we saw a jeep full with soldiers came  Russian soldiers...and they told us that the 7 war was over right here in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want to.
And what youre describing is much more the Russian mir system  where where villages were collected in one place.
No  they didnt  because again they knew to as far as they knew  our father was in the Russian front and and my mother always s howed like she was so sad  she didn't know where Father was exactly  that they pretty much left her alone  as far as I can remember.
And the thats 17 Moscow (Russian) 39 there are places in Russia  near Belarussia and Ukraine  the Kozaks18 were alive there and they were working with the German.

Maybe the  the Allies and the Russian at that part  from the air  and then  they  they  the closest place was to send us was Theresienstadt.
When we came  there was a Russian man in there  and they took him pretty soon out because a big part of the people 4 were Jews that fled Poland from the other side where the Germans came and they took them prison...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either.
And So your first class is actually your beginning school It was Russian  yeah.
So we took -- I said  ﬁWhats going to be if he catch you?ﬂ The Russian is out - downstairs  you could see they working with the car.
I remember there was the Polish army which was associated with the Russian army.
In the summer of '44 I d ecided to join the Polish army and uh I was brought by the Russian  uh one Russian to what Poland...where the front was now in uh...Lublin was free.
And I started to write Russian  but it was very hard for me  because I never spoke Russian.
It wasnt it wasnt pure Russian  it was like English [indecipherable] smi sme they call it something simple  plain.
They caught the SS - the main... Maybe the Russian later caught them.
I didn't look  I didn't know him  and again  how we ll do you know Russian?
And so we had a lot in other departments  some Russian Jews.
But they worked with the Poles and Germans  so when they came around  the smugglers and I and the shoes went to a little where German patrol was standing and under their direction we went over to the Russian part.
And we are running the streets with the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia.
The second reason in -- in -- was because they wanted to slow down the Russian approach.
There was a -- a Jewish group  what with a Russian com -- commander  so we figured well maybe its a good -- so we got the idea to go.
Now  in 1945  the mother in Stockholm got a phone call from the Russian ambassa dor Mrs. Colontery  telling her not to worry about Raoul.

In our city  not the village  but a city and this is what they made out of it  you know  when the Russian occupation was there  they changed the whole thing  they made it look like nothing.

All the furniture  everything stayed back which we have never found  needless to say  even after the Russian came in.
You started to go to school in r had you s ah  one question I had  did you see Russian soldiers in Lwow?

The Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 21 Russian or Ukrainian?
And then I went with the Russian Army  we went to Jawiszowice  walking.

Only deserted of Russian army -- Went to -- -- would go  or adventurers  or gamblers were going to America.
And life was quite good 'til one day they come  a y ear later; and they decided they want to draft me in the Russian Army.

You can find escapees from -- prprisoners  Russian prisoners  [indecipherable] you know  they went in in the woods.
Who could write thats what we talked about  who could write the lines neater  who could read Russian better  do the arithmetic.
Of course  we were immediately arrested by the Russian USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0037 36 army patrol  taken not to jail  taken like the city hall  where we slept on a table or something  I dont -- and the following day  we were released.
They explained that a border crossing from Yugoslavia into the Russian ....in Austria.
One Polish army was established in Russia  which the Russian took prisoners  most of the Polish army.
And how did the Russians treat you ap -- ther -- Ive heard some stories that some of the Russian troops were always respectful.
But at that point  you would just point at somebody and there was no trial; the Russian would just shoot them.
Then they thought we are going to fall into Russian hands  in French hands  in German hands again.
And the Russian Army enter in two days after this  in two days  in Arad  and occupy Arad.
So we crossed  I guess  the Russian -- that used to be Russia.
And the Russians were so near us  the Russian soldiers  that at night we could hear the music.
The only general in the Russian army  a four-star general  so the wife had a daughter  again my age  and I start...they took me in.
So they billeted a whole slew of Russian soldiers with us.
It was not -- i-it was not the Russian zone of Germany  this was Poland.
Do you remember when you how where you were My my Russian invasion  I remember very well  and I have described it  and told about it many times.
My grandfather owned an upscale delicatessen store  and my mother tells me he brought home the most delicious things everyday from the delicatessen somethi ng like in Paris  and my grandmother  the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from the Russian city of and her maiden name was .
So he dela yed that call til -- delayed until finally after the raid  and these two fr -- fre -- couple friends  the Russian escapees talked them in and say  he got -- he gotta do something  in other words  so he left.
So uh this is all Russian Fortresses where the under the Czar they built it for military purposes.
She had a husband who was a Hungarian Jewish officer and they -- the Germans put those in the front of the Russian line so they should kill them.
Only he was  you know  wanted to tell us all about Russian union.
And -- and then another one  who lived not with his father in Balti was caught in an -- another thing  and also a pparently left and was on the Russian side.
No  the Russian prisoners were prisoners that were used as slave laborers.
I couldn't see what's in front of me  and I could see only that a gun is before my nose and I could immediately... but I couldn't see way in front of me or I couldn't unders tand that this must be a Russian because we knew that the Russians is coming  the Re d Army  so I saw...told him  Russian  don't kill me.
She says  ﬁI don't care if they are the French Army  the Russian Army  the Am erican -- it's a Jewish holiday.ﬂ 10 Pioneer (Hebrew).
We had -- just when the worst part is happening  the Russian troops were coming close to our borders.
And we had to move away a 100 kilometers from the Russian border.
Me  Ruben  and two Russian prisoners went out through the same hole.
Did he think this was a good idea  even though it was in the Russian zone?
And in the ni ght -- and so I didnt think of -- of locking the 115 door or anything and in the night drunk Russian soldiers came in and all the rooms where the lock was  they -- and they went -- they opened the door  but as it wasnt closed  it wasnt important.
The population also ran very much afraid of the Russian Army.
And then we had one Russian girl I swear to God  I dont remember how she got assigned to us.
And some of it we -- were also concerns because the Russian didnt like it  you know  we had to be careful about that.
And so I learned the Russian alphabet  we -- this is -- this was a must  we had to do all this.
The rabbi  the one that I show you the picture  he didn't speak any Russian.
They would take a lot of young people...very seldom Jews because Jews were already rounded up and and they were in camps  but there were a lot of Russian  Ukrainians and Polish young people and they forced them to go to Germany so they could work on their fields  because the German soldiers were not home.
But the Russian people  we had to stay away from ‚em.
And after three or four days  it seems like an eternity  they sent us to a camp which was being built by Russian soldiers--by Russian prisoners of war camp.
So  we are talking still about 1940  Chernowitz was occupied un -- came under the Russian [indecipherable] and we were blocked in Bologna  we didnt know what to do.
Then slowly  slowly  now this was 39 already  close to the 40s  the Russian come in.
Those 10000 people were taken to the called the Ninth fort in ghetto  and uh  previously Russian prisoners had dug trenches  and they all  everything was prepared  was done a master plan  how to exterminate the 10 000 Jews.
You turn it to number two  then he was talk  speaking Russian.
Do you -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 48 CE: We were at the farmer and -- matter of fact  a day before the Russian came  is -- is the children -- not the children -- SE: No  d-day before the Russian came  there was some birds and they flying up where we were hidden.
We were a year under Russia  and so when the Russian came there were -- all the stores were -- were taken away from the population  so ther e was no private ownership.
He got back  and he told us that there were Russian str eets -- I mean Russian soldiers in the streets  drinking and dancing and carrying on.
We both were from Germany  and we smuggled ourselves at a Russian troop train  which was going northeast  and we got out.
One of the things that stands out in my mind is uh Russian prisoners of war that were driven through the town and they were in just terrible condition  uh without shoes  without proper clothing  hungry  looking dilapidated and drawn and went begging  of course  for food and water and if somebody attempted to give them...or couldn't hand it to them  throw toward them  uh anything  any food and if they caught it or even if they didn't  the Germans beat them and even shot several people if they lunged toward the crowd to receive some food  they shot them  and that was I think the first awareness of the brutality of those people.
We didnt want to go into the Russian zone  so we went to the England zone  because from Poland firs t is the Russian zone.
There was -- after this  the Russian came back and they was fighting about the city of Przemysl one week  seven almost days.
The 16th of January 1945 we were liberated through the Russian troops.
When ghetto was starting  some couple which were Christia n and Russian and Jewish  they could choose the at least the wife could stay outside.
They spoke Yiddish and my father was probably Russian and Yiddish.
I remember also 12 years later in 1956  when the Russian tanks rumbled on the same street  to ward the center of the city.
I remember a picture of his father   my grandfather  because he was a very big  bold man and we used to have a Communist hero called Kotovsky  his last name  I don't know if you ever follow Russian history.
And I will never forget that  how my husband went to Moscow with the other person  and put on the table something I would the thing I dont know  about hundred thousand maybe  in the old  Russian money.
So the colonel pulled out a piece of paper and wrote something down in Russian and said whenever in th e future  Russians sort of try to attack us or molest us  to show that paper.
So  it was before the -- [indecipherable] the Russian regime was still the ware -- already talking about -- maybe a year or two later that -- that broke away completely  yeah.
They were not nice to them because they were Russian  Ukraine  whatever you want to call them.
ye you know  that two years before too  and also the two years during  you know  we had picked up quite a bit of Russian.
So on one side the -- the grandparents spoke Russian  and on the other side German?
It was very close to the train station  and when Russian left they -- they bombed the bridge.
When Polish was destroyed and occupied by the Russian  a part of the Polish Army was evacuated in Romania.
But then around November of '44  December  we began to hear the artillery  the Russian artillery.
But the main  the -- finally the main -- you know  the Russian  they discovered a trick thats -- in -- in order -- we were supplied with -- just like a bar of soap.
And next door was another factory where Russian prisoners uh were working on the propellers.
I -- When -- When I jump ed in to the train and I saw there were some Russian officers sitting and they showed me that I could sit next to them  so I did.
That thats a from Krasnovodsk   which is the port city on Russian side  Pahlevi is on the Persian side.
Instead  I landed in Russian hands because the people that wanted to brings us over there  agents of the Russians.
So with the Russian and th e German  we were able to communicate.
>> Bill Benson: Julius  your father had served in the Russian Army.
When he went to his - before he went out  he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with  and he said  ﬁIm sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group  the Russian group.
And after the theater he said  the Russian are looking for workers  and you know whose it's going to be again.
And the Russian soldiers came into the car  looked around  and who didn't look too old  they pulled out from the train  pushed them right under the train  and raped them right there.
There was also others  they real...they real... But when we...when we founded the kitchen  they sent me to the rich Russian Jews to get them interested  you know.
Well  most of my uncles were drafted to the Russian Army.
By myself  I learned the languag e  learned to speak because the Slavic language  Polish and Russian are little bit  you might say  more or less  related.
You should never forget they were beautiful Russian people and Polish people.
Lallier  we know that you know languages  we badly need you for your east European languages to be trained as a specialist in Soviet affairs  but you have to learn Russian.
So so you didnt stay with the Russian group  you formed your own Jewish group?
I remember long  mile long marches of Russian troops coming through from the east and going to the front.
They wanted to know if that Russian crossing point was closed permanently or whether it would be opened again  the reason being that they had made all kinds of preparations before they used that crossing point.
Oh  a couple couple men that were fl uent in Russian and whatever  they wrote they took piece of paper  they wrote similar format  our names  and we could we could buy or they could buy bread.
When the Russian s retreated  they destroyed the sugar factory and the buildings where the workers used to live.
Just before war started between Russians and Germans  they came  they left Russian side and they came back to Warsaw and my brother left right away for my parents to Kielce and were there.
EL: Well uh we knew that  that everything was uh that the  the Russian army was approaching.
So ah Moroccan  black guys  Russian girls  and it was an absolute holiday spirit with all these people laughing at not understanding what's happening to them.
There were some  but most of them were like -- like -- people like my -- from Russian Jews  and je -- Polish Jews from Russia who survived the war.
I had gone twice into the Russian zone  ﬁLets go with Walter  he knows his way.ﬂ Well  we were stopped  taken to an old forest rangers office  and some of the women were raped.
So they were afraid that something will happen  so they and and the Russian  a lot of Russian prisoners run away.
Yes  I was 20 years old at the time  yes  I and there was one woman  as I say  and she spoke a little Russian.
The -- the Russian didnt kill you  th -- you -- when the Russian came  you can go to school  you can do anything you want.
I was given a pause.....a stretch jacket  prisoners trousers and hat you know...laugh..and a a Russian boots  winter I mean winter boots  you know.
I was already 19 years ol d. I wasnt so emotional  but my younger brother  I remember he was kissing the Russian tanks.
One of the incidents that stands out in mind is uh coming to...sort of getting across the border between Hungary and Austria and hitting upon British troops who sent us back to the Russian side because we were in the wrong place.
So Prather told me in his letter I mean  he mentioned that he is going to that he has a a hunch that that he has already somebody that that will be able be in thats going to be helpful in my in my defection from the Russian army.
In 39  the Russian captured the west part of Ukraine  in whats today called Yes  west part west part of Ukraine  thats true.
And once they got on the Russian side  the Russians gave them a choice to join the Czechoslovakia legion by the way  by that time they established the Czechoslovakia legion in Russia.
They call us in Russian the runner ise -- the runner ups  the runners.
So one Russian officer came in  a very intelligent man  a nd he says  \ Listen  the war is over.
We didn't hear from my brother for a long  long long time and when we finally did  which I believe was months later  he was uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone.
Actually  Russian became my first language because while I was a 2 -year -old or 3 -year -old kid in Poland  I know my parents -- even though they knew Polish but they talked with each other in Yiddish  a Jewish lang uage .
Well  the Uzbeks are... Well  first of all  we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian.
Then when Zus  he was the commander of the intelligence of the whole forest for the Russian  and for everything.
From the P.A. system  we would hear how the Russian brave Army was retreating and so on.
I tried I I edited the Soviet history from Russian into Polish.
So she would get postcards in -- in -- in -- in Russian and sometimes it would come in Yiddish and so on.
I sensed it of course  and I resented the fact that my parents did not trust me  and that was probably one of the reasons I did not join the Russian Yout h Movement  the Young Pioneers because everything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a child.
So I was -- had opportunity at to go to the pole -- to the Russian school.
When he returned  he became a officer in the Russian army  and he traveled from to the and back again.
Wed see a lot of trucks  tanks  but we didnt know who they belong ed to  whether they Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 61were Germans  or Russian  or American  we didnt know who they were.
Scrobof had a uh  POW camp for Russian Soldiers  and one of our bullets from our rifl e hit one of the ----------- accidentally  and got killed there.
Were they the only people who were in that camp  the people who were marched from Romania or were there also Russian s there?
He -- after the -- I-I think after th e -- the liberation that the Russian took him back to the army and he was killed in the army  yeah.
Having believed all this German propaganda about how when the Russians came in  they were so wonderful for the Jews  my father set out to the Russian headquarters to find out if it is possible to be transported back further behind the lines.
And my father lived in a place called in Russian obszy zycie  its communal life   communal life like a community in barracks.
So it had no impact on me  but when we got in and the ne xt thing that I reme mber after I told you about the radio  and the uvaga  uvaga  the attention  attention  my father had a motorcycle  and the Soviets sent out word  they wanted him and the motorcycle to report to an assembly point  and my father was goi ng to deliver that motorcycle to them  and mother said  no you're not  and she fainted  a nd because she fainted and that's the first time I've ever experienced anything like that  one of his friends came by and he told him  he says  you always wanted to ride my motorcycle  he says here are my gloves  my helmet  my goggles  take my motorcycle and de liver it to such and such assembly point  and the guy got to that assembly point with the motorcycle  and he was taken  a Russian officer got him  right on him  wouldn't let hi m go  and took him off to the Soviet Union with the motorcycle  and they left.
Some were fighting with  on the Russian front and were wounded.
My uncle thought somehow that he can buy up the German guy  with whom he made friends -- dragono -- I dont know what -- what he thought they would let him do  because many  or rather some from that area went into the swamps  whic h were surround -- which were not too far  with the Russian partisans or with the underground.
Were all the Russian soldiers helpful to you  or Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 9 Mos-Most of the time yes.
And and then comes our neighbor  th at Russian wife  Byelorussian wife of our neighbor.
We were green and white as a sheet and we saw in front of us three young Russian boys with very long coats and with rifles and we asked them \ who are you\  and they said \ nastuyahschi   Russki partisani .\
When my parents  when they were young people  they started in the University of St. Petersburg  so they spoke Russian . ‚
July  the end of July  we were told we have to go to the Russian headquarters to receive passports.
There were also ladies who walked down the street with strings of bagels  shouting [speaks Russian] Thats in Russian.
I mean you just sort of went there and you learned Russian -- How -- how old were you?
So after so many years of Russian occupation  the first one  the Tsaristic occupation  that remains.
And Itka came from a a Russian group  so she learned there.
So when the Russian gave me the [indecipherable] maybe this was psychol ogical  I always felt that might as well leave.
I took off my...somebody pulled the cover off my head  and a Russian soldier with a Kalashnikov trained on me  \ Who are you?
So we went another maybe 20  30 miles and we got to the Russian border.
Then we went -- together we went to -- he was in the Russian army  a doctor in the Russian army  and we went and occupied east part of Germany.
The Einsatzgruppen are  when they took over the Russian territory  they didnt send the people to concentration camps.
I was liberated and the Russian trucks and army came in and looked around.
So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was rather minimal.
Now  in the -- there were no secrets from me  so I saw that this will not be a life for me  and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see  in Russia  in the Russian system there were three kinds of people.
They gave me a a rifle  the automatic Russian automatic rifle  ammunition  and a a how do you call it  armband.
He worked with a Russian singer  studied with her  accompanied her.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 30 CE: Be-Because I was -- because she was Dutch and she didnt speak any Polish  and it was very -- only between the Jewish -- the Polish Jewish and the Russian Jewish  that we -- that we -- the planning of the camp -- of the uprising.
And Russian  which I took in -- in -- in -- in Czechoslovakia and Kosheetza  which I had to take.

And he became an anarchist  and by 15 or 16 he was living in another town  owning a bakery of his own  hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist movement and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905.
The Russian line was in trenches on one side and the German other side.
His sister  the one we we re together in in the [indecipherable] you know  in the Russian occupied territory.
With those papers my father hired a driver that we had acquainted from NKGB  which was the Russian secret service  with a big truck and that night we got loaded on the truck and wouldn't you know it was a night that I didn't have the stamp collection  and I didn't dare go up  ask for the stamp collection for that night and we took off with that truck.
So when German came -- oh  th at was also -- before German came  when Russian decided was escape from German  he gra -- they grabbed my father to the army because they needed medical corps.
If they are Russian tanks  fine.ﬂ Sure enough -- and I told to the Germans  ﬁYou sit quiet  all.
The Russian was there and we going back  and I was -- we went to Ringelshain in this one -- in Sudetenland  you know  and Czechoslovakia and I was there.
Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 17 They spoke language which is very sim ilar to Russian  so later when when we were in Russia  I had the very easy time learni ng Russian  because I was already exposed to Belarussian language  which is  like I said  is very similar.
Lets say  we drew conclusions what was happening in the eastern front  when we saw trains going through Warsaw with the German sol German soldiers  you know  that no ears  no noses  no hands  because of the frostbites  from that famous Russian general.
And we found in the papers that you are a kindergarten teacher  so you will take over this whole um Russian village except the the woman between eighteen 'til thirty-five.
And I say  \ Well  you know  I re ally know this area very well \  so the uh the Russian who's...you know  \ you can really unde rstand Russian reasonable well.\
They did the same thing what they did  claiming that they are sympathetic to the to the partisan  to the Russian partisans.
This is a group who took all the arms the Russian left and we have to send it to Germany.
So he said that he will not get in the Russian -- in the German and that's what he did.

We got a pretty good sense from the firs t interview about what happened when the Russian occupation of Sarnee began in 1939 and then subsequently the German occupation happened and you mentioned a little bit about your life before all of the horror began.
She was the most gor geous  beautiful African-American Ive ever -- African-Americ -- at that time we called them black -- African-American girl Ive ever seen  and she came to me  and she said  ﬁWe dont do those things here.ﬂ I said  ﬁI just finished being in a concentration camp  in a displaced camp  in a Russian camp  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 38youre coming to tell me that I cannot take a picture of that woman because she has a different color skin?
And at that time  the Jewish brigade of the British Army was operating in the occupied area  Russian occupied area  trying to get Jews who are returning out into Israel.
I came in at the ninth with an examination because on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into school and it started a new life  sort of  in a way feeling of joy  even though everything was left behind and all of a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat.
We walked this way and the Russian soldiers came that way.
it became part of Polish  because [indecipherable] I cant re-recall how many miles yet to the Russian border  because it  you know  was se veral hundreds of miles to the Russian border  so it was still well in well in Poland.
The woman will close the shop and he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee from Transylvania  like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee  refugee from Transylvania.
Others lived in  which is called Ukraine and my Postalistichi Novy its man and he learned Russian quickly.
So they ask the government  the Russian government to do that.
And he shouted to the Russian  to the soldiers to come over.
11 No  the only information we have is this you know  and this is anecdotal information  that somebody saw him on the Russian front.
Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and Poland would be Poland.
So he arranged with the general  a Jewish general  a Russian  who was taking a whole truck with machinery back to Russia and they had pass from Germany through Poland to get to Russia because German [ Germany ] is on one border  Russia is on the border of Poland so.
At that point he had decided not to go into teaching which he had planned to do because there was this shift from Russian studies to Viet namese and Southeast Asian studies and there were literally no jobs in academia.
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 74 Between the Russian.
There was a military  a Russian military  hospital train on the next track.
He got killed with the first Russian bomb  so she got saved.
Right  you know  and in and I I dont to I dont think there was any Russian normal person that did not go to some kind of something like that.
You know  they they werent allowed to I mean  in general  under the Russian empire  it was a different system of land distribution  and who owned it.
And we were in the French zone a couple weeks  until they made up Interview with Ezra Sherman May 16  2014 92some papers  and we traveled to the to the end near Bergen-Belsen  on the British zone  but we have to smuggle over the borde r  between the Russian zone.
But  on September -- September the fourth  over the radios  there were announcements that all military age men should leave Warsaw  and recruit in a certain city near the Russian border  in the eastern par -- eastern part of Poland.
Well well  what ha really happened is that my father was drafted into the Russian army.
Then when the war broke out...the Russians  when they went in  so they took us from this camp and they sent us a camp a few miles away from from there because they brought in the Russian war uh PL... No.
When we didn't want him to get in the hands of the Russian because they will not have any mercy on anybody  and German particular when they fi-find out that he was the owner of the factory who was using the slave labor  so we decide that we will prepare getaway car for him and his group--his wife and his friends and who was there  what he wants to take with him  and we would assign a group of our people will protect him and take him out from the camp  and five minutes after 12  12 o clock midnight  on the  on the day of uh May the 8th  you know  between May 7  May 8.
05:12:46 First of all  at the beginning  in the camp  a  a young girl was so excited  and we knew that the Russians are coming  the Russians are coming  and she run  and wanted to greet a Russian soldier in a tank  and she got killed.
So the whole family was walking from that town  eight kilometers  already with some Polish soldiers that gave themselves up to the Russian military  and we also walked back and as we came to the city of Rovno  there was a guard checking everyone who came back into the town.
In 1939  the Russians came in  and we went to the Russian school for awhile until the Germans chased the Russians out  and came in  and occupied.
So I remember an American o fficer was saying  \ Are you sure you want to go back into the Russian zone?
And after their the show  th at they were putting up a show in the theater  they were saying  the reason we are entertaining  and were going around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking prisoners for work.
For instance  when we left Poland to Czechoslovakia  and from Czechoslovakia to -- we were forbidden to speak any Russian at all.
We were living there for a couple weeks with a border guard  a Russian soldier.
And the sending to the front lines to face the Russian front was a big punishment because  as history told us and we know already with Marshal Polis at that time  which would be the armies which the big rift did happen.
And then  uh  this was getting into an area that was declared by [the] Yalta Agreement 12 that would be Russian territory.
ﬂ By the time some Russian or someone occupier would end the war.
So  to to compare if a young Russian tried something  yes  it is very bad  sure  sure.
And we were in Linz at that time  which was the border between we were wa iting for the opportunity to get into across the Russian zone.
One from our group worked in the woods  sent to cut fo -- for -- you know  for a week and he was work and they left -- you know  they stayed there in the 35 woods for a week and at night Russian couple -- couple -- Russian partisans came over.
One thing  was the Russian dentist on the train with the big coat -- Yes. --
I learned very fast Russian  to write in Russian and read.
This came from the Russian soldiers and they said  when my mother told them she was Jewish  ﬁYou must have collaborated with th e Germans.
I was going to be an interpreter because I spoke Russian and I spoke some English at the time.
And the Russian army came closer and we evacuated  the whole army  Riga  the German Army  so the ghetto was eliminated and old people disappeared.
It wasn't true but he was stealing it from the Russian which was...they steal from him.
I don't -- I  I cannot remember  because it was in the late summer I 7 intelligence service (Russian) 8 bandolier (Russian) 12 remember  because in '44  at the end of April  the beginning of May  we already were discharged from the from the partisans.
I never can do  and the Russian came and I could be Russian.
And before they come in to clean up all the rest of the units of the people which are  which you will find in the forests  whether it is Russian partisans or other kind.
Thats the way when the Russian people came to us and they were.
Trains were going east and west and north  and those were trains that the Russian armies were moving from one side to the other.
My wife remembers few Russian words  she was also in Russia  but I dont remember nothing.
In a week  he came back  and that's how I know the story  because the Red Cross had--the Swedish Red Cross had--I met later on in Sweden  and he said Raoul came back  and behind him there were two Russian officers on motorbikes  and he said  \ As you can see  I have some Russians behind me and I am invited back  and I have no idea if I am invited back as a visitor or as a prisoner.
And wa -- I will just give you the title of one of the songs and thats ﬁPuppyrosen.ﬂ Puppyrosen in Russian means cigarettes.
So their basic Russian was based on the military requirements  you know  in other words  what what do you ask  you know Right.
So  when we came to China  I was three years old and I -- when I was about five  I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian language and all the other subjects.
But there was one place over the Mulde River where we had to cross  that was a separation line  the demarcation line of the Russian and the American forces  and the Ru ssians let us go over.
In night time  take...take...uh...the wagon with the horses  put full straw on this and we will go under this straw and you will uncover us when you see the Russian Army.
Pret ty soon  we heard some voices knocking  some sound knocking at the door of the farmers house and later we learned that Abraham  his little girl and his wife  at th e last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the village  were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at.
You know  coming out of the concentration camps  coming out of that place  that Russian camp  and everything  and he brought me presents  and -- and he took me to pl aces  but I could not speak USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 17Jewish  and I could not speak any other language with him.
B ecause they had some kind of an agreement that the Russians would go to  to Warsaw  or whatever they had the agreement  and the Russians came  and  and  we had the Russian officer sleeping in our house because he was in charge of the bakery from the man wh o saved our life  and he came to us and he said  \ Listen  you better pack up everything and take your children.\
You know  in this time we become...uh...the Russian comes us  and we become  you know  police by Russia.
So that I I really dont know what the population of the town would be  but it had a beautiful Russian Orthodox church  there was a Catholic church  as I remember.
Yes  because he was born under the Russian system  so he spoke Russian  Polish and Yiddish.
And I wondered if you could tell a little bit more about  well the time of liberation  encountering the Russian soldiers.
You can take a name  like Russian name  like Vera  and tell that you are Vera  you dont have passport.
You need German to talk to the German authorities  and you need Polish  Russian  whatever  and Lithuanian to take care of the refugees.
And then in late August  maybe early September  my father came back on a Russian hospital train.
We were very close to the Romanian and Russian border  was like 30 kilometers or something to the Romanian border  or 35  just nothing.
A lot of Jewish  as well Jewish U.S. soldiers  Russian soldiers and Im not sure but I something in my back of the mind  I Im su re that the midwifes stepdaughter  who was a photographer  I believe she took pictures.
And I worked in factory in the  some secretarial work  I had picked up some Russian and that was en ough for my job.
When Willie came then  we  I got into the jeep and we went with th e jeep with a Russian soldier that they had given him to accompany him and with a sergeant whom we called Red who by the way was here a few months ago visiting wi th his wife.
She did learn some sp some Fren ch  and when she was in school  but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to speak Russian.
They Yiddish  Polish  Russian  I spoke [indecipherable] in Russian  German And English.
Some how the Russian soldier  he didn't know how to read it; and he gave it to one of the SS in the wagon  and he somehow explained to the Russian soldier that I'm just coming home from the concentration camp.
And after the war we had a big influx of Jews from -- from eastern Europe from Nort h Africa and -- and the second generation or third generation of -- of the Jews born to Russian immigrants or Polish immigrants because the school system is so open went to higher education and all of a sudden they are engineers or .
In those three days and three nights  with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day.
Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there.
I didnt know Russian  but I unde rstood those few words  it was very similar to Polish.
So my mother took us every day  someti me in the evening  sometime in the afternoon  but not at dark  and she spoke Russian and she spoke Polish to the other.
So I started to be scared to tell cause my husband told me  but I...I will not tell because these Russian s  they can...they can  so I...I...I didn't...I...I was thinking I told...so they didn't want to tell me.
And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers  and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed.
So they decided  and its  I think  historically documented  to let the Poles kill themselves  you know  before they had their own Polish army  which is part of the Russian army  take Warsaw .
He uh supplied meat to the Russian...to the Polish garrison at the Russian border.
And I said  ﬁCommander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich  that son of a dog says this and this and 21 Polish watch (Russian) 22 Interpreter (German) 24 this.ﬂ And in Polish its skurwysyn 23 in Russian  its sukin-syn.24 In English  of course  you know what it is.
Nu  in 1940...1944  they take the...the Russian army... army... uh... came back  nu  and the Germans...nu  how to explain?
Some prisoners  especially I remember there were Russian prisoners  too  from the war  they came in much later and they 05:24 were much stronger.
The Russian prisoners of war were marched -- that's what she told me  to the town and even when some of the non-Jewish -- well  the Jewish population couldn't but the non -Jewish population would offer them water  they would hit them with the rifle butts and would n ot let them accept the water.
My older son is married to Russian woman  a Russian woman and it was very difficult for me from the beginning  not because she is a Russian.
They were uh uh drafted to the Russian army  but then they became uh not the only but they became uh working...uh uh..what they call that...work...working battalion.
You see the difference between Russian occupational zone and German was that they we re both death enemies of Poland.
But I applied to the language school because I wanted to help with the Russian.
But then  since Czechoslovakia had -- was supposed to become independent and the Russian a-and the American troops were supposed to be withdrawn  by October the Russians were trying to round up their nationals and ship them back and my illness was -- had regr essed far enough that it was no longer an excuse and we realized that we would be in trouble if we didnt want to go back to Latvia again.
They ask the Russian  they a and the American  they ask the German.
The last  the last bullet  the Russian bullet got his hand  his left hand.
Her state of mind at that poi nt actually improved  or she took heart from the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the concentration camps working at Telefunken  but there were also German soldiers who had been injured on the Russian front   many of whom were missing limbs and Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 17were put to work basically  as best they could in the factory.
I dont know how they did it  becaus e they spoke only Yiddish and maybe a bit of Russian and they had to travel  of course  by horse   and by cart until they got to the train and then from the train they should have crossed the sea by boat  and then to arrive  but they made it.
He was waiting few days  because it happen in another cit y  in Tarnopol that after the German left  and the Russian came  the Jews went out and then th e German came back  and they all were killed.
And later she got another education and she could teach Russian  English and German.
the Russian soldier  but it was not that simple  was it?
But at that time  it was towards the end of the war  and they were very much wrapped up with the Russian front that was very close to us.
That m-means July 23 rd on my birthday  probably this is when the -- the Russian came.
He wanted to volunteer to fight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took  ‚cause they needed people to fight  and he was a ccepted.
And when I learn that he is Russian  I told him I am not going to answer  because I dont trust Russians.
He organized this way  so on the night of May the 7th  to 9  to 9  to May the 8th  we disarmed 12 o clock at night all the soldiers  and we put them in the cellar  and we kept them till the Russians came in on the 11th of May  we were protecting the camp ourselves  we put our own people on the towers  and we kept the guard the inmate  and we closed the camp because we were surrounded with over 100 000 German sold-soldiers around because they were be tween the American  French and English troops on the West Side  and the Russian troop on the East side  and we were just in the center of the whole mess  and we put a big sign  \ Typhus inside \  so nobody could enter because the Germans were afraid that the typhus could be spread  and we put -----------because nobody---  and they lib--we were liberated by ourselves  but officially on May 11  the first Russian soldiers entered the camp.
However  I think the Russian Army still is involved in a lot of drinking.
And it wa -- it was from this camp  which happened to be between the German and the Russian front -- we were in between -- that I escaped into the Russian side and to Poland.
Because we resented you see  we considered Russia inhuman land  because its the minu te you cross I am not talking about the Russian people  but the land is inhuman.
And my father started to work as a tailor there for the army  for the Russian army.
A Russian grabbed me  and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards  these young shnooks  I think two or three of them or f our of them  I think four of them  few  because some of them run away  lined up along the wall.
Viarel Trifa was perhaps the best known in the early years  but there were others  Verence Korair  wa -- who  as a Hungarian news paper editor in Transylvania  and Vladamir Sokolof wrote for a Russian paper in central Russia that was published by the Wehrmacht for the local population.
Because after liberation  they all -- w-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer  and we were all going to bike to Prague  and the girls couldnt do it.
01:10:34 And when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian  because the Ukrainians were collaborators  and they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish.
Whatever we heard after mostly was that Russian soldiers were correct.
And they came to Iwje  you are born in Nikopol  so you are a Russian citizen  and finished  and no more discussions.
The next thing  it was a matter of I don't know -- the next thing  we hear bagging on our barn doors and Russian spoken.
They establish a governor who work American governor and the Russian governor altogether  and they establish peace and harmony  whatever it is.
Not mein kampf   but the last kampf   the last battle  to see they they wanted they were very muc h disappointed to fell into the ru in the Russian hands.
31 Well  my mother told me that we had withdrawn a large sum of money before the Russian occupation occurred from the bank  a considerable amount  but not everything should be suspicious  so only a part.
In my heart  I was very happy that even if I get killed that I knew it was a Russian bomb  not a German bomb.
We sang at special Jewish occasions and we sang carnedi-- Carnegie Hall and in the Russian tea room  and at the Worlds Fair  and all kinds of things.
So that meant that we were liberated  came more Russian soldiers.
So  I picked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place.
The people who were listening to the news kept always telling us which town fell into either Russian hands or allied hands  so we were always trying to figure out how many miles left before they reached us.
On 17th  when Russian attacked  we were still in Poland  free part of Poland .
So  we loaded the railroad with th e stuff and then by then already as we were there a little few weeks because that already was towa rds the end of the war  we started receiving German soldiers from the Russian front without noses without ears  frozen hands.
One was from [indecipherable] army  one was in the Russian army.
My younger brother's name wa s Sherman and we called him Cenia   was Russian.
I came  I see two horses with a wagon from the Russian army  and the bike and the radio is the same I think this is like the same [indecipherable] the Jewish people had [indecipherable] my friend [indecipherable] .
The Ukraine people...it was...they was working in their villages  and  nu  someone it was  nu  when the Russian was...he was policeman.
But then I truthfully  I dont know what happened afterwards  you know  because he was called to he was called to Moscow   to meet with Molotov  for a certain for for certain reasons  and fortunately for me  I I was not able to see him when he came back  because I was not in the Russian army any more when when he came back.
And from there we went for a few months to Plaszow   to a military barrack  and we were helping there clean up  the closing what came [indecipherable] it was in 1941 - 42 closing and the military equipment  what they brought back from th e front  from the Russian front  that they were cleaning.
And in the light of the jeep you saw these Russians  not the  the Russian horses  small horses  these wagons coming back.
The ji -- Russian wanted to immediately 100 prosecute him  but my father testify  so that was -- they left him alone  but he was a old man  and he die  his wife die.
Mili Ribbentrop was a German repres-representative of of the government  and the Molotov was the the Russian like min Soviet.
Only that one I saw the first time is when we were in the Russian camps  and we went to work in a ca Right.
And I had...uh...the hot soup and the bread again and he was...he told me he made an arrangement with a Russian Jew who has chil...children that are...uh...manager of a cohorse.
All of a sudden we saw trucks and Russian soldiers coming.
And he said  \ The Russian front is very near  and these days we will be taken over by the Russians and we will take over Poland back again.ﬂ Talked openly.
I have a feeling something  I said  I have to as I go out this door  the Russian goes by  I catch him by his hand  take him in this door.
I said  no  no  Im sorry to tell you  but Im a Russian officer.
But then  we had an apartment and then we faced somethi ng else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they  they got  they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in  in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people.
So  what people did when they got their luggage if they got their luggage  many people didnt get their luggage they would take what the belongings they had  they would go with something to the Russian  where the Russian concentration camp was.
And it was called the boyfriend in Russian  different na me.
It was supposed to be a barricade before the onslaught of the Russian army.
It means you have to go and meet the Russian army  the Russian army Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 72needs you.
My son -in-law  Nikolai  Russian  wonderful man  said  ﬁJacqueline  why don't you start writing your memoir?
Nineteen...maybe early 1915  1916; and after the Russian revolution in 1917  he decided to stay in Moldavia.
I said uh English  German  Russian  and I still didn't say Hebrew.
No  no  then we started to move with my wife and a group of other people west away from Russian zone because Poland was under Russian influence at that time.
So she got the restaurant and she give me food and she says  I get you some money  and I and this time th e Russian was there al-already  you know  in Poland.
Nathan: Yes  she spoke Russian  Polish  German  of course Yiddish and Hebrew  you know.
So one was a train that actually did arrive at Theresienstadt  and the second train was captur ed by the Russian Army  and this was the third train that had come from BergenBelsen.
How my mother used to love to read books  and wa -- a lot of the books were in Russian.
And he did a degree in glass technology which is an unusual subject  but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought his parents over to England becaus e they had  in fact  they lived in Krakoff and as the Germans marched in they marched out towards the Russian si de and eventually the Russians sent them right deep into Russia and although they had an awful war  there were no worse off than of the Russians because nobody had any food  so th ey were discriminated against where they were and they came back to Krakoff right after th e war  and then we brought them over to England and they always said they had been the happiest years of their lives.
I was so shocked  it was so but it [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] I cou I couldnt take that a Russian should do to a Jew.
And right smack in the middle was one car reserved for the British -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the British who would accompany the train and tried to -- would try to protect us against the Russian soldiers.
As a matter of fact  he used to tell us  the Russian front is -- it's about 50 or 60 miles away  and they were scared to death of the Russians.
I feel so  that they threw less shells on the Russian territora territory than the Germans.
They used to have the Russian Hebrew congregation used to have something one night a week where all the German Jews  somebody had organized them to come together  they tell each other wha how they got a job here  how they got a job there.
I dont know why I was called for -- by such a Russian name  Claudia.
There was another fellow  a Russian fellow who was also an inmate and with whom I befriended.
And in s -- late May  they -- Russian planes dropped off military -- military what you call it?
He give us one room in the cellar  and after the people came in this cellar  when the front came  the Russian ca me and the German was there  and the Russian came  the Russian get there  go back.
The soldier tells me  the Russian soldier tells me  you know  this one is a Jew  this officer .
It wasn't unusual at that time you know  because the  the Russian was coming.
Of the uncles that were taken to the Russian Army  two of them fought and died on the front and the others survived  another three survived and came back to Drohobycz.
I wrote a nother book -- I called in the Russians and compared notes with some Russian experts and I kept writing books and articles and going to the United Nations and going to all these meetings  keeping abreast of what was going on  trying to influence it  and nothing much was happening.
And as I was staying  there were two  maybe four young boy soldiers in German in Russian uniform  you could see that they were Jewish.
Now  I dont th -- I dont think that that was quite as di -- as long on my mothers side of the family  b ecause I understand that from their aspects  my mothers grandfather  m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when Poland was under Russian law  and rode across the border into Germany  into -- into Silesia.
The rumors were also that the Russian army is moving toward Poland  closer and closer.
Be caus e she has not  she is only one and she has mother who is Russian you know orthodox.
He was in the Russian Army and was taken prisoner of war by the Italians and we didn't know about it.
But I never went  but they were giving and the Russians told us  if we catch anybody entering on the ship with Russian money  you go back to Siberia.
I couldn't get a job anywhere because wherever I went they wanted documents and -- or my original false documents said that I came from a little village near the Russian border and I kept up with it  and my name was Krystyna Maria Ka lnowska.
And she was taking all this news to the... They were afraid of her  of the Russian girl.
So they were showing a Russian movie without subtitles  so I was si tting there and explaining them in Polish what was going on and behind me was sitting a young boy with his friend and this was my husband  my future husband.
No  this is this is a de-delicate matter  because the allies were trying to convince us to return back to to remove us from their backs  because there was one and a half million refugees  slave laborers in Germany  and the countries of their origin were already under Russian occupation.
I saw Goering  Keitel  everybody and when I saw on television the things I was looking if I can see my brother-in-law there  because he had good connections with Redenko   which it was the Russian prosecutor.
It was very large  and made of wood  and it had many  many big rooms: music room  bedrooms on both sides  a huge kitchen and a huge dining room  where my grandfather entertained local big shots  wh ich is was where he got his power in the courtroom  because he was now he must have spoken a language Im sure he was fluent in Russian  and probably all the big shots in Lithuania were fluent in Russian.
They took us and they said we going to go on the track and you going to -- they gave us saws  he says  ﬁYoure going to cu-cut telephone poles and telegraphs and stuff like that.ﬂ The Russian says  ﬁOh  you do  we -- they lay an ambush ﬂ he says  ﬁwe going to protect you  atﬂ -- everything at night.
And one day we were standing  Mama  Pa pa and I  Mr. Brownig -- Browdig comes over and he says  a -- well  in -- in -- Ill tell you in Russian  see if you understand. [
The Russian armies eventually when word got to them  some of the escapees went behind the lines and told the story what happened to them.
I have a question about just after Lodz was liberated in 1945  and also in Germany at the displaced persons camps  what was it like meeting more children  some of whom had different kinds of experiences  speaking Russian  Polish  Yiddish?
And Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday night  I was dancing in a nightclub with the  with the wife of a Russian colonel -- the head of the Com-- of the whole Russian Army in that area.
And we were just sitting there  and all of a sudden  it was in the morning  March 11  1945  that we heard a big commotion  and somebody started to scream  \ The Russian are coming.\
He came  bu t sometimes drunk  had very curious habits  not washing himself  but spraying himself with a kind of an autocologne that smelled terribly  but this was common apparently among the Russian soldiers.
He runs into a couple of Russian soldiers and asks them  where is the headquarters.
Then  there is -- what do you call it when you commemorate -- a memorial  a memorial  and on the memorial in Russian it says that Russian citizens  100 000 of them  were murdered here  no mention of the Jews.
The Russian  the area that you had come from  was that still part of Poland at the end of the war?
And the summer of  uh  1940  it was a Russian ultimatum asking Romanian to cede the Bessarabia [and]  uh  northern part of Bukovina.
And  of course  Hitler sounded fiercely enough  was fiercely  and even had a chance in an American view and through some trickery he still could  with the help of Russian  of course  win  you know.
Matter of fact   one day  I walking in the street in the daytime  and there were many invalids - Russian invalids [and] they want to fi ght me.
Did they change the schools to Russian  and things like that?
They didn't let them into the group  into the army  in the partisans' army  but they were outside like protected by the Russian  by the partisans.
It has to do with Poland having been part of it having been part of the Russian empire  part of it being sal Austro-Hungarian  and part of it having gone to Prussia since  you know  in the 19 th century.
Was a Jewish officer and a few Russian soldiers; they were crying.
SE: No  we could see it  that the Ger -- that the Russian came.
Maybe its because of a 63 small place  they didnt know that we are Jews or that -- they call me Szurka  thats -- that was a Russian name.
And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer  a gentile  Christian.
With a long story  I got with this through and on the border   it was the borders between Austria  American occupation  Russian occupation  occupation.
By the end  when the German and Russian army came closer  they wanted to get -- cover up what they did  I guess  and the people from Kaiserwald  they organized groups of 40 men each day.
I was walking on the Russian side  yeah  from from Wlodzimierz Wolynski to the Russian side  because I was afraid to go back in same city  and because al they they were so anti-Semitic that we had to run.

You know  I left -- actually I left -- I -- when I was working  assigned to pru -- my town  Pruzana  I was in uniform  Russian uniform  and I have a gun  and I have a -- you know  its just like duty  like a soldier.
So ac tually then it was big celebration that the Russian army liberated Prague and liberated Czechoslovakia  because the true was that the whole Slovakia and Moravia   the Russian army liberated.
And two  three days later  the Russian tanks came into Bucharest  because the -- Romania came out of the war by -- by politic al maneuver with the king  and the -- Antonescu was arrested  and the Romania shifted sides.
And this one Russian sol I remember that  he took his coat  or whatever he had on top of his coat  and put it on me  you know  bi tha tha-that time I think I as I recall  I really felt scared.
He sent a letter to us and he stay on the Russian side of occupied Poland  in Lvov  in some places in that -- that were taken by Soviet Union.
I think it affected my my father was a so ldier through four years or more  and he knew of the horrible possibility existed  and I mea n  he didnt sit in an office during World War I. He was in the Russian front among going on  this  that and the other came out.
In Plze  they...it was then that portion became ...it was...it was divided in American and Russian zone.
My husband at the time of our marriage was working  he knew Russian and French and a little English and he worked for a tech nical publishing compan y at in Paris  France.
But deep down I heard that the German...the biggest mistake  we were talking in the army  that they're killing prisoners  Russian prisoners  in that time already that the Russians knew that the Germans are killing thousands of Russians and you have to fight not for...we're not fighting against Russia.
What was it like now that you got Russian troops in control?
And we came in contact with people who knew something about -- tha -- something that partisans are in the area  by -- somebody asked my brotherin-law  ﬁWe heard that you have a place to -- a hiding place ﬂ a marinar we called it -- was called in -- in Russian.
We just put our trust in the people who were going to bring us over to the Russian occupied part of Poland.
I loved it and I to -- and to this day we employ a lot of -- of Russian refugees and -- and I have no problem understanding them.
Interpreter: Now do you want  it says here he was liber ated by first  Russian front  yes here it says the name of the city  Nikolai (Mikolow   Poland or Mykolayiv  Ukraine or Niklovichi  Ukraine)  Upper Silesia and the man who gave hi m the letter of liberation is Captain Ivanov and they had to check him out because it is da ted May 12th  1945  so actually straight from the concentration camp they took him back to th e Army.
There were rumors that they were doing it in the Russian territory.
Whenever I would see a Russian  I would run away from him.
And one of them  the the brother worked as a laborer in in some factory with Russian workers.
And  natural  when the Russian arrived  was this the girl what was uh working with the Germans  took ten minutes for them.
I-It was -- Russian didnt like that you have t-too many r ooms  the fa-family  and besides  it was y -- they wanted to -- to help those refugees who really didnt have a place where to -- where to live.
In the meantime the brother of Mr. Frankel went to Belgrade to talk to the Russian embassy.
And then there was occasion I wrote about in the book  I left the [indecipherable] and got the job in another place on the railroad  you know  and somehow we survived like this  that in 1944  in August  were liberated by the Russian army.
Actually it was -- the Lithuanians were Catholics and Jewish people  we had a few Russians -- Russian Orthodox  but thats how it was.
Yes  my father  he was studying in Russia because when he was young  the country was under the Russian the so the Russians rule  the Russian Imperial rule.
And beside that  in Banska Bystrica was the first actually Czechoslovak socalled Czechoslovak government in exile  and many high ranking officials came from London   and then the Russian started to drop munition and weapons from the air  first from the air and then even many times they landed in Banska Bystrica   there touch outside from Banska Bystrica   or they brought a we-weapon the Russian  or [indecipherable] for the uprising.
And there I stood [ NB: stayed] until we could hear the Russian army already approaching.
Was it difficult to communicate sometimes  or did you all speak Polish or Russian or what did you speak?
Well the Russian -- well  we had -- we had -- this is a shirt and pants  khaki.
23 Son of a whore (Polish) 24 Son of a bitch (Russian) 25 Gen. Wladyslaw Anders 25 My cousin women and and children were bundled up and sent to India and South Africa.
There were only Brick buildings there  I understand that these buildings were made for the Russian prisoners of war and then  when they were moved  they others moved in  you know.
And I reme mber picking up a a Russian officer  and we offered him some cognac  and he I think he drank that whole bottle  we just couldnt believe it.
I went over there  and then come the -- this time come the Russian over there for good.
I wrote it from the partisans and the Russian army and th Israel  and they took it away.
Some Russian prisoner go to the Lichencomer mean the morgue  go there and pick up the gold teeth  stealing the gold teeth from the people.
And he spoke very good Russian  because he lived in Russia for years too  being being being in the service.
They took us everyday in camp  to Treblinka by truck  by car  by truck  and there wasn't only Russian journalists.
And one Russian came with one rifle  he this way  and another came this way  and you cant move  and my brother   he has to sit like that  and he couldnt do nothing.
And by the way  at each of these intersections  like that also  there were heavy guns and -- put into place  that -- so that in case Russian tanks would appear  they would immediately be subject to heavy artillery fire.
When I forgot his name  that Russian prior to Gorbachev   ye ye yench Oh  prior to Gorbachev?
They concentrated so many troops  Russian and Polish  to get rid of him that it was not very comfortable anymore as a unit.
We were the only Jews there with the exception of the uh mine physician  who was a Russian man who had come in 1905 due to the pogroms and who didn't admit to anybody that he was a Jew.
They uh  I was supposed to be a Russian liaison officer who would take recalcitrant prisoners uh and and ship them off to Russia.
They were went to a paysan  the villages  and he said  \ You know  when the Russian ran away  they left a lot of rifles  in this and this house.
speaks Russian place name] [speaks Russian] So from sovkhoz I know its a some ca collective farm.
And I came to Matrosov [indecipherable] but he was a Russian  he came in the first war took  and he he married a White Russia n shi goya and we went to I went over there and I told him  Mr. Matrosov  we got to find out  your neighbors who some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to destroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him.
Under the Russian people  you are not a person  you are just like I said.
Th-The the regular way of the Russian lies that are even now you can s listen to [indecipherable] and and and and see how nicely he forms certain ways of how to do the right thing the Russian way.
But the Russian people had their cows  their their whatever  chickens.
But a Russian officer told us there was no transportation  nothing  and his advice is everybody should go back to the country that they came from  to their home.
S: By now I am still having the Russian way  Sulamit  because I came here with papers  Russian papers  so it was written Sulamit.
You see  when -- when the war started  when the -- you know  Russian  the Russian-German war  a big army  Russian army in the first days surrendered to th e Germans.
So when we came to a place in whi in White Russia   when we met when we went out from the woods  we had a a garmonika playing music   we knew we we met we met in the Russian army soon.
But like I say again  I jumped off the train and then immediately followed all those Russian soldiers which was crossing the train going the other direction.
So  even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him  I said -- this may not be in terested on the tape  but I asked him  I said  ﬁTell me  why are you  a officer in a different battalion  from a different town than your son is  and youre not even Jewish?ﬂ Everybody says Marshall Zou  or whatever his name was  I dont even remember  and he says  ﬁYou see  they took us  the Jewish officers  and doctors  and send us to different places  because when we were caught from the Germans  that the soldiers  the Russian soldiers shouldnt give us ou t that we are Jews on top of it.ﬂ So this is my first lesson I learned  that I wasnt the only one that suffered  and there were other people as young as I was  at -- it concentrated  that answer concentrated into my mind.
I have a guy which he came with me  he came til -- a -- a short time because the -- the Russian took us on a bus  me and him  and th -- you know  and they didnt have too much more places us to take.
if its happen to work during the day  if you see a Russian officer  soldier  and he speaks to you in Russian  dont ever an swer in Russian.
There were a lot of people that did not understand Russian  but like I say  lucky there were a few people that would translate it.
As an intelligence officer  the Russians were in had had Vienna at the time and that part of Austria and they wouldnt let us go into the Russian zone.
We never made it back  because the Germans occupied that part and from ther e on we did not stop in Lubov  but we got connected to another transport and we traveled towards the Russian territory in the east  by train  and we had  I remember  a open platform train  where old cars were open like platforms and we took that train and we traveled to Rovno which took us a couple of days.
Then I decided that because I didn't care for what I was doing  checking on products  on the pharmaceutical products  but because I could speak Russian  even though I could not read nor write  I would be a better help to the government during the Cold War.
And because of my languages  a friend called and says  Lili  you know how speak Yiddish fluently  and German and a little bit of Russian and Polish.
They had no common sense  and they were in fact  I wouldnt be surprised if those were released prisoners  because the Russian I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia  or people that were politically ar rested or other some reason other arrest.
They were letting just a trickle in and I'm sure if we would have waited for the Polish quota  I don't know when we would have gotten to the United States  but because my mother knew  you know that we were so close to Russia and convinced the Council that uh she actually was born on the Russian side  that uh we were able to come on the Russian quota which was open because very few people immigrated from Russia to the United States over quite a number of years  and uh so we came in November 1947.
He fought on the Italian front and also on the Russian front.
That was another period of great hunger for us  because we crossed the -- we had to cross the river  into -- onto the other side  you know  because the Russian was -- were advancing.
We arrive in Pomerania and there's cows  sick cows and sick pigs and sick things  you know  and they want  needed food for Russia so what they did is they opened a cheese factory  where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with it  so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the Germans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the stalls from the cows  everything.
I thought it [indecipherable] when I saw the Russian  you know  th-the -- the Russian trucks and tanks  I was happy  first I thought they come as our allies.
But eventually  you know  the police -- the Polish police  which was  I think  called Enkavide and the Russian police too  together came and they said you -- thats it  you must return the child.
And we got outside and we h itched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next town.
L inz Donau is where I walked across the Russian border from the Russian zone to the American zone and ended up in an old SS camp in town called Wels  W E L S  in Austria and that was the end of the odyssey as it were.
In my concentration camp was 5 000 Russian office -- ar my officers.
who was very brutal  beat my father once very badly  and this Russian (?)
My father tried some compensation from Russian s for the ranch so Stalin told him if you want that ranch come in and live on it.
That's where the Russians were congregating and some of them put up so me make shift podium and they went on it and started to play their balalajkas and sing Russian songs.
You could become a doctor  a nd engineer if you studied Russian or Ukrainian because there were universities and institutes  and the schools were in Russian or in Ukraine.
So I was hoping both these two had survived  but u-unfortunately no matter how much I tried  I did not I did not find my sist er  but I  after awhile  investigating and chasing around  I found out that my brot her  my older brother was captured in the Russian prison  survived and he is waiting for me in Czechoslovakia   Chust.
And I was down there  and you had t o have per you know in the Russian zone  you know how it is under the Russian s?
They came back because my parents  many people around spoke about them very highly  positively  and they wrote to the Russian government that they were not for Bourgeois who exploit othe r people.
You know  and we didn't know they were Russian planes until they came down real low.
And then a lot of them run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police.
Rae Goldfarb: The Russian system believed that any kind -- anybody who was engaged in commerce was not a suitable profession.
So I went to the commander; and I spoke by the time  you know  ve ry well Russian.
Not only that  but I'll tell you  even the Hungarians who were practicing the same thing  while they were stationed there on the Russian front  guess what they were doing.
And in the stables  helping us  were Russians  Russian prisoners of war.
So So he told you to so the Russian officer Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30  2014 16 Yeah.
After war -- after Germany take Poland and Russian take firs t all guns  all radio  all instrument against the enemy  and in Poland was not -- you ca nnot buy gun  you cannot have some ammunition  because everything German took out.
Now the -- the Russian who was shooting at the jars  was laughing like a child.
We started immedi ately evacuating the Russian troops  the Russian wounded patients  and I was supposed to go with the Russians  the medical corps to -- they vacated to Sebastopol.
At the end when they feel that the Russian front is coming they changed a little bit.
So we h ad to take over their machinery and they sent them away to the front lines  to the Russian lines.
Then we both realized that Russian is -- Serbian is much like Russian and neither is Polish and switched.
Theres a lot of closeness between the Russian language and the Polish language in a certain way.
He was a -- a soldier ze -- probably the only one -- Russian soldier with a university degree.
>> David Bayer: We didn't know if they were Russian or Germans.
He came there and they surround   they were looking for people they did not have White Russian passports.
There was quite a few prisoners of war  Russian prisoners of war  and most of them they give away the cigarettes for the thing.
The Russian s marched in when the war on Poland was still fighting.
Some ran away  and some did not have to go because if the Russian what  major or whatever he was did not want to take the partisans because they were not fighters  you know what I'm talking  not army people.
I mean  it happened to have been the Russians  but at that point we didnt know it was the Russian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed.
She wanted -- she majored in foreign languages  and she knew Italian  and some Russian  and English very well  of course  and she had a job that she had to know English for  and so she interrupt her studies every time she didnt have any money  she s -- worked up there.
That's the Russian  from west  you know  all the way from the eastern part.
So Lodz had been under had be en under the Russian occupation  earlier in the century?
Once Russian general comes in and he's how dare you be barefoot.
This person is with the Nilos and he was a little way uh friendly together but I get this letter from my husband that this person must be Jewish  very elegant  Nilos but Jewish  and I run up and I open the door and I am shouting at the boys...here is the  here 34 is the Russian army.
They used to bring truck loads or...or thousands of Russian soldiers and...uh...they used to roll off there...ever see  like you know how you see in the United States when they bring a garbage truck to a dump  the opened the back and out.
Yeah  I want to m-mention that when I was in Rome on the Romanian passport  I went also to the Russian embassy -- to the Soviet embassy in Rome.
And th -- oh [indecipherable] some people take us to their house and we were afraid to come in  we were still so dirty  we -- we didnt have anything  we didn't have money and we didnt know the language because Russian we dont know  we learned a little bit.
And he one tim e obviously  without knowing how  that everyone spied on everyone  said that Polish workers had it mu ch better than the Russian workers  and they somebody in that factory denounced him.
Also  during the brutal Russian winter  they -- some of them had regular clothes when they had to march and they had to march a lot.
Some survived who were drafted to Russian army and they survived in Russia  because like I mentioned before  we didn't have any concentration camps.
When I start it was not  it was most go -- mo-most Russian people  Ukrainian people.
Why dont I ask you - you mentioned an incident about Russian POWs?
We  as a family of a criminal -- my father was called a criminal because he was sentenced  so the family under the Russian law  we were supposed to be also taken to Russia.
They had Pols  lots of Pols  lots of Ukrainians  lots of Russians  Russian POW.
He used to smuggle from the from the American from the Russian zone  certain items to the American zone  and from the American zone to the Russian zone.
She didnt survive  her brother survived because he was in the Russian army.
Ah Jews in di -- veris -- well -- So you wouldnt have -- if you were Jewish -- There was a Russian time  on the Russian time we didnt have this problem  but when German came to Turka  that where problem started.
Because Russian army already encircled them from the  from the west .
And the Russian took Bornholm  and stayed there for so and so long time.
And so he was called up and he -- he was brought down by the guard after whatever  maybe a half an hour and he was hardly down and had sat down and he looked already very disturbed  when another officer  who looked also extremely brutal  ap peared with a -- he had sort of a baton and -- and a sort of wooden stick in front  i-in his hand  waved it in front of that Czech guy and shouted at him in Russian  something that didn't sound very pleasant.
Thir -- I went to Polish school  I didnt know Polish  only Russian and Yiddish.
This is tape number three  side A. And could you explain a little bit what you meant by the Russian kitchen?
But after a few days you know it  water receded and the ice receded and then the Russian start to build a pontoon bridge.
In the school was only four children that were Jewish and I  from Russian school from Siberia  I have pictures.
Now my father married my mother also in Moscow and she was studying at the Russian  at the Moscow Pian o Conservatory  I mean Music Conservatory  she was studying pian o. And she was studied then  hist ory.
But uh many Jews went on  went out from the city to reach the russian border to flee from the Germans but the Russians had uh had closed the border.
Russian guards and I was caught first time when I tried to cross the border.
No  no  there was a -- second class cars and -- but I remember arriving in -- the Russian winter  as you know  starts fairly early  so it was the latter part of November  1940  in Novosibirsk where the train stopped  and it was about 40 below.
I was born in Kowel  spelled K - O - W - E - L on the Russian border  very close to the Russian border.
I stood with him in the Polish [indecipherable] couple weeks there  because most of the officers were Russian.
And now after so many years my fight was right  Po land is free  Russian Communists is dead.
We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier  and the Russian soldiers  they went out  they got the seven horses  came back  got them dressed back their uniform  dropped them on a cart  and took them back to their camp.
And then I went back and I forgot  either the same day or the next day  all four of us went there and met Major Shike ag ain and he award us a piece of paper in Russian.
Uh on the fourteenth of January  1945  the Russian offensive started and that was I think from Warsaw towards the   and we knew that contrary to the landing of the of the of the of of the Allies in western Europe or in Italy or some other Russian victories  this time it's us.
And -- but all in all  I -- I meet people because I am so involved with it  so to one I can speak Polish  while in -- two se conds later  Ill switch over to Russian  or from Russian to Spanish  or to Hebrew  and people always have -- how could I remember all of that at one time?
There was this other case that a Russian woman run into our house  this little house that we had.
So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even listen  so what they did is they gave me a 02:05:30 little bottle of medicine that the hospital gave me  and every time a drunk Russian  no matter how drunk he was  came in or something  they send me out with my all that green stuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman  and when they saw me coming they start running.
When we came and they find out the people  the Russian people  they killed them because they were Jews.
We saw the trains coming from the Russian border and there was a lot of trains with soldiers and some of them wounded soldiers or German soldiers  so we realized that the war was coming to an end.
Picked up Ukrainian  they taught in the lower grades and I -- and some Russian  right  because I recited poetry and I -- I was scared to death  they dont believe in Santa Claus  but they called him Ded Moroz there was  with a big tree and he was dressed like the Santa Claus  and I had to recite this poem in -- in Russian.
The first person we saw on the uh on the May the 11th  when it was about 10 o clock in the morning  there came a couple of Russian soldiers  I didn't know that one of them was Magor  they come on the horses without the saddle  the rifle w ith a string  they didn't look to me like a sol  soldiers  they looked to me like a bunch of uh I don't know  running away soldiers.
Russian I have to start to speak in 1939 when the -- when Poland was divided  and Wilna start Russian for a short time  and then they gave it to Lithuanian after two months.
The direct  closest country was Poland and Poland would not permit the passage of Russian units across it's territory to 01:21 help Czechoslovakia  under no circumstances.
It was army of Russian volunteers who fought against their own brothers  and we were sitting with those criminals.
And and and Gorbachev admitted too  and he sealed off that this was the Russian doing.
I am glad this going to some museum and sp ecial the Holocaust Museum and I be glad it be placed there and this way we know was not only Je wish people killed in Holocaust  was French  Polish  Russian  Zigoinen (gypsies) and many othe rs.
Well  to cut a long story short  we were evacuated  and then I found out that he was killed in action on the Russian front.
Also  I was scared  and so I never went into the Russian zone in Germany or never went into Berlin.
Everything... because when the Russian came  it's a big change in the system.
My brother and my...we didn't eat anything else during all the time until well after...even when the Russian came in...only snow water was...this was heavy snow...brought in at night from the street by others too in the building  which was made a little fire into the gas stove with the furniture  pieces whoever found it...little wood.
And not only that  because the law -- the Russian law says apparently if there is someone a criminal  quote  unquote my father the dentist  then the family also gets to Russia  to be on the gulag somewhere.
You asked me before how it was when the Russian came in.
What the Russian saidŠwhat the communist saidŠthe Russian USSR was organizing cooperatives in the villages. (
There were they were decisively against it  and they knew that  according to the Russian rule  whoever was taken prisoner  he was a ta traitor traitor.
And I remember Russian soldiers used to come in and they would buy five bottles of Eau de Cologne and they would hit it against something  take off the tops and drink -- drink that down.
There was a russ a lot of Russian Jewish soldier  they deserted and they went to Palestine .
And my sister told him and there were other Russian women my sister said  vrosh  you lie.
To me  you know  the word Siberia  as you may know in all of Soviet or Russian literature  usually meant that people never returned from there.
We knew that had been take n and that that certainly that they came pretty close  the Russian army close to Krackow  and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events   in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the I think  and uh reached Krackow...Krackow was only  I think  sixty kilometers from Auschwitz in the east  then a day before th at uh uh the order came not to wal...not to march out any more to the factory  and the question was what's going to happen  because certainly uh uh without knowing the uh the uh the uh thinking of the of these SS gangsters properly  what are they going to do with us  it was touch and go.
So  but I -- when I was still in -- I spoke really more than Yiddish and German  because I -- before I came to Sobibor  I worked at a farm and when I came back f -- as a soldier  as a prisoner of war  I went come work at a farmer and it was a Ukrainian farmer and I worked there for two years  and -- He spoke Russian?
But then  we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their so ldiers and so they  they got  they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in  in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people.
It was called in Russian  L. So he was not maybe yet seven in 24.
You had  in Krakow   unlike in the Soviet Union  you immediately had Jewish organizations  and those organizations would try to provide as much information as Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 68possible  about the whereabouts of surviv ors  or liquidations of earlier ghettoes  when and where and how  and so forth  which you did not have in Russian occupied Poland .
We walked a little bit  the second house we saw we opened the gate and a priest comes out and greets us ﬁhello who are you?ﬂ We told him we are inmates and that we are going to be here by you because thats what the Russian army told us.
She escaped howe to Russia  which as a witness from my city  they saw them going to the Russian side  and he says  come on  lets go in deep.
Her  my mothers youngest brother  he and his wife went east when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland.
They didn't want us to unders tand when they spoken Russian.
And they didnt accept no Russian  no Polack  no nobody  they were just their group  all Russians  anti-Semites.
Its like a monument of the Russian occupation of of Poland.
Here are coming in a few Russian soldiers  we were sitting waiting for a train and he says  who are these clowns?
And one day we woke up and we heard already the Russian guns and Russian planes and we could  you know  we were starting to to have hope against hope that maybe  maybe salvation is near.
The train stopped there by the by th e bridge there  where its supposed to go over to the American zone  on the Russian zone  the train stopped there  and the Russkis came around.
And then  we decided that night we will not go they said  you go there  they that will come the Russian boats in the Baltic Sea  they will take you to Creme.
It was a case which I have to describe that a a a Russian tank failed to when they were by escaping  they they just he was right next to the next to the river  the Nemunas .
Besides being a messenger for him and ma king reports  what else were you do -- I [indecipherable] the same  I had always to receive the Russian commands to prepare  you know  special food for them.
But then afterwards  when I was going home  I would get a piece of Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 87bread  or actually a sometimes it was in the Russian families  the Russians had bread.
Uh...Immediately in ...in private homes  Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people.
We didn't know that time what tanks it was  whether it was Russian tanks  American tanks.
Well  at that point  I spoke Russian  you know  and I spoke Hebrew  and I spoke Yiddish and you know  that was that was And so and English was gonna be added to that.
Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15  2010 56 And asking [speaks Russian] in Russian [speaks Russian].
And so  since there were so many of them  I think 32 or something like that  they had to the th ey the old lady and her maid originally were the bosses of this Russian kitchen  but then they couldnt manage it  so his wife became the boss of this kitchen.
I said to him  \ I'm Russian...\  So I never thought about that.
And there were soldiers  Americans Russian soldiers  and to me they were great .
Oh  I got a job by the Russian  they pa explaining for the girls that went to to the Germans from Russia  to tell them to tell me what they did and everything.
So we got out and we saw the Russian people right there.
What happened  one Sunday morning we hear bombs and the Russian army starts to run away  and next morning the German army came in to town.
To this day I can still speak it better than I can Polish or Russian.
We lived there for a little -- a very short time and Mother found out she could enlist in the -- with the Russian workforce and we got on a train that was rebuilding water towers.
Well  as I said  th-the the Russian and Poland had non-aggression pact Russia and Poland   mm-hm.
In c onnection with Stalingrad  and the aftermath of Stalingrad  uh  more of these SS men were sent to th e front  to the  to the  to the in order to the Russian front  and  the Germans and the SS build a guard  a chain around the factory so that we were not watched completely by the SS guards in our   our detailed work.
And so the decision was made that I should run away last because I would be interviewed on newsreel and on radio about my camp  and they thought that if I ran away it would blow the 19 The Tadeusz Kosciusko Division appeared in July 1943 and was comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command.
Yes  we were going still to school by ru Russian  yes.
Oh yeah  when the Polish when the Polish people caught me with a blan with a with a sheets  the Russian people sold the the way anybody who wants sheets  with a number.
It was very difficult for me to come back  I had no documents  only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number and with my name  that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army.
We tried to get through the to go to the Russian side  but it was impossible.
And -- but I -- I forgot already Russian quite a bit.
He joined the communists on the ground with the Russian soldiers also  in the underground.
So when I went up th ere this one German man said to me how come you speak such a perfect German  are you a Russian Jew?
Was it Russian soldiers who came to the house  or these released thieves from the Polish Russian soldiers.
My father owned the high school  it was a Russian high school.ﬂ This secretary told.
They were right because the Russian were not very nice to them.
And when we came out we were just pale and green and  and there were a few Russian partisans  maybe boys of age 13 or 14 who ca me and they looked at us and they said  in Russian    \ And who are y ou?\
What happened  we went to the Russian soldiers and we found somebody that spoke German no  we even found a Jewish soldier.
And they said  ﬁWho would like to stay in Austria?ﬂ And I saw those beautiful mountains  and that b eautiful scenery  and like I told you  at the Russian camp I was boar hunting  and I was riding  and I loved sports.
[

I say  ﬁI can't buy from you; I have no money  but if you hang around here for a few hours  I'll sell it for you.ﬂ And those were can  cans of American ham and beans  like C-rations  but big cans that the American  that the Americans supplied the Russian army with.
Said this late they're going to send to the Russian front.
Uh my mother particularly wanted to get out from the Russian area and uh she was able to uh dig up some valuables that were hidden and uh managed to bribe uh...was a work...working train.
The first question 1 Simon V. Petlyura was a Ukrainian journalist a nd military leader during the Russian Revolution.
But they didn't know that in American law your nationality where you were born and not what passport you have so these two were born in Odessa and my mother was married to a Russian.
Uh  my mother came from the Polish side of the Bug River and and my father was on the Russian side and  uh  they were childhood friends and they immigrated to the United States at different times and met in New York and my father was in World War I and  uh  in the infantry which  uh  I was quite proud of as you'll find out later.
And...a nd...and the...the dogs was crying terribly  but suddenly I heard a woman's voice in the Russian  to the dogs  like \ Stop the barking.
The people that knew how to speak Russian had a little conversation trying to find out if other places were liberated.
I wanted to run to that Russian and kiss him from top to toe.
So I didn't stay very long  but the doctor in charge over there  the Russian woman  saw that I...uh...must be...some...somewhere...some...she wanted to know more about me.
No  was a mixture Russian -- in fact it was more Russian than Jewish people.
Lo and behold Columbia took me without restrictions  but with the restriction to study in the Russian Institute.

was a Russian  and he killed him in the st reets of Paris.
If there is something  a lack of certain things  because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the market. [
Did you -- Did you tell them or did they just know -- Oh yeah  yeah [indecipherable] they -- they -- they couldnt tell  because my Russian was perfect  I spoke only Russian there  I lived there for several years with them.
When the Russian soldiers came through  when you met them  were you in hiding underground?
The Russians had already advanced  Russian troops had already moved in.
My landlady opened the door and said are you crazy bringing a Russian here?
They were beggi ng army they should take them because they felt that the Russian s were right there behind them.
We didnt encounter any Russian troops  because Theresienstadt was pretty close to as far as the Russians got.
They had places in various parts of Europe  where they would receive the refugees  they would come m and those this is the period when we had the Russian refugees coming out.
from the American  but later we got occupation from the Russian  because th -th e American wanted a part of of Berlin   the English wanted  and the French  and the Russian.
And he was kind of like the -- Was your father known as a Jewish doctor  or because of the Russian papers was he -- No  no  he was Jew.
At that time the city belonged to Poland  and during the -- from 39 to 41  the city wa -- were under Russian government.
But my mother just so happened  knew  because you know  one of the White Russian nis policeman said  your two two boys were killed this morning  you know.
He's a hero  Russian hero...he lives...I don't know if the lives now.
They love him great and when the Germans came and when th ey kill all the Jews there  Russian peasants hided him.
The baker was like a god by the Russian - you know  bread.
What was it like for you to see a Russian soldier in a Russian uniform?
We were convinced that they were German but they were Russian  the Red Army.
It was a place  Poking  you know  because they said that...uh...that if the Russian  you know ...uh...soon they're gonna be closed down.
You come to this   you at s -- anyway  in this apartment was 49 Italian colonel  very big Fascist  who was so ashamed that Italy collapsed  that he volunteered for Russian front.
So he he hadn't got any idea  and he never acknowledged  after a year of trial  where the Americans  the English and the French  and the Russian have shown them a lot of documents  even a movie about Auschwitz .
Seems like it was terrible there  because the Russian soldiers...uh soldiers practiced cannibalism.
>> Nat Shaffir: Since he dealt with the Iron Guard Army  he tried to make contacts with the Russian armies.
That's the way I picked up a little Russian a little Polish things like this.
87 I get out -- when I got a job  went to the Russian.
I went to a Russian public school for a short time  and after awh ile I read an announcement that they are looking for students for a specialized school and I signed up.
In -- in -- is a ru -- a -- a Russian proverb  [speaks Russian here].
But then the Russian came every day closer and closer to the camp.
I went to this Russian school and two years after the war started with -- with the Germans.
And today came a day they found us and they sent  during the occupation of Russian  they sent us sometimes [indecipherable] some fruits from inta Israel.
There were still Russian army coming in and they were not the nicest.
And he at that moment  he said that  I am with the Russian  yes?
And Moldavia was the first part to come under the Russian army.
So  when I came to the Russian army  I found people who speak almost so well  how I am speaking Russian.
I dont speak much Russian  just a few words  but when you describe your mother  theres a phrase in Russian which comes to me  which is wot zhenshchina .
Do you -- They spoke Russian when they didn't want me to understand.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings TAMAR LAZERSON ROSTOWSKI pg 5 Interviewed (7-18-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: TAMAR READINGS (This is take 31  roll 89 marker) TL: (Russian????
In the beginning -- Yeah  you had Russian -- the Russian uniforms  yes.
Subsequently there was a Polish -Russian war that started in 1920 and lasted until 1921.
Couple days later came a order that they have to leave the that the Russian army is going to take over Volary   and the Germa and the American army had to evacuate.
And we were writing  and we had special Russian document  and we were going with Russian soldiers.
And we did call the Russian and they note and they did pay us for it.
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
uh...follow that appeal  but most of my friends left on th at day and they went east toward the Russian side.
We had a four room apartment and that was still in the...in the Russian time.
54 Now  there are some Jews in that population that came  but the majority who had came over -- Yeah  there was a large Jewish Russian population.
He was a Russian lawyer  a man of very high standing.
He said  ﬁDont you know that that is not allowed in Russian to do?ﬂ I said  ﬁ law   how should I --ﬂ (You couldnt call them   you couldnt call th em .)
If he agrees to this they could let him go and he joined the Army  goes to the Russian front  gets killed.
He knew the Russian too because he was in Russia 3 years  4 years.
And Id gotten  of course  I was at the time this the main job of that particular office really  was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30 000 a year.
He would read to me  he would sing songs to me  tried to teach me Russian.
The prominent people was going slowly out from from Budapest  not uh not remain as long the Russian will will make something.
But it just so happened it was the Russian Army that opened the doors for us and that was the end of our  what should I call it?
If you have that the ger Russian lady  says 90 percent they were Russians.
You know  even...even uh anybody in the Polish army  the Russian army  ...I got lots of guts  and no brains maybe  you know.
Because men were very afraid of being conscripted into the Russian army  which was 20 years  they couldn't get out.
I would say most of the credit fo r the liberation  1948  comes to those Russian soldier  they were already trained  and they really know how to fight  Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 31those people  thats why I was talking with them after.
And then the Russian -- >> Bill Benson: Before you talk about leaving Auschwitz  tell us about the surgery that you were forced to undergo.
So anti-Semitism was  amongst the Russian soldiers was quite predominant and at that point I was very scared because I was small  I c ouldn't really do a whol e lot about it and the soldiers were drunk  and they carried on and I was really afraid for her life and mine too at that point.
Wi -- and you are in the -- We were in the Russian zone.
And Russian people excuse me  the olde r people  when they made sure that nobody is listening  they would made the si gn of cross  and tell us how they believe in God  and how they feel sorry for us.
So those Russian people would welcome them  with flowers  and they would throw flowers at the soldiers.
And the second time  a man came to the door and...and in...in Russian: Kto tam?
In Russian language they call him Vladimir  but he was Velville.
He was in the Russian army and then he was bombarded and shot.
So I had some sentiments to Russian culture  to Tolstoy  to to Chekhov.
which is an open space with barracks  they were like fortifica- tions so in case the Germans will attack  the Russian army will hide behind the walls of the fort  facing the windows to the west and while the Germans are attack- ing  they can shoot at them.
Of course  we were not afraid  we thought that the Russian are here  that the Germans are not here  but we were deeply mistaken.
The Russian come in there and this was May 1945  and I was with my friend from Holland.
I was charge of the Russian resettlement program here and Im still in charge of that.
Somewhere outside Gross-Rosen by Russian troops in the spring of 1945.
He brought me more bread and he told me  \ I am living with a Russian woman.
Also  another thing I had in my mind  I knew the relationship -- it was during McCarthy time  I think -- before McCarthy time  and I was Russian born.
Yeah  they thought they go Im gonna go [indecipherable] to the Americas  and th and from the Russian army.
So anyway  often these peasants did hand so mething over  and she learned a few words of Russian  laybeonki being children  and you know  I remember her always saying about the children.
By the way  in Auschwitz I was helping a Russian to pass soup to the officers who were in very bad shape.
I speak fluent Russian so I said  \ I'm the teacher here.\
And they take us over... Seems like between the Russian Army and the American Army  there was a no man's land.
Eventually   the next day  the Russian troops came in and took over Prujena .
They -- they took us out of there because they were overcrowded as it was  so many different concentration camps which em ptied on account of Russian ava -- ba -- advances.
These were plenty  which left from the Russian army  were drilling a hole  puttin -- put there -- screw in there the -- the handle from the hand grenade  open it  and through the ring  put this -- a wire through shmore -- in German how it is a -- so we were sitting hundred yards away  and we pulled it  it was blowing.
There were Polish people  Russian people  Germans  Hungarians; so there was a lot of folks  folks tune singing because they were not only Jews who were in there.
I -- another one -- when -- in the new company  a Ukrainian  who worked in the bookkeeping department  turned to anothe r white Russian  and he said to him  ﬁYou know what?
And the Russian people were the first ones to get the honor to be declared a free country.
Later on before this camp was liquidated  these two Russian prisoners were stoned to death by the other prisoners.
I dont remember anything  but we used to re -- wr ite and read Russian  was Russian language mandatory.
So  I started going to school in Lvov on -- in Russian school and I did have some education in -- in -- during the war  in Univ  but not a lot.
And the Russian  and I spent a lot of time in the Soviet Union and the Russian people are remarkable people in many ways so it  it  intuitively I  I just picked the right country to be particularly interested in.
So their representative immediately continues in Russian  and the Czech guy in Czech.
So uh  the more we knew about the news  the uh Russian Army come closer to our border  the more we think that maybe we will escape.
I remember only it was in winter in January 1945 there was so because the Russian front was  it was 1945.
Budapest is one of the cities that is na -- did not have a Russian palace of culture  which is that wedding cake monstrosity thats in the middle of Riga  and Warsaw  and lots of other places.
So the Russian wanted us to be in Poland because the Polish people were not communists.
And they couldn't understand how come I... There was no reason I wasn't getting better; because not realizing I was drinking alcohol constantly with those Russian soldier. '
We were liberated in uh in 1945 uh in the Spring by the Russian Army; and I remember that uh with this army of Russians also a lot of Romanian troops came.
No t an American professor  but a German professor  or the Russian professor from before the war  which is a different thing.
And they uh  start to behave  and that's how we managed to stay  and later on in the end  let's say the beginning of 1944  things were different because there  in the area became many Russian Partisan units  and the Polish Partis an units  and we were  we were just walking around for weeks  staying in one village.
So I ha ve very strong sentiments to Russian cultu re  to the Russian people  but not to the Russian [indecipherable] .
During the Russian occupation  they did not take us out anyplace.
Yes  Hungary -- I don't want to criticize your introductory speech  but you said Hungary followed Germany in its anti -Semitic belief s. Hungary preceded Germany in many of their fundamental -- Hungary had a very bad experience with aborted Russian revolution in 1919  and a lot of bad feelings.
A lot of Russian films  but that was mixed in too.
At one time I got caught by Russian - by Russian soldiers and put together with German prisoners of war  into a train.
I saw Russian tanks comi ng up to the city  waving to us and we asked them how are you.
There is a very nice poetry  Russian language...what does you today or tomorrow bring upon us. .
I Nesse Godin 5 December 14  1995 Page 5 personally was carried by a Russian soldier  on his arms  and he carried me to the village.
First  '39  after a few weeks  we read a proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army 4 will come for order and safety of the city 'till the situation will be cleared and that we should cooperate.
Oh  yes  I didnt never went into the Russian zone  and I never went into Berlin because I was told my name was on a list  and I didnt know whether this was true or not.
I was taking one with my shaking hand and he took another  and I was   and I run out and I am shouting...here is the Russian.
But that was the start of the Russian offensive  where the front had been stalled for all that time.
When it came to my turn  he asked -- the questions were asked by him in Russian  by th e way and the civilian next to him was an interpreter  then he gave it to me in German.
Interview with Fred Firnbacher September 16  2010 53 under Russian control.
17 During the Russian o-occupation  di -- my fath er w-work in -- in -- in two places.
And my mother spoke mostly Polish amongst the population because they either spoke Russian or Belarus and very few of them knew of cultured Polish.
That apparently the Russian sort of m ilitary leadership had gotten wind of the German attack because the Germans had  after all  ma ssed three and a half million troops along the border  and there were a number of -- even some German deserters who crossed into Russia and warned them of the attack and theyd been warned from other sides.
The Russian tanks will come  tank traps  will laugh for 30 minutes and take one minute to get through.
They were learning German  they were learning Polish  they were learning Russian  they were learning French  so that theyd know how to handle the DPs when they got to Europe.
I was in the Russian army  it was September 1955  I think.
We thought that maybe  because she was so clos e to the territory that it was eventually occupied by the Russians you know  in 1939  when Poland was divided between the German occupants and the Russian occupants but we couldnt find her.
First were the Russian s  first were the Russians and then came the Germans.
And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian.
And so later on  my mother would take one of the chicken when it grew  to ask some Russian to kill that And then youd have some food.
We saw that everything whats happening with the Russian army  the victorious expelling  pushing the Germans towards towards the towards the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 100 west.
Into depending on which was which was Austrian  which was Russian  German.
Because I knew about the rush where the Russian industries were.
Some young guys thought to go to German girls  whatever  and the Russian military police used to  at night  searching for deserters.
That was one  you know  one person who -- who couldnt bear the -- who -- looking how we were punished and how we were beaten or -- then a group of girls run away  and from the same place where the Russian Latvian guy was working.
And just so we're clear  pogrom is from Russian word  an organized attack either supported by the government or engineered by the government.
Then  the Polish armies became alive  too and so on  and there were the Polish armies from the Russian territory  the Polish officers were from the Russian ar my  and is all kind of thing.
Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 90 I wanted to ask something else: aside from how you were greeted by these Russian exiles  who said you will get used to it  you will get used to it Yeah.
He began the partisan when the Russian people -- the soldier run away from the German  so he had the couple  and he began to be bigger and bigger and bigger.
It was very cold and there was no food at all  so one day I walked by and I have seen some Russian carrying big kettles with food and I saw them going outside the camp carrying to somebody  so next morning I got up real early  like three o'clock  and I followed them.
And eventually they went to Zahedan   and they were there in Zahedan   and there was there a Persian general Kava Kavushek   who spoke very well Russian.
So  I can tell only like about this author of the book  and about Russian people  who to ld me what there was.
So we managed and later on as a matter of fact we were lucky enough to uh 6 get on a Russian truck and uh they took us to his hometown.
We were fou r kilometers from the Russian border  from the old Russian border.
I says  I di never spoke Russian  so you couldnt have be en speaking to me in Russian.
And I said something  not connecting  or referring to -- to his English  and -- because it was obviously with a Russian accent  and I can detect it immediately.
And there was we were in a camp where where Russian men  workers  working only in the summer [indecipherable] and so on.
And th-the fact that  you know  they knew that I am educated  and I will learn the Russian quickly  th -- they -- they also wanted an educated cadre  you know  to work for them  and they wanted an educated cadre which will promote  and will help them  you know  implement  you know  the Communist regime.
Jewish people and the Russian people were laying  slaughtered like so many pigs.
However  not like Russia  like deeper Russia  this was like European Russian ; like most of the people there were Russian.
I don't want in the last days \  because the Russian was approaching very close to our hometown.
Of course  my father spoke German very well  and Mother spoke Russian by virtue of growing up in  under the Russian sphere of influence.
And don't say anything  because when you pass by the Russian territory  because ŠŠ you know  Germany was divided in four sections.
But the Russian people  we had to stay away from them.
People who were very intellectual  like for instance  people in our town used to speak Yiddish and Hebrew  Russian and Polish and German and French  it fluently  a lot of them.
There was a Russian prisoner of war camp before we came there.
So I I spoke  when I in the beginning I spoke Russian.
So the next two  three years I was going to the school and I learned how to read and write in Russian  and so on.
I spoke some Russian and Spanish  and of course that didn't suit me for either of the assignments  but I did find that English was the official language of the trial in Japan.
I heard later on different stories of different people who were treated very badly by the Russian liberators  but I have not experienced that and I have not seen that.
So I said now there is a whole -- they've come as far west as the border of Germany and a bunch of them are up in a town called Stettin  that's the collecting point  and at that point these Palestinian guys can't come into the Russian zone of Germany or the American zone of Germany  so there are some of us here who are helping them.
But I had a brother  the second one who just missed my mother and missed the family and he did not want to stay on the Russian side until he reunites us.
We had frie nds in the Russian who we re just as us and we were friendly and brotherly the same way like anybody else.
The female officer was Russian  of Russian origin  but had lived in France many years.
And those people who came there  the Russian military  not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating.
We had a base  and they came to Chiel and they told him they said they will kill all the children 38 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) 39 Jumpers (Polish) 44 and women.
And we kind of finished up where you were saying that the Russian forces  the Soviet forces liberated the area  and a Colonel Volkov invited you to join them  and even made an a uniform for you.
And this was his greatest and most horrible heartache  when one day he arrived home  because we had these safe houses  what they called the International Ghetto  what it wasn't  it was given to us and not bought  by Christians and Jews who didn't wanted their houses and villas on both sides of the Danube to fall in Russian  in uh  German hands.
And  like everything else  it lasted for a while and then  then -- someone -- then  then the Russian government started to print it.
They they was afraid  even the Jews  but they didnt know if th we are Russian Jews  so move on to the Russian side  or so they were Interview with Paul Jonas May 3  2013 35 What how did life change for your family?
The main thing that they worried about was the men because the men were afraid of being conscripted into the Russian Army  which was the usual procedure what they did and they were basing themselves on the First World War.
And we came to a little German house  and an old person  maybe for 90 was along -- around  and the officer  the Russian officer came  ﬁOpen your house and let the people in.
So I applied for it  and I -- I knew about three words of French  or maybe five words and two words of Russian.
And so we slowly but  slowly but surely many times  we the  the train had to stop and  and  and the Russian soldiers came and identification and  and they used to select some young  young people for  for the war effort  you know.
That's a small to wn in White Russia  part of Poland in White Russia  not far from the Russian border.
And after I saw the first Russian  I went oh  one thing I forgot.
I was able to convince the German general  the Russian general excuse me  that I was married to her already  which I wasn't because I knew darned well that if I just say she's my girlfriend he'll never let her go but luckily they bought my statement.
People who had children  who were already two or three years old  the Russian collected all children and took all children away.
My husband had a very close encounter with a Russian who told him  \ I don't think you're a Jew  I think you're a spy  there's no more Jews here  we know that Hitler killed them all.\
It depends whether you read the Polish or the Russian records.
Making a long story short  I found out that two Russian planes came in  seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the area.
So I had got my old school I.D. card that you just saw  because Latvian has the same diacritical marks as Czech  so to the 67 Russian this looked like Czech  to the American it probably looked like Czech  and to the -- I dont know what it looked like to the Czech  maybe he didnt have 20/20 vision.
In this time  we got afraid to come to these same...to these same Ukraine people to be...and we was right looking for the Russian partisan.
So  we figured very fast way  cut wood in small pieces  and on the ends we put small Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 65pieces  then everything is empty inside  and we cover with the logs on top  and the Russian And theres the norm.
And one day my mother was so afraid because the predsedatel  thats pres political president of what was Russian  and ultra  ultra-communist ga was away  and my mother couldnt get the permit to go out.
So he saw that I am good friends with Polkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the milk was delivered and were going to the cheese factory  so the Russian soldiers wouldn't get anything to eat  and when we came back  what they did is what they did with the cows that they captured  we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around the lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they would cut  cook it for the Russian soldiers.
But my close friend was a French wa -- girl that had lost both her par -- parents in th e Holocaust and her uncle  who was Russian  Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg July 29  2000 74and a multi-millionaire searched all over Europe for her and her sister and brought them over.
I read a lot  and I like classics  and I read all the Russian classics  I read.
Most people over there are all Muslims and the nurses were Russian.
Over there was groups  12 - 15 people groups  and th e commandeer was a Russian officer and the rest was all Russians.
And my and the my my mother supposed to translate them to Belarusian  and she somehow she knew Russian  and you know So she managed.
The parish was already in the Russian USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 7hands.
We divide in six groups and I took with my friend from Warsaw and we go west to Warsaw because this place was very close to Russian border.
I'm...first of all  I want to say thank you the Russian government....uh  I'm sorry!...American government what they take us to America  and I want to say thank you ...uh...American people; they begin to teach me  my 5 Brynski held the military rank of Colonel.
I tried to stop one truck  another one  military Russian trucks passing by from Lublin to Zamush.
I remember learning a little bit to write the Russian lettering and all that.
I had behind my back a Russian and he wanted to rape me.
They won't have to listen to the... We always... When the Russian were fighting we were always behind them.
The Russian soldiers holler and said  you can go back  they already in your town.
We hear the people talking and then we find out that my brother was killed  the last day  when the same day or day before when the army came in  the Russian army.
First of all  th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very friendly by the Russians  because Stalins Stalins view was that the Russian s should never fell in a prisoner life  I mean  he should give his life for the country.
He was Ukrainian that fighting with the Germans on the Russian side.
And my father got the job because he spoke Russian perfectly.
But somebody told us that its already free  they already -- the Russian people  the Russian soldiers came in already.
So later  wh en the Russian liberated him  they sent him in the army.
In Russian language it was called bougadena   where they used to house poor people  you know.
And the Russian answer was that we never heard of him.
Russian) 28 You get accustomed (Russian) 29 Good  what are you called? (
These the Polish army  but it was in Russia   and under Russian jurisdiction.
So from there he was still in the Army but eventually the Russian Army evacuated from there.
And but and then we had to learn a lot of poems  Russian poems  everything Russian.
33 No  no  he was almost as bad as Altov ( ph) by his behavior like when he was coming theyd he also demanded to freeze  people to freeze  and then they were the people  the Sicherheit Polizei   which was the  like - I dont know how to say encavudei in Russian  how do Sicherheit Polizei   they were– Intelligence police?
So they found a little guy and this guy came over and says  in Russian -- my husband speaks some Russian -- \ You think you're a Jew?\
And...My priest get them priest clothes and false documents and we wanted them to go Resikecky you know you took...to bring them over to the Russian area so they could go or to the partisans or somehow closer to the Russians you know  and they wanted to save their life.
And in the front  approaching them from the fr -- opposite side was a army truck  a Russian army truck  and the driver was probably drunk  and Socha saw this and he s-start to pedal much faster  that he came in front of his daughter  and in the last moment the -- th-the truck hit him and not his daughter.
This is the original  prayerbushka  made out by a Russian o fficer  and he was wonderful to me  because I didnt understand any Russian  and he talked Yiddish to me  or German a little bit  and he helped me so much when I was in th is lotsarett it was ca lled  in Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga.
While he was there  with the Russian system  with the Communists  while he was sitting that he went out of his way...he took us in  you know  it was a line...people stay there three days...he took us in because me and my father  without the line  without waiting  two times a day.
I think 15 either it was in October or November  the part of 9 blocks was separated again by barbwire and the gate was put on and on this gate they wrote that a prisoner of war camp and the Russian prisoners were brought there.
We went to a policeman  a White Russian policeman and we told him that the second house from here because on the other side was the ghetto before.
And Russian wanted everybody to get Russian passports  and my father was a great Polish patriot  and he would never take Russian passport  so he decided to go back to Germany -- 31 to Germans.
Now  two days after the SS had left the Russian soldie rs started to march in  but they never really liberated us.
And eventually  when the Russian army pushed ahead  and liberated Auschwitz  people were coming in -- people from there were coming -- going east to this town  to the cities where they belong .
So then I met a lot of Polish Ukrainian Russian boys and girls who came almost the same time or just about that time.
Three  Russian  and English four  because I really liked it  and I made a point of really getting it under my belt.
It seemed to me that people just I just knew what I knew of it was that Smetona   the president left  and that now I its the Russian government.
The Germans were telling: we need volunteers to go to the Russian territory  we occupied so much land  we need people to work on the farm.
Well  according to the latest arrangements  Przemy l is almost at the border  the Polish-Russian border  because Lvov has become a Russian city  its not Polish any more.
To Vienna I couldn't go also Russian a nd without working to be  then I started to work.
And the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um village is coming here as an exchange for the Russian...for the German generals. \
The Russians came in and of course that school was closed and we went to a Russian school.
As one of my friends  whos a historian told me  he a he a to ld me those were quite likely Russian troops  that had then he describes how Russian troops would be in that area.
This was been when the bombardment started by different uh units American and Russian and so on  they would uh join the group  our group  in civilian clothes  and pretend to be one of the refugees.
They took us over to a separate unit near the Russian headquarters where the Red Cross was there waiting for us.

During the Russian occupation  that he was hi ding  his wife was already sent to Siberia.
He decided to volunteer to the army and he escaped from that particular town into the recruiting place of the Russian army.
Til I was three or four years old  I only spoke Russian and then one day  my fath er came  and said ﬁWe have to speak Polishﬂ because Vienna was   you know  at time  it was like in between  it was Russian  it was Polish  now it is Lithuanian and eac h countries brought their language so we had to read  know  a lot of languages  so then I started to speak Polish; and  I was sent to a private school  only for Jewi sh children  but we were taught only Polish  but we had lessons in Hebrew and in the religious instructions so ‚til I went to the ghetto  I only spoke Polish.

And  as I said preceding this here chapter  while I was speaking of the attack that we had on the Russian and that there came back reinstalled a new now garrison in the Russian.
You said something about when you got there that they had to kill many Russian Jews?
Come with me.ﬂ So I even told them  \ When I go back to show the people that that I met Russian partisans  why don't you give me your submachine guns.ﬂ It's called in Russian papetsha. \
However  it was -- in the Russian Army to see women  it was no novelty.
There was a Russian expression that the populat ion -- the Jewish population used.
One was a officer and the other was a sergeant or something from the Russian army.
Instead of learning how to speak English  I took up Russian.
Uh towards...closer to liberation in early 1944  uh the Germans tried to rid the forests of the partisans because they were already in retreat and in order to to be able to fight the war  they had to get rid of this monkey on their back  somebody that that was inflicting all kinds of uh disruptions and they had...uh in addition to the Germans there were some Russian groups  actually it was a Ukrainian group in our part of the of the country...where a whole military unit had turned themselves over to the Germans and they were fighting on the side of the Germans and uh they were doing the dirty work for the Germans  and those people had what they called the blockade.
So  they used to come to our house  and of course they didnt speak Polish  but my parents speak Russian  so they were talking in Russian all the time.
Now it was just one after the other  but the Russian offensive wa s really nearing to Auschwitz.
And those two dots beca me bigger and bigger and then became two Russian soldiers .
That was work  it was an army sort of  out of civilians that were not labor  that were not taken to the Russian army because we we re Polish citizens and they only took us from one camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed workers and all kind of different places  from one place to the other.
41  exactly one week before the outbr eak of the war  on Sunday  suddenly Russian trucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave.
Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 49 And the they murdered people in Kharkov  NKVD building  and took the bodies to the place  like Plakihatki   which is a small surrounding  supposedly luxurious woods  and dachas  Russian dachas   and that was what later proved to be a big cemetery also for the Ukrainians from the previous persecutions.
When the Russian came  the Germans ran away  because they had a fight.
But what what the Germans where we ki there were so many Russian were killed.
But my mother knows she  and I believe he r  that soon as the Russian -- and now she was alone  my father was gone  you know -- Right. --
Ours was I told you fabrics  fabrics there were many living Russian people.
Uh...During this...uh...1944  after January...I don't remember  probably the 18th of January  when Russian soldier appeared in the cellar of that house where we were  we knew that every minute  every hour is danger.
I did not really  although I myself felt if I had been liberated in January  like some other people did  I'd have been volunteer for the Russian Army and I would have been the first one to go in to fight.
As a matter of fact  our language at home was Russian  not Jewish.
>> Irene Weiss: In January  winter  in terrible cold  thousands of people who were still surviving Auschwitz were pushed out on the highway and we were made to march hundr eds of miles deeper into Germany  to avoid being liberated by the approaching Russian Army.
Yeah  the all the time was Russians to Krasnovodsk   and after Krasnovodsk   was Russian all the time.
Took my belongings  went there and then officer  captain Russian captain came on a motor boat and I spoke to him whether he will take me across.
Ya I remember he taught me al so Hebrew songs  poetry and Russian poetry  he read me instead of children stories  he read me stories tell st ories Thats what I grew up upon  war and crime and that kind of thing  and not Cinderella stories.
This is where we were located and they  they told us not to go in groups because the Germans will think it's military and they will start shooting so I ran and all these people ran after me and we came to a small town already Russian occupied.
So we -- we were supposed to go bbackwards when -- when the ger -- ger -- Russian army came.
for Russian sold so he had like a special store Yeah.
And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the war is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life.
so they thought that the Russians are going to come in because we weren't too far from the Russian border  Sandomierz.
Almost at th e end  because finally Russian troops came in Budapest on 15 th  whatever.
Now  this was the most illogical  stupid thing to say  because the Russian soldiers had two ha nds  what are they going to do with a piano?
So when I woke up after 3 days without conscious because I lost a lot of blood  being already on the verge of dying because I had typhoid and no food  no water  for the last time before the Russian entered.
>> Susan Snyder: Did you weigh which was better  Russian vers us your -- >> Halina Peabody: We had no choice.
I went to a Polish school nearby because I didnt know to write and to read in Polish  only in Russian.
Here is you got to know is a Russian system  a communist system.
A lot of Jewish partisans was killed in the Russian army because the Russian want them to be killed.
So he started to talk Russian and we talked to him also  you know.
Even if I was officer  because mostly the officers in the Polish army  the high command  were mostly Russian in Polish uniform  and I had more priority than the the Polish officers who were really Polish before the war.
So they went downstairs  but it was already the whol -- there were a lot of people already there  because they ran away from the Germans  like Polnisha people and so that was our safety  because the next day the German came and -- CE: The Russian came.
In the beginning they had the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 46 German guards  but then they start to bringing in the the [indecipherable] the Russian Ukrainians  and then brought in Hungarians.
How did you happen to choose Russian studies as a ... Oh my goodness.
We went there and uh we lived there for a couple of days and we tried to make connection...we knew that Russian ambulances going to Czechoslovaki a are taking...for money are taking people who want to escape from Poland  so we made the connection  but before we  we were able to leave  the friend of mine asked me...Sophie I have to do something.
The s y-youre not allowed to be taught in Polish  schools were taught in Russian.
So then he takes out from his drawer my thesis  and he hands it over and I see there was written excellent and I (laughing) remember the thesis was and in the Roman and Russian War. (
It was January twenty-one a nd the war was continued until  as you know  until May. So here was all the time moving Russian truc ks and armaments and soldiers.

They was in train this pass from Poland and Poland Czechoslovakia and most of prisoners from the Russian front from the German.
Now since the si nce historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there.
132 Yeah  in the beginning  but then there were no Russian uniforms more  so they have taken -- while sorting the stuff which they have taken away from the newcomers  the good stuff went to Germany  into the Reich  and the less -- th-th -- those which looked more cheap and -- and not so good  were then supplied the beglidinskammer  the clothing barrack  and were stored there  and distributed to other Jewish newcomers  while the non-Jewish newcomers received the striped clotheses.
When we notice in a town that there were Russian soldiers  too many Russian soldiers  that they might go out on you know  at night  looking for women  we didn't st ay in that town.
I never forget it  that one Christmas night  she said  ﬁY ou must come to our church.ﬂ Its very interesting  the Russian Orthodox church.ﬂ There  it was interesting.
We had already certificates  but then I... I can't tell you the story but we had to run away because the Russian heard about it  that there are people from... from Russia from the...from the Baltic States going on the boa t  so we had to run away back and went back to Hungary  back to...uh...Austria (coughing)...sorry...and then we came to...on the border of Austria and Italy and there we passed a border.
I talk  I talk Russian  I talk Polish  I -- Really?
He was in the infantry in Italy and he was an aerial observer on the Russian front.
They spoke Polish  and German  and maybe Russian  I dont know.
And I recall like now when was downtown  our town  was a big map of the Russian front showing how deep the German troops and others to penetrate in Russia.
And I used to write letters to the from the Russia from the Russian army  all t to all my friends  the girlfriends [indecipherable] if youd be in contact.
We really dressed back -- dressed back in army uniforms of the Russian Army  so this sort of did not have them with us  but we got them.
I wanted to ask you too -- did you ever regret that you came back from the Russian border and didn't go to your uncle in Moscow?
None of us spoke Russian and they only knew sort of a s-smattering of some German words.
However  I had one brother  he was on the Russian front the longest  and he doing all of this stuff  the minefields and all  he was there a long time.
She thought her husband was one of those taken by the Russian constricted.
They were complaining to the Russian partisans that  ﬁThey took away my pillow.
They had the sa me edition in Russian and I think Arabic.
Went to the Russian side and one day was caught crossing the border.
Now  this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army  why did you have to bring her into your offices when very few people were there?
Premisz was also  one side was the Russian  and one side also was the zerc I mean  the water in the middle one side was the Russians occupied  one side was the Germans.
But I do remember by then  trains filled with wounded Russian soldiers being transported.
The next day  as Schindler promised  we did not hear about any announcement of surrender but we did see a Russian soldier  a single Russian soldier that looked like he was 20-foot tall on a horse that was extremely small.
T-To-To the trucks  and from the trucks to the [Russian] .
We we re making barracks for the whole Russian army  the German army.
We found ourselves close to a family and they say well they are going to the Russian part too  and they have a maid who lives not far from the Russian border.
She lived till '44 and was force marched to -- they interned in Poland and they had a forced march going -- when the Russian troops came  they forced -- the Germans forced internees  the prisoners to walk back towards Germany.
Anyhow  we crossed that  went down  and finally hit the Russian lines  and it was -- the Russians were so enthused when they -- 70 everybody wants to shake hands  and embrace you.
He speak fluently Latvian too  but he spoke Russian to me.
First with the Russian occupation because the Soviets considered us \ bourgeois\  I guess is the word in French and we did not have the -- the same type of life that we had.
There is a -- there was  at that time  a Russian inst allation.
That was a Russian Orthodox priest who also taught children who were of that religion  though the town was almost all Roman Catholic.
This is when I start to realize  Im not French  Im not American  Im not Russian  Im Jew.
And the Russian front -- one of my brothers  especially  he was like the first one there.
We knew that if we would take Russian citizenship  tomorrow they Interview with Shulim Jonas 15 will send us to the army without teaching us how to use a gun or a... So this would be our death.
Yes  he was talking that he was a f go-got first lieutenant when he graduated from that I call it the Russian West Point.
The  my father spotted a Soviet soldier and at that point we knew that the Russian army had come into our area and they were pressing forward towards Kovno  and they were  we were 07:28 behind the lines  once we were behind the lines we were free  so we came out of the hole and we no longer had to stay in that hole.
But  it was different  the Russian came closer and the Allie s  the places that I were  on the way from Hainichen  then we went on a trip.
My father understand stood Russian too and we moved over  right where we could in the corner  and the night came and wagons and the machine guns and the airplanes and the bomb.
The Russian found her an d took her to hospital  and she stay in hospital six months.
And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a great extent.
When I was working anytim e I had somebody to see  the Polish army  the Russian  they had nails under their shoes  52 nails in the Polish army.
Yes  so I was good in Russian and I was a learning type.
And and so  they Im Im surprised they didnt have Russian guards on on these things.
Russian ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 officer woke me up  rushed me off with a little water  put me back to the back  and there was only 12 people.
We learned the word diarrhea in three languages and Im not sure that I can even say the -- the names today and Im sure they would too  because one was Russian  one was Polish and one was  I guess French  because we had a very sweet Frenchman who spoke beautiful English.
So he told the Russian people coming back from Russia  maybe one of his brothers will survive.
>> Bill Benson: David  in our remaining time  you're in the woods hiding with the two Russian prisoners of war.
But the plane the train never got very far; because we were bombed by German planes and had to abandon the train in Poland not  not very far from the Russian border.
So we you could say he s poke four languages; Lithuanian  Russian  Polish and German.
In his eyes  I was the only one what survived to be to tell the story  so I took...we got back to the same place where we were and we're waiting and three months later the army came  the Russian army.
I heard that if...I don't know how many miles...10 miles  20 22 miles from here  there is a Russian hospital and they will accept you there.
When we were liberated  we were part of a Russian unit  the Kalinski .
Only this kind of people were  you know  were lucky if you knew somebody or the people who were directed to the Russian army and went on the front or went to the Russian uh  you know  uh uh  you know  working brigades.
and the Russian was wondering that we could make a couple of norms in a day in this way.
And for example  in the sovkhoz   I never saw u Russian soldier.
World War II began when Germany attacked Poland from the west quickly followed by being attacked by Russian from the east.
I feel that Israel must live because not only then  now is a lot of hope  a lot of people...where would the Russian Jews go now if there wouldn't be Israel.
Pencils!ﬂ (Russian) 47 ﬁMidday  break time.ﬂ (German) 39 going to look for the German guard  he stumbled in on somebody  and that somebody was the German guard  dead drunk.
We had to go And on the other side  the Russian.

They had a Russian name for it called tolkuchka.17 Tolkuchka  it means ﬁone was pushing the other ﬂ where you sort of  whatever you had for sale  someone would buy it from you.
Then they would make fun of me saying I was a Russian rabbit.
N-No  that -- the front door seal was never opened  because the guy got killed on Russian front.
One road led to Lwow in the direction of the Russian border and one towards Warsaw.
There was a normal Russian school there  which was run by the Siberian railroad si siber Siberian Si-Siberian Central Asia n Railroad.
They said that by coincidence  a sheer coincidence  there was a Russian officer who was an aid to the Russian commanding general in Vienna.
And well  of course  a lot of from the Russian empire also; Polish  Lithuanian  Latvian Catholics.
We had just Czech schools and also Russian  because in our town there lived a -- a great many  they were U-Ukrainians lived in our town and they lived mostly in the hills  not in the center of the town.
And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw.
It was a Soviet soldier  he was from Kaukas or somewhere  th-the Russians told me  he is from Kaukas  so he doesnt know a ny Russian.
You going to be good.ﬂ And the same thing was from Poland  from France  from Belgium  from the Russian  from Ukraine  from all over  all over Europe and this Buna works and this Buna I.G. Farben industry they make was at least one million of workers.
Here appeared  you know  a...and I came [to] a special Russian epidemiological hosp ital  to take care of all the inmates of 24 concentration camps all around.
Since Russian was not my language  but I had to study so instead of coming in according to my education  I should have at least come into the tenth class because the Russian had a ten-year school.
Stanova is -- ther e was a Russian word that was used in and among the Lithuanians and I used to lie next to him and he used to tell me little stories.
Uh...My mother is the seventh of eight children  and a family where Russian...they spoke Russian at home  and...uh....a little Yiddish.
You know  at any costs  so he decided that it was worth to run the risk and take us without permission to Romney and during the trip he turned to us and said  this friend of yours who speaks perfect Russian  they'r e Danish Jew  by the way  but born in Russia  he was a corespondent of the Danish state journalist in Moscow.
In Russian times  it was much wors e. Poland was a democracy but the Pas Outsky [ph] was a general  and he had them under c ontrol  you know what I mean?
So I remember there was a -- I had a friend  he was a major in the Russian KGB  and I went to him  and I told him  ﬁLis ten  I want to get out  and -- and how should I arrange it?ﬂ And now I didnt know that he would betray me.
It was 1941 in Ukraine when my father was taken to the Russian army  to the front.
This was probably around the time when the Russian Army was beginning to approach and was liberating some camps.
From Potekovalishna  in February -- in February what was very cold -- something like in February  or maybe beginning the February  maybe end of the appa -- s -- f -- January  when the Russian come over  because they come like in the January  begin the January  I went from Potekovalishna  because you have no -- no possibility to live.
You know  teachers were very important  you know  you could -- they had -- you remained the Jewish -- Jewish schools  the worn clothes  you went to a Jewish school  you went to Russian school  or the Polish school.
I had no idea where the Russian army was standing  and so forth.
And...uh...overnight  when we passed...call it...uh...you know from the Russian side to the American side.
And another thing is that the Russians suggested to the -- those that came and stayed there to take Russian passports.
The same thing we had Russians that were in fact by myself the Russian people are a nice people.
I tried Russia Russian people  I tried Jewish people  I tr ied anybody I could imagine  if any knows what is breck?
And they were all running back to Russian closer to the Russian border  deeper in Russia.
Yes  I had friends  I had friends who were Polish Catholics and especially during the Russian  when the Russian came and I went to this -- Im sorry -- and I went to this Russian school.
Because my father was bootlegging at that time  and the Russian soldiers got sick from from this drink  and they arrested my father for selli ng bad liquor to the Russians.
So  are you is there any apprehen sion that theres going to be a war coming to Latvia  that the Germans will do something that this wont stay- No  no because according to the Ribbentr op Molotov Pact  Latvia and Estonia and a good part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently occupation  and that Germans would not dare attack Russia.
And we didnt know that Russian are rounding these people and sending them to Siberia.
He was in the Russian army  then they transfer him to the Polish army.
And then -- now unbeknownst to me also  by the way  the -- the Russian commander in the area  had ca-called on all German forces to surrender and furthermore had  i-in that order also  had declared that any German who tries to eva -- a ny German soldier who tries to evade captivity by putting on civilian clothes  will be treated by the Soviet armed forces exactly the same way as he would have been treated by the German forces.
And my father and mother  they could speak Russian  German  Ukrainian  Polish.
That's what the Russians did  they used to conscript the men i nto the Russian army  and you were 20 years in this kind of prison.
I see the ordinary Russian people  and -- be -- being faced with an -- a representative of an ideology that is totally alien to them  and Im sure they will resist against it. [
It was one church  Catholic church  and was [indecipherable] A a a Russian Orthodox chur dox.
It happened in June  but in in si August in August  the Polish government in exile already had an agreement with the Russian government.
About a year later  they were asked to a big party by the local Russian army people  because they discovered what we did and especially what we did for them.
And while we sing th eir praises  we also sing the praises of the great Russian nation.
Most of my uncles were taken to the Russian Army  conscripted to the Russian Army.
As the Russian front went  we went right with them  and from the hundred  soon as a town was liberated  some of us remained in the town to establish a Polish presence  and to start to organize -- organize security  and -- and civil offices.
They fought with the Nazis  and as a matter of fact there were divisions of the Hungarians fighting in Russia on the Russian invasion -- the Nazi invasion of Russia.
One is the British  one is the French and one is the Russian.
That haystack beyond that haystack are the Russian  beyond that haystack are the Hungarian communists  but in-between is okay.
So we we re suppose to go to a town called in Polish where they ha d the Russian war commander.
And they were taken most of the time to the Russian front.
So it gave them a lot of motivation to kill Jews  and in the most brutal way  like ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VER BATIM RECORD 12 having water sprayed ont o them at minus 40 degrees weather in Russia  in the Russian winter.
Right  right  and who -- and who -- Do you think that that -- that may have been part of their understanding of -- Well  I think the Jewish people have alwa ys had a strong feeling about Civil Rights  and you know  being -- being an oppressed people fro m -- from way back  I mean  whether you go to Russia  and I mean  you know  the Russian -- the -- the Jewish people have been oppressed for -- for -- for -- for -- from -- from day one  actually.
Nobody...but uh even if they knew they couldn't do nothing  because I was mostly...I came from the Russian army to the to the Polish army  you know.
But it didnt mean a thing to me  you know  and I just -- I was pretty strong to -- to take it  and we walked farther  and we came to a city of Kleck  K-l-e-c-k-  and this city was very close to the Russian border.
Vlasov give up three million best soldiers from Vlasov in the Russian army gave up  because they didnt like the communism  right.
There were a couple of Jews that joined the Soviet military and one of them in particular became [Russian spoken here]  which was the highest medal that the Ru ssians could give.
The -- as I told you  the my -- my mother was Russian -- well  I mean  not Russian  w-was educated in -- her childhood in Russia  so she knew Russian literature very well.
Now -- so they wanted to -- yes  and as we came to the -- closer to Krakow from the west  so the Russian engineers  if -- f-find out that they already found some installations with [ind ecipherable]  where there were important USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 39 buildings  but they couldnt destroy the whole thing  because its like -- like this was the end.
I didn't say  \ I'm Jewish \  because if I said the Jewish I go to the Russian army.
And again  at that time for me  to tell me I don't want to fight and all from a Russia n...I expect it from everybody else  you know  but from a Russian I...in my youthfulness  in my   I expected some compassion  something what I went through.
So that if  should have some trouble  they couldn't say I forged the document  this is my me ssage to you  to you the Russian soldiers th e border.
So thats where I get there in sometime November or so  w ith the Russian.
And then  when he came to the last time to tell us that the Russian are all ready in Shedlitz.
Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23  2015 53 The Polish army  but the Russian directors are right there.
And the German Department of Agriculture had brought these mares and some stallions and othe r horses of a different breed  Caucasians and some were from the Russian steppes.
Because the Russian who been born 50 years ago is now a man of 50 years.
He was a soldier in the Russian army and they lived in Siberia first  in Russia  then when he died  they moved to China.
And Russian kind of escaped even though I went home every weekend hitchhiked  re I became a very a very good hitchhiker.
And in between newcomers were coming in  a nd the -- the Russian uniform were going to an end  and so those clotheses were -- had to be marked with red stripes.
And of course  he was afraid that he would have to join the Russian army.
We were not permitted to get out  it was November  but we sa w across the our train a train with Russian prisoners  in open cattle cars  and we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one bread in each car and these peopl e were starved to death   woul d start fighting and the minute they would start fighting  then SS said mutiny and would take their machine guns and Brrrrrrr.
I dont know  the Russian ghetto actions were every day  and our ghetto th ere were two more actions  I think  I cannot tell you the amount of people that were killed.
I never knew what 33 they did with the rocks  but the different layers  the Russian prisoners were at the bottom  the French prisoners and we were on top and what you had  you had rails going up and on top of the privileged character  I had this big  big handle that would bring the lorries  a lorry's a flat bed  these had sides on them  get them down to the mill  and pump  and empty one up and he would pick it up and then go the rail and there you had your little areas  whatever area was destined.
Well  again  I  I sort of  I think Im the kind of person whos easily interested in what goes on around her and so after I married Alan and I was thinking now what am I gonna do with my life and my masters in Russian Studies didnt help me much here in Albuquerque  New Mexico.
So then tol they told me to take a group of my friends and go and see the there is a report that some communists  or maybe even Russian soldiers  straggling soldiers are in a big building  Meistas factory  or a a b a building  that they might be hiding there.
They had a choice  to go either to that -- to the Russian school or to the Czech school.
And so the Russian Army gave him some shoes and they gave me a pair of bo ots.
We use to march--go by everyday a prisoner of war camp or Russian prisoners were there.
And  could you speak a little Russian with the Russian soldiers that you- Yes  oh  yes.
And the Russian war commandant was suppose to give us instructions what to do further.
Except  ventually  when the Russians start taking it over  they ask me to join the Russian army  which I said  ﬁWhy should I join the Russian army?ﬂ Ac tually they wanted join the Russian Air Force.
Parents were working people  but they gave  they gave me a good life  and I didn't  didn't know about poverty or problems  and uh  then all of the sudden  the planes come over our town  Kovna  Lithuania  dropping bombs  and our whole lives were shattered  especially my life  being at that time the on-one and only child  I had problems to adjust myself from a good life to  to complete a turn around 180 degrees  and here we  we start running  we start running from the  to join the Russian army  to run away  and the Germany  the Blitzkrieg  cut us off  turned us back  in uh homes  we came back home.
I lived under the Russian oppression for about ten years and again food was very scarce.
I know the German invited us when we were in Poland and some how they were even so I dont believe that they will do any harm to me  after all  I am a law-abiding person and I am professional.ﬂ So  we were standing there...as soon as the Russian left  in a few more hours  the maid of t he young doctor  there was a friend of my father came running up and said that the doctor told me to tell you there will be a program (you know what is a program) to night and since you are the most prominential in this town  you will be the first one.
So they must have been Russian s  but probably they were afraid too.
I came in and I was dressed in a Russian uniform.
When the Russian front come near  we will go come we will go back.
Not not so much from the White Russian  but from the Polacks it was terrible.
If you went to -- slept -- if a German woman encouraged young Polish or Russian boy to sleep with her  it was found out  death sentence immediately.
And the Jews didnt want to take Russian passports because they were hoping that  you know  things will straighten out  and they will be able to go home.
Isnt that enough of blasting  basting the Germans  of constantly constantly he says to me  my father was also in the Russian front.
How in heavens name was that -- Well  my -- we were -- it was in Ukraine  in D onbass  and we lived at this little room from the Russian old lady who rented to us  and me and my brother got sick.

And then eventually the Russian Army came in and we moved right with them.
And this us ed to be shipped to Galeetsia  farther down near the Russian border where we had it.
And was a good feeling that later  uh sooner or later  the German would be defeated and all American Army will come to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first o ver there.

Vienna was under four party occupation but in the middle of the Russian zone so we had to be evacuated.
You know  somehow  Russian Jews had also gold rubles from the last time  they had hidden.
My husband  when the German came  he was in the Russian army.

And we had to go out some out to sit betwee n  because if the Russian come in well theyll ch when they check with the [indecipherable] they gonna get you.
Thats why I refused  but h -- I have -- he recorded it with my picture  and him  and acknowledging that I was the comoon -- platoon commander  or commandeers ruddid  way they say it in -- in Russian.
So I run over to him and I could see that he happens to be Russian.
And we stayed with the grandparents until we  until we went to the Russian side.
Finally  we were permitted to talk to Russian soldiers because the Russians had established bases in Latvia already in September  October 1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact   but we were not permitted to talk to Russians.
And this Russian looks at him and he says  \ Sacebo\ . (
But you no  no Jews  no Jews  no Jews.ﬂ Even the Russian soldier.

Oh  he went when the Germans started  when the Germans came to Russia  he went  was it the Russian Army  different Russia  and he spent most since he didn't know Russian  so he had to work in coal mines.

And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also  Marxist phraseology  which they didnt believe in   who were Hebrew teachers before he beca they became Marxist  quote unquote  teachers  who were teaching Yiddish instead of Russian  which they ended up teaching for a while  you know?
And  they also  of course introduced all Russian history and Russian  and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda.
And two Russians were started in business  because I was  at that time I think  president of the Jewish Federation  and I went to the airport to greet two im when we took at every community at that time  took it upon themselves to resettle some Russian Jews that were able to get out of Russia where there was a lot of anti-Semitism at that time in the Soviet Union .
And Russians took all our -- 17 September -- couple of days we were fighting with small group  pro-Soviet group  Communist group in this area close to East Polish border and near the Lithuanian border in {Orani} that was less small fighting and Russian Soviet tanks was surround our group and we was forced to surrender.
The parents spoke between themselves in Russian  and sometimes in Polish  but with us they all spoke Polish.
And they were so cold the Russians  so they sat down and they said thank you and uh I picked up naturally a few Russian words then and almost talked  not at that time but after  and they left so then Joseph came down and said I take you up to an apartment.
I broke into the warehouse with a bunch of Russian soldiers.
The title of the song is Inde   it is written in Yiddish  it was written by Tasha  a very good friend of mi ne  an inmate of the camp Dinawarkee who never survived  who never made it an d the music is a popular Russian folk song.
Sort of a young  rather innocuous looking man who sort of rent the apartment  and was just w-wearing civilian clothes and then one day instead of opening the door with his key  about a month or two later he rang the doorbell  and my mother opened the door and sh e saw this large man in a Russian majors uniform and at first she didnt recognize him  she was scared.
And that was a Russian I think Russian officer  but an anyway  is Russian.
Okay  maybe  but I dont know which patriot they were  but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians  of cour se  because they wanted to help the Germans  but the Germans wanted to mobili ze them to go to the army and to fight the Russian [indecipherable].
And all of a sudden I looked up  and there were two big  black boots in front of me  and I looked up  and he said to me  in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.
My job  I was like a -- th -- a -- a -- the maseetsala channika -- Im saying it in Russian  a -- a vice chair of a department.
The Russian  how do you call  the Russian prisoners  you know  there were lot of prisoners of war from Germany that came home.
Then I have to attend to the gi -- gimnasium  in which I would be learned perfect one of these languages  Russian  or German.
Was a group from 40 or 50 people  all of th em all of them deserters of Russian army from Polish army.
The Germans attacked the Russian s and they needed the pelts.
I couldnt read Russian  but I was looking at the pictures  you know.
And the first Russian soldier was on a bicycle  believe it or not.
So anyway  I decided to escape  I -- I didnt have money enough  I gave him my watch -- to the peasant  and for this he took me in a rowboat over the river  and we somehow were able to omit  you know  the border patrols  the Russian and German border patrol  and I took a train back to Warsaw.
They spoke no German  they spoke Polish and Russian  and a few words of German here and ther e. Some Czech children  but mostly  as I say  it was eastern European children  who had either been brought in by themselves  or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them.
At that stage I didn't care  and one morning I looked down from the fourth floor and there was the Russian army  and being that I speak other languages  some Czech  some Yiddish...there was a Jewish officer in the Russian army.
Your father was he able That was til 1940 when the Russian war broke out.

A lot of Russian dignitaries came into the si -- town  and set up the administrati on in which they -- they brought people  their own people to administrate the city.

He was caught and he remained with the Russians  on th e Russian side.
And the letters stopped coming and there was the Russian occupati on of Lithuanian where I heard only indirectly of his activities and the ways he was handling the situation toward his family and above of all for his colleagues and himself.
I still have this passport  provided for the Russian who let me in.
And we were allowed to speak English only with the linguist  with the Russian lang -- And we had two students and one linguist and we changed every hour for five hours every day.
He was a husky guy with a mu  mustache  had a dark complexion  he looked like a Russian.

We were sitting in the cellar and uh the Russian tanks came in and there were a lot of shooting  a lot of killing.
So  with her fluent Russian  they made her supervisor for that whole group of people who are working there My God.

When you first started to learn -- how did y -- when you first started learning about what had happened in -- in Poland  primarily  but certainly west of where you were -- Yeah  this was when I was in the -- in the Russian army  started to read  and -- and I came to various cities  and nowhere were Jews.
With a great deal of luck I got ahold of a Jewish Russian officer who spoke Yiddish.
Now  we were in the Russian sector  going into a building and unbeknownst to me  she was meeting we were there to meet with  I guess  representatives of the army  the U.S. Army to see if we could get papers  so that we could begin the process of becoming DPs  refugees  and eventually emigrating t-to the U.S. So she went from one zone to the other?
We should go with a Russian army   where they took  you know  was already occupied from the German territory  when they gave it to Poland  and Stolczyn  Szczecin  all the Jews arrived.
And a -- a otriad is a -- the -- the group of Russian -- group of people.
And when the Russian la take over  her husband  president  and his assistant vice-president  they putting them on a truck  they were emptying the latrines  you know  like in the old days.
Well  they had to have been Russian   which my mother referred to as not liberators  but occupiers  again.
And then the reason she didn't want me to go is because she didn't want the Russian soldiers to come.
I know that there were some German soldiers who came on convalescent leave so it was sort of a R & R rest and recuperation place and I dont remember how many but there have been about forty or fifty or so who occupied one or two buildings there and if I remember correctly  they had all been wounded on the Russian front and so forth and they basically just wanted to get well and they didn't want to have trouble with anybody.
We came with the Russian soldiers  with this  to Bial ystok.
And about 20 some kilometers farther  there were a couple of Russian villages  which at time  we were given permission we were given the pass  that we could go to those villages and trade  barter for some of the clothes that we brought with us from Poland for some food.
And when the Russian came in– in the beginning he was a very big shot.
E: And then he became a very well known as a physician  very well accepted by the whole diplomatic corps  the Russian and the Ge rman ambassador  and the Swedish ambassador and the British ambassador and the American ambassador  they were all his patients.
For some reason  that one day  they opened the  the border  and the Germans got rid of these people  and the Russian s accepted them.
They spoke Yiddish most of them and half Russian because their guys were the other side  but I spoke Polish  I went to school.
The the nearby areas that there but there was always so I remember  you know  every once in awhile wed wed catch a ride  you know  or if you know  and and I remember one time we were on a train  on a cattle car  and wed stopped at this station  and there was a another train  th-t he next the next 29 railroad track  and were all Russian soldiers  they were returning from from the you know  from the war  basically.
She was working in Danzig for a Russian general with her mother as interpreters.
But in the morning I I have  in sleep like singing Czech songs  partisan songs  and when I woke up there was a Russian soldier what woke me up.
Your treatm -- your treatment by the Russian authorities  or the Soviet authorities in Bialystok was -- Oh  it was good  but they did not -- they probably supplied the food for the various organization to feed us.
I mean  we didn't even keep track of the Russian and Jewish so ldiers  except some of them were at the Bar Mitzvah.
The people  the owners who were ow ners of plantation; they had plantation in the eastern part of Poland but they lost everything because of revolution  the Russian revolution in 1917  they returned to Warsaw and they treated the place they lived like their plantation.
Because in Berlin  they had the Russian zone  the French zone  the English zone  the American zone.
I used to call him uncle and Frieda  and uh he worked  you know  and this was already in the Russian  because the Russian was on that part of Poland.
I was on my duty in th e hospital when it started  and the hospital had a lot of wounded Russian troops and so on.
And there we were with the supposed to be with the Russian girls  and lets see  what else?
Went to the movies and I went...I studied hard and I didn't 2 knew Russia  so they gave me papers  newspapers to read  and I read newspapers and this when I learned Russian  and uh it was a...the professor told my mother it's a big and I will be .
It's a total sh rinking in  and trying to listen to Radio London  uh  trying to find out what the news is  uh  having a map which you open every night and you see what happens on the Russian front and reading the newspapers to try to guess what really happened.
So  here here were  lets see  girls uh-huh  Russian grab Poland.
We didnt do too much  I would say  like the Russian  they reward  what do you call it?
But we got them and we were changed over as Russian soldiers.
On July the Russian came in and we was free after this.
But later  you see  go out in the streets  and you saw those Russian soldiers  and -- you know  I -- like I mentioned  I was raised and I had none -- much sympathy for Russians.
And then the second piece of inform ation came in 1999  when from the Red Cross and from the Russian Red Cross  yo u got some information that there was a woman who had the same I.D. as your mother  but that she comes from Saint Petersburg  not fr Yeah  and in in the same time.
She just came back from taking them clothes and food  and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about  they were talking in Russian  and I understood Russian.
But Berlin by itself  found itself within the Russian occupational zone  which means Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 130 that in order to get out from Berlin is not to get out of Berlin  I had to get out from the whole zone  to cross through hundred few hundred kilometers.
But they were uncomfortable there too  because they they were Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8  2013 53 not Poles  they were they they their allegiance was closer to Russian Jewry than they were to Polish Jewry.
I yell at him  ﬁDont go there  th-the officer says nobody is supposed to go there.ﬂ ﬁOh  you will tell a Russian soldier  yeah?ﬂ And went down and took all his bottle.
Then also  the partisans  like Zina was  they was a group of people like -- they called themselves in Russian semeyny otryad 12  they were like families type of things there.
So I looked at my MOS  my military expertise  and decided that already I was already an interpreter  why send him to Russian school?
So  the Russian partisans were able to pull a lot of the local communities in?
Even the Russian Communists  you know  but they saved more people than anybody else  you know  and I I went with him on that raid and and we really went in a house uh and there were men and maybe two women  but mostly men  you know  and and were there.
But really  we were told if we caught on the German side  tell them we came from th e Russian side so they throw you back on the Russian side.
When we were...we were taken over by the German  there were...there were...we actually...the part that we were...were...at the Russian occupation  and 6 there was...uh...a truck standing in front of our pharmacy and there were Russian doctors that were asking my father to join him and go back to Russia before the German occupied  but my father said that in a war you have to have a roof under your head and he didn't want abandon it.
Hey toots  said he  and proceeded to talk to me and discovered because I spoke Russian and he was in charge of the PW and DP camps.
I recall going to the opera house  we were involved in opera  and se eing the Russian ladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns  and I recall in our  when they took our store they removed everything so my fath er still removed some di shes for bartering later which helped us for a long time .
Its Russians -- it was still Russian -- 37 Oh  okay. --
And we st arted to study  but the language  before Lithuanian  we started to study Russian.
I was working like nothing would happen  but over there one Sunday the Russian partisan went to the village  they had a good time with the girls.
At th at time Poland was partitioned  and Lwow was Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger 4 in the Russian sector  and where we were living was in the German sector.
As a matter of fact  besides Russian  I even spoke Polish.
I spoke Lithuanian  and little bit German  and then after the Russian  the one year Some Russian?
What would come on the radio ther e  what was there  music  or Thered be the the well  yeah  for th e most part there would be first thered be the news  you know  of  you know  the the Russian front is moving  you know  and the Russians are winning an d all that kind of stuff.
And it was very bad  and my mother  she start thinking  if we not starve really  to death  you know  in that camp  in that Uzbekistan   then she send two my youngest sister to Russian orphanage  because in orphanage they have more food than all this.
I mean  you ha -- because we might ha ve had a Russian housekeeper  so I would have occasion to speak Russian to her.
Then we get into the Russian liberation camp  the hospital and then I get typhus.
That was his name  he was sort of Polish and white and Russian mixed in him  so either way you would call him Polish would be correct.
Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 37 I have to learn Russian language in school.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 9 And can you tell me this  was Kolbuszowa in the last in the 19 th century  was it the part of Poland that belonge d to Austro-Hungary   or the part that belonged to the Russian empire  or the ger or the Prussians?
I discovered that no one else has survived  none of my family  and the part of Europe  Germany where I was liberated  became...was destined to become the eastern  the Russian zone  now part of eastern rather than East  Germany  and uh the Americans wanted to uh put uh on turn us over to the Russians because they were shipping people that were from France and Holland to France and Holland and people that were from Poland and Czechoslovakia back east and that day the Russians didn't...they put us in a truck and brought us out to 23 the town  outside of the town where the Russian's lines were.
It would have had to be -- we were closer to the Russian side of course.
My family was in Galicia  and then belonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the Russians.
We are going to be resettled to Poland  and they're going to have Russians -- White Russian  who were replacing us.
So I was shipped  for three weeks of Russian refresher course  in Oberammergau   Germany  and you probably know Oberammergau is a place where every 10 years they give the the Easter thing.
I remember the first one of them demonstrated me one evening how to fire a rifle  and of course f-for a little kid thats -- I mean  I didnt fire it  I 17 couldnt even hold it  it was -- but -- and I learned to sing Russian songs  some of which I can still remember.
Even me when I was little because my first language was Russian.
And then Vera Weitzman  who was a very you know a lady and she was with the all the Ambassadors over there  so she spoke with the Russian Ambassador  they're bringing in...in Washington and she was here and she spoke with the French Ambassador there and here.
Before the war started I got two years in Polish school  and two years in the Russian.
Do you know  you say its Russian Asia   but what would be the place names?
>> Bill Benson: So this is one of the pilots in the Russian planes?
Oh  I need a coat  he says  Im going away  and -- hes going -- hes a Russian [indeci pherable] from a little town.
And I did not join during the Jewish Corps  which was primarily Russian Jews; but a transport company.
The -- at that time -- it was 1931  I think  the street signs in Latvia were still in three languages  Latvian  German and Russian and German was still -- a-and both German and Russian were still considered acceptable languages  although the Latvian government emphasi -- tried to em phasize Latvian.
At that time we did not know what was happening to them  but they were chased through certain 01:15:30 sections of town into the forest  a place called Rumbola and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large graves  mass graves  and when the people got there they were told to undress  put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile  clothing in another pile  driven to the edges of this mass grave  and machine-gunned.
If that property would have been converted successfully  at the time of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might  it would have been worth millions.
We also supported Israel in the settling of the Russian refugees.
So he give me two days to come back and take an exam in Latin in the Russian language which I did and I passed it.
My boss thought that the Germans could fight off the onslaught from the Russian army  so eventually the fight...if he's safe  I'm safe  so he could open himself a little bit.
We had enough food  but on the walls  and on the ceiling  names from the Russian who got killed there.
They took a lot of people  and she th-the Russians was carrying stuff  and we gave the Russian Interview with Sylvia Rosen November 20  2012 33a bottle of whiskey.
So we went from the Russian zone  into the American or the British zone.
No  no the school became a Russian school  a school with a Russian language of instruction.
To run to the Russian oc -- and now conquered  liberated territories.
But your mother spoke Russian  so it was -- Oh  she pa -- she spoke perfect Russian.
He spoke some re some Russian  but he was not very good in in the Russian  yes.
Right before our eyes we saw the bridge collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants  really.
Other -- you mean other prisoners were beating them up  or the Russian Army?
And in April actually they -- at the of April  the Russian troops came to Brno.
I had a young Russian boy working with me  I would duck behind the machine.
shoes  when he sent  in the terrible time of Stalingrad   the Hitler has thousand bombers  and and and and the Russian 43.
So I had the potential knowledge of Russian  but I never used it  until ‚39 - ‚40  when the Russians came in.
I tell you  the Russian people that we met  a lot of them were very  very nice  you know?
Once we were thrown out  and went back to our room  the very next day I said to her  Im not going to st -- there were sectors  American   British  French and Russian.
The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the Russian Zone.\
We -- with my mom we spoke Yiddish and Polish and with him  he was little  he didn t know Yiddish or Polish then  spoke Russian to me.
First of all  the Russian classified everybody in many ways .
And nobody everybody looked in them  and we kept on saying a guy came over to me  he says to me [Russian]?
I needed to understand a little bit of what this meant  and and if I understand what youre telling me  is that this Russian  who was so tall  and strong  and able to cut down the tree Yes.
Ve ry few trees to stop th e wind and the wind was blowing and then we heard the Russian planes over and some bombing by the Russian planes and I said  well maybe they  they goi ng to catch up with us  but  they didn't.
Whatever you want  you have to be divided.ﬂ In the meantime  he made me and he made a group in Russian Russian kept separate  and he made from Polish people  A.L. he called them.
You see trucks with Russian soldiers going through and kind of fleeing --?
I don't know how  because he was Russian at the time from the war.
I cannot do it.ﬂ So they were hidden on a flat car that had a tank that was traveling to the front German tanks that were going to the Russian front and covered with tarps  so they were hidden under the tarps and they somehow made it.
Russian revolution began  the my mo my grandmother insist that she come home  and she did.
We knew some  we knew the you know  my ma my f my father see the beginnings of the Russian revolution in Russia.
Everything was ----------  the money ------ ruble  was a big  how should I tell you  ------police  Russian schools  policemen  the army  the farmers they couldn't sell the way they want the produce.
What she did was each time there was an opportunity to talk to one of the Russian guards  which was at work  and this she told us in the evening about  or wh en she got her ration cards  or when she whenever there was some contact  she would ask.
So she took me to there was a a Russian truck  military truck.
We ran out in front of the barn and those were Russian tanks that were rolling into that particular town.
They dropped leaflets all over...not Germany maybe  but all over the prior Russian territories.
We was standing... that was Rozhishche [Polish: Royszche]...from the partisans  and we become Russian soldiers.
Interview with David Wisnia 65 By the Russian planes  and wait  you're talking about something playing a trick on me  the Russian planes we saw stars  red star s  right?
And I know about what the Russian say s  and I was right because those who went to the Russians went to live in Siberia and other places.
The Russian guy tells me  well Elizabeth  dont you recognize me?
Later on I heard that some guys had hidden under the straw and they waited for the Russian and they didn't take the trip to Germany  to Buch enwald .
So the Russians -- the Russian prisoners had more guts  more strength.
And they began writing home letters describing what was happeni ng on the Russian front  describing what was happening in Albania  describing what was happening in Yugoslavia  Croatia  and all those places  and saying  ﬁI am Italian  I love my count ry  but I am ashamed of what some people are doing  collaborating with the Nazi.ﬂ And they were letting their family know  and of course not everything came true  and the censorship was very strict  but we have to remember that among the censorship there were also people who were Italian  and Italian being Italian  and member of the -- letter go through  so that we seems to be aware at that tim e -- not that I understood it  far from it.
So then he said to his -- so the other man said to him in German  which I understood  he said  ﬁNow  we dont have to go.ﬂ Because they were a patrol to see wa -- from where the Russian.
And he came to Romania in 1917  probably with the Russian Army.
As for us in the barn  freedom came in the last moment  and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle  leading the way to more Russian soldiers on trucks appeared and pr evented the burning of the barn  with our living corpses in it.
But my fa Was this the fir was this the first time you saw any of the Russian soldiers  or or Russian military [indecipherable] No  I no  we saw them also coming in.
I had to study Russia -- Russian  and how else did it affect me?
We talked to him I mean  I didnt talk  becau se I didnt speak Russian.
Then from Odessa we went by Russian ship to Turkey and from Turkey back to Palestine.
And they explained to him that if he allows the American trucks to cross the line  they will they can liberate all of the prisoners  and the German didnt want  obviously  to Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 102 have the western prisoners fall into Russian hands  the way that the western allies didnt  so he agreed to it.
Came Jewish officer  a Russian officer  a Jewish and told us  you know wh at I have a better  a very ba d feeling for us.
We were very remote  you know  we are twelve miles away from the Russian border  the .
Again  historians know that the region of Hungary was uh  struck some kind of ally pact with Hitler a nd they were allies  so Hungarian troops on the Russian front and so forth.
All the other schools were can -- had -- transforming to Russian speaking schools.
I went over there  and as I came closer to the woods  and I saw a few came out  is a -- Russians  said to me to lift -- to raise my hand  and they looked at me  and they ask me who I am  so I said  ﬁI am a Polish partisan.ﬂ I spoke Russian.
So I was with a going on with a Russian  they needed me like a hole in the head  they didn't have themselves anything.
AVRAHAM TORY September 27  1991 ...and this is what came from   Russian to Hebrew Tory.
So the Russian officer says  \ You are a director of the factory 10 and you are barefoot.
You also have to re-remember that my parents were a generation th at was educated in Russian schools.
I see the love the soldier had for that Russian officer  I figured I'm not saying anything that I'm Jewish  nothing.
Speaking Rus -- speaking  they spoke Russian  and the boy made accqua-acquaintances and we were close to Berlin  very short distance to Berlin and he would go to Berlin.
And we particular the Russian literature  the Soviet literature we had we had to read  you know  some of the Sholokhov s novels  and there is about de-depor tations.
I didnt recognize him because he wore the partys uniform  the red star  that was Russian.
Then  we also ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- in our little town.
We brought this in the -- to our place  our home there and on the way going -- youre going -- going to our place -- to the bunker  call it a home  we stopped another little farm  we got some bread  you know  the way the Russian did.
But even to the Russian 12 military they lost a little bit of faith  are we going to be alive.
And he comes across a page of my diary in German on a stone on the heath of Luneburg  where the Pershing weapons on the left  on the west is the English and American  on the right is the Russian.
Because when the Russian will come--which we have heard th at they are very close--there  first of all  they will rape you all...um like not one  but all.
Then I said  if it comes a Russian  Im going to identify myself as a German.
He was the mayor of the city and he's a Russian soldier.
These were all Jews that were trying to... Jew...Jewish...mostly...probably a lot of Jewish  mostly Russian and a lot of Jewish people were running away  and I was with the uh uh Frieda Klatter.
So after I relaxed and thought on this moment for a few minutes  I continued to walk by myself on the upper hill of 44 Landowner (Russian) 45 Jew (Lithuanian) 37 the  of the forest-like highway.
All our correspondence has to be in Yiddish  because we dont know English  we dont know Russian  we dont know Japanese  you dont know Spanish.
I the only rumors that I heard as a child was that they when they could  they escaped to Lithuania   and in fact  Lithuania is surrounded by lakes  and one of the thrilling stories that we cousins would talk about was that our various parents spent Interview with Al Jaffee May 21  2016 12nights in the lakes  breathing through straws to avoid being recaptured by the Russian military people who were looking for for the young men.
No  as a matter of fact  some eight or ni ne month and during the Russian Occupation.
I found out they ex -- they excavated everybody  and they burned them.ﬂ The whole -- they -- when they liquidated Plaszow  before the Russian came  there were couple hundred people to clean up.
I went there  the was had just been over  it was a long story  I  our lines had just joined with the Russian lines and it was very strictly forbid den to go into Russian territory because of dipl omatic possible complications and so  and I just took   went to the border  I had made so me passports for myself  which I ha ve here  with th is  this officer  Lieutenant William Perl is pro ceeding to so and so and all Russian authorities are requested to help him in the fulfillment of his miss ion  signed William R. Perl.
Like I say  they didnt have apartments  we rented rooms  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 46 they were -- oh  I think they were about 80  even in those days  and they were ru -- Russian immigrants  spoke very little English and they hesitated in taking in a girl in the room  because  you know  werl washes her ha ir  puts bobby pins  in those days.
But they were not in the communist -- they were not in the Russian zone.
They were not prepared because the Ge rman with Russian  they were friends at that time.
Somebody said that is a thunde r  somebody said in that a war  or or the third version was that the the Russian soldiers have exercise maneuvers.
The Nazis didn't want to go to the Russian front  so they built and they expand  and they said they need this and they took out more people in order to escape from the Russian front.
It was an -- a -- a look of a Russian inte lligent [indecipherable] you know -- you have to know the Russian intelligent  how they -- they looked  like Chekhov  like  you know.
And we saw how the Russian Army push back the Germans.
And I witnessed them doi ng that in the movie theaters  where they would stand by the door  and watch for the patrons to leave  and they would round up whomever -- whoever they thought were a nash -- a Russian national  which wasnt too hard to detect.
And we went around and if they had the calf  we said  we will set a small herd of cows  and we will go into the steppes because it doesnt belong to anybody  we could do it  and take it but somehow we did it fell through  but anyway  my brother was taken by he wa s then 12 years old  and he was taken by the some Russian people who were building the train things to to go and be you know  go-getter  or some how do you call it?
And as a matter of fact  he was also one of the victims  but of another in Vicovnya   which recently was opened up on the Russian  near Kiev  that it was the prisoners  who were not prisoners of war  but prisoners who were taken to full prisons.
We reached City Poznan in Poland  which had a large station  and at the station  there were Russian soldiers sitting all along waiting for a transport.
tape break] Okay  so it was this one young Russian soldier who was helping to pack up Right.
He comes by  he drives closer  I recognize a Jewish  um a Russian soldier.
Some of them even came from the Russian side already or there were Gentile papers.
As the front lines started to move forward  the Russian armies kind of joined up with some of the partisans.
And all the peoples are coming  so there are proof there were some da and Ill have to translate from English to Czech  from German to Czech  from Polish to Czech  from Russian to Czech and I am doing all these things  and I have Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 65 Im translating.
When his family arrived  he brought two Russian girls from Moscow  th e head bookkeeper and the head cashier.
Anyhow  when we came to that villa and -- and we stayed overnight and lo and behold  next morni ng or next day  the Russians -- Russian soldiers arrived.
So the Russian  the general says [indecipherable] he didnt say nothing  he walk away.
But the question...they told me I will get ten years if I wouldn't have political inter...help in knowing...they also realized that I didn't know what I was talking  but mostly the political...if a Russian would ask  he wouldn't see the sun anymore because this was a no question.
And and af ter we received food and everything from the Russians  we then this Russian soldier  I dont know what his rank was  or what  but he was this Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated and we became the guide to his officer  and showed him where to go in Berlin from point A to point B  because we knew it so well.
But excuse me  the reason why Im being more precise is  wasnt that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  or was it the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic?
The Germans din -- We were come -- We were ra -- We ran away  you know  when the bobocart  and we start to run towards the German -- to the Russian border.
They stopped because the Polish people wanted to be very smart  and they wanted   when -- as the Russians approached Krakow  so they wanted to make the uprise  and the Germans were -- had involve with the Russian USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 50 front 10 divisions  so they figured they were busy -- busy with the Russian front  and they will make the uprise  and they will establish an -- a free Poland government.
Germans absolutely unprepared to survive Russian  Siberian type of the weather.
We came -- we came with -- previously I told this story  that the Russian smuggled us to his cr -- tr ain compartment  and we arrived in Berlin and he let us off at the station  and we were standing there  and sort of sizing people.
When the Russian s  came a lady  the Russian women  they  you know  power steer ing.
So pretty soon this Russian officer came on the platform  started ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 talking to my father.
I mean  was not far  about 50 kilometers from e from the Russian border.
But thank God they had [indecipherable] they had a Russian Cossack who spoke French  and he was teaching French.
So many men would escape to the Russian side to go and join.
And just started taking child development courses and fell in love with those like Id like fallen in love with Russian foreign policy.
And the next night we met two Russian soldiers  not partisan this time  and we spoke to them.
I was speaking from my -- my native languages were two  Lithuania n  and Russian  I spoke from childhood.
You know  the [indecipherable] was a manifestation of these two armies  western ar mies  and the Russian armies having -- having come together  you know  there must have been millions of such encounters.
Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.
Then we looked up in a slit window up there and we saw just shoes and they were not German shoes but they were Russian boots.
She said in Russian [speaks Russian] Will I stop or not?
Educated people got their degrees  their higher education at Russian universities.
So my father said  in Jewish  he says  dont leave it alone  because they dont understand the difference anyway  between Polish and Russian  theyre French  you know?
And so went out int o  at this moment  Laura already came down  running  and she kissed me and embr aced me and this Russian officer was so emotional  that he got his sergeant    his name.
Europe I left probably in 1945  I came out from the Russian army  came to Germany and sit there for three months in the kibbutz.
We were taken from Banska Bystrica by a Jewish partisan who was part of the Russian partisan movement.
American prisoners and Russian prisoners and Polish prisoners-of-war; they had it a little easier  a little better.
And I worked there in polyclinic  but -- and during this time  when was Russian.
Did you like these Russians  the Russian soldiers  and the Russians that you -- Well  I didnt really sort of -- I was curious about them  you know.
But in Kaunas in Kovno   they started nationalizing the big businesses and they start taking out those people who they felt they are not sympath et ic with the with the with the Russian government and that they had some some kind of history that they were exploiting people.
They couldn't run away with the Ger-- with the Russian soldiers.
Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves  they were POWs  right  and they didnt have no weapons.
Half the bridge was Russian  half American  the we -- Americans w ouldnt let us cross.
He got over to the Russian side ; for whatever reason the Russian accused him of being a German spy.
That's all I had was my Swedish paper and one I guess he was a Russian or a Rumanian and he started to talk to me and I smiled very nicely and couldn't answer.
One day a young doctor came in  a medic from the Russian Army came in into this place.
Tell me that the same valiant soldiers from the Russian army  that they captured Berlin  everything  fought so gallantly against the Nazis  over two and a half million got killed  and they went like sheep to the slaughter.
So  a-after a couple days we had to be relo reloaded into the Russian train.
We...I was born on the German side; but we wound up on the Russian side.
One of the things I regret not having time to get to is  and this might embarrass Dora  but how she met her husband because she had learned English overhearing a conversation on a train with an American   a Russian  I think  and a Bri t. >> Dora Klayman: And Yugoslav.

Yeah  Russian  I s I spoke Russian  I we used to write Russian.
But we -- we were staying in the Jewish house in the Russian zone.
It was a small group of about 20  they were a forward group  and their mission was to undermine the progress to the Russian front.
A coupl e weeks later  I ran away too  for a couple of nights  and I came back and it was quiet  nobody ever looked for me  for my other friend and that Russian guy disappeared.
They were always mixed  a few Jews in the Russian partisans  thats where Itka was.

Because we had to run away from Poland  the Russian were there  and that was a very  very bad time.
They were Russian officers that were in the Spanish Civil War.
There was a lot of Russian women were there and he says  make sure you don't let anybody bring in any food in the camp.
There was a bridge over there  and that divided between the Russian and the American zone.
And I do remember very  very  very clearly that it was Christmas morning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood.
And I find myself in this apartment and it's facing a square  and diagonally across to the right is where the Russian soldiers are housed in some big huge building.
So I can say that I am an assimilated Jew in the Russian culture.
He was in the Russian army and then they took him to the Polish army.
So  there was quite a congregation of people from that little town around and then there was one person who said I introduce you to the Russian commissar who is in charge of all the stores and his wife is taking care of children who have no homes and maybe somehow we can work something out that you ca n go to school  maybe find a job  and I had no place to go  I say okay I'll stay another day.
It was like the small bin that is I've seen here in this country  and a Russian soldier actually st rapped it on his wrist Bill Benson: Like a watch.
Of c ourse  other s radio stations  German  Russian and others were available  but we didnt we didnt feel like we have to use that at that time.
Like needles stuck in my lungs and I told  I had a friend  a Russian prisoner  Ivan  I don't know whether that was his real name  but they called him Ivan .

And so  you know but I Im in a way Im glad that I that I went to school  because I still remember a lot of Russian.
When the Russian army were near th near the over there.
So the very first soldier foreign soldiers that you see Its the Russian.
Also  there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border  it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates.
So we were -- we want-- wanted in the beginning to go with Russian  but they said they won't take us civil people.
So they start to talk to us  \ we are Russian  you're going to be free now  the war has ended  you come out.
And then naked  wet  we stood in that freezing cold wintry day 'til we got the remnan ts of Russian prisoner of wars uniforms  which was cotton top and cotton pants.
You werent in an environment where you could learn Russian because if you were at home all the time Yes but being there you were familiar with the Russian words.

I dont know that there was much of an underground in Latvia because the Latvians really  from everything we could see  were really very much pr o German and very much anti Russian and I think the Latvians were probably roo ting for the Germans to win and uh .. I would say that the Latvians were basically more -- more the Latvians than the Lithuanians-- were probably more  more an tagonistic towards us than many of the Germans were so I couldnt envision escapi ng into that element.
Pawiak prison was an old so Russian prison in the center of Warsaw   a huge built to take care of Polish par freedom fighters of the 19 th century.

>> Bill Benson: Now you see the Russian troops  they're here.
We hide like yard goods  so we still had something all the time to tr ade and still live a be tter life than {the average person under Russian occupation  they didnt have it}.
And I know the incidents of people who was one professor that I read somewhere that small story  one professor at the University of Lvov  they were talking about one of the uprising in in Poland in the [indecipherable] what they said congress was a part of Russian Russian part of Poland who stepped up the activities  and they said  where I where are you sons  they asked the prof essor.
And  you know  they was in the middle and all the soldiers  the German soldiers have to be on the side because  you know  they was the Russian soldiers come in  and they took them all to the camp.
Some spoke Russian  some spoke Polish  some Ukrainian  Lithuanian  Estonians  Latvian.
He survived then  he was a doctor and he had helped quite a few people over there in Poland and they hid him so he came back with with the trucks  with the Russian Army.

Once a Russian soldier spoke to me and I asked him if he can bring me to Lublin and he said he's going in that direction> I was fearless  and I said I'll go and I'll take a look by myself.

In Swidnica I dont remember the Russian presence -- presence at all  not at all.
And then when they -- it was when the front came near to th e ghetto  the Russian stopped  they didnt want to move in.
Liberchuk -- Celia Liberchuk and Labe Liberchuk  which was in Russian Leonid  because Labid was too Jewish for -- for -- for sure  to be in -- in Russia.
When the war was over the Russian told us if we want to go back to Poland   we can go.
So  I knock at the first door  and a woman comes out  and speaks Russian  kto tam   who is there?
You could have easily pointed out somebody and said  Nazi  and a Russian would pull a gun and shoot him.
We came over there and we couldnt walk any more  we got swollen legs  and we we went into a city called Beyhavar  its not far from the Russian border there.
The American Occupied Zone of Germany  the British  French and Russian Occupied Zone.
They have instructions from their leaders  from from Soviet  from from from Russian.
And I spoke fluent Russian  so I recognized  and I'm very sorry to tell you that eventually when we went to another town  we wanted to be repatriated so that we could find out  because we were completely isolated - this is now East Germany - the Russian commandant  who whoever he was  who was repatriated  and I mean people had no idea yet what was going on.
Bu t when we came into the forest  we made sure 24 military detachment (Russian) 25 virgin forest (Russian) 32 that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the farmers.
Now you have to understand we 26 later realized that we were walking into some kind of a military poc ket...the Russians in the back of us and the Allied armies in front of us  and uh in th e middle of the night it was...no  not middle...it it it was just getting dark...the Russian guns really uh sent their shells and they came they came closer and closer  and almost thr eatening and at this moment I said to my frien d...we...I saw some of the Polish people  Polish political prisoners we had in our area  said well  this enough  we run.
It was May 5th I think it ended  Russian date .
First of all  they know already because before they coming to us  they pass already Auschwitz and Buna there  and the whole way that they make from the Russian country ‚til us.
But on the other hand  if I would have been with Russian partisans  if -- if Commander Proch would have tried to break a barrel of liquor  they would have killed him.
And in two minutes a Russian officer come with a re a red band here  with a tomaht  leave everything alone. [
They were a -- they were having hordes of German soldiers coming from Russian prisoners camp  and priority was for the older ones  not for born in 26.
You see  I dont understand at that time  but I must have had some  becaus e when we came to over there  to Paklevy   they were talking in Russian a lot.
These were weapons that the Germans had coll ected in the battlefields that the Russian army had left behind in retreat.
And they went over to them and they told them it is a group of partisans and this  and they said  ﬁJews on top of this  what?ﬂ Here this a Russian general came over  a Jew.
We di d know Russian  some Polish and I really don't know how formal it was.
We know from the memoirs and testimonies of people who survived that during the winter  the harsh Russian winter  temperatures a re minus 40 degrees  the snow is knee -high  they didn't have other clothes or shoes  and they had to march in those circumstances and many of them just were too weak and couldn't march any longer.
Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 51 A. We continued walking  and the Russian took over.
And then after my parents got used to my marrying something of Russian background  and they loved Art because he's a wonderful man.
And they...when they looked out  they saw Russian tanks and uh you know  they greeted them and Adam walked over to one of the officers there.
I even forgot his name by the time I went out  but he gave me the papers and I walked back to the super  and he was quite shocked and I didn't know that he speaks Russian and he was living on my father for all those years  my father kept them.
Some were able to  when the war broke out  to go east  to the Russian side  eventually  they came back and few people.
We just said  ﬁWe ll make our way to Poland and from there  well worry about going to Starachowice.ﬂ But we met a Russian soldier who was Jewish on the train  and he told us  if were Jewish  not to go back  because its not safe in those small - he asked us how big a town it was  and we said  ﬁSmall town.ﬂ And he said  ﬁDont go back; go to a big city.ﬂ And we said  ﬁBig city?
88 Well  we had y -- you know  y -- our people worked to collect the arms from the Russian military.
Warsaw was mainly under the Russian influence and Russian zone  so to speak.
It was one day when the Germans left  and the Russian didnt come.
Tell us what that time was like for you and your community and your family when you were under Russian occupation.
And so this woman used to get couple of those Russian workers and go into the fields and there [indecipherable] around  and she would say w-we can g glean your fields.
He brought him -- he went to the Russian zone and brought my Uncle Ben and we ha d a reunion and we met.
till one day  one day we heard there was also in Lublin -- it was a bigger place -- there was also a lot of Dutch prisoners of war what were freed by the Germans  so there was some more Dutch people in Lublin and somehow  either through the Red Cross or 11 Shlomo Podchlebnik 21 whatever  they organized into bring them back to Holland  bring them back from the Russian -- I don't know from where  but it went out.
And Tory who was  who  who  who was on the  on the  on his flight from Kovno yes through  through Russian communist territory uh had many difficulties.
He was upset  he had his whole family  he was a Russian.
And what does that mean  Miles  what does that kind of a job -- In Russian its called snubjoinya.
the German army swept through the Baltic states  within eight days occupied the Baltic states and there was very little time to make up one's mind whether to stay behind or to leave with the retreating Russian army.
But the captain who was sitting next to me was killed  a Russian captain.
And it has the name of this smaller - it was just really not a camp  it was an apartment building or a series of apartment buildings in the French or Russian sector of Berlin.
Now  at what point did you decide to go over on the Russian side?
Was there any -- did you know people w ho tried to run to the Russian side?
And finally I walked all day I suppose  because I remember about one and half or two kilometers you know and came to this artillery position this Russian artillery position  and this guy  and this Russian saw me the yellow star  yellow armband.
He first he beat the hell out of him  and the Russians came around  there wa a lot of soldiers  they came around and they seen wh ats going on  they didnt intervene at all  til the guy got ready  and then he s he says to the Russian  he said  this is the guy  when we were in the ghetto in the and boxcars used to come in Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 20with potatoes or other kind of food for the ghetto  so this guy took away all the food  he gave it to the local people and to us  when it in the bottom on the train there was dirt  he said  this is for the Jew.
Some of the uh  Russian organized and controlled first army Polish troops moved in  recruit...recruited or drafted from eastern provinces of pre-war Poland  and trickling into town started coming back first Jewish refugees who were with escaped or got somehow saved by going to the Soviet Union.
Again  Im use to answering Yiddish  and my parents would speak Polish  some Russian because the town we came from was it was Poland and it was White Russia  and then it was Poland again.
We was working like slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other place to work in pieces of assembly of ai rplane.
So a Russian officer walked by  took him by the head  threw him in the..in the...in the yard.
And so  you know and the and then the once the this became and and they came in to Poland and and all that  I remember they were al-always saying [speaks Russian] What does that mean?
It comes about evening...late in the evening and we go to the Polish...uh  go to the Russian side.
Now  the war came to Vilnius  and Vilnius from the place where the army  the Russian army was around 75 miles.
And we knew of a woman  a farm woman that used to come during the Russian occupation to sell butter and chickens and eggs to my mother  and she invited us many times.
The other one was not just refugees  its a Jewish school  th-the Russian Jewish kids there  the British Jewish kids  these are the people from India  and -- Right. --
Then finally  I went to the Russian  we went to the country with the Russian and we took the stocking what the two brought us-- [socks] and went to Cracow.
Those who were able to speak English and French  in case the the the uh especially the Allies should reach us first  and those who are Polish and Russian  uh uh for in case the Russian army should  because we were certain that they would uh enter Saxonhausen in in the course of the military operations.
So when the Russian soldier carried me  she said to him  please  I  don't separate us  that's all we have each other.
And there were some that came from the concentration camps and from the Army  Russian Army.
Its sort of a long story  Raye  but I went to the head of the Russian archives  this unusual man  uh  Major Avenerius he was  and I told him what we were looking for  and as I said last night  he  he asked me  well  he said  ﬁDid you come up from the John Ford unit?ﬂ And I said  ﬁYes ﬂ and he said  ﬁWell  thats very interesting.ﬂ And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar.
He was a Polish Jew  but when the war broke out he went over to Russia and joined the Russian Army.
So this guy  the Russian peasant  he took off  and we were left there just like that.
And we were so lucky that the Russian invasion stopped before our border.
And all the other military governors were sitting there  and there was  at that time still that instrument which was supposed to be the coordinating instrument  using the Russian term kommandatura  spelled with 32 a K  and that had to be -- that was part of our of-official vocabulary  and -- and I was then directed to move from Frankfur t to Berlin  and I moved there in January of 1946.
There were Jews in other Russian partisan  but not like the Bielskis brother.
I found out later they want to get rid of me  the Russian.
So I learne d a lot of basic Russian  and I could communicate with Karowlka   with Anna and Ziegmund very  very easily in Russian.
16 Ya  there was a lot of... They took... The whole Ukraine they took it over  the Russian.
Of c ourse there was success  but Orlovsky at the end almost -- he got -- had a -- a Russian -- they threw a Russian dynami -- dynamite pieces.
I mean  for example  one day L itvinov  the -- the -- the Russian  first foreign minister  the Bolsheviks  came -- came to the house  a party or something  and I was allowed to go into the drawing room downstairs  which as a rule I was not  of course  yes?
Was so they they just hated it  the Russian  the Russian language  everything by Russia was for them poison.
I couldnt figure out  I says to friends there  I says  thats the Russian?
And again they told her [speaks Russian] cannot be a nurse  because theyre going in to cure patients.
When we had another one  Fenya  she was Russian  and then my father in the building had a nur se  Maria.
Take one card out and swap them all over [DL] You mean the Germans on the Russian front if they were waiting for ammunition... [AG] Yeah  yeah we used to swap them over.
There were about five Russian soldiers with guns no rifles  with rifles and bayonets.
Yeah  you know  here is another place that I was during this time  because it was close to this Russian border  and I figure out when I need to run away  if Germans come I can run to Russia .
While a man  a German uniform went out and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a  I believe a captain  if higher  spoke to us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were searched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that.
The main trial  of course  was held in four different languages: German  Fr ench  Russian and English.
And that guy  the Russian guy says  do you know who  exactly?
She was a woman born in Russian  went to medical school in Russia  married a French diplomat and she lived in Germany.
Russian) 30 To be called by name (Russian) 26 were wash-outs  little bubbles.
So I was the first one  I -- he sa -- I said  ﬁI am going to Rigenwald.ﬂ We came to Rigenwald  the doctor that they sent to teach us  it must have been from different camps around that  but from our camp we went only one Russian girl  and two Jewish girls.
Somebody was tell in Polish...at that time I spoke Polish well because being there you learn to speak Polish and Russian.
And I went into the line with them  hung back to the end of the line  and when we got to a bridge that was going across the railroad yard  it had a Russian anti aircraft gun and placement right there on the bridge  I ran.
Eventually we joined up with a group and that group joined up with another group and we somehow met up with the Russian Army and we were liberated.
In the afternoon came a high rank ing officer  a Russian officer  early afternoon.
So after I saw the first Russian  I came out  and I was so weak.
So we was there  and then the Russian start to come again on German territory  you know  from the Ossen.
By the way  with me at that time was also a Russian  one of the Russian  uh  soldiers .
The Russian soldiers  the men in the house  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 25 they don't bother the woman.
Then I went to the Russian school from 1939 til 1941.
So you had the wh -- white Polacks  the white Russian.
So one thing that they moved into my office  so I learned a little Russian  I listened to Russian music [indecipherable] little little radios tuned into a Russian I dont know how they heck they got the Russian station.
I know of about two or three people that also received this concentration camp I.D. that were not in hiding  that were out of concentration camps  because the Russian government  or the Russian military produced these I.D.s that we were in concentration camp very close to where I was at at that Anhalter Bahnhof.
When there was something wrong  she spoke to me in Yiddish  not in Russian  you know?
Russian soldiers  well we were in the basement of the building.
She became hysterical a nd she started to scr eam  so the Russian took a candle  put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water.
So right away I found a a friend of mine  who told me that if I would like to serve to serve in the in the Russian army because  due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium  and I speak the I speak Lithuanian  German  and an -and Russian  so I would be a good prospect.
Can you tell me about that  like what kind of preparations you made to run to the Russian side  what you took?

And there was -- it was really horrible  because for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 11 a day and night  there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and the Germans.
But but yeah  then when when the th-the ac Nazis began the Stalingrad campaign  thats when we left from that area  because we were pretty close to Stalingrad  you know  an-and we wound up well  demobilization was had started  Russian were mobilizing  moving everything up  away from as far as possible and setting up factories.

There the books were translate into -- the things were translated into Russian.
And then later after Germany attacked Russia  the conditions got better and there were many other Polish Jews were allowed to join in a Polish division in the Russian army.

And we start to hear the sounds of the artillery from Moldavia --from  say  city of Iai [ Ger: Jassy]  or closer --because the Russian army start to come closer and closer.
And I...I just didn't like to see Russian soldiers  to be honest.
So we already 1939  before before a couple of days before the Russian came  we didn't have a house  we didnt have nothing  everything was destroyed.
They knew that there are Russian partisans or underground in other areas.
And he -- when he rested  my aunt -- my uncle  one that studied medicine in -- it was already Russian were there  so he was a doctor already  he arranged for him to work in clinic in hospital  so he went to work.
There were some left  British  Russian prisoners  military men   all mil itary men.

The Russians were actually -- were more sympathetic  because the Russian underground -- the Russian partisans were more sympathetic toward Jews  they -- they accepted Jews on a -- on a basis where you didnt have to say who you were  as long as you were willing to fight  as long as you were willing to do something.
We find out there is Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 28a guy  a Russian guy  a driver  he had a truck there  his name was Sashka .

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 86 The soldier whom we met in the train  coming out of Germany  I mean af -- when the war ended  who happened to be a Jew -- a Jew in Russian uniform and who asked us on the train where it was we were planning to go to -- in Poland and we told him that were going home to Starachowice and he asked us wh at size town it was.
Earlier in the war you and your family lived under Russian occupation.
Russian girls who were in P.O.W. camp  black African  French guys who were working as -- they were not P.O.W.'s and they were not in concentration camp but they were something in between.
Rovno the city of Rovno remained under the Russian government after the war  because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed hands back to Poland.
So we realized we were now in the same town as we were during the Russian occupation.
Here  the Nazis were afraid of the underground activities  of the Russian front approaching and everything  so they came to th e conclusion that they ought to take and break up the Polish work details work units and bring some Jews in for them not to be as comfortable and not to be able to do the work that they were afraid of  as far as uprising.
Only the Russian border was not use being used as an army for Germany.
The Russians in one of the towns on the eastern front; his company was surrounded by the Russian army which was coming in fr om the other side.
Also  ve ry vividly  I remember  prisoners the Russian soldiers and the Polish soldiers they were shot.
When the war broke out  the first day in 1939...as soon as the war broke out  the second day we had trucks that my father took the family  us and my uncle and another twenty people...whoever wanted to go...and we run away from Kielce to the Russian border to get away and I remember that my grandmother...t his I saw with my own eyes...took out  at that time she had twenty thousand .
I was there for three month probably  in the Russian school and I jumped right away to the 10th.
Then they had huge photos of 17 Stalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange points  at Lichtenfelds to see that everything was run properly  that they got on these trains.
January of 1945 and the Russians are... The Russian artillery is bombarding the city.
The German people packed their wagons because they wanted to go west away from the Russian army.
I went to their school for one year  I learned Russian  and I got that coat that the other girls were trying on  everybody liked it.
Many people who were liberated at that time had to go to the Russian army and still in the last few months were killed on the Russian front  after surviving concentration camp for over four years.
Our circumstances were quite different  so 9 it was sort of a degrading of circumstances starting with the Russian occupation  and that proceeded into the German occupation  the conditions constantly getting worse.
The Russian army was getting close and the Germans were going to evacuate all of us out of Lithuania.
So  from the Polish school I had two more years  I went to the Russian school.
If you pick up a Russian map of New York C ity  the river is not Hudson River  but Kudson River.
We also had a young French soldier who fell in love with his girlfriend  a Russian girl  who had to be in the American zone in order to be able to immigrate to the United States.
Russian curtain we felt would set in  and it did in 1945.

So he said: but since the Russian government is..is a good-hearted govern ment  he exonerates us for only [one] reason--because we volunteer into the Russian Army.
So I took the train and I went to the last station before the borderline between Russian occupation zone of Poland and German occupation zone of Poland.
And Interview with Riane Gruss April 22  1994 40he had a very good job with the Russian s  and so he made money and he sent parcels to us.
We were hiding for a few days and suddenl y we hear guns  guns  guns  Russian guns getting closer and closer.
Each one of us got a Russian card and the provisions were -- the only time you could get your provisions was after a whole day's work.
So I went over to the Russian zone and I went to Lemberg [Lwow].
And I remember the Polish person  and often when we go to out in the evening in Vienna  we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were not going to defect.
This I only find out later  but anyway  the camp was full of all kinds of nationalities  there were at that time when we arrived there  maybe 5500  there 44 were Russian POW's  Soviet Red Army POW's  there were Polish civilians  Russian civilians  there were Frenchmen.
I go up the mountain  I get a hand grenade  come down the mountain and there is bunch of Russian commando groups who just looking for somebody just like me to walk ahead of them  okay?
My father spoke Hungarian and then of course in school we started uh learning Yugoslav uh language  Serbian or Yugoslav  so as a kid we spoke uh three languages and then uh we had a governess in the house to...French...we learned French from a Russian tutor.
I took two ŠŠ there was a lot of Jewish Russian soldiers.
There was Polish resistance in both parts of the main streets of it was called at the time in Rovno  I remember there was a militar y church where they were hiding  the Polish police was hiding and as the Russian soldiers with their equipment were coming in they were shooting at them from behind the buildings and some of them got killed an d then they killed all the police that were shooting at them.
And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp  from a prisoners of war camp.
What I because I was in the in the Russian zone  you know Right.
And we told the Russian leader  you know  where we were there  that the -- these guys before  they -- they killing the -- many people come from ghetto  they been killed there -- a lot of people have been killed.
He was a a how he was not a [indecipherable] he was he was basically a Russian.
There  I met two girls in Russian uniforms fr om my home town.
And they all  and they came from Russian zone into the American zone through Hoapf   Germany.
So I describe how the gate opened  how we shuffled out  how we saw the Russian soldiers  how we ran up to them saying  oh  like messiah was here.
When it was quiet down  two boys  Russian young soldiers  18 years old  kids  come over to me  I should help them to take out Germans  surrounding the white flag from the trenc h. I said I have no right to leave my cannon.
I don't mean Russia from like deep Russia but European Russian.
And Russian soldiers saw it and saved her and -- and put her out.
And he came back and he said  \ I don't know whether I'm ordered back to the Russian headquarters  but I don't know if I am going as a guest or as a prisoner.\
I -- I -- I ca -- I seem to be able to absorb it because subsequently when I was in the Air Force  and there was a sign down there  and that was specia lized training for to -- to study Russian for -- for eight months.
Did you think of yourself as a Ukrainia n Jew  or a Russian Jew  or just Jewish?
And at that time we saw already Russian doctors  Russian nurses.
Whatever...we was scared most of the Russian soldiers; more than of the Germans  because they were more with us.
So it must be something to do with with Russian  but I think it was absolutely that there be many Germans living in .
So there were no  were there Russian troops around or not in that part of the countr y?
All the refug ees were allowed to go back to Poland since Poland was under the Russian ru le anyway so they did not make a fuss.
So I put down a list of 103 books  and Russian literature was a very  very modern at the time   to read the Russian  the Russian literature translated into Polish.
And they say  we ll  we were raped by the Russian army.
And one girl was very smart and took couple bottles of drinks  I would have never thought of it  which was very helpful to us because right after the Germans liberated the town  two days later it became the Russian 36 zone  and the Russian soldiers were totally ungentlemen-like.
They were living separately  out of ghetto  in the vicinity where the Russian wives and children of Russian officers were there -- where they were there.
So they shipped all of us out  which was quite a number of people  to the East ern part of Poland--I know it was early fall or late summer--to dig ditches in th e form of a \ V\ ... they were qu ite big  to prevent the Russian tanks from coming across.
The superintendent of the building was a Russian  a old Russian with a big beard.
I said  two two and a quarter million Interview with Morris Rosen August 5  1999 83250 000 Russian soldiers  Jewish soldiers got killed fighting the Nazis  its a fact.
And we -- we -- we hear what you saying to the Russian soldiers and please stop telling them that you are Jewish.
Now  Im going to talk about Larr y  that he actually survived all this time  but when they were taking him b ack as the Russian or the --- After the war  you mean?
And this idea comes from a lady whose name is Dr. Vera Permish  who is Russian.
And we were close  the Russian border was about 50 miles from us.
I was reading French  Russian before then  communism  and [indecipherable] So who did you read in Russian?
So my parents realized that I understood everything  so if they wanted to say something that I dont wouldnt understand  they switched to German  because Russian I understood everything.
So you did you point the the Russian soldiers in the direction of where the Germans were?
And they only find out at the end of the war  because coincidentally  Ilia Aaronburg  the Russian author  had been to a tour of concentration camps  and w ho had been a -- obviously -- apparently to Treblinka  and who told the survivors  67 out of 3500 Bitola Jews  that all were 64 exterminated in Treblinka with no survivors.
Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 53 were surrounded by the Russian.
I mean  it was Some the German had by over three million Russian soldiers.
I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day  I got acquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in civilian clothes.
Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops  and the German army  I guess they were forced into th e service.
But really  it was Radziwi ow  you know  and th when the Russians were there because it was constantly Russian  Polish  German  Russian.
You know  in the early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi.
That was the only time I was in jail  in a Russian jail for 24 hours  interrogated.
And the the Russi an soldiers came in  and told us [speaks Russian] again  you know  get out  get out.
And we hear the Russians coming  and we understand them because the Russian and Polish are -- are Slavic languages  the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand.
My father  teaching himself the Russian language  started talking to them with tears in his eyes.
How were relations between Polis h Catholics and the Russian Orthodox?
I'm a Polish citize n.\  He say  \ You eat Russian bread  you have to take.\

Fisiek ran away when the Germans were advancing  he ran away towards the Russian border.
And finally  a few hour s later  a little Russia--not Russian.
And there was a meeting in the flat of a officer  Russian officer  where I was -- there was something  somebody higher than the -- I - because nobody spoke when this man spoke.
So I decided because I could speak Russian  in the Cold War that would be very helpful.
As a matter of a thats when Itka and myself and the Russian partisans  we went toge ther  but we couldnt find the [indecipherable] it Interview with Esia Shor February 22  2010 42was a regular army.
Now  I was on the Russian site  but I still had no money.

Lithuanian  or Russian  people before Communi sts and they were parachuted into the forest in order to establish this detachment.
So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitchen  and there were three Frenchmen.
19 some young Japanese officers that  at the border or somewhere  come across the Russian edition--was the original edition--of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion  which claims Jews practically run the world and own the governments and own the banks  and all that stuff.
But the Russian was not very easy to live under either.
I wanted people to know about it  and one of those poems I put to music and the other poem   we were singing to a Russian melody.
And other thing interesting is  again  now is history  uh during the war was a lot of prisoners from Germany  from Romania  from other country who fight against the Russian  so Russian organize this prisoner  some special army  most of them.
And the Russian Cossacks made some anti-Semitic riots and other things  a nd they just decided to come to Uszhorod  which was Russian -- the Russians couldnt pass the Carpathian -- pass the mountains  so they came to start a living -- 2 Where did he come from?
I had previously tried -- well  let me explain that many Germans in large cities  knowing that the cities were to be or were being bombed  took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in rural areas  which happened to be the Russian zone.
Take them  let them do with them whats -- whats ﬂ -- so  the w-were 10 people guarding this hundred German soldiers  there were also White Russian policemen.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: He served four years  two years on the Russian front and two years in the Italian front.
And then the Russians  the Russian kids used to attack us  even in Hongkew later on.
That time my mother she did not have any papers that s he was a teacher so she went to the university in Irkutsk and she graduated as a teacher of Russian language.
In the beginning  we had a Russian colonel -- a Russian general -- living with us.
And in the Russian school we learned Russian history and there was no anti-Se -- anti-Semitism at all.
And just then an officer comes to the door and he says in Russian  \ What the hell is going on?\
You see  we were worry about Schindler in a  during the last month of war that when the Russian will come in  we will be liberate by Russian  they di dn't ask question.

And they would rather be under Hitler  a -- a --a German Nazi  then under a Russian Bolshevists.
Her ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 name is Dina but in Russian it was Dorka.
So the the Russian came to me  he said Im sorry  I didnt know you know how t how to how to the they say Jewish people dont know how to fight.
When you were thinking of going to the Russian side  you're feeling was that you would have better possibilities with the Russians than with the Germans or the Poles?
Also when people were drafted into the army  they went to the Imperi al Russian army.
Well  thats what th -- worry we -- we reached the point -- Well -- -- as the -- -- as the Russians -- -- the Russian was approaching  we fear -- the fear thermometer  Id say.
But  when the aliyah start coming in from Russia  we had a big convention  Bnai Br ith convention  and I was there  and it was in the aisles microphones  and I came up  and I said  ﬁRabbi  you want us to make Jews out of the Russian people.
She was happy that I was there because she was scared of the Russian soldiers.
I think it was...the offensive  the Russian offensive was already a long time on.
So they grabbed them out and shoot them and shot them and...and then they went to liberate the Russian camp.
No  but I met another German  another German  who was smuggling people from east Germany  from the Russian sector  to the west Germany.
Came to another town  we looked around what was bat we were very much aware  and Im really surprised you probably heard from other people because you the first one ever asking me really  that Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 12question  how because we were were a lot afraid of being raped by the Russian soldiers.
First of all  we spoke Russian  so that was no problem as far as the language.
We dont know Russian security personnel  maybe there were  maybe there were not  but nobody established that any Jew ba that Lithuani an was is in command  you know  at the sugar factory that wo So  another betrayal of a of the wors t kind  is a it is a Lithuanian who is a communist Right.
So we went to the mountains  40 miles; from one border to the other one  even after the liberation  to get together  because we were on the Russian border.
And that wasn't easy either  because I was in France  and Slovakia was in a Russian zone.
We were very tired  Luta was sick  and we were going together with the Russian soldiers  with Russian officers.
Well anyway  what happened then was that  lets see  about 1944  about February  the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian war pr prisoners of war  and they were starting to dig up thats what we heard from other people  I didnt see it that they were digging up the bodies  putting them in piles and setting them on fire.

We landed in Semipalatinsk   where also Zbishu who was released from prison  because the amnesty was proclaimed for all  found himself there  and found a room with Russia Russian couple  and it was the so when we first arrived  Ill never forget  we went to see wh-where we were going to stand and again  quite a few Pole s living together  but it was in the city  Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 95and so on.
And about two oclock in the morning  Russian soldiers came over.
My mother  you know  could speak 16 Russian and Polish or Yiddish  and well  there was the as far as I know there were no Jews in in in that area  you know  I mean the you know  so Yiddish never came up until somebody found out that I was Jewish  you know  and then they started teasing me and stuff  you know.
In the Bible  I have the Bible in English  in Russian.
We knew only this side  the east  the Russian  the Russian army.
In the morning somebody opened the barn door and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot and he came in.
One June the 22 nd  early in the morning about 4 oclock in the morning  being that I was on the border and working on the railroad at that particular town  in the morning I saw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplane s. That was the start of the war.
What should I give her?ﬂ Not that we had that mu ch food  but the food was Russian and so we have bread and we have a jam and saccharin  and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that.
They giving away and they give to the Russian commander  to Platon  or whatever.
The people who we re attached to the Justice  to the Russian delegation.
And we didnt want to go with the main road because there still the Russian Army was moving.
Do you feel American or do you feel Russian or do you feel Jewish?
It seems that they were also advancing towards us  the Allies or th e Russian army  whoever it was  was advancing in our direction.
there were French  there were Russian women there  there were children  many  many child ren.
This--where we were liberated was to become the Russian zone and the Americans were of course uh  uh expecting to retreat from that area on the other side of the Oder river.
Pretty high up  you know  the plane was there  the Russian officers were shooting from their pistols  and that it was much too high to reach in the plane.
He told us that  you know  when ŠŠ how he did  the Russians were comi ng close to this  that only says  Do me a favor  when the Russian comes  don't run out  in cas e the Russians come into that village.
But in the Dead March  when the Russian was behind  we have to run together with the Germans.
We were in the Russian sector first and they tried to also establish that we were Jewish.
They didn't lie that they were on the -- right next to Moscow  that they took millions and millions of Russian prisoners.
Yes  yes  they announced it  they ann ounced it  thats all the prisoners in the camps are liberated because the war started to Germany  which they thought  and they hoped that a lot of the people who were in the barracks and the prison will join the Russian army to fight the Germans.
And he wrote hes ashamed being a Russian  that th ey did not allow to put up m-monuments in these places  so they did allow  finally they did allow.
So we went to a Russian fellow  and officer  we told him we want the wagon to go away from the camp.
So they were talking to the Russian government  and the Russian Russian allowed more freedom  and better better conditions and better pay  and everything else.
So that was the greatest fear among the SS is that they were going to be sent to the Russian front.
There were many Polish partisans and Russian Partisans  and they were groups like we were.
And she  like my father  she spoke fluent German  obviously fluent Russian  and fluent Polish  so Multilingual.
This was -- you know  when the pact -- unknown pact  Hitler and -- and Stalin made the pact and when the Germans in 1939 pushed the -- no -- attacked  most of the army retreated east  towards the Russian border.
And he was in died next to me  I saw he wa and usually  when someone died  even it was a German or a Russian or a or a Slovak or so  usually  especially it was close to a village or so  and they knew already they went  because the people used to go to the forest there and so they saw some dead Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 80people  so they buried them.
So when you were I I I I learn so good that some people  they didnt know that I am Polish  or or Russian.
He told us he was in the British Brigade  and while we were in Lvov  he sent us a letter which came to us from Marseilles: to be ready to go to Odessa because his job is to repatriate Russian prisoners of war  to repatriate the–prisoners of war  so if we can make Od essa he'll smuggle us on a ship for us to go with him back  get out of the Soviet Union.
When I came in I heard on the radio [Uvaga  uvaga  uvaga and that meant  a ttention  attention  attention in Russian.
This Russian military hospital was dissolved in 45  Septembe r. In 45 September  I was certified (??)
Her mother was a Russian and she blames  sh e was married  she was divorced.
So she was fluent in Russian and German and I noticed also she spoke French at one point.
The right wing from the Polish army they use to be - they were killing Russian officers - and the Polish officers you know.
And that is the way  according to what I was told when we were together  how he had survived at Theresienstadt and was saved by the Russian ar my and later a group of of  interesting enough  an American colonel  of the family I think  made a special way when they heard about Leo Beck to Theresienstadt to to take him out and by special plane he was flown  flown to London  so uh uh but 61 and there was also something else which I...and it's the last I want to say about him.
The Russian were b urning everything up for the Germans to freeze to death ; they couldn't fight.
That was -- since I came from  I dont know where  wherever they had me come from in Poland  my Ukrainian was not perfect  my Russian was not absolutely perfect  but that was the excuse.
Now up to this day when I hear boots marching  even on the beautiful parade  I get nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections so there we heard these footsteps and we said  ﬁOh  the henchmen are back.ﬂ But we heard Russian language.
Actually Pepi  she saw all kinds of people from  from the Jewish community a nd they were also American Jews  English Jews  French and Russian -- in all the armies.
Yes  because they were French  and the Germans were coming and occupying the Russian held territories in 1915.
And but you know  then the Polish zoty had been exchanged  ta ken out  and the Russian ruble came in and and all that  and I really dont know how how that happen ed  but it was just several months that we lived  because we when the Russi ans came in it was September 17 th  and when we were deported  it was April 13th.
I said  thats good ta for him to stay here because the Russian are close.
He actually got mad at a Russian that was in the Pogrom.
Where are they?ﬂ And he said  ﬁIm afraid they were arrested.ﬂ I said  ﬁBut why?ﬂ And he said  ﬁB ecause they saw too much of you French.ﬂ And I don -- then later  you know  also through him  found out that the doctor was sent to the Russian -- to the Russian front  and he was killed very soon.
He teach young people  the pres ignico how its called  Russian.
And at that time  I dont know I if it was Russians or what  but we we were sitting on these benches type of thing against the wall and wa I I all I remember is my father stood up to  I think it was a Russian  they wanted the watches and the jewelry  and theyre women.
So every day came a Russian guy and took over how many trees we did cut today  and tomorrow I had to cut more trees.
The excuse was that they are not trustworthy people  and they are taking to Siberia to help build the -- the Russian effort.
So the English guy said  ﬁOh  youre going to bring some of ours.ﬂ He says  ﬁYes.ﬂ He says  ﬁRemember  dont speak German -- er  Russian  when you go through the Russian post.ﬂ So since -- after all  we had experience for five years how to fib and do certain things.
I mean  the Poles had to fight in th-those armies  that were either Russian  German or Austrian.
I knew some  I pi cked up some Russian that I knew also from before something and I felt quite comfortable not  not enthusiastic but not really very bad  not threatened yet.
And one night I would do the stamps  next day he would do the stamps because the apartment that we moved into  the collaborator that lived there was a philatelist  he had collected stamps from all over the world and they were confis cated by that Russian judge and given to me and his son  and the two of us kept the collection going.
He was Russian but he became from not th e revolution before the revolution he was k  you know.
He didn't believe that and then...but he put him down and he said keep your coat  but we are here now and you will help us speaking Hungarian and Russian  so he was like  you know  helping out  translating.
So I was told that -- that -- then the joke was that I answered the [speaks Russian here]  I dont want a big mach-mach ine  yeah.
First of all  my parents come from Russia and with the Russian army  they could communicate and then they started to organize different businesses  everything under the government control.
So the commandant of the city -- there was a Russian commandant.
He put vodka in front of these Russian soldiers  on the table  and they started saying  take an ything of value; like jewelry  like silver  or things that you can sell in in in Russia for for Food.
That was a little more difficult be cause you had to go through the Russian zone   you see.
>> Marcel Hodak: My father spoke several languages   Russian  Turkish.
And because he was the only one not in Russian  not in the Soviet Union  so he inherited his business  and it was the stu -- h-he was the owner of [speaks Lithuanian here].
>> Michel Margosis: Well  because of my father's training -- he had this teacher back in Russian  a famous poet.
So I spoke a very good Russian  and we went into this house and I asked the Russian soldiers if we could sleep over.
A Russian Jew and a German Jew  we're so far apart because the German Jews were...were very prejudice  solid  integrated people.
There were also some Russian PWs  worked in that Powder Tower.
You could see them  yes which we assumed were not Russian planes.
We used to carry  my mom -- in the Russia  if you see Russian old movies  you have like a -- a wooden [indecipherable] like its half round and it has two hooks  one hook for one pail  and the other  and you carry it on your shoulder like this  with the -- I used to carry that.
She ran away: So the youngest sister -- she with a friend went with the Russian Army back to the Soviet Union to look for my sister.
We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the ghetto too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening.
If you remember  about four or five years ago  where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo  they showed the Russian Siberian man  who was a weightlifter and a wrestler  how he ran a mile in the snow that deep?
That was Spanish...very fine  very fine people  very...very...they were not the average Russian partisan  the average soldier.
So then actually  was it all over that only the Russian army and the Russian people liberated Prague and Czechoslovakia .
And he was scared silly because it was in the Russian sector which in those days the city was still divided.
My mother  I remember  was kissing their hands and the Russian soldiers were patting her saying  ﬁDevie   devie  ﬂ which means no  no  don t have to do that.
And a-again  a Russian soldier was in the neighborhood  whereas -- as soon as he saw me  he pointed his gun at me and -- and pointed me toward a tree.
We stayed in Berlin for about six months and we were in Berlin we tried to get to the American side because we were told it was best from the Russian side with the Russians  eventually  like with cars  trucks  trains until we got from Poland to Berlin we did a lot of traveling.
But it was definitely during the Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time.
So  we asked the Russian echelons of soldiers  trains of soldiers  to help us to go back to Kaunas.
But there were some Jews and the times when the Jews didnt hear  you could hear– I understand Russian and Ukrainian  too.
So there were Russian forced laborers  who were followers of Vlasov in this camp.
>> Bill Benson: This is what the Russian soldier was telling somebody in Poland at the border?
Because I had I had the Russian occupation I mea n  the German occupational marks  which belong to the on the Russian border on the the the Russian zone  not the the the British and the American zone had different different marks  you know.
He must have been...officers...a lot of officers were Russian  you know  the Big Red.
He took us back and we heard still in Jawiszowice fighting because we heared the...uh...how they fight Germans with the...with the...with the Russian s. And I...he went back over there to the Russian Army.
The food was not  you know...food...the Russian army never works on  you know  they used to get their own food.
Well  in camp  the rumors were going around  and you know I was there  the war goes on  and all of a sudden we heard that the Russians are mo -- the Russian front is moving down  and how we knew that its really getting close  one Sunday  when the coal mines werent -- the coal mines were working  bu t in our free time  they take us out to dig ditches  for the army to  you know  to dig in.
So  whether you were Jewish  Polish or whatever  ye if you wanted to get by you had to speak Russian.
And still in this -- in this military clothings -- The -- the Russian -- is those pajamas.
So I was talk with my sisters  my brother  I says to the I says  you know  this is too close to the Russian.
And here in Minsk  I -- we knew somebody  and the story was  when we were in Rakichenka  I learned fast to -- the language  to read and write Russian.
So  b-before he answered me about the information  he said  through this interpreter  why are the Americans killing Russian soldiers?
I was speaking  I was  used to the Library of Congress to one man who is who knows Russian  not sp great.
I have one other person that I probab -- I caused the death of another person  probably of a Russian prisoner.
So then it was a little bit of White Russian  and a little bit Lithuanian.
There was -- were one or two of Russians  Georgian Russians or Russian Georgians  who  who had been incorporated into the German army after the Germans entered Russia  took them captive.
And also I learned  the one of the people who 1 The Taduesz Kosciusko Division  a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command  appeared in July 1943.
You know  when the Russian came in  they call in the head from the family  to the office  and they ask questions my father.
Some Russian and some White Russian people were forced to re patriate to their respective countries.
Well  from that point to your return... The Russian...under the Russian... Under the Russians... Under the Russia ...all the women put on their scarf and they were hiding their youth with .
I tried not to speak Russian at all  to understand English.
His name was Louie  and he was recruited into the Russian army  a-and the Russians  you know  wanted to convert  and my my Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8  2013 56 my uncle was not very religious  but he wouldnt convert.
Naturally  I deserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian  or the KGB would find me  they would probably hang me.
This was Russian prisoners  was -- were captured from the Germans.
A in Russian  and they went out for a few hours to get the medication.
I cant speak to hi -- his parents are from Russia and his mother really spoke some Russian  you know  and Kira spoke Russian  too.
While he was sitting on the train  there was a man  a Russian man sitting next to him.
They and they would ope n everything  and you know  ward its called wardrobe  I think Yeah  a wardrobe Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 48 inste because not not a closet  and Mother had dresses there  and then  you know  we were not exactly rich  but I since Mother didnt know this is the story  Mother didnt know Russian  when they said to the wi portnikha   my mother thought that portnikha means you belong to some party  and my mother was trying to Mother said no  no  I don t belong to any party.
Its Pavworda   which is the voivodship [names Russian locations] Oh  youve got to repeat that  I didnt catch all of that.
And I felt I was really taki ng to Russian  everybody was pleased.
The army  the Russian may not be good enough  but they'd send me to school to learn how to read and write.
I can't go into in this interview all of the particulars  but there were incidents -- there were incidents where I saw Russian escapes.
And one times we stay in the barracks and they open th e door and we saw the first Russian soldier.
And the bodies of these Russian prisoners were stuck six feet high because there was no - they didnt have the capacity to burn the bodies.
Because the Russians...the Russians uh uh set up this station where they had a Russian 10 Rabbi Shimon Kalish.
They were Polish -- not Polish  but German partisan German -- Russian partisans.
So  were your parents more assimilated  in in that they spoke Polish and Russian  or Absolutely not.
Uh  and I... I mean  I graduated from Washington University a Phi Beta Kappa  got a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to Harvard  got a Masters in Russian studies from Harvard--but still as a nonperson.
And I get there and she kind of laughs and I look to go to the Russian kitchen and it says  all food has been given out  its all done.
I ventured to pull out my German rather than Russian  and I think I made the right decision  you know.
So we started to hide from expor tation in -- to Siberia  and we had to leave Pinsk  and we went to some small village  I dont remember the name  and later on through Lvov  and later on through Turka  where my father had cousin and her husband was a dentist and he knew Russian -- he was treating Russians and he arranged for a passport -- finally he -- they decided to take Russian passport to -- you know  to -- not to be sent to Siberia.
The russians did not allow Hebrew or Yiddish or any sort of education that was other than Lithuanian or Russian so I was put into a Lithuanian school and I didn't know what was going on at all because I didn't speak Lithuanian.
Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 51 He was at Harvard getting his  his doctorate in medieval Russian history and he was three quarters of the way through when we had the opportunity to join the Foreign Service and go to India  so we did for three years.
He was not just making statements  he was really agitating and in a very emotional wa y and I was  I just  I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore  not after what happened  just  you know  in the last few years and my boy scout commander  and at that tim e I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement  my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with th e Russian troops already and was one of the organizers.
And he was going to their -- to the -- to their building and one day he comes in and -- and one day he comes in there  and a Russian prisoner says  doc  I gotta tell you a secret  but dont you dare tell -- tell that I told you.
It was not dangerous because most of the Polish army that was walking on that same road with us  were giving themselves up to the Russian people.
And then came a Russian -- Russian soldiers  you know  on -- on -- on trucks  they stopped  and they asked us  they said wh at -- who are you?
That they're going to take me to Russia on a plane and keep my father in the Russian partisans  in the Russian army.
Nu  we was ready everything and come the...uh.. to the Russian  no?
talkover] he showed this proudly to this Russian truck driver who showed us the way  we always  we got lost a nd the Russian said  ﬁLook ﬂ the whole arm full of watch.
They came in the woods  they met  there was a small group of Russian partisans  but he was intelligent so he became the commander.
So I went to the Russian border - to the Czechoslovakian border.
And the Russian Army entered already in Romania  was entering already in Focsani.
78 05:13:16 And then  when the Russian came  they spoke  I could understand what they talk to us  they used to say  well we liberated you  we did liberate you  they said in Russian  and you don't want to love us  so we knew it's going to come for us  so it came at night; 05:13:41 we used to barricade all the doors and windows; all the furniture  there were benches over there  and chairs  you know  the furniture heavy  like oak  heavy oak furniture was the  so we put it against  and we didn't go to sleep first  until the barricade was up the ceiling  that they couldn't open the door.
There was a Russian woman who worked with the occupation forces in Germany and there was a major  air force major who taught Polish pilots.
The German make a big victorious sign  you know  they start feeling when they start -- you know when the east -- the west [indecipherable] was get and when they start in -- in the Russian -- Russia  you know  they have a -- they have  you know  victory.
That the idea is good and just now again I will tell you about this Russian work I read yesterday before I go to bed.
And the first of May  of course  is a big Russian holiday  a Soviet holiday and -- and it was for the soldiers.
There were some Russian groups  partisans or es capees from the POWs  but   but that was not the main thing.
And she was speaking good Polish or good Russian so we decided to send her out  to the closest chimney  so out to the edge of the forest and you could see the smoke coming through the chimney  so that means  they were over there.
There's some Russian soldiers  the Chinese I guess from  they called them in those years  I remember  Ta-tongs   I don't know how you call them now.
But I learn Russian by myself  before I went to Belarus   because I know eastern Europe  theyre all speaking Russian  so what I need to learn Polish?
While I was with them  well  as soon as Brussels was liberated  eve rybody had flags on their houses  allied flags  British  French  Belgian  American  Russian -- only one on the block. [
I did like the Russian language  because we also took Russian.
The military mined themselves so when the Russian soldiers came to remove the bodies  they would blow up.
So I left  and I came to another one and th ey [indecipherable] they remind me very often where I come from  and what I keep in mind  because they knew that my papers every time  when I -- and the last time -- not -- it was not last time  before this -- before this time  I fill out the papers again  and -- and th e director of this  he was a Jewish guy  and -- but he got a Russian name  he -- by documents he was Russian.
I imagine those children must have talked Russian  I must have picked it up there.
I started to go to Russian school so that my sister my sister already at the time was in gymnasium and much higher grades th an I was.
I was smuggling out -- they were in Russian ambulances  they were -- tho -- theyre going to Czechoslovakia.
So here was they were reading in America in their Russian papers about the strikes in America.
And in order to get food you said you had this folder  this camp folder  the red the red side of Oh  oh  oh  that  yes  most people that were that have survived from a concentration camp  that were in a concentration camp  first in Berlin were given a little identification by the Russian soldiers  it was in German and Russian  indicating that we were discriminated against and have survived a concentration camp.
In the camp next to us  one of the camps next to us  were Russian prisoners of war.
We reached the front line and first -- we saw the first Russian  and this was the -- suppose our liberation -- supposed liberation.
We had very bad experience because the Russian soldiers were not nice to us.
We were going to Israel in 1957  sh -- since you ask me for evidence that I am from Po land  its written everything in Polish  Russian and thats it.
One time he was really [indecipherable] Germans  but by Russian -- by Russian people  sniper went through right here  and he died with the scar.
They took from the Russian church  from the parochial house  they took the house and they opened a pharmacy.
Just the fact that we had a French school and German school  Polish  Russian  Hebrew and Yiddish schools  just to give an idea of the culture of the city.
But since I spoke Yiddish I could understand a little bit  but  of course  I wasn't going to speak to him in Yiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we  we lost my we lost our mother  and we're looking for my mother and whatever.
And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the camp and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up.
Were there accusations of people  such as yourself or your colle agues who were in volved in the  arranging the transports at  people who were in it for themselves   trying to make money  did that accusation  did... Not an accusation  accusation that anybody has stolen money or abus ed money  but I had of course enemies  particularly around Jabotinsky's  there were a few people who were just   German Jew and ther e were Russian Jews and who were big people in the organizatio n  so now the whole organizat ion didn't   only it.
There was a German firm; they were putting up structures for high tension wires from the German border to the Russian border all along.
We spoke  first of all when they met  it was– my mother didnt speak Russian  he didnt speak Hungarian.
Hard seats and outside was both sides soldier with a gun  and we were transported through Russian Europe.
It was near the Russian border which before the war was there.
And it was obvious then  that what Goebbels wanted to avoid is that the food stores and the shops might be maybe taken by Russian troops.
But the two dots were two Russian soldiers  and came more and more.
They had a Russian leader  and they fi gured that was better.
We had it in the ghetto  in the basement in a dry place and we used toŠwe were in touch with a Russian lieutenant and he was working in a village near the forest  so he had cabin that he made in the woods  so we used to bring it in over there.
Whether it would have been Polish  or Yiddish  or Russian  or or German  or or something else.
And this place is with a lot the Ukraine people that was in the forest  and they kill Russian people.
My father leans around this soldier and in perfect Russian says to him  \ This expletive deleted  expletive deleted is trying to teach me a language that was my mother tongue before he was just an idea in his father's mind.\
So he came to -- and they invite him to introduce some people [indecipherable] to the American life  to the st yle  and he said  ﬁIf you will tell American that ﬂ -- Russian has this word like [indecipherable] or president  they call it prepeeska.
She was so...uh...afraid and when he died  we got out from there the first time the Russian came and there was a few Russian men came I remember.
Be cause in that time was  Germany was divided to the Russian sector and the rest was called Threezonia  three zones.
It was a really a huge army barracks that were built for the Polish Army way before the war  and there they collected all the surplus of broken up  damage d arms from the war  Russian arms that they 14 warehouse of confiscated goods and valuables (German) 16 collected.
Of course there wasn't much I could do there with uh my Master's in Russian studies  so I figured if you can't fight them you join them and I decided to go back to school and I got a Ph.D. in  with a focus on child development/family relationship and I have - we've been there for the last 21 years uh and I teach at the University part-time and and I do some counseling part-time and it's amazing because my whole focus on family relationships/child development has made me so aware of the horrendous impact of the war years and all the things that ideally should have happened after the war that didn't happen  how much pain could have been prevented if people had been more aware of the horrendous impact of - even the  let me compare...our experiences are nothing compared to concentration camp experiences.
So again  like in America  where the kids are in there in English4 and the f -- and their parents speak either Italian or Russian or whatever.
In that children's block there were not only Jewish children uh but also uh uh Polish and from uh Russian uh war uh prisoners of war  some of them uh even younger than me.
She was happy to see me  it was a Russian woman  very happy to see me.
But one of the things that they did was the Russians -- the Russian Army basically laid down their weapons and became prisoners of war.
They now have documentaries  they have films  they have books  they came out with everything  and then they invited Gee and Nina  and they took Peranga with them  because after all  Per was the nearest one working with Raoul  and also they have a secretary who called Sonya Sonenfeld  who is Russian born  and they took her so that nobody can cheat when they talking Russian.
Poland was divided actually into three segments  and this was Prussian  Russian  and Austro-Hungary.
And uh  the Lithuanian guards  the Lithuanian part--the Lithuanian partisans  Lithuanian soldiers  machine gunned them and then covered them up with tractors with earth  and earth had moved for three days  with the tractors and run over them to squeeze out the last breath  and when uh the front came closer   and start undigging them  and the same prisoner  pl-uh Russian and Jewish prisoners were still there  they found laying there  mothers with children wrapped around together  and they died together in the common grave.
Uh now uh about uh...let's see...a few months later  see as the Russian armies were getting now closer already to that area  I had a friend of mine  an older...about seven or eight years older than I was...told me that uh one of these days now  Cornel  he says we are going to escape.
So what really happened  in that area  a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German front.
And with another interesting st ory  I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in Washington .
I read a little bit Russian but - we knew it was very bad.
So I found myself in the eastern part of Poland under Russian occupation and my dream then was only one dream...to go back to Warsaw  go back to my family to be with them.
So I had an argument with a Russian sergeant  but anyway he walked away.
And I was stuck in Prujena   which was Russian  under Russian control.
But it was the Russian army that was chasing the German Army.
Father was counting that maybe one day the army  Russian army will come cl oser  and the Germans will run away.
So when the Russians took over  they made a more wide  you know  on the Mm-hm  a wider [indecipherable] the Russian a Russian standard.
And in Leipzig there was a whole bunc h of young women  mostly Russian  from a labor camp.
And all those two years they were telling us [Russian] That is not Poland. [
If the Russian Jews were still there  I do not know.
They didn't care SS  inmates going home  you know...they so...people in that...in the station...middle of washing a nd a Russian soldier came over.
He he was in the World War I  and he w he took they took him to he was in the Austrian army  and they took him to bene in the war they took him the Russian took him to Siberia .
But she was afraid and she wasnt  I would say  it was a problem for he r. So eventually what happened  the nun USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 5gave her clothes  and put on a big cross on her  and she took off to a town in central Poland  and there she spend most of -- most of the time til  in 1944 when the Russian moved up to near -- n ear where she was staying  liberated her  and she came back to Pruzana with a nun.
He was worki ng he with them  he he he was helping during the 1905  1905 there was a revolution in Russia  and in Lithuania it took a national character; Lithuanians against the Russian suppression.
He was writing -- he was writing because he -- he didnt belong to -- actually to -- to Germans  and he didnt belong to Russian.
My question is did your family say yes to Russian Citizenship or no?
They send all those poor young men to died  especially on the Russian front  as well as the African front  as well as Yugoslavia  and Albania.
They were a satellite country during the 50 years of Russian regime.
And the Russian military people came in  and they saw him  and they saw him being wounded  and they said  well  well well send you a doctor.
They put me into this thing  into the Russian camp because  not because  I dont know.
But -- but what I did like  incidentally  was kind of interesting is that the -- that the Russians liked opera very much  you know  and they had tran slations of classical operas in Russian.
The Russian front  the expression to send you to the Russian front was like a sentence of death to a German soldier.
23 different scenario and in fact they want to repeat the same thing that happened in Poland  and so the communists rather than wait for a coordinated army and underground and communists and Russian attack across the mount ains  jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in August in large quantity into Slovakia and these saboteurs without any coordination with anybody  stopped the night train that goes from Be rlin to Bucharest.
We found a place on Wulecka street with a Polish family given to us by the Russian government.
He work ed for the Russian government in  in buying agricultural implements for the Russians.
Maybe was and we went to the Russian commandant too  and they give us all kind of things too and it was very  very nice.
So when we found this jewelry and the money  we paid the Russian guards at the border to get us out and get us through into Romania from where we could go to Vienna and from there on wherever we can possibly go.
Because when they stole something  I dont think the Russian would carry  because although  who knows?
He walked over  he spoke perfect Russian  he went over to this Ukrainian  he says to him  \ Sir  can you let me talk to my son for a few minutes.\
And -- but at that time  which I was really  I wanted to do  I even took the tests  lets see in Russian  Hungarian and Czech and they -- I passed them and they wanted to send me to -- more for Russian  and I -- it sounded very tempting but they asked me -- they had -- I had to sign up for an extra year of service  which with hindsight I made a big mistake not taking it because the 16 extra year I would have been in school anyway  a whole year.
And then came two Russian airplanes  and they started strafing the lo comotive.
And so my father visited both but he particularly visited the Polish and Russian temples because  to please relatives and possibly even my mother  because her family had  well she  her family died at a very young age actually so.
This house -- this home burned down -- this home burned down after th e -- we first had Polish people there  Gentile people and then we had also again Russian people.
Wilhelm Gerke was a short SS man who knew exactly that once the ghetto are being liqui- dated that the Germans in charge of the ghettoes were being sent to the front to fight the Russian army  and having good connections in Berlin he got a new assign- ment and changed the name from ghetto to concentration camp.
Instead  when I spoke to the Russians  the Russian were telling us  well take you to America  and well give you good life and everything.
That was a little town that we spent the rest of the Russian occupation.
Did you feel a particular warmth for the Russian people having sacrificed so much during World War II?

So now its December 43  and you said that Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 75 43  and then we we went and with the Russian army in Krasny Baraki .
So this only proves that I really didnt speak any more Russian  but of course th e languages came back very fast.
So this were mine...this were when I...I got freed until Russian came there.
We were on our way to go deeper  we were supposed to go deeper to -- in towar -- in p -- in Poland  because the -- the Russian army liked us to be in the back of the German army  because we did a -- a good in -- a good job  apparently.
So I got to Regensburg  Germany  and there the Army  uh  applied for the Russian zone  to let me come  to let me go across to Slovakia on the train.
You know  when they first come  they get the minor jobs  then they go -- and -- and we met a guy from Russia which is Jewish  hes a Russian.
Because at the same time  like for there were  you know  all those millions of Russian war prisoners  and forced laborers  and immediately the Soviets had  you know  made a deal with the Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 225 Americans and British  that they should all go back.
You know they came from Afghanistan  Kavkaz   they were Russian  very wild  drunken soldiers.
As I came close to the rails  I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun from the tank pointing at them and all the Russian s with their hands up were standing in front of their building from that colum n. And I couldnt figure it out that the Germans were there already because I didnt see Germans until that poin t  that was the first tank I ever saw German except in the air  the bombardment.
And at one time you know the  the Russian  it was then the you  no it wasnt Christmas Eve.
In Polish language and then we had to go to a different school  that we got Russian teacher in.
A nd after a few weeks they ordered all students return to their classes  but because of the extra-curriculum given by Russians in Russian language in Communist history  in party Communist history  we were taken one year back -- because they told us we complete our e ducation as Communists after two years of indoctrination.
Before he was in the...uh...first war  he was in the military in... uh... Russian...Russian military  and he knows very well Russian language.
We just followed the Russian army wherever they went  and we...until we got to Berlin.
A. Then -- well  the Russian were coming in too fast  so they did not want to -- the SS did not want to be liberated by the Russian so they start to walk us.
They were there to see that things were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian directives.
Well  outside is where the we were  at first  living on the in the small they put us with the older Russian family  wh ere she had she had one room  and we had another room.
If they find a Russian soldier killed  they burned the whole sa village and killed everybody.
Some people who had spoken Russian  and were enough  so somehow either met some Russian who said you could come here  maybe be a teacher or something  but it this was too small a village for a very differentiated society.
Now the bars stayed  but once the Russian s came in  you know  th ey put like some boxes over the windows  so th-they couldn t see.
Be -- I had a potential knowledge of Russian  because when you put the radio on -- we had a good radio -- of course television was not in existence  that we could listen to all of Europe  and Russia was right next door.
It was a project whereby the Germans were building railroads to bypass Krakow itself  and the spur bypassed Krakow heading towards the Eastern front  towards the Russian border.
So we arrived in May. In January the Russian front  the Russian Arm y  was approaching Auschwitz.
One of the husbands was killed in a Russian military  on the front.
In one case  I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape.
There were some more that c ame from Russia and some that were partisans  some were in Polish Army and Russian Army.
He spoke Polish and hardly any Russian but he tried to find some Russian words and said finally  finally you are here  finally you come  and we heard from the other side  out  out  out  you damn...the Germans were back.
So  they didn't leave so she sent away her sister  the 18 year old with white blonde hair but me and my brother my brother is in Israel now  he's younger  four years  than me and a sister two years younger she sent us away to the Russian side  so the border we couldn't go through so at night we went through because it was already closed  the border.
Lvov took am Russia Do you [indecipherable] Okay  so that was part of the Russian territory.
Because you know  the Chinese came  the Chinese then came  it was in the war  they were volunteers from China  the Chinese that came  and thats how I wound up in Korea  because the first pilots over there were all Russian  in Korea.
But then wa once we were transferred to the other location  and it was already getting into the time when the when the schoolyear begins  I was assigned to go to the Russian school.
The moment we had no more Russian uniforms to supply  then the -- some of the Russians uniforms appeared again  because people were killed in the gas  and we received the business back  only the numbers had to be removed  because they were the numbers of the dead people.
He special turned off the radio  for me to listen about news  the Russian uh... Then... You were getting the news from Russia through the radio?
And a lot of Russian  Ukrainian and White Russian people  falsify a doc -- their documents as if they were Polish citizens  a nd also came in here.
Poland was invade by German and by Russian an d during this time  Polish nation  35 thous -- 35 million people  a-and 10 percent was Jewish  a nd some other nation was in Poland the same time  and we lose six million Polish citizen.
I told you I know Russian  so there is a song...brick layer  brick layer...is that one passes by and sees brick layers are laying brick on the buildings that they are building.
My mother did  my mother spoke Polish and Ukrainian and Russian and all that.
We were taken to be deloused  because the Russian thought that Poles are really a-absolutely uncivilized  because they dont have delousing stations.
And in fact I remember there was a toilet and the Russian opened the door.
But you didn't know the Russian army was on the march at the time.
Uh my parents  right when I graduated Russian school  uh decided to send me and my brother to Shanghai.
During the day we saw the planes flying over  you know  very low and the Russian would say we could -- you could see the pilots in the plane.
Put on the black uniform  and with the French through several Russian controls  as a matter of fact  I got through Czechoslovakia to the American zone of occupation.
I had so many chances to n-not to be Jewish  even the Russian army  and in the partisans  they used to call me that  you are not Jewish.
Thousands of miles they used to march when the Germans...the Russian used to advance  so they didn't want to leave the prisoners.
With tatoos on his hands  it leaves me to believe immediately that he is Russian because local people did not have tatoos on their hand.
The Russian army in -- No  in -- the German army.
And he touched me badly  the way he said it in Russian  \   \  which translated into English  means  \ Are you still alive?\
I went to then I also bought I left the company after I was president and bought an interest in another company  and I s-started another company with a couple of immigrants  Russian immigrants  which they still work still running here in in I in Des Moines  now owned by a large syndicate  and has about 300 employees.
And one Sunday his brother came over  with a pair of horses  a wagon  and took me took me to his village  and he kept me til end of the til til the Russian came in  til 44.
He says  ﬁYou killed your brothers  sisters  and -- and -- and -- and you want now to escape with the Germans?ﬂ This was my first encounter with the German -- with the Russian army.
We stopped places  they gave us food sometime  there were Russian people who were a on little stations looking and talking to us.
I remember crying  yes  I remember crying  I think I was already in and I must have been 17 or 18 year old a nd I saw a Russian movie and I do distinctly remember the movie was about a boy who lost his parents and all his life  he didn't really lose it  somehow he was separated or whatev er and the whole movie was about how much he wanted to meet his wife  not wife  his mo ther.
And I started to work with a woman who was a white Russian.
The only thing I remember is one of the Russian guys was chasing my brother because he had boots on and he wanted the boots.
I remember very well...Madame Richter  R - I - C - H - T - E - R  a Russian uh emigre from St. Petersburg for all I know.
And once we find a truck with -- a Russian truck with soldiers  full with equipment  and full with food  and full with everything.
The Russian at the time would keep quiet because he did not speak Polish.
We went in the woods and all of a sudden (I was very good in orienting myse lf by the stars or by the trees and so on ) and we all thought that we're going eas t to meet a Russian ar my but I stopped and I said no we're not going east  we're going north and north are the Germans.
I did what I felt a person should do ﬂ and what he does he blames  36 virgin forest (Russian) 42 ﬁIf I could only point my finger its to the pe ople the ones that did not help.ﬂ In Yad Vashem37 he was speaking he say  ﬁI accuse the people the ones who could help and did not help.ﬂ We have a little tiny bit of time left.
They used to say to everybody that they're sending us to work  to the Russian front or to camps  but never they're going to kill us.
Th is was in Bittem  and we called on the telephone the Russian military which was stationed in that town  and the Russian military told us on the telephone that they dont interfere with the Polish government.
Before I go to the Warburg Estate  a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia  go back to Latvia  go back to the Soviet Union  et cetera.
It was a dogfight  the Russian planes came right to the place where the pilot parachuted.
I couldnt tell them that I was Polish so with my pu rest Russian I said (?).
That was about -- on -- not far from the Russian border where the Germans caught them  the prisoners of war  so they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to Sobibor.
As a Girl Scout  it is international  so you meet Swedish  you meet -- in those days  were no Russian  either  but I met from all countries  and I corresponded with ever y country.
Either he remained in Russia where they -- when -- when they were in Russia  you know  trying to -- to beat the Russians  or he actually escaped Germany  and -- and Poland  because of the fact that he was doing all these awful things  and -- and he went to Ru ssia  or maybe there were -- he did some things for the -- to the -- against the Russian people  and th ats why they got him in -- jailed in Russia.
Like a loudspeaker or [indecipherable] And a loudspeaker that we heard that our armies did this  th ey -- they killed German  they occupied this city  in Russian.
First of all  th ey were evacuating us from Auschwitz  because the Russians came close and they did not– the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands.
Someho w  we managed a little bit better because we didn't have this anti-semitism that used to be before the Russian ca me in.
For from time to time  because my mom fluently Spoke Russian?
And I knew that the at that time there were some unpleasant meetings betw een the German and Russian people  diplomatic  some conferences or whatever  we didnt know yet at that time.
Did you have  you had information about what was happening through your involvement with the AK that you knew where the Russian front was and whether they were advancing and so forth?
That was his first jo b. And his second job when we were married  he work ed for the  the as a translator since he knew English and Russian and French  so .
They were not allowed to meet the Russian P.O.W.s so only the Jewish Hungarian refugees were partners for them.
This time  and we are talking about March  1944  and detachments of to the occupants in Russian it's so it can be translated \ Death to the occupants or the conquerors \  in English.
Th-Th they had a good level math in Russian schools  and of course I learned Russians at home  because lot of those Russians officers came to Poland after Bolshevik revolution.
And so somehow she accepted that  you know  and when she was born and until 1914  that part of Poland was under Russian occupation  all you know .
And she says  dont be mad  because we had  after the Russian came in  we had many people  Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews  because they knew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in their o-organizations  you know  the Cath olics and all these organizations.
05:16:48 So  then it came to the commander  the Russian commander  and he was the boss  he was a nice man  he understood the situation  and he told them  he said that these soldiers  they're going to do things like that.
They were from the from apparently also  they were former Russian prisoners.
They were So was it Polish partisans  or Russian partisans who had robbed you?
And they walked in and he sa id and their their their questions were  where is my money  wher e is my house  where is my servants  where is my wi the Russian way.
We looked out and there were the Russian soldiers and the liberation of that town took place on March 31.
Russian language  Russian soldiers  dear ladies  we didnt know you were here  we were  we are fighting the war  we found already a few other camps.
And between ourselves  my friends  we spoke Polis h. My mother and father -- I was only 10 years old when my father died  they spoke Russian between themselves.
This woman had a garden outside the city  the old mu the mother of the young woman  and I had to and this one day I forgot all about my birthday  and I sh-she always gives me work  extra work and I said please hurry up  because Ill be late for the Russian kitchen  I have to get the food out.
One was of Russian origin and the other Stanislaw and Nissinger .
It was not Russian  but Ukraine was more difficult than than the Russian.
That it was 1941 41 when the Russian  when the Russians went to war with Germany so -- Then he had to be in the ghetto as well.
But then we went to Russian Jews who was  my sister was engaged to their son.
For a long time  and then they start to protest th-that they want -- when they have enough people already in Wilna  they came from all kinds of the counties  they start to talk Lithuanian  in the stores  in the banks  in that -- but before it was rush -- Russian.
you have Kaluszyn  you have Wegrow  you have S   you have more to the Russian side  to the east.
When the Russian came  since he was an ethnic -- that's right  they were both shot.
As I said  later on we did find out that they were Russian soldiers.
You know  unnecessarily sending people into the Russian zone  just to -- to put an F on the wall somewhere  which mean frimins -- Freiheit  freedom.
Ye yes  we once we got on that little boat  we crossed over that [indecipherable] Austria German border Austria Russian border  we came to we crossed over that little water that that man took us across  that was the border.
But it turned out the people in there  I remember them  devie chesso thats in Russian Thats right  thats give me your watch.
I was wearing a fur coat but in fact I was wearing a rain coat over it and took me to a school for Germans they brought from the Russian part of Poland to clean for them.
So I walked back into town  nearly into town  and here was a Russian  and he had a piece of black bread in his one hand  and he had a chicken leg in his other.
So what the Russian  was a very smart thing what they did  they went -- before Krakow they went to the north  and then they surrounded  and they came into Krakow from the west.
Well  I think h-her family was of Russian origin  but they ended up in Lwow.
But then I decided its very risky  even to run to the Russian tine  so I will endure  and take my chances to legal -- to be liberated here  in Krakow  where I survived.
Mark had been so wonderful with Russian jury and I thought he would go into international law.
In fact  someone told me that in the Russian Army she was a gun loader on one of the big guns. [
I remember very well one of our teachers was a White Russian who pounded us (laughter)...verbs and syntax.
And in the large Russian cities  you 7 could work at day and study in the evening.
And she was working during the time of the Russian occupation.
In any case  the German we did not also  th-th-th-the Russian invasion besides they came in with the tanks  along the dusty  country road  with little wooden bridges.
We receive d our independence from the Polish -- from the Russian Tsars regime.
They had good reason to be afraid  but we have to remember what the German Army did to the Russian civilian population when they were over there.
We didn't have any soap  and we take the ashes and we put in a piece of cloth by Christian people  like Russian people and we put some cloth and we had warm water  you didn't have water.
The only way to become cultured  educated people was to become  so the Marxists said  and it was th e politics of the state  because it was a Marxist state  to help the Jews to become assimila ted in the surrounding culture  the Russian Ukraine.
When he got I guess this must have been on the Russi an/Polish border somewhere  he said that a man came to him who was in the Russian ar my and surrendered  and said that Im Jew soldier   and so he -my father took him home to Pozega along with his horse  and the man stayed I dont know how long with the family as a prisoner of war.
Three weeks before the Russian came  the German came and they make there the w hole  the main stop  the what's the name in in English  the command  they maked in this house.
And was that the He was going with the Russian army.
I thought we were talking about the Russian p-prisoners of war.
That was in the summertime  and the reason that I remember that it was in the summertime is one of the refugees  he was  ju st hordes of people  I mean the roads in Lithuania weren't any good  they were dirt roads  and people with walking and pulling wagons and horses  it was just mayhem  and one man started running around  he had lost his mind  and he started screaming to anybody  anybody that has a Soviet flag  tear it up and make a scarf out of it and put it on your head  so when the Germans come in  will not find the Russian flags on you.
I know South America  when youre -- Russian  they all have dough with something stuffed in the middle.
Well afte r awhile we found a Jewish Russian soldier who was a Jew.
And on the other hand  the only one who believed it  accepted it as fact  was Ivan Maisky  the Russian mbassador  who probably had known by his own experience that the extermination of peoples is possible  even by so-called civilized countries.
He didnt even say nothing  because he couldnt get to it  or even if he could  he couldnt do anything  because theres lo many of them  these Russian soldiers  well-armed.
We were too close to the Russian front and the concentration camp of Krakow Plaszow had to be liquidated.
It was  the normal soldiers had been partly from Russian prisoners who run away.
His family got completely destroyed and he says  and I remember it like the day he was  I was fascinated with what he had to say  he said that one particular night he got drunk  he was a commander of a unit  and he started crying and he said when he stopped crying he said  let's go for yaziks  that's a Russian word for tongues  and they attacked a German outpost and cut everybody's tongue out.
So now youre s-seventeen years old and you have Russian Right.
And bread  they used to make it from a little cornmeal  how you say  the dark  dark bread  mixed with -- we call in Russian language mich .
This way we reached Russian borders which was Soviet Union at that time but we called it Russian.
So they just threw all the rest of the Jews out to this place called Tluste which was the same place we were during the Russian occupation.
There was one soldier he was speaking Russian it was American soldiers  and he says  ﬁWhat's wrong with you?ﬂ I say  ﬁbu55  bu  boli56  schmerzen 57.ﬂ And he took me in the Jeep  and it wasn't far away and drove me in to a town called Muhldorf and put me in hospital new  and I got good you know  cleaned out and the surgeon gave me farina  milk and sugar every day.
Of course  they were under Russian occupation for many  many years  but we kept touch  and we kept greeting each other.
No  no  no  this is eastern part of Poland   there were the Ukrainians and ru res ru Russian people  mostly.
That was another thing by the way  my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too  he knew with me -- he was going need the Russian language.
In the morning of the holiday a Russian guy came before we came and said  \ Go to work \  and we had to work.
And you were liberated  as you say -- At [indecipherable] by -- -- by some Russian soldiers -- -- soldiers.
And it was very interesting  her town  and her territory was about -- was Russian occupied for -- no  Im sorry  was a -- American occupied  but first the Nazis were there  then the American troops owa  and then Eisenhower signed some papers where the demarcation line on the border would be  and the part that she was in was turned over to the Russians.
There was a Russian who lived in the building next door and the Germans came several times to look for him.
For example  one day they said [speaks Russian] Former marshal of Poland escapes to Romania .
When Hungary came in -- by the way  the population where we lived were primarily Russian.
I don't mean it in a...I am not putting any...passing any judgment because when you are...when you are brought to this kind of a...when you are...when you are made...when you are so dehumanized  it's...it's very difficult to be human; but very few of us  for instance  would eat dead...you know  dead...would... would...would go in... and...and...and...and eat...uh...you know  some parts of dead people  but some of the other inmates  the Russian women particularly  but I think they...they really suffered from hunger more.
There is no longer any oil there  o -- today  but he was a oil prospector  he was Russian.
And in this respect it was better to be a student in the Polish school than in the state Russian school.
And I was looking that soldiers  Russian soldiers are first this part ask in [indecipherable] start this with alcohol.
The Russian man said to him  my brother is a big man  he was always very big and he was bald at a very young age.
She was bedridden  and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund th at still going back to the Russian occupation  encouraged the boys  there was Zigmund and two brothers.
Once you were under Russian occupation during those first few period of the war  what was life like under the Russians?
The Russian language came after a little while  it wasn't difficult  and they did not single out one particular group of people  but I guess they did  only I didn't realize it  they singled out the people who were materialistically rich.
In '44  when the American came...before the Russian came to liberate Romania  uh...the Americans started to bombard the railroa ds.
Also  the Russian soldiers that had managed to escape -- and more and more escaped -- organized themselves in the forest.
And in this place they had a man  a Russian guy who came  the first World War II  he married a White Russian  and his name was Matt Rosov.
And they are  they were running back to Russia  because Lithuania was full of Russian people.
There was a lot of Russian people living there  and one time my father had a Russian person come up with one of his kids to -- something was wrong with him and he took care of him.
So  he brought us to this brother  and we were with him  uh from...October  that was October  uh  43  and till um  about June July 1944  that was uh  the  the Russians moved up --------------in Poland  and they stood there for 6 months there  so we were in this part  Helm  was by Helm  what is more to the Russian side  so we were freed really in 44.
Yes  also in that  uh  period  uh  my uncle--who was a war veteran from the First World War  and  uh  was on the Russian front  lost one eye there and was kept for six years in Siberia.
I mean  I especia lly  as a young person  I think my uncle eventually understood that some of this was not good as time went on and  you know  we were under repressed and the Russian rule  and so on and so forth.
So I was able to go to school from 1939 to 1941 in Russian school  for two years.
>> Bill Benson: So when you were in the bunker and you realized that these were Russian soldiers and eventually you came out  do you know if there was a sense of it really is over for us now or because there was still obviously war going on around you  a fear that the Iron Guard or the Germans would  you know  counterattack and you would be right back in the same situation?
I mean it was probably Russian  whatever  but to me it was plenty.
I saw in Dubno  when I was in Dubno  they near the cemetery they kept Russian prisoners.
Uh...I rememb er that we were inform ed by the underground that we should await an uprising because the Russian Army was closing in on Warsaw.
There were statements of form er Treblinka guards  who identified Hajda  and there was a whole issue  as you probably saw  about the spelling of Hajda  because the Polish -- the s -- the -- the sound of Hajda  theres no H in Russian  and the interrogations were always in Russian.
So the Russian suggested  you go south  and Sikorski   and and ish and Sikorski and the Russian not the Russian  En glish forces  suggested that you go southern part of Russia  and then get out into the Middle East under the British jurisdiction.
The Russian Army liberated us on the 5th of August 1944.
And we know that wouldn't be long until he found us and all we heard is he kept shouting and then new voices appeared  more voices and -- which -- wa -- since we didn't know Russian  I don't know what all these voices were saying  but apparently they had to move 151 on because the voices became more and more dist ant and -- and then finally ceased.
The emphasis in my life was that the language  the formal language became Russian instead of Polish.
5 I I you know  I dont know if its an original memory  or or you know  pictures and stuff  but I seem to remember or or stories that my mother told  but I seem to remember very well  when when the war started that he he was putting us on a train  that we were leaving Sarny for the Russian you know  that the deeper into Russia  I seem to remember him waving goodbye.
The Russian doctor came  and without any anesthesia without anything she came and cut  I have marks.
That's mean that the Russian soldiers take a couple persons  a couple men  soldiers and send them to the soldiers  to German to...to catch...to catch a couple German people.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 6 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ing at--at--at the Russian soldiers in the back.
He escaped to Poland  he gets to Russia  he went to the Russian army.
And his book had the -- probably the task to unite a nation  because I dont know if you know Lithuanian history  but Lithuania was -- 9 the history is quite painful  because you know that the Polish influence  the Russian influence  and -- and the Lithuanian speaker were mainly peasants.
He made a pact of non -aggression w hich allowed  in `39 -- which allowed the German and the Russian to invade Poland from both sides.
Now  when we came back -- after liberation we came back home  we were notified by his wife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an informant and -- yeah  he was an informan t and we dont really know what happened  what he did  because we were in Romania  right?
So I say  ﬁyes.ﬂ So she say  ﬁYou want to come in because some Russian come in and they make us some trouble  and we can't speak with them.
And I think they were Russian Jews so And how long did you We stayed there for a while until they came and took all the m en the Russian and Polish men Jewish to concentration camps.
And the Slovak partisans  especially the Russian -supported ones  100% sure  I assume that here they are behind the mountains ; what's the big deal?
Um  you know we are grateful to every soldier that came in  whether it was French or English or Russian or a wonderful American soldiers that came in and talked to us like human beings.
Sure enough  we went to Budapest with him  with the Russian commander  and arrived in Buda pest -- it was unbelievable  of course.
So we met a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian.
Well  Ladino is created that way and I can equate it like Yiddish is a German laced with Polish  Russian  whate -- other language  wherever the Jews lived in those days.
Once you get into Berlin  Berlin had four zones: The Russian Zone  the French Zone  the English Zone  the American Zone.
They were greeting Russian soldiers marching into Nowogrodek   and they were the orang Russian army was pitiful.
When you started school and you i-it was Russian school  so youre starting to learn Russian  yes?
So and all of a sudden we  we heard  we heard the gate  by the gate  some noise and then they broke open our.... We  were locked  our...our camp was locked from outside with a.... They broke the  the lock  and there were Russian partisans.
And uh during that time uh when uh my mother and my sister were liberated in uh Ravensbruck in East...what was East Germany under the Russian influence.
And the and modern Russian literature  but not to the same extent.
And -- till one day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from Minsk.
And then I while I walked  a Russian truck came and I stopped and the y  they gave me a lift.
As a matter of fact  we had a I remember that I was in a foxhole  and that was the last moment  and I had my last little K ration  it was a chocolate bar  and I fell asleep  and the the Russian probable was very hungry  so he stole it from me.
And the -- and the Russian accepted them in the beginning  but there was such a flood later on  there was a lot of -- came -- came over with a flood  so the Russians sent them away up sisib you know  was too many  they send them to ser -- to -- to -- not to Siberia  but you know yur  theres a Azerba-Azerbaijan in Russia  they try to make -- now under the Russian  this was under Stalin  tried to make a Jewish re-re-repull like a Jewish state in Azerbaijan  you had the Jews there.
Today many of them are Russian rather than of German origin.
And no idea what was going to happen to us and the Encoverdare officer closes the door behind him and -- as were shaking  and turns to us and -- and -- and says in Russian  ﬁVeehad sheety zheets  yatazhoy.ﬂ ﬁYou want to live  I also do.ﬂ And so he became part of the smuggling ring after that and he got a cut.
Did you yourself come in contact with a ny of the Russian partisan [indecipherable].
For many Slovaks they replaced the German occupation with a Russian occupation.
And they explained to us that when we come to the front frontier that Russian soldiers will come.
And when she came to some organization  there were Russian who working in this organization  not Jewish  Russian.
Webb  its been said that the Russian space program is a very methodical program  you know  because they had started with a manned thing  then you send one individual  then a woman  th en two.
Well  we went back to my husban ds hometown  which originally was in Germany  but after the second World War was given to Poland   and the name  in German its Gleiwitz and it was changed to Gliwice in Poland   and it was under the Russian influence.
And I know I I speak with Russian  then I knew.
Lotchik in Russian means a pilot  because when I joined the army  I was accepted to the air force  and everybody envied me  because very few people were accepted to the air force.
We were taken out and th e Russian army came close.
Uh  then uh  there were Russians  and it was hard to separate the Russians who were uh  military prisoners from Russian civilians that had been sent back  but uh  they were always hungry.
And one man who was working there  started to talk to me in Russian -- because we didnt know Latvian  it was a strange country for us.
Because I wrote  I translated my articles from Russian to English.

In those times  you know  I wouldn't say I was very proud to be in Russian army  but I actually had no feelings  is what I want to say  I had no feelings.
If I dont go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a deserter  because I was sort of mobilized alrea dy by the Russian army to be on the railroad  and then they will kill me as a deserter  the Russian government.

Uncle Norbert was my fathers tutor during the Russian occupation of Warsaw.
The camp was in the middle of the Taiga  so it was guarded  but I don't remember any Russian or Soviet soldier with a machine gun or whatever standing over the people.

Now  I want you to tell me about Bucharest  but one question  did you or your family think that maybe you might be better off under Russian?

And I remember we went s -- once wents -- went to th e Russian opera -- I mea n  to the -- to the Lvov opera house for a performance  I believe it wa s ﬁAida ﬂ if Im not mistaken  in Russian  you know  because the Russians liked to listen to operas in translation  not in the original.

They were built in Israel  they were designed by Technion  built by Israel aircraft industry and they were launched on a Russian missile from Kazakhstan.

We have French -- not English -- French and Russian and Yugoslav.
That was the last time I saw my dad   when he left with the Russian Army.
I never forget that day  because even though the -- the Russian front was on the east side of the Oda river  which runs north-south and about 50 to 60 miles east of Berlin  so it was pretty far away  but the artillery barrage was such that the ground under Berlin  under the city  was rumbling and slightly shaking.
In the old apartment  we had to take in a Russian soldier.

And when we they werent Tuvia said  we are partisans  in Russian  dont kill us  you know?
Immediately when we were lined up over there  I think there were maybe two Germans in all and it must have been Ukrainian and the other Russian police over there.
Now the Poles went out and the an d the Russian went away in another place in the same  another place  and the German came b ack.
Anatoli Sherberkof is when I joined the r -- Russian group  and there were Russians  and again I had to mas querade as a -- as a -- as a Russian  so my name was Anatoli Sherberkof.
Uh at the time it was about four kilometers from the Russian border.
But I sent these German trucks up to Soldenburg   which was just beyond the American Occupied Zone of Germany and into the Russian Occupied Zone.
We got to the villa  it was a German villa  and we 81 stayed there until the Germans came Thats how we were liberated - except  one of the girls among the ten was a Russian  and she said the Russians rape women  so we should not stay around  which we had no intentions of staying around  no intention.
And they had Russian soldiers   and we didnt have enough water  it was hot.
Now  we had heard since there were women from the Baltic sea among us th at women from th e eastern state would be sent home because the war there us over alre ady  but the German Jews would be shipped off to Siberia because they didn't really the German Jews and  you know  these soldie rs must have notified the Russian authorities  so 24 they were constantly after us.
We met a Russian  I mentioned before  we met a Russian in our to wn  he brought logs  wood to sell and we got acquainted with him  and he was a lieu tenant  and thats when it started.
It was Russian there  like where I was born it's like the bo rderline was.
Because  when you are drafted into the Russian army  your career lasted 25 years  so all your life  basically.
Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 99 S-So  the Russian people for them  every other person is a spy.
Two of them in a different direc tion -- there was a couple -- like my brother said  somebody Russian.
You see the house the Germans took away and then the Russian people moved in.
Was the first thing they told us to do  to go immediately and to clean  because it's more difficult to say  because the same time we saw the Russian uh troop  Russian army goes to the city day and night.
My father was learning with me  to write and to read to read in Russian; this I learned by myself  I learned this.
They st opped at our house; my mother ha ppened to speak Russian.
He got the night stick  a piece of cloth which says that he was a Jewish police i n three languages  interestingly enough : Hungarian  German  and Russian.
One Russian commander  he took the rifle and wanted to shoot to Alex  so Alex took out his revolver and Panchenko came in between and he pushed them together.
So  the Russian says to him in Russian  he says  ﬁY ou know  this is a very interesting story.
And the Russian  they let them out  so right away  soon it was this  you know.
And so she said to me  look  we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who who fled  and who are hiding in our in this in this camp.
And he found them -- and then were stayed in houses emptied by people who went when the Russian army retreated  they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the Russian army.
So  you had groups  people who worked fo r Russian  for them  with the clothes.
So he said to all the people  a Polack wants to kill three Russian girls.
So Vrba got out because he got ahold of Russian tobacco  and they tra -- they somehow soaked that in some kind of an oil  and the dogs would not smell it  the dogs would not bark.
We studied Russian  Polish  Yiddish  history  geography  whatever other gr -- in the same grade.
And what we  I would do when I was going up to Salzburg or to Linz  the other side of the Russian zone  I would get on there was an American army train known as the Mozart  and we would get on that and that was not inspected by the Russians  but you still had to have a permit to leave Austria.
Sometimes when -- My wife also spoke Russian  it was -- it was Leve [indecipherable].
He was married to a Jewish girl  Russian Jewish girl  and we were very close.
We got a little room  a long  little co -- like the same width  but longer  with one window  two beds with straw mattresses and a stove in the middle  like they call it [speaks Russian here]  the Russian stove that you burn on coal or wood  and no gas.
We came to a...to the... On the railroad station came my Major Smuklarski with another Russian officer--who had also gonorrhea.
My aunt at that point was working in a Russian bank.
And then you make ee-ee noises and dance and youre like this  like that  you know  the Russian folks dancer  have you seen sometime Russian folk dancers -- Really [indecipherable] -- or th-theyre -- theyre very like country songs.
Also because of the three people that I told you that had escaped our ghetto  word came that the underground was being formed  that the Russian prisoners of war that escaped and a few Jews who managed to escape had banded together and became a resistance.
They were the refugees  but most of these people were communists who were  as they expressed it  they were waiting to go to paradise  you know  Russian paradise.
So this was in the wintertime when it was col d. And also  the food situation was very bad because the Russian system applied to them  too.
He fought in the Russian campaign; but unfortunately  he had a Jewish wife and two children.
So the Russian officer gave my father some military b oots.
They now write this letter that a Russian Jew  who came to Israel with his father  was drafted  became a sergeant in the army  was killed in Lebanon or someplace  and they couldnt bury the guy  because his mother was not Jewish.
I went to get some bread  came back  and the Russian arrived at the home.
WEll  he was a Russian major who was prisoner in the camp  and they had taken over command of the camp.
And suddenly it came out a few boys with the armbands and a few soldiers  Russian soldiers and to them  ﬁHands up!ﬂ And they fell down  and they were begging.
She was old en...for many many years after hopi ng oh  she got lost someplace on the Russian side and she couldn't get out and maybe someday...and this is so mething that I must admit even to this day even though I know  I know  I know...there is a trace in me and I've never said this to my son...there's a trace in me that keeps telling me she's alive someplace. (
And they were just a bunch of wild animals  the Russian soldiers.
She was a full developed  beautiful  18Stakhanovtsy: The name of the partisan band (Russian).
So you were -- were you learning Russian at that time -- Russian -- Or had you already spoken -- Yes  I knew the lang -- I knew Ukrainian a little.
After the war it was Polish Jews  and now its all Russian Jews.
We stood there a few months and then they -- there was rumors  there was writings 31 that if Jews from Poland want to go to Russia to work for a year  they have to sign out papers that they going to be in Russia working  and after a year if they want to stay  they become Russian citizens.
So Moma Kopelowicz and another friend  Eli Zaryckevicz   he was from Russia  a Russian officer  was a young man maybe Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 3725 years old.
Uh  so once we got into the Russian zone  then it was entirely different.
The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war  so they brought them into concentration camp and never gave them any food.
That son saved himself  ended up in the USO of the Russian army.
So  that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet  and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans.
We went they shouldnt catch us  the Russian  because if they catch you  they were controlled with Russian  [indecipherable] Russian they get you  then like they said  they take you to Siberia.
And then   must have been about four oclock  five oclock in the morning and all of a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier  Soviet soldier  came through first and then the whole body.
On uh other places  they keep the prisoner to the last moment and the Russian troops liberated them.
In French  in Russian  in English  which I didn't speak at that time.
And then there is my mother worked at that pl ace  and I think there was sometimes some Russian food that you could get  I think.
But today if I can find a Russian Jew that I can take by the hand and give him part of my America a nd return him to self-sufficiency as a way 12 of life  that justifies all the efforts and all the hours because it gives you love in return.
In Russian  if you want to be nice  you say oh  .
1940...yeah...about that  and we got on a on a...they put us...we got a lot of stuff together and we went to the uh the station on the train and were going deep into Ukraine  but it took us like uh three weeks till we got past the Russian border  from Stanislawow to the Russian border  and there we stayed for about another week on the on the   how you say it...on the train  on the...and a lot of people who were running away from the Germans  the Russian people with with their children  and uh  you know  the the Polish people...Jewish.
We brought some money because at that time in in Nowogrodek   the the currency already was Russian dru ruble.
They spoke Polis h and Yiddish  and and also some Russian  because at that one point  the Russians were there  and that during the first World War  the Germans were in were in Warsaw .
However it came in the Polish Army  which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army.
And that room was Doctor Anni e and a couple of other doctors  Lisa was the administrator  Theresa who was the scribe  then they sent in another dentist  the Russian dentist  Larissa.
And while we were waiting for the Visa  the Hungarian government and the political system were taken over by the Communists with the help of the occupying Russian forces.
And our camp was Minziret in direction to Breslitoks  to the former Russian (?).
He didn't know what would befall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to return to the Ukraine.
That was a very courageous thing to make from the Russian side.
And one day one my friends  and there was a general system w hich worked probably  he start to talk to me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation  what represent the German war  against become the Russian  how's our situation and start to uh convince me  I guess  we have to do something.
So one was Jewish  and the rest was NKVD   NKVD  the Russian.
The other two ca mps in Ashafenberg  Displaced Person camps  one was strictly Ukrainian and one was strictly Russian and -- and White Russian.
Because the Russian army that was there  and they had their their their arms  and they were not resisting  because they saw the handwriting on the wall  they saw what actually happened  they saw the might.
And  I think a day or tw o before the Americans came in  we  the SS abandoned the camp or left only a few people and that's when the Russians attacked the camp  the main entrance and a few SS were captured and that's what  th at was when I  I saw all thesethat were and scream at me and we caught a few of them and the Russian killed one of them that I knew particular.
Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong  th e camp had a big bell in the middle of this field  and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell saying  ﬁYou're free.ﬂ Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28  1995 Page 10 In what language?
126 With a visa one can–anything (Russian) 127 Do (Polish) 128 Visa (Russian) 129 Counter Intelligence Corps 84 Nazis war criminals  yes.
The same day they were sitting a restaurant  a drunken Russian soldier killed my sisters husband.
And each time I had to change languages; from Russian first to German; from German then to French.
So when when they came to the [indecipherable] waterfall  then they the Russian  Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28  2015 111whoever was in charge of that group  sa id that they have to go down on the waterfall.
The Russians -- They didnt -- The Russian soldiers in striped uniform?
They had Russian exit visas  which the Russians gave to them; and they sold them  th ey allowed them to buy tickets only if they were paying.
There were a lot of Russian immigrants and all kinds of stuff  all kinds of people that were on that ship.
We had nationalities here  had Poles and you had -- you had Jews and you had some White Russian  Bellarouse.
So I walked back to give that report and on the way back  along one of the streets  I saw a sizable group of Germans  coming under guard by -- by two Russians  one Russian in front with a gun over the shoulder and one Russian behind.
And you know  of course later on was all Russian  you know  so And you picked up ru you know  a five year and a half year old will pick up a language fairly quickly.
Interview with Cesare Ugianskis February 1 8  2013 25 Well  because the 26 th corps of the Russian army was became bebecame the Lithuanian army became 26 th corps of Russian army and they were stationed in Vilnius   so thats how he ended up living in Vilnius .
But one evening--night rather  mi ddle of night  the Russian Army came in.
Unfortunately  the German occupation did it  and the Russian threat continued during it.
And the Russian soldiers saw me  picked me up  carried me like I carry ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 this glass  like a package.
>> Susan Snyder: You said that you became aware of the brutality of the Germans beca use you witnessed the Russian POW s. >> Rae Goldfarb: Yes.
One day they came to us and said : Well  we cannot stay here  the Russian Army is coming closer.
I would remain there  because probably later  I was hoping it would change from a Communistic to a regular government  the Russian army will move  and then I was hoping legally to -- Ill be able someday to get to -- to my brother.
But that that would be a real German  like another group I will mention now was the Russian.
This was a construction organization and all the guards there were middle aged Germans that were not taken to the Russian  were not 16 taken to the army.
There were four  when the war ended  there was the English  the Russian the American.
5 As a result of the Potsdam Conference of July/August 1945  Romania came under the Russian sphere of influence. (
And and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime later the same sergeant comes in and he says  do you speak a little Russian?
And every time the phone rang  and my uncle gave it to me  and he said  \ Oh  this must be the Russian  oh  the uh  the Swedish Ambassador.\
So when we tried to smuggl e the border  my mother tried every evening to -- there were the booths  and there was a Polish soldier on this side  Russian soldier -- you know  they like -- on the border they had a booth  yes  one Polish flag and one side the Russian flag  and soldiers in their uniforms.
But when you arrive in the gulags  if somebody asks you for your name  you tell them that you are Uncle Misha.ﬂ My brothers name was Manasha   in the Russian  Misha.
And I was in in the school [indecipherable] Majewski and I finish up with the eighth grade and had to go to the ninth  and then broke out the war in 1939 and I had to go into ninth  and the Russian are here.
And first thing I recall that they requested  like  I think its because of the Russians  its sort of Russian money  but in rubles.
He got four brothers in the Russian army  so he thought maybe somebody  because those really -- a transport with the people came  but none of them survived.
Not maybe pe rfect  but I had the beginning in Lwow   and of course in the in the camps  they spoke only Russian  you know  in when we were incarcenated in the camps.
I dont know how many miles  but yes  Kovel was pretty close to the border  Russian there.
Of course we   we had the rumors of the Russian  they were coming  they were progressing  prog ressing  progressing  they were 200 miles from here  then they were 250 mile s  150 miles  then 100 miles.
Acro ss the street from one of the streets in the ghetto  you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs  and they were begging for bread.
Was born in 1843  and I suspect that he was fighting in this 60 in 1860s in this one of these crazy insurrections  where the Polish-Lithuanian area a gentry actually arose against the tsarist  you know  with pistols and sabers against the Russian army.
Once the Russian s came  you were  at the time y ou were free to do whatever you wanted?
With the same clothes that they they left the partisans  with the same clothes they went to the Russian army.
They came in and could not look into my eyes  the Russian people.
But our group  that were in this Jewish otriad 24  remained with the Russian unit and it was called the Kalininski Otriad and  of course  we met up with Antisemitism.
The beginning of World War I  which st ared on September the -- well  actually  my father was a Russian.
It was the place where they collected arms  the Russian arms and put them in one or two buildings.
I went to Russian school there two years  I learned Russian and -- and -- under the Germans  you know  I learned Germans a little.
We had oth-other undefe und un under un u-u-under our feet Germans and Russian  are mixed  th because the the the the the the fight was so intense and the artillery of the Russian was giving fire [indecipherable] and bombs that i-it was a you couldnt see anything  like rain before you.
One of the Russian came and took away our horse and gave us another horse and then on the way to the hospital we went to a empty house and we slept there.
40 So this was part of  lets say  the ri -- White Russian -- White  white Tsaristic -- -- Russian refugees who had -- -- refuges  right  right. --
German  I spoke already English and Russian and we didn't have -- it was like a hole in the wall.
We never had bad experience  for example  with French  Jewish  Russian  the same.
Yeah  there was a school  but my mother didnt want to send me to Russian school.
A younger girl  she was Russian  she was real Russi an.
It was -- it used to be POW camp for Russian POWs  and they already evacuated too.
We ran basically toward the front lines because we knew that that's my mother  I didn't know anything  my mother knew that that's where probably the partisans would go and that's to help the Russian armies.
And the father  he was in the Russian army and he was an officer  I dont remember  from the Czars army  he got crosses.
They were...they ...they... you know  I don't know if you know the Ukrainians were throwing...you could see that after  you know  that they were throwing flowers on the Russian tanks  but the Russians...not the Russians  the 21 German tanks  the Nazis.
When was the first time you saw the Russian army come Immediately.
Well  when I wasnt in -- in Germany  of course I -- I spoke Russian and I spoke Yiddish and I spoke Hebrew and I spoke a little German and I hated the language.
They were going  the Russian army was advancing and just shooting so that the people dont attack them.
A-A-Af -- one evening after the -- the Russian came to -- to Lvov and occupied the -- this -- the city  my father came at evening home and he said to my mother that right now we dont have anything.
They call it   4 a Russian   you know  to take care of the sick people for nothing  no charge  freely.
They tied up the main rail lines with us  with the Jews to Auschwitz  instead of carrying material for the Russian front for the troops.
Well  he speaks such perfect Russian  he's just posing as a Danish journalist.
So the Russians  the Russian officer  he say  ﬁhey stop  go down and come in.ﬂ And the officer was saying -- and he talk to his soldiers  ﬁTake him  bring him there.ﬂ He doesn't want to.
But the Russians were really  really treated bad by that time  the Russian POWs.
She all a of a sudden came to the -- to ours -- and she didnt speak -- to our camp  and she didnt speak Russian  she spoke Yiddish.
No  no  no  they didnt get any place very many people  because many people were aware what was going on because when you volunteer for the job  they know Russian front was next direction.
One Russian ran between me  somehow bended and he run away  and the second after him.
Me -- I mean  we all we -- on Sundays  the Sunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs  Polish partisan songs  Yiddish songs.
And we -- the farmers looke d out and they said there's Russian soldiers marching on the road.
Im working for a amer for a Russian lawyer  who heads an American affidavit committee for people for Russian refugees not refugees  for Russian how should I say it  call it?
You have to realize Hitler was loosing at the Russian fronts and and all the Germans...the the German citizens were in the army.
S everyday eventually l My times  most of the high schools and regular schools had to have Russian.
On our side of the perimeter  I was at that time a machine gunner and I had a Russian type of machine gun with a round disc on the top and I was placed from place to place were to attack and where to shoot.
Now one of my father's sisters's was married to an Arian German and they lived in Klinicksberg but the two other sisters were married to Russian Jews and they all lived in Grodno.
I said  hes not a Russian  hes not a Russian  hes Jewish.
When the Russian woman with the daughter came to us already in that little house  and she ask whether my sister has any dresses to sell because the daughter is getting married  and she would like to have a nice dress.
And finally we did get to  to n earby west of Warsaw and there we got a train  a Russian transport train which was delivering petrol or what you say  gasoline.
I even wrote to the Russian commissar or something in December .
One day they put out of the 250 men were not all German Jews  they were Russian Jews  Polish Jews  but now there may be 200 left.
That one was not thrown away by anyone  in fact I still have it among my souvenirs an d in fact I never knew 155 what it really said and of course  with the Russian immigration to this country here during the last decade or so  we also -- we made some Russian friends in Ann Arbor and I had that guy translate it to me  for the first time -- what  40 ye ars after Major Shike gave it to me.
No  no  she was Jewish and she -- a lot of people did -- Russian?
But later on I picked up somehow by  I dont know  I picked up the language  not that Im fluent  but maybe because through my language  my mother-in-law spoke Yiddish and Russian and so -- But when you were younger you didnt [indecipherable] No  when I was younger  no  I didnt speak any Yiddish at all.
So they attach me  they put me in a uniform  some American soldiers uniform  and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat ( ph) and I say  before you go we have to cross Russian borders.
On the train for six weeks  by the time we got to Siberia  my Russian was almost as good as my English.
My br the one classmate whos left was was in conscripted in the army  was sent to Russia   was became a prisoner of war for two years  or three years  he was in a Russian the worst possible condition Ru-Russian prison camp  and he survived  and ultimately he came back.
Maybe they didnt hide Jews because -- but as Russian people  they were from -- from her village  from Skundaliena   they were very good people.
If we had more time  you would actually hear the rest of her story about meeting Herman and how eventually in order to protect them from the Russian soldiers  quarantined all of them and then through bribing with vodka and kielbasa was able to take Susan and get them out of there.
And I would say that same day  all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that subway station with Tommy guns machine guns in each hand and everyone everyone down in that subway tunnel started clapping.
And she...she put...she was...she put herself a Red Cross then  and she was collecting those few girls that she knew and I was...my sister was there  and I had a few friends and she said that there is a very good danger because the Russian soldiers are raping the Jewish girls.
And Russian was there  so immediately some friends of my mother -- she had a lot of friends in Pinsk because she came from the town  gave him the suit.
Were there people in your car  in in your wagon  who spoke Russian?
We had no idea what was really happening  except all of a sudden we noticed Russian uniforms around  and Russian tanks.
He talked about the Russian and German soldiers   of the general who fell prisoner and joined the Germans.
44 written  written in Russian  which I had written by Russian prisoner  war criminal who we helped and he said  he said  \ Yes  I decided you have to come with me \  he said.
He was in the Russian front line behind the enemy line digging trenches and doing this kind of work and this is the only brother that survived.
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 54 And it and this [speaks Russian] or diploma  because I I graduated as as a one of the first students.
I discussed with him the crossing point from Yugoslavia into the Russian zone of Austria.
Besides the Russian soldiers being of help to you  did you sense that people were helping others?
But somebody was always the Russian soldiers because there was no other vehicle on the road.
Once we were in Russian in Americans hands like  they show us pictures  and we saw we we ca we couldnt believe it  ah  we couldnt believe it  but and then we start to meet the guys from the camps  and Well  heres another ques tion.
And we looked out through the window and there they were the tshubarikis 2 the Russian soldiers  and we couldn't believe our eyes.
The communist party to ok over the Russian partisan movement and the democratic government had a branch in London.
As soon as the Russian troops go out and the civil government sets in  well start the same thi ng as we lived in 1940.
A Russian soldier came and picked me up  carried me  with one hand like a sack of potatoes.
They were fighting  but nobody even mentioned them because this was a Russian partisan.
So  until the until the Germans unearthed Unearthed that Katyn Katyn and they announce it  America  and England said it was done by the Germans  and Stalin [indecipherable] the exploitation  and he had Polish Jewish fellow who was a general  what was his and he formed communist army in Poland   and that was another army over ther e. And they went all the way to Berlin  too  with Russian army.
So if we would have had money  we would do 20 political instructor (Russian) 21 village administer (Polish) 42 that?
Only one brother  who the Russian mobilized to their war  and then the -- oh  I -- I apologize -- and then they -- and the -- and then they were er -- I was trying to say something about it.
40 -- you see  the years when the Russian come. ‚
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 87 Well  is there something that you would want people outside your family  outside your grandchildren  other American children  or young Polish people  or young Russian people  what would you wa nt them to understand about what you went through?
And I said  ﬁThis is a Russian policeman.ﬂ ﬁAnd you dont know what to do with them?ﬂ He took out his gun  shot it.
There were Russian girls  and Polish girls  because this was really such along way out of Auschwitz  and out of all these selections  that the group was extremely mixed.
Many who built for war in say like the bridges  railroad  toward the Russian front were excused for active service in German army.
First  Im sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward Russian territory rather than just taking care of you themselves  and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood  what it -- what this all felt like.
And the Russians  of course  they had a big front  what 3 000 miles of front line and they were demanding that the a-allies  meaning British and Americans open the -- a new front  to take some of the load from the Russian front.
It was a Jew  Russian  Jew  Russian  and this when was the liberation.
And they ask if an ybody speaks Russian  I volunteer to speak Russian.
He comes to G  and he said  in Russian  my name in Russian is .
But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone  and I dont know how long we were there.
The Russian came from one side  and th e German come in from the other side.
That what w e had to deal with from then on  for some time  simply bec after finding out that we could leave th-the Russian free labor camps jurisdiction  then we could we still needed assistance  so the army units were op en  fed some of the civilians.
She was my s ecretary because she spoke Hebrew  German  Yiddish  Hungarian  Russian  and was a remarkable woman.
But then comes the Russian war  the invasion that -- to us.
Bur later on  of course  we didnt feel it so badly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this.
And th en my sisters married and as Polish Poland citizens we got out from the Russian from the Russia/Soviet Russia in the December of 1946.
I slowly was starting to get a little better and we made contact with some Russian officers who were coming through town and they asked us whether we would like to work for them as interpreters  being that my brother and I speak fluently Russian and German  they asked us to to come with them to help them to deal with the with the civilian 02:05: German population.
What they wanted to do was to teach us Russian and to teach us the Communist mantra.
He says  okay  I am too  he says  but be quiet  dont tell the Russian soldier that Im -- they dont know that I am Jewish.
So  and I thought myself  yeah  six oclock  but I heard the ger Russian can be here in an hour or in a day.
They brought a lot of Russian bullets  and they were rusty.
I wasn't a baby  you know  but I used to make pancakes and I used to make things and I used to bake and if the Russian soldier were coming  you know  from one side and to the other side  I don't recall from where they came  I always had food to give.
And what we saw there was the Russians had come so close that the most eastern Province of Germany  East Prussia  was now threatened by the Russian Army who had every reason to be bitter about the Germans.
I have Russian officers who quite frequently looked for my help.
I was liberated by the Russian  and I been in a hospital  in Russian hospital.
I'll tell you why  because it was the last house  and not too many soldiers  Germans  came that time  because they were busy with the Russian front.
In in the Russian army  they knew I was Jewish but in the Polish army  a priest came over to me and said to me  I know you're...because  you know  they know...you know  the Polish people are not circumcised.
We recognized it immediately and all this  but just to give you one example  most of us  we had to go to Russian instruction every day  most of us either didn't show up or if we did  we didn't listen  we didn't learn anything  and after going through college  at the end you had to take a state exam.
You were saying before [speaks Russian] give us gasoline  give us gasoline.
Then  what were going to do is move beyond this experience  into the time after the war when the Russians came  and found you  and inducted you into the Russian army  or the equivalent of it at that time.
And I wrote to them and I warranted about him  that hes not one of the Russian serv ices and he got a job in agronomy.
So -- so I ask her  ﬁDo you speak other languages?ﬂ She said  ﬁYes  I speak German  I speak ﬂ -- of course she spoke in Polish -- ﬁI speak Russian  and I speak Hebrew  and I speak English.ﬂ So I said  ﬁEnglish?ﬂ And I spoke a little English.
But I have...I must have seen him all the Russian refugees in Zurich...you know.
I think I was 18 or 17  I dont remembe r. I got a job in a Russian -- where they sew uniforms for soldiers.
What were the Russian soldiers or Russian guards like to you in that village?
He was originally from a town near Tarnople  this is near Stanislovov this is near the Russian border  there was a few brothers he was originally from there.
They were picked up off the water  three men and two women  by a Russian trawler.
My father come back fr om the prison -- mean the farm prison  and come back to Warsaw  and start working aw -- eight -- for example  propa -- he was about 20 years old  working for state like Marines  on Vistula ri ver  because during this time  if you has -- are 18 ye -- or -- year -- years old  you cannot create a good education  because was very tough during the sn -- Russian occupation.
And where we were liberated was the Russian territory  because England   Russia   everybody took a p a a part of  I think the country.
I didnt -- only after 39  when th-the ration came  and they took Lvov and then the -- the government was like a -- a -- a Russian government  and th-they -- the -- the Russi an [indecipherable]  they -- they opened the kindergartens and I went -- the first time I went to the kindergarten in 39  the end of 39  maybe 40  th -- I -- I remember the date that I went -- went to the kindergarten  how I wa -- I was crying.
Marcel Drimer: I will finish talking about the Russian -- Bill Benson: Okay.
So they retreated  and Russian took the hospital  and there was a hospital  with a vo very good doctors.
It was organized by Russian paratroopers and the barra cks of the Slovakian army.
So -- th e Russian uniforms were cloths of cotton  yeah.
Interview with Frank Hyde May 4  2013 100 But she wasnt there yet  no  she came much later  because she was on the Russian side  and they were not so organized bringing the people back  like when you were somewhere on the western side.
When I came to the United Stat es  I spoke Polish  Russian  Ukrainian.
Or da it was Russian m oney  or Austrian money  I dont know  but the family was talking that thats st ealing.
And Russian physicians would be available to provide treatment  to provide medicines.
All of the sudden  I hear  there was one morning  like a rattle  like a  like noise outside  and I look outside  and I saw a tank  but  and I recognized the Russian insignia.
I know that he was two years in the Russian front.
And then a lot of times  the Russian soldiers stopped with the trucks and they give you a lift.
He got his orders to go on the Russian Front. \
And when you talk about this Russian occupation  what years would we be talking about?
I wore a German uniform  and four from the Russian partisans  and they gave me a submachine guns for us  and we came to the place.
And he -- and his sergeant  he was a regular Russian.
Even I met already Russian partisans  already I thought they have certain salvation  there's no end  there's no help for nobody.
They gave us...I still was wearing a Polish...the Russian uniform  and down there they processed me and you know  the Polish people didn't like...you know  the Polish they didn't want anybody from the Russian army to be in charge  you know  but most of the 14 Polish army was run by the Russians.
Typhoid  dysenter y. The next day or a day after they came this Russian people with some help of the villagers that they recruited to do this work and they carried me to the hospita l where my hair was shaven from all over my body and I was dunked in DDT to kill all the lice and whatever  insects  and then I was unconscious for three days.
Lwow used to be on the Russian... 2 Belonged to Russia but before Germany invaded?
Millions of people killed and although we had interpreters  Russian interpreters  we had a meeting ta even before V-E day  it it was in late April  we were on the Elbe and we stopped  and the Germans stopped on the other side  that was agreed that we would that Elbe was the the the border between the two zones.
I come into there  come into the office and there's a city dressed woman sitting there with a stack of papers with pictures on it that I could read it  you know  in Russian and in Polish  and the uh captain or major says well Slivka  what do you think?
In the Russian zone  there is a uh  house for all the refugees arranged  mainly managed by Jews.
And you know I already spoke perfect Russian  perfect French and I wanted to go to learn languages.
He was Russian soldie r. Maybe he was in capture  he was ca -- he was captured  and he escaped and this way he -- he came to this camp  I dont remember  but he -- hes arrived  too  and they got marri ed on th -- a-after the war  and we visited them  we stay in their house.
But what this means  they must invent -- they must invent a town which is under Russian occupation so nobody can control them anymore.
because it was very  very  very strong bombardment  and we saw the Russian running.
She knew Russian because she was from Kovel (Ukraine) (394)  a nd she spoke Russian very well.
They wanted my mother to say good  because then they traded us in for the Russian  for Berlin .
So  there were  of course  exiled Russian doctors in Peschanka too  but they had nothin g to give you to help you when you were sick.
When I hear Middle Eastern music and this includes Arabic  Israeli  any Middle Ea stern music or Russian music  something deep within me comes to life.
So when they had to go and apply for a Russian exit [visa]  then he needed somebody to translate for them.
But later  a jealous  her boyfriend  the Russian officer arrested me  put me in jail.
All the Jewish names  and they ta lk because the Russian Jews  they're open-minded people.
Yeah  he was teaching -- a teacher  not -- not only Hebrew  he was teaching Russian.
>> Susan Taube: After the Russian front came closer  the concentration camp was liquidated.
A seasoned man  he was in the camp since the first week on and the Russian soldiers were somehow surprised in a captured village  this to happen  but he was not.
And there were a group of Russian partisans  under the name Shapiga  and then Wandervaselevky's group  and th e I  People's Army Group.
But I was so unhappy that I second time I saw the same when liberation was by Russian  it was unbelievable what they did it.
Well  were told by the political officer  by the po litruk33 in a camp that  ﬁYou are going to join Polish forces  you are going to join our victorious Red Army are going to fight the damn Germans.ﬂ 03:25:59 [Technical conversation] End of Tape #3 32 Round (Russian) 33 Political instructor (Russian) 28 Tape #4 [Technical conversation] 04:02:54 This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.
I spoke German  I spoke Hungarian  I spoke Russian   I spoke Polish.
And he says  \ Look.ﬂ And he spoke to his chief of his Russian section  Saito-san.
Yeah  I mean  there was a ki-ki-ki -- mail was -- mail was still going -- going across from -- by that time -- I mean  that part was already under Soviet control  but that doesnt stop a postcard which would -- which essential -- essentially would come in Russian to my -- to my aunt  I guess it would be  to my fa-fathers cousin.
My mothers family were Lithuanian and Russian but she herself was born in Poland.
We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I  immediately  and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia  and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia.
They took guns  they were shooting at them and they were jumping on their ropes  and they were yelling in Russian  this is for my mother a nd this is for my fath er  what you did to my country to my Mother Russia.
They didnt -- nobody knew where we ar e going  but the Russian told us we are going to resettle us  so we figure maybe its going to be something good out of it.
And all the time my husband kept the letter with him in his...uh... But when we are within one borderline and the Russian were...were hitting us  terribly shaking  and I saw they are taking all the written things of they take away And then Avraham saw it . . .
What -- what did that uniform look like  the Russian uniform?
As a result  you would live under Russian occupation until June 1941.
As a result  you would live under Russian occupation until June of 1941.
142 On the other side of the valley was a high -- not highway  but a road where the German army was running like crazy  because on the other side of the valley was a hill and you could see Russian soldiers  mounted soldiers with binoc ulars watching whats going on.
`42  but in 1943 wh en...when the Russian hit back already  for good - in April  that was in April.
So what I heard about Russian occupation  I had not in Jaimalas   I havent seen any police  or I mean  soldiers coming in  or anything.
And then we heard that that film was  the German film was all in the Russian sector  which made it even more difficult for us.
So the officers  the Russian officers  told them to leave otherwise they will get killed. \
This is when I realized that they had some important Russian officers there.
When I saw the firs t Russian  I just -- I said there is other people around.
33 A In spite of the fact that it was already the Russian period  the religion was not anymore a dominant factor.
My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of me for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist  and then be arrested because a child had said something.
And so  from we were at Shpital on the Russian line  and we were we furnished guard duty fo at [indecipherable] Goering and Hitler and all had the paintings and all 26 of the beautiful things  artwork that was done  but I never got to go inside until 25 years after that  the wife and I went back and I got to go inside of the Neuschwateine castle there.
As a result  you lived under Russian occupation until June of 1941.
The the most I got in contact with  at the castle where we stayed  they had converted one of the rooms into a very nice little bar  and in the evenings it was the bar was pre tty well full  and there was one Russian who was a jolly sort of a guy  didn't speak any English at all  but he was fascinated by the different kinds of glasses that different drinks came in  and so he would line up everything from Cointreau to Tom Collins practically  like six or eight glasses  ten glasses.
Now  many of the yellow starred houses were raided  and many of the people already were deported  but in the middle of December  which is what what was  there were Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops.
What happened after the liberation actually  the Russian kapos set up a tribunal.
That was my first attempt to escape  but they rounded us up and again they didn't shoot us  because we are strafed  you know  and then when we tried to walk -- By Russian bombers?
I mean  during the Russian occupation  only one time  and there was a speaker  and I mean  of course  it was all in Russian  you know  and I didn't have as good a time as I used to at the university.
We left because of there was  you know  we were al lowed to bring in United State  150 dollars  which is -- which was equivalent to 3 000 dollars -- or 300 dollars in Russian -- in Russian money.
So  then I was sent -- thats was already -- we already free people -- already we -- the Russian army free.
Jewish students who were architecture  art and so on and we organize a student group in this town who performed music  dancing for the remaining Jewish refugees that came back from Russian.
They're small houses  and so we had Rusisha shul  Russian shul  and a Poylissha shul  a Polish synagogue.
Were the other students Jewish refugees like you  or was it a mixture of Russian students and Jewish students?
At night...the same night after they shipped him  some were caught at the...the Russian army caught the trains and busted the trains up and let the prisoners out.
And he that of course  he was starting to look because they were talking theyre killing Jews  theyre killing Jews  the Russian  but he never believed  because they said all all propaganda he was talking about.
The first year at school was in Yiddish  everything Yiddish  but we used to study Russian.
The Russian army will come into the city; they'll take care of you.
When I woke up  I remember the Russian doctor asking me my name  my age  where I'm from  and holding my hands  and giving me hope that I'm free  that I'll be okay  that they'll take care of me.
You know  the Pole  after the war after the war  th-the Russian took par-part of Lvov  and th-they give the Poles the West Germany  theyre called Farbruck there.
See  when the Germans destroyed the Russian army  they dropped everything on the fields.
I think -- I think now  the attitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course  they were not in the concentration camps  they were not in Auschwitz  is already different  and they are -- the willingness to -- to help  is also greater  because now  since we are established  and since we are -- most of us anyhow  are doing well  and want to contribute both financially  and with our work  to our -- the Jewish community  and all the others  not Jewish causes  we are respected.
Well  he arrives in those gulags and in Siberia wherever he was there  I dont know  and then he stands there and you register  register you and they ask him  ﬁWhats your name?ﬂ He says  ﬁManasha Galperin.ﬂ The man said to him  ﬁDo you have another name?ﬂ My brother said  ﬁNo  I dont have another name.ﬂ He says  ﬁIn Russian they call me Misha.ﬂ He says  ﬁDyadya Misha?ﬂ Hes  he figures what can he lose  he will say.
One day the Russian army decide that al l officers got to know how to dance  but dancing to ge to Germany  in Germany everybody is kultura.
She said  ﬁWouldnt you come and do some wo rkshops for us as a volunteer for our Russian refugees?ﬂ Which I did  for about four years.
I dont know why it did not happen  but it was on the agenda in in in Germany   before we took Berlin  because the Russian wanted to press so hard  kill how many Russians and Germans together  just to be the first in Berlin.
Something is fishy  so I asked one of the Russian officers there  what's happening.
So with the help of the packages which I sent him regularly for many y ears  he subsequently is a very capable man  spoke Lithuanian fluently  spoke Russian fluently  spoke Yiddish fluently  all these things which I couldnt do  he was able to do very well.
Now if they come down  and they looking for Russian  they will find yo u. They will kill you right away.
Why don't you describe that day that -- that you were liberated by the Russian partisans yer.
At the frontier  it was 46  the Russian officer didnt like us to enter the country.
Immediately they arrested me and they put me in a big yard  with the rest of Russian prisoners  a schoolyard.
One of the reasons the word rus  the population in our area was mostly Russian -speaking.
And they went ther e and they met some people and they met some Russian people  Russian soldiers and they told them to wait another couple of days because it 's insecure to come right now.
Only the Poles would fight after the -- the German -- [indecipherable] the Russian  they organized themself  but not the other  not the others.
You look like Russian village woman  so no one cra -- can recognize you that you are Je w  and no one will ask you.
So  I found a job in  I found a job in slave labor outside of the ghetto where they collected arms  Russian arms  which we re left over when they were running away.
Because they figured you're more efficient and you're more good the camp will work  that they would stay a chance not to go to the Russian front.
Yes  that was not necessary anymore because the Russian government didnt have the same system as the Polish government so I gave up the w hole education that I had for that purpose.
And that time  it came an order from all the brigades  from all over stretching from this -- from eastern Poland  way up in Lithuania  whatever  deep to the Russian territory  that we have to -- this was impor -- imp -- that we  first of all  we have to mine all the roads and mine all the bridges.
It was a camp  the German camp Russian pris oners  Russian soldier by the hundred.
But I spoke Russian with my mother  I thought I could I wondered.
No  other studies  a few of our teachers es caped  and whoever escaped was replaced by the army teachers  Russian army teachers.
When we went we come in the station  and we see there is bread  there is herring  there is whatever you want for eating  brown from dusk  we thought people we didn't see it in Russian for the last last time  you see?
When you were with the Russian army  you served primarily as an interpreter?
My father could not get back there  because it was then in -- under Russian contro l  and U.S. and Russia  and you know  it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 78was a catastrophe  youd have to go through Moscow  and the [indecipherable] now  you dont.
She came to this country  lets say in -- in -- in 1912  or something like that  so she -- so whatever education she had was -- was in Russian.
Im Jewish.ﬂ S o  the guy says in Jewish to him  ﬁWhy didnt you tell me that befor e?ﬂ So  anyway  he was saved  but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways  trie d to - since Adrian was already there  like the Russian and him were already such frie nds  and so  he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him  but he wasnt.
They let me though both the Poles and the Russian s. Not only this but on one corner of the bridge  they were telling the other corner  hey you there.
And you know  it the the area  which of co urse loc-located in in the part where many people were Ukrainian  White Russian s  Jews again  you know  because thats thats the way it was in Poland  all all over the place.
The Germans also went through with their army to the Bucovina to the Russian front.
And all of a sudden I had nobody  and and then a cousin looked at me  she said  a-already  after the war  I ca they the Russian people say you could go to Poland.
And I was there  and there was  I think  a Russian woman or a Russian boy and a Mongol woman  I dont remember how Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 89many  you know.
So uh the situation was tough  and many non -Jewish people took out many special fascist organization  took advantage  took all the Jewish business  all the Jewish factory  all the big Jewish house  or small Jewish houses  so the only hope of the Jewish people was to  to get out of the war and we know that there be USHMM Archives RG -50.030*0151 9 or due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our territory or to the Russian army  start the offensive about the Germans over there.
But hear over the radio home  the Russian side  the Je wish people over there singing Jewish.
Me and Rubin and some Russian prisoners went out the barbed wire and went through the forest.
And they s -- the sergeant  Atkinson was his name  Se rgeant Atkinson told me that before the border dividing the Russian zone from the British zone   I should get out of the British car because the Russian soldiers would come and inspect the Brit ish car and they did not like German citizens mingling with the British  meaning a -- I would go into the -- into the car in front of us and pretend to be one of the -- well  I was one of the people.
Turned out he was a Russian that had come over as a teenager  to get away from the Germans.
So  and I remember  they were very cute old men  we had no  I mean we had sign language  we didnt speak Russian and the only inci dent I remember is that my mother  of all these sufferings  had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive co logne water that she kept.
With re verence and with   we take over the task to judge the Jews in the ghetto and we'll do it to the best of our understanding  to the best of our...taking into consideration the specific conditions in the ghetto that nothing was alright  and also their rulings...their rulings they took into finding any law book in the world  and I I... You know and you know Hebrew and you know Russian .
The two boys slept downstairs and one of the fi ve girls  her name was Sarka  she found herself a r -- a Russian officer.
Bill Benson: Rae  we're going to turn to our audience  but is my memory correct that you -- you couldn't get over here because the -- the Polish quota for coming here was so -- so restrictive so you were able to end up getting on a Russian quota which allowed you to get here.
