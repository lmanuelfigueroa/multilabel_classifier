So once Soviet Union was attacked  vast spaces became killing grounds  where nobody counted for anything  I mean they could murder Russian civilians  Ukranian civilians and was the start of the extermination of the Jews.
In a Russian ambulance we escaped from Poland  and rode through the border Czecho...into Czechoslovakia  later to Germany and then in...we were in the DP camp in Feldafing where I worked also for a while in the at the with the Joint Distri bution Committee and UNRA and a friend of ours  a friend...she befriended us.

The only thing  since it was so close to the actual Russian border  they did not want refugees th ere  that's why I was not sent out because took me under his wing  but a lot of peopl e were sent out into deep Russia.
I knew a little bi t Russian  and the other girls were Polish and I at one time when Magda said why don't you come and her husband was .
She married a Polish Jew  and she came to Wilna with my -- but she spoke only German at home and my mothe rs first language was German  but because she was educated in Russian schools  so with my father  at home with us  she spoke Russian.
One of my cousins was in the partis ans too  but the Russian took him out in 1944 and they took him on the front and in anur Bialystok   he he was killed.
Th-They had one Russian who spoke some English  so somehow they got along all right.
We got in touch with another Russian guy  a Russian pilot who was working for somebody in our town.
As they got closer to the house  she recognized the language they were speaking  and it was Russian.
What happened  two Russian planes came every five minutes for about a minute to check on the locomotives  we were not the only one  about 10 in a row.
And so  soon as the Nazis 4 occupied Poland  the Russians moved their borders as well  and consequently we came under Russian occupation.
The they dont know that over two million Russian POWs were killed by the Nazis in Buchenwald also.
in afterwards  its an interesting thing that as a new country  did Lithuania adopt the old Russian Imperial legal system  and thats why it would have been useful?
You cannot stay here.ﬂ So the woman  that Polish woman told Mom in Polish that -- dont be af raid  these Russian soldiers they dont want any spies in the border because Russia was not at war then -- Right. --
It didnt had -- they portray all these -- the Russian like they would be stupid til the Sputnik come into being.
Tell us about that time  about the Russian attack on Iasi and then what it meant for you and your family during their attack but also in the time after that.
And as we were walking  I with a little friend of mine holding a hand  we sa w two Russian soldiers  and I -- that I will never forget  and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers  and we asked them to take us to Lomborg  and you know we covere d our head with -- with scarves  and we -- they shouldnt notice that we have typhus.
We see the Russian soldiers and we run up to them.
They arrived in -- like a -- a truck or some thing and they wanted to know who was who and we said who we were and we spoke Polish and there was a Russian woman with us too  because that was already out of Radsoff.
And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h-hospital.
Hanging  et cetera  and when I watch the History Channel  and I see some of the some of the things when Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci  and how they used to hang Russian prisoners  the German and so on and so forth  this always comes back to me  this scene of how I had to watch these people being hanged.
And so they got a new friends  and the pe ople who was here  from -- the Russian people  well  they was not -- they actually afraid to be anti-Semitic  very  very  because actually they should take care about families who was -- came from this -- the territory that you know  like the -- they ra -- ran away from the Germans so  it was -- everything looks not very friendly.
And is there anything else that...any partic ular stories that you remember from your time in the Russian that you want to talk about?
