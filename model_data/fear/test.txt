I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of some thing that marred my life for a long time.
And this was when -- when you would be warned that -- that Germans were coming?
>> Bill Benson: After about six months  if I remember correctly  your father did return.
Ma so then th not not in such a fear Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 146and as as in the case of the doctors.
We had to hide a lot because  you know  there were...we always were afraid somebody...it  it was...let's put it this way if I think I mentioned to you...very often we envied the people that were in con centration camps because we felt that at least they are thousands and hundreds of them.
And some desperately wanted to go home  and some were afraid to go home.
The letter was already 10 days old  so I was afraid she would not be there anymore.
When I got home I was completely covered with blood  and I remember when I got into the house  my mother looked at me completely colorless something...such an awful thing to see first time...I was just absolutely covered with blood and I always remember my mother's expression and my mother's fear and my mother cry out when she saw me completely covered with blood and that was the first night  the first expression what was...we didn't know what's coming and it was a horrible thing the first night.
At one time  my parents were talking about going to the city of Warsaw.
Also when the so-called racial laws came out  it was uh decreed that uh no one  uh no Jewish family where the where the man in the house can have a ma...a live-in maid because uh they were afraid of uh mixing up the races for and uh he  that man...his na me was Victor Marschek ...uh got a permission to uh for our maids to stay to the very end because he said my parents have other things to do than uh to stay in the house.
But what she did  at night she used to come to my cot and used to tie a knot in her night gown and mine so I wouldn't run away anymore .
Bad enough Im sure [indecipherable] and the fear was very great.
Were you not afraid to die  or you just werent afraid of -- I was afraid to die by the hand of the Germ ans  but I wasnt afraid to die by the hand of allies.

12 Because there was an experience from World Wa r I that the Bulgarians had occupied the city  and th-the -- i-it was only torture and -- and -- and fear  and [indecipherable] killing people.
Maybe they were afraid to be now harsh  you know; because at any time 25 According to Arolsen  this would have been a subcamp of Stutthof located in the city of Danzig  known generally as the Danzig Schichau-Werft because the civilian employer was F. Schichau GmbH. Also referred to as Burggraben  after the barracks where the prisoners were housed.
We felt fear at times that we would be deported someplace.

Maybe they were not anti -Semitic but they were afraid of the dangers of hiding Jewish children so they sent us right back to our parents.
And it  the cost was of  many great strength and a great fear.
And did you--do you remembe r  or did people talk about fear of not being able to get into Palestine  or were you-- Yeah  we were  yes.
That was one of the reasons that everybug -- bu -- one who could leave Kavala  left  because we were afraid to stay under the bulger -- Bulgarian government.
Number two  he was afraid that the more he knew  and the more he was involved with the Gestapo  they may  in the end  not let him go  not let him even survive.
If it's some thing that he's afraid of  he would open the door right away.
The Jewish survivors in the DP camps could look beyond the barbed wire that surrounded their camp  they could see German civilians walking on the roads  they knew that the Germans had been the enemy of the American Army  yet the Germans were free to come and go as they please  but they who had been liberated by the American Army did not have that privilege.

As...there was such a terrible atmosphere  such fear of not knowing what is going to happen.
She was afraid that I will if I will stay I will be shot the first day.
It was basically that a -- that very fear of what will happen that my parents  Im sure  felt.
You were afraid to go into your house  and not only this.
We ask that if you have a question  please wait until you have a microphone  make your question as brief as you can.
You know that you -- like I say  you had that Jewish -- thats the Jewish o -- council there and you had organization and they -- its -- Im afraid -- they -- they didnt know much about all the survivors  but they knew  you know  they knew who was in Bialystok  you know.
He thought that I would be afraid I wil -- cant afford it  so he said  ﬁIll remove your number and I wont charge you anything.ﬂ I said  ﬁNo  I have not interest.ﬂ He said  ﬁBut I wouldnt charge you.
She was allowed to express herself without fear of being pegged as one of the lesser students trying to work their way up.
That was the cooperation they got from us because of that fear.
They thought that fall might come any minute  and I remember my mother was afraid  because my father was an officer in th e army  that he might be one of the first to go back to the service.
So anyway -- and I looked at this kid and I said to her  I need to protect you from my past  because I was afraid that if Ill be talking to her what I went through  its -- its going to be a punishment to this kid.
The woman will close the shop and he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee from Transylvania  like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee  refugee from Transylvania.
You know  I told you  I did find myself walking on the stre et -- I was afraid to go on the boardwalk  you know?
Maybe that's not a proper word  but the fear  you were under this terrible fear and now it was already several years for me  a lifetime at that point  that we lived under this.
I said ﬁWhere is my sister?ﬂ So  she was there  so I said to the people that were running with us   a whole bunch of people  many people I said  ﬁIf you're not going to go after my sister  I'm going to scream so loud that all the Germans are going to come and kill us too  because I don't want to leave her  I'm not going to see my sister.ﬂ Everybody was running back because they were afraid that I'm going to scream  and I was a very tomboy.
The worst fear that I had  and I can't tell for my mother and my brother  that at night when there would be trucks coming through the streets  you would just lay in bed and you would just wait and you always anticipated that that truck would stop in front of the house you were hiding in.
For woods they were afraid  because they know with the underground is no place to play.
Do you think -- oftentimes people s-say their kids are afraid to ask because they think its painful for you.
I mean...of course as a Jew it was very dangerous  but in that  that period  all men about twenty years of age were very afraid to go by train because the  the Groen Politie 5 the German police  trapped all the 2 Pieter Meerburg's group was known as the Amsterdam Students Group.
But then this Russian came and we were scared of them.
I mean  like I had fear but also I had to laugh.
or did they -- were they kind of afraid to have you so close by?
I saw Jewish faces  I decided that I want to live here  because I was so afraid about -- o-of big cities after Leningrad  being outcasted so much  that when I saw here Jewish faces  and Kiev was a f -- the fa -- city of the -- a lot of Jewish people lived b ecause still before the revolution  and everybody who survived bu -- came back to Kiev and in Kiev somehow you can -- it was difficult anyway  being Jewish [indecipherable] was very difficult.
But the -- the -- with the fear of the documents always.
I came to Canada and I was afraid to leave a door closed  because my door was closed I'd leave it open.
I was more or less I would say courageous but I was afraid of the bombs and sometimes I had...I was panic...I was panicky in spite of the fact that objectively was not as dangerous then as other occasions where it was more dangerous and I was less afraid.
We couldnt  you see  we couldnt keep on staying in the same town for too long because we were actually afraid of this.
And there was a fear that if we invade d  that they would come out and fight our our navy.
And he couldnt wait  he was afraid because the German were were making razzias Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14  1997 95all over  and were looking for Jews to ta ke to the concentration because it was actually one of the last the last aktions   what the German were looking for Jews to take concentration camp.
So there was was some more fear then  but then when the Americans won  the Allies won  then I think we really felt that we had survived uh and just that we would live.
And we are afraid that -- we don't know what will happen with us.
She kept on saying Im sorry I did that but I was so afraid.
And I woke up -- I woke up in that ward and I was afrai -- I wa -- I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 70 had been afraid that I would be recognized as a Jew in that Catholic hospital in Limoge.
By then I was not afraid  I went straight to the gate to the Jewish policemen.
So even though I didn't  wasn't told specific details of what was going on  I sensed the fear and the  the worry of my parents at that point.
He's afraid that when we get caught  he' ll be shot by the Gestapo.
It was -- I was so afraid to go on a ship because on my trips during the summer in Croatia  when we used to go to the island of So lta  we once went on a boat that took three hours from Split to Solta  which you can see from one another.
Were you ever afraid that they would ask you to do that kind of thing?
Him  I was not afraid any more to say [indecipherable] I didnt say I was a Jew.
indecipherable] You described yourself as very reserved  afraid sometimes -- Well  I was conf -- constantly with the -- I was afraid.
On the one hand I want it the most  on the other hand I'm afraid of it.
I remember it was sin to have any napoleons   uh gold coins  so we were so afraid of deportation that my mother flushed a couple gold coins down on the toilet because we were so afraid that if they  if we're going to be found out we're going to have to go outside of the city and...uh I'm struggling for the wor...word...I don't know what happened with capitalists during the communist uh regime.
I hoped -- I was afraid of the language and I hoped I will learn it  as a -- at the beginning I was better  but I lost a little since I have cable television.
So you made excellent work not out of love but out of fear?
Okay  and so I assume you feared them and  and -- Well  I mean  you know  at that time that was the  way before the war  we didn't fear them because they were not  they did not have any real power Right. --
And then -- It was just  you know  very scary to see the way  you know  the Germans were all over the city  you know.
No  because he was afraid that the whites -- the -- the w-w -- the whites would take offense if I invited Martin Luther King.
I was not afraid of being detected because I was only afraid of the Poles  I was not  the Germans wouldnt know the difference  thats a f act.
When the Korean war broke out  London was no longer an option  he was afraid of Europe and so on  Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 169and he decided and and I wanted to go to to New York   to America.
We were afraid of the Germans coming here  here as   as occupiers but plus  at that time  I was already in love with Lotte.
I -- I -- I wish I -- I wish I had written  I was always so afraid that if I write  and somebody sh-should come on e day  if something could happen.
Because all the babies had whooping cough and I was afraid more of whooping cough than of the ba -- bombs.
Yes  certainly  and at the time W. Brandt was already out and had tried several times to become Chancellor and had a lot of problems and I was leading a campaign for him in France  for W<B< I would like to go back for 1 second to the moment of the slap  were you afraid ?
And I later learned that my mother came back and said to my father  I dont really understand this country  but Im afraid that Guidos teacher may be a prostitute.
I was just as afraid from my comrades and from my sergeant as much as  as I was from the Germans.
They were so sure that we are so afraid that we will not hide it.
I'm afraid to go in ghetto  I'm afraid to walk  they're going to kill me like everybody they killed.
So we had talks  and then they -- he said  well  dont fear us  because we are just in the army  and if we dont do it  what we are supposed to do  we get killed in our -- our own country.
And  you know  I wasnt afraid of the devil  you know.
And my grandfather w as afraid that she would smother the baby.
The worst part of it was the fear  you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the sa lient points were in that home where I just didn't know where anybody was.
And didnt didnt say much  because they are afraid  you know  their they were afraid.
And I was afraid to go in downtown or in the streetcars without star on...on my coat--because was still uh spring  and I was wearing still a coat.
I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski  who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in ghetto.
Everybody was afraid to say something because we didn't know what was going to happen  so whatever they gave us we just made it enough.
I wanted the world to know what Hitler did  but 01:50: I wasn't sure how it was going to affect young children and I always was afraid that they might see movies of my experience in Majdanek.
So he got in contact with a girls' Gymnasium 06:03 too and they permitted me  not to attend classes  first of all I didn't speak the Hungarian  they were afraid  you know  for me to go  but they gave me some lessons to learn and I could go and pass exams  and so I continued my education past the sixth grade.
Mm  mm-hm  I understand what youre saying  but my answer on that would be this  I was so afraid being that I wasnt born here  and I have an accent that Interview with Helen Goldkind February 21  2001 54somehow another my children m-might suffer from it  that I will not be able to guide them  you know  to the right pl aces and do the right things.
They were very nice to me  but I was still very much afraid.
She was afraid that he might hear the little baby crying  so she passed me back to Annie.
Didn't deny it but didn't identify it because I was afraid of what's going to happen here  that it could happen here.
I apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure.
When I came home  I was afraid to tell my father I was listen I was going to listen his pitch  so I told my father ahead theyre saying about its going to happen like this.
>> Bill Bens on: And she's also afraid she might sing an -- a Jewish song.
Interview with Edith Langer 27 So you were afraid of them.
And that may be because my past was so terrible and that was influencing my thinking because the Israelis  they were not scared  they were very courageous and they were not afraid of anything.
And it wasn't long  I don't know  maybe five minutes  maybe less  I don't -- when he came back and -- and we heard him shout and I was just sweating with fear.
Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning  and you were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing.
This I remember  and they were always sounding the sirens because of the fear of the attacks from the air  and so  I was watching the women.
And finally  probably she was  I don't know  afraid that we will wait maybe longer  \ I don't know \  she did come  she did go to a  we did go to a  she took us to the yard and there was a bunch of stones  a heap of stones laying.
So  there was a period of time when we were afraid to walk the streets  you know  how big is whole Poland.
But then this Russian came and we were scared of them.
So thats many people died because of this  but see  I am the first one thats not afraid to tell about.
And  uh  even the people who lived there as our renters were afraid to live in the house what belonged to Jews.
Did -- were -- was there any hesitation or fear that maybe you were wrong  or -- No.
The childrens were afraid  the childrens were  Mama save  Mama save for later  save for tomorrow  save  save.
We are afra id to be around it  we are afraid to being taken by train to -- it was the camp  th-they didn't know what exactly ar e doing in this camp  bel -- in Belzyce  that was the closest camp  and was only camp they kill  so they -- we were afraid to go to Belzyce.
And there was a fear of bombing of the city and so we would go into the shelter.
They came and we was laughing and crying  we thought we saw our parents - we didn't know what to do with ourselves.
You dont give men whom youre going to put rifles in their hands  and whom you may not entirely trust  alcohol to drink  for fear of nothing else that theyll shoot each other  or theyll shoot you instead of the people theyre supposed to shoot.
Now  we we re afraid that they what we heard about in in when we were in still in in our home country  that the SS took civilians in the forest and they killed them in the forest.
But the fear is there and  you know  when I would say \ Mom  where are Interview with Pepi Schafler 44 they gonna send me?
I had tremendous USHMM Archives RG -50.030*370 9 problems as a te enager and as a young woman because my father was afraid of temperament.
Well  they were trying to  the Germans  to find out how much time and what kind of power it will take to cont rol a situation like this  because they were afraid for the balance of the Jews.
No  it wa first of all  it was fear  not just for the babys survival  but for the adults survival  what would happen with a pogrom  with the killings  that we have to go into hiding.
And they were afraid at that time for public opinion and they let it go and they made a deal at that time I think  with the Hagannah  I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 80dont know exactly the deal they made with th e Hagannah  so the people  they -- they ask the people to disembark and they put them in a camp in -- near Hamburg.
They say you have to leave because we are afraid to keeping you here any longer  so I got dressed and I put my arm band and I went...took the streetcar to my hometown where my brother was laying there.
Because they was afraid that there were most of the prisoners are sick.
And thats what gave me invigorated me not to be afraid.
And I was rushed in very quickly by my step mom  quickly into the room and I dont know  I think I hid under the bed from fear or what have you.
And when were you aware of Hitler himself for the first time?
But the health is a problem and everybo dy was afraid every day somebody was  family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment  uh special uh formation to dig uh fortification and many people didn't come back.
They always are afraid to do wrong because they dont want to hurt the parents.
He was uh uh he was  he had a...he was deathly afraid of typhus.
We had  we did our thing even when the only thing we were afraid  that we would be sent away and nobody knew where youre going to be sent.
And I wasn't afraid because I knew he was not going to say anything.
Anyhow  to make the long story short  this man br ought me a book of poetry and told another soldier to close the door  and brought me a few sandwiches that I took to my father and to my aunt and to my sister in the ghetto  and he was beside hims elf  he was so brainwashed that he was beside himself that the Jewish y oung girl can talk to him intelligently  can explain to him  can cite poetry  can read  and he gave me the book  but I was afraid to take it.
In fact  would you believe that later  you know  in the '50s  I was afraid to go back to the building where we originally were living because I owned one third of it  and they would have calle d me a capitalist  you know?
See that time I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by the rats.
Were you afraid at all th at -- at that moment when they shot -- shot at you?
The Germans  when they come in  they were scared of us.
I live in fear  but I manage -- to have a husband who is an optimist and so we have a balance  but I'm very anxious.
Not saving completely but worse time  not of them  we wouldn't be alive  we wouldn't be ablebut being there  very often we were afraid because the Ukrainian police.
So  I was too afraid to talk to anybody except what I was reading in the papers.
Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 49Or in the first Gulf War with the scuds coming ov er  and everybody kind of hiding  and I felt no fear.
They were also afraid for their lives and of course they were ones -- I think once I remember that they caught my mother some place and 01:14 they took away a ring from her and they said if she doesn't give the ring they will bring 5 her to the Gestapo or something like that.
Anyway  then was talking there will be aktion again because they were afraid  the people.
I dont -- Im not afraid of difficulties or whatever  but not my mother.
And of course I saw with my own eyes  plenty  so maybe they felt its bad enough for a child to see and experience here  but not yet to live with the fear of what is really happening somewhere else  which is probably not true.
Or if I had a fear  I could not talk to my brother at that age.
And I don't want you to walk through them.ﬂ Because it was like um a low-graded neighborhood where they were hiding in  and he was afraid for me to walk there by myself.
He was going slow because he was afraid that the condition of the train  and the people  they were falling off  they can get killed.
And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear because it took the place of fear.
Why did you change your [indecipherable] I didnt want -- I was afraid of guard.
It was so ramshackle that I was afraid the house would fall down.
That's the same  I haven't been in the Yad Vashem even though I was in Israel and I could have gone  emotionally I'm just afraid.
One  we wanted to see what was going on better  but mainly because we we re afraid to be in the building because the mother's just didn't deliver the children on a silver platter.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Bill Benson: Because of the bombings in the war?
It was like I threw the fear down in my feet.
We were afraid  na -- but we are there already  we couldnt turn back.
So they didnt do anything  and they had searchlights that they st opped using  because they were afraid that they were going to bomb -- bomb us.
Fear doesnt go away the minute you open a window and smell freedom.
So he walked out because he was afraid and he didnt tell us  I think he didnt answer  he walked out  thats all.
Other ones were overwhelmed with fear and didn't want to help us.
There Interview with Ginger Lane September 28  2016 39 was this fear  sort of hanging over all of us  that if you dont behave  youre going to be sent back.
I am afraid to tell that I am not a Jew  because later or early maybe they find out that was small world for me.
13 Well  in the start of the mess you know  to put people who had never been in a in a boat before  coming with everything they could have and afraid  first to calm them down.
Now  with NATO  and entering s -- Yugoslavia  Serbs  and everything  I am afraid that may backfire.
But while 01:27: 8 I was walking with them one to the other said  \ Ich glaube nicht dass das ist ein Juedisches Kind\   in German he said I don't believe that this is a Jewish child and this give me such a strength that I recovered myself of the initial fear and when I walked into my mother  my mother saw me  I saw my mother is pale and is dropping like she's falling and my sister and they start to talk to this man at the time  this wife of his just gave birth to the fifth child  and he happens to be home  the husband and he was a high official in Warsaw.
It was only my feeling  but I suppose he was afraid that I was working in the theater with German people.
The children didnt hear it or know that theyre listening because you were afraid.
And yo -- the family that put you up  were th ey -- do you think they were afraid of being caught?
We didn't have any papers  and nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the factory were afraid to talk to us  because if they noticed that they talk to us too much  they took him away.
So the sense of fear  that was unfamiliar to me  was very familiar to my daw sister  and to my mom.
So they must have been Russian s  but probably they were afraid too.
And I  I was afraid in a way  stirring up all those memories  cause I said okay I talk about it  that's fine  but emotionally I'm detached  why stir up this?
We were afraid because the punishment was drastic every time you did something wrong   including crossing the street!
I was never so mu ch afraid because it was not written on my forehead that I am a member of the resistance movement  but here it was enough to look at her.
I'm glad that you came to interview me  that maybe through this tape and my expression somebody will benefit by it and gain by it  but I don't with no one in the world to experience such fear and such pain as I have been through.
But he didn't have a partner of whom to be afraid  so he just turned around and walked away.
And here would have probably [indecipherable] Im going to pause now and change the tape.
Some of them were afraid  used to give me some food  a piece bread  some apple  whatever they had.
So its fear of your neighbors who themselves were afraid of the Germans?
So I came there and she saw me  she says   ﬁLook  I have two children  I am not afraid; I am going  that I want to be together.ﬂ And I told her that I had the offer from Guzik  she says  ﬁWhy dont you take your child and go?!ﬂ I said  ﬁIm scared  I dont know.
And this was very painful for me because I was afraid that the Jews would see that I am Jewish and  and maybe some murmur or whatever  you know  or some approach from  from a Jew.
Because I -- how should I explain somebody that I dont -- I was afraid then for questions and everything.
They would be afraid to go outside  wouldn't let us go outside to play or whatever.
And even though I didnt know exactly what it meant  I was frightened a lot.
In [indecipherable] we -- but we got afraid  its holiday  if you can go on a ship.
Okay  so I went -- I was afraid to go on the bridge  I went through -- the shepherds guys told me where to go through because down there are these whirlpools  so I went by and I went on the other side  I was all alone.
They were not even afraid to set the house on fire if they had suspicions that somebody was there and they could not find him.
And frankly  I was afraid -- I didn't want to stay in Germany; I didn't want to hate that much  and I didn't know where that hatred would bring me to.
And that was very upset and we was very scared what happened.
There was the the understanding was that the Germans were very much afraid of the woods  because there were there was already started a resistance.
To that to the bombing and everything else  the Nilosz which was like the SS in Germany  came in many times to safe houses or basements to people and started killing and letting their angers and fear go to the Jewish people.
They took care of me only because they had afraid of the Bielskis.
So every moment  every step that you did  you had a certain fear in yourself.
And I remember going down on my knees and in front of these two little children and looking at them and they were not afraid of me--I didn't touch them--they were just there  and when I stood up I I did feel a little bit more human  or I did feel that I that the anger and the and the desire for revenge have had left me  I did feel a little bit more human.
And he he wanted he was afraid to face the battle.
Either that  or afraid  because seemingly 100 percent were not necessarily in favor of what was taking place  but it seemed to be the vast majority were.
That they didn't know any more about a concentration camp than we did.
But the difference was that when the Jews were dep -- deported  they knew its -- its a death march  th -- its -- its the end of life  whereas the Germans didnt have to fear that they would be bad -- that they would be killed when they got -- they were deported to Germany.
I didn't even want to take her to the hospital because this way I fear that she thinks I'm throwing her away.
And with the last train we send them back with the women to Wa rsaw  thinking that the safest place would be Warsaw because the propaganda was very high in that time  that Poland is very strong  and she does -- she is not afraid for everybody.
And he told us  \ Don' t be afraid  as long as you are under my jurisdiction.
And when they went they went in war with Germany  a a [indecipherable] there were he he was afraid of the Jewish population because in those days th e Jews were friendly with the Germans  Interview with A. Zalc  L. Ragin  J. Mizrachi July 23  2009 4and they spoke Yiddish  which is an an old German.
But  I mean  the 90 Germans  everybody was afraid of them  because th ey knew that from one moment to the other  they would wrap things up and take people away  and off they go.
So as we were going into the showers I was afraid that those pictures were going to be taken from me.
My aunt was afraid to let him go because at that point so me of the groups were infiltrated by traitors and sometimes children were picked up  taken away  and were never seen again.
So a lo t of people doing it  but you see  is not what is is afraid  he is shaky  he is shameful.
Interview with Susan Berlin March 7  2003 16 My parents were on both side of me   and I did not fear -- I didnt feel I belonged to that group that was being attacked.
So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the Americans and so in a way that is also sort of what happened  but not right away.
I says loo k  my mothers name  I gave my mothers name  my fathers name  dont be afraid.
Uh  we had a girl who did the home-work [t he housework]  a maid...sleeping-in maid...and we had somebody else who tended the store  and  uh  she also had a room in the house  so we all were down on the floor and  uh  it was...it was a very fearful something  because you felt the fear from your parents and  uh  yah...it was a very unpleasant  unsettling  fearful time.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ETA HECHT page 16 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Christian family was a colleague of his so he knew I was with Mr. Losouskas and where I was  he knew exactly the address and everything but apparently he must have been afraid that in case this was found by a German they would be able to  to find me  they would be able to locate me.
So my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there  without children  a nice old Jewish poor people.
Obviously  she was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of school if she does something else.
And I know that there was some tension  be cause there was a fear that you had that if it was understood that you had gone underground  that your parents might get in trouble.
A couple days I stayed in the camp and then I went to work back  because you were afraid.
There was too much chaos  too much fear  and my mother was the barometer.
I mean  what father would want -- would want his son to be in that place where youre afraid to open your mouth  right?
So  I didnt have this immediate fear that somebody very close that we loved was burned in the crematorium  and yet it was so horrible to think  so horrible to think of how many people who ne ver experienced life  who were either teenagers or even little children who came to this world never had a future  and its just heartbreaking  now that Im an adult and I am a mother and a parent  and I see how many innocent lives have been lost because of Nazi madness.
It really what we suspec ted  what we were afraid  now  you know  came to fruition.
Uh Harry didn't like this at all because in these unsettled times he was afraid that people would steal whatever little he had left  but uh reluctantly he uh evacuated the family to a cousin of of his wife's.
So  with all the fear in your heart  and other people also received  so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill kkept going  did you receive  did you receive  I did receive  I didnt receive  why didnt that receive  what will happen.
Sa -- so we were very much afraid  maybe -- figured maybe something is wrong  and they would ship us back or something.
They couldnt take over Rybnik  they get stopped over there  and then -- [indecipherable] -- a-an -- and they were afraid.

But we were afraid they should leave and we started to beg them  ﬁDon't leave us  but maybe there are some still hidden in the -- in the woods and they could come and -- and hurt us.ﬂ So they said  ﬁDon't be afraid  we -- the -- the French camver all man ﬂ this was a man's camp.
So -- so I was -- theres always that -- that lingering concern  as it we re  on my mind you know  and fear as well  that I may be discovered.
So  tell me what was in your head wh at were you afraid of at that moment?
I think on one occasion I encountered a wild boar  but I think the boar was more afraid of me than I was of him  because he ran away but scared me.
There were police outside because they were afraid of neo -Nazis.
And they escorted us at gunpoint to a central meeting point  a railroad station in town  where we were thrown together with several hundred othe r Jews like us  who were huddled in fear fear and not knowing what to expect.
So I was afraid if I was going to undress before doctors  they'll recognize that I was Jewish.
I had to fly in becau se I was afraid she will not pass .
He was so afraid of me that you have no idea.
I had no fear because I knew that they liked me  you know  this Mr. Madritsch liked me and he was there with the with a group inspecting the factory at that time.
When the German army came close  we were afraid  I remember still at that time that we thought  oh  we will not survive the war  this -- because we cannot fight tanks  and -- and -- and cannons will come back  a organized army.
So finally he took me and we got out of the trolley car because he was afraid that we would get in trouble.
My mother wo -- as I said  I was very connected to her as a young child  I was afraid to leave her and yet she was -- I mentioned that too  she was very strict as -- very strict  a real disciplinarian of the old school.
He organized this way  so on the night of May the 7th  to 9  to 9  to May the 8th  we disarmed 12 o clock at night all the soldiers  and we put them in the cellar  and we kept them till the Russians came in on the 11th of May  we were protecting the camp ourselves  we put our own people on the towers  and we kept the guard the inmate  and we closed the camp because we were surrounded with over 100 000 German sold-soldiers around because they were be tween the American  French and English troops on the West Side  and the Russian troop on the East side  and we were just in the center of the whole mess  and we put a big sign  \ Typhus inside \  so nobody could enter because the Germans were afraid that the typhus could be spread  and we put -----------because nobody---  and they lib--we were liberated by ourselves  but officially on May 11  the first Russian soldiers entered the camp.
And we had gas masks and fire   but there were some  many people were afraid that would be an invasion of England.
And however  you know we had  of course I always had a great --------------  so I was not particularly religious  I had a great deal of respect for religion and books  and um  one of the things I wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father  I wanted to I  I knew what would happen in the ghetto  you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June  and um  I asked a friend of mine to go with me and collect uh prayer books  you know  I  I was afraid when they'll find it  they'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that.
But then  when we were told that we are liberated  we are free  we dont have to be afraid  well  I ran in -- you know  I was in the street and I ran in to give them the good news.
Went to school  but I also went to the Music Academy and I was sort of ﬁnon-childﬂ prodigy  because everybody was afraid of that word  so I didn't have that kind of a push from home.
Because we -- then th ey told us that we looked so ho rrible  that they were afraid.
But it was dark and I was  as I mentioned before  I was only 13 when the war broke out and this was earlier  so I was afraid to go down .
Because Interview with Jerzy May 8  2013 9 there is a big gap in his history  which I suspect that is not to mention anywhere  because it for afraiding yeah  they were afraid of talking about this  after the [indecipherable] in 69  or something like that.
So  at the certain moment you feel that -- y-you are afraid be -- the adults are talking about the war.
and uh  they didn't even look at me  and they were afraid to say anything  and was sort of strange  they have to recognize me.
They were afraid  you know  very afraid that we will do something Yeah.
And then  when I got to New York  in those days  they didn't let young women off ships because they were afraid of white slavery.
But I was afraid by the unknown of the human people.
I mean  I had not hing to fear with the Germans  and I had no reason to dislike the Germans  except what I had heard  all these el egant people around my mother say -- some of them -- some of them of course were Jews  because you know  most of the -- most of the theater people really were Jewis h  and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot of newspaper friends  there were a lot of Jews.
What -- what set in was hunger and fear  you see.
So so his th ere there was no question in my mind after that little thing  that he was not afraid of of of history  but that he he has done that he has done his best.
The fear was enormous  but you clearly wouldnt have known at the end of the four days -- 76 Oh no  no  no  no  no  no.
Thats  thats  and I said  ﬁIm afraid  Im afraid that your parents arent here anymo re.ﬂ And shed say  ﬁOh  thats right  theyre dead.ﬂ But she wanted  she wanted something  I know  I know what she  she wanted to go back to a place where she was safe.
So in the 30's when Hitler came to power  how aware were you of what was going on in Germany?
Were you afraid for her to find out when you first met her?
The German thought we are very brave but it was no fear in us.
A. The Judenrot they tried to do something fo r the people but the Germans didn't give them a chance.
The second day they came in so naturally  we all start praying  we were afraid.
Those Priests  Roman Catholic  they were marvelous men; but when our community council came to beg them to save our people they said \ We are afraid to get involved.
and she makes so many mistakes  I was so afraid  you know.
All of a sudden  you know  if you thought you were afraid before  forget it .
What did you -- you were af raid  what were you afraid of at that point  do you think?
Do you remember if it was just for you and your sister constant fear?
I was always afraid that she was working too hard even after we came to to the United States.
You live with that pent up anxiety  was a pent up fear that you can be discovered any moment.
But by virtue of being at the end of the line  and not being terribly attuned to realities and not being old enough to understand it all and put it together  I could understand the danger and the fear  but I couldnt relate it to the fact that I was doing anything special  because I wasnt doing anything for anybody.
I wrote that she was only 35 years old but she had showed strength and did not show any fear and my grandmother also.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 10 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: we took them out and I  I mean unfortunately  they didn't survive but at that time I saved them.
There was any great  what is  any great fear about the events in progress.
But we was very 14 afraid for the Germans...for the Germans weren't so nice to the girls.
I also remember that somehow I knew already that not everybody came out of the showers  so every time we were lined up like this  I remember that fear  li ke oh my God  is this the last time?
So uh my mother was paying them whatever  and then after a while these people were also afraid  so they wouldn't keep my parents any more so my sister  she took my other sister by one hand and my mother by another  and they went into the mountains and they traveled on foot without shoes  you know--that's the kind of stuff--through  well there were no roads.
So I never had their fear  I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the United States  previous to the war  was a butterfly  and every time there was a butterfly flying around  it was my grandmother up there watching out for us.
But my father was -- my -- my mother was very interested in -- in sports  though not just spectator sports  but she did a lot also to entice me to -- I was originally totally averse to any sports  I didn't like it and often was afraid of things and she had a tremendous energy and -- and sort of practically forced me how -- to learn how to swim  to ski and to skate  I mean ice skate and bicycle.
I was too inexperienced and I was too young and I was too afraid of it.
So my mother  too  ha d no -- absolutely no fear of these people.
Now  when we come here  I was going to to turn  but then  I was afraid that this army camp is here  the Germans can see me see us  and start to run after us.
And they were afraid I was going to start on them.
I remember we were afraid and we didnt sleep in the house and yet they didnt do anything.
I dont wear it anymore  Im so afraid it will rip or I hide it away.
Because they are afraid  the front comes close...near  so they went into the woods because to be safer.
01:09:46 Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it?
He was hiding all the time  you know  because he was afraid of that he going they going to arrest him.
>> Bill Benson: In an absolutely astonishing way you left Auschwitz.
My mother didnt like the idea of going up to the mountain  but also  she didnt want to abandon our supplies for fear that -- that they will be stolen again  although we had to change rooms because this man not only he resented the f act that we called him a thief  especially after we found things hidden in his house  but he asked us to leave because we insulted him.
And so we were already afraid and we were already worried about our safety.
And if you worked on the fear  based on the fear the other had for you  then you somehow could get away.
Whenever we used to stand in line  they used to point out a Jew and they used to drag us out of the lines and every once in a while they used to come in to our houses and take away some people and...it was a very scary time for us  especially for the young people  because we didn't know what [they would do]...we were afraid they'll come and take our parents away always  every time we saw a German  and we had to walk around [them] [and] we had a curfew.
And so when I opened my fear was always that I sat in the vacuum and mommy and Gitta are de ad.
And they wear the red hat that Turkish wear  and I think they were Turkish  and I used to be afraid of them so much.
I didn't want to have children because I was afraid that another war would come one day  and that my children shouldn't have to live through the same thing I did  and then I said  \ No  I have to show the terrible people who wanted to kill us all  that they cannot kill a race  and I have to build a new family because they took my family away.
And then one time something happen ed which is a little bit funny but at the same time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave me  made me a little bit anxious.
But when we on -- when we were in the village  we did not allow the villagers to go in the direction of the city  because we were afraid that they will betray us  you know.
It was turmoil  it was fear  when they were moving so ferociously  and so  you know  w-with bombardments  as I explained to you before  and with heavy artillery  and then they were -- they entered Lvov without damaging anything  because the Poles did not oppo -- not the Poles  the -- the Soviets did not oppose  did not resist -- did not resist 55 the entrance of the -- of the Germans.
When you say you were afraid when you saw them  what -- Y-You -- what you were afraid of  you were afraid of what you didnt know.
Im afraid to start all over again  but yet  we had the strength to do it  and all we were thinking is how to improve the world  how to make things better for our children.
So people were what -- what -- probably afraid in Austria that -- and ask me why I came back  and considered to come back.

Go.ﬂ I am afraid to look back  but whose calling Cywia?

In your opinion  do you think American Jews might ever be in danger from neoNazis or skinheads?
Now there were some people that had  but didnt want to show that 97 they have  so they didnt give  and -- cause they were afraid for themselves  maybe.
And frankly its not really related to the Holocaust  but all because its -- its -- its Russia and its France  but the oppression and the fear and all that  and -- and we both sa id we were so happy that we didnt see it with anybody else but each other  because we both knew exactly how we felt and what disturbed us and what -- you can never get rid of that fear.
The slums were a good place  a safe place for people like us to be there b ecause the police were afraid to get in there.

And later on  or even if they were  they were afraid to open the doors.
There  there  there was no air  there was a small little window with wires th at were over the windows so that nobody could escape  and we went that like that for maybe 3 or 4 days  I don't know how many days we went  in between the  the  the  we were riding  the trains had to stop because the sirens would come on  and uh  and then they wouldn't ride the trains when th e sirens were on  and then we would start again  and we  and people were getting very  very restless  and very nervous  and they got upset with one another  because their tension of uh  of uh  of patience was running out  so they started arguing with one another  and uh  and fighting  and there was noise  and all of the sudden  the German put his rifle in  in the window and he was just shooting at  at bland  at people  and then he hollered we should be quiet  and he shot 2 or 3 people that way  and we settled down  naturally  because we were afraid that we were going to get shot.
I was...I wasn't afraid 9 because the Mayor of the city had a car.
The first time I was afraid  that happened when we were in that movie  that was the first time and from that time he was very annoyed and he says  \ That's it.\

Do you think that there are any -- I mean in -- in raising kids  given what happened to you  and -- and the -- the fear that you had to live with  did you ever feel like there were -- and again  this is the kind of thing thats probably hard to separate  cause every parent is protective -- Mm. --

And I came to him  he said  ﬁYeah and I was afraid to tell you.ﬂ So as adjusted our family is and as we are very Nesse Godin 72 December 14  1995 Page 72 different.

And we were a little already nervous  because we were already put our documents  and we were afraid somebody can know about it  so it was not but Nida  that was something special.
In Lithuania Im actually afraid of my life  51 because even wa -- even though I was very young  I know the town.
But I want to come back also  because I said fear  fear  fear Thats right.
I was always afraid to -- that there will be --a bomb will be thrown in  or fire  because I remember some of my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 46friends family were put in the synagogue  and let -- and burn ed to -- the synagogue  bur -- and burn in the synagogue.
But I dont know that anyone  these days  in this country  Im not sure that we would have to fear a Holocaust.

I mean  wa -- was it -- was it a -- was it fear  distance  curiosity  wha -- how did it make you feel?
I had been afraid to go to Poland before I retired because I was working in defense industry  but then after I retired and Gorbachev came to power or something  we decided to go and visit Lwow.
Windows were open and I was supposed to go to sleep  and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feel ing of fear surfaced all over ag ain.
And I said to sar -- to my sister  I says -- and then I even slept with her in the same bed because I was afraid some of these Russian prisoners were going to  you know  rape her or do something.
They hanged her and they let her hang on a windy day  very windy  and she was dinging three days and three nights and we were afraid to look at it.
Yes  great comfort  and to think now I'm afraid of my own shadow.
And we couldnt go out  becaus e they were rounding up children in the street  they were rounding up people  they were rounding you know  and they had these ratzias as they called them  they roun ded up people  so my parents didnt th-th-they were afraid to let us out in the street becau se or themselves  for that matter  because they knew that these Bolivian passports you know  they they were safe th-there was talk that the we would be exchanged for prisoners.
So when we came to Warsaw we came to a beautiful apartment  friends of mine parents were still....on the summer house because it was summer in Europe and we...this was   and we took their apartment  but we didn't remain too long in this apartment because the Polish army moved in...in the building with the...you know  so we were afraid.
And never in my life I was so afraid at that -- this moment.
There was just this fear  this schnell  schnell  schnell  and no food  and the hunger and the beatings and the screamings at night.
There was not a day I was not afraid for my life.
Probably my parents did  because they were so much afraid of transportation.
The people who were not a rrested and who were friendly towards the Soviet Union  didn't feel that they had anything to fear.
But this was the second time that my mother almost lost me and it was very frightening for -- for her.
I was afraid to go back to Brussels because I hadn't carried out what Mom told me to do.
But I heard a lot of rumors that he was...he was  in between the time that you could do some business  he was afraid for the Polish money.
Then we start to run down fast  you know  we are afraid.
And he said  \ I am afraid when they continue talking them on the Ninth fortress my closest friend  the most respected former member of parliament  Ga rfunkel  can commit suicide  and you have to rescue him.
Why I was afraid that when he said that \ What did you do wrong \  because I still had the letters which I didn't have time to deliver.
Were you afraid at all or nervous that they would find  that they would check up on your story about having been an officer in Poznan and find out about your identity?
They would have been happy to get the Jews go  but the Jews weren't ready to go then?
You are afraid to move out here well  from the house.
And at that moment  as I said  when we walked home I told my Interview with John Lang October 15  2010 12father I was afraid for my life.
They killed more people in the forest  yeah  because they knew and they were not afraid to go in the forest  inside.
And the Germans...there were...there were fifty in this railroad...in this other train  looked at us and they didn't move because they were afraid and I mean there was no satisfaction on their...they could have shouted dirty Jews  which happened later on  but nothing   and suddenly a German woman was running on the platform with a container with water and her husband behind her who wanted to restrain her and the soldier went after her and she didn't stop.
And the reason for it being is that the Latvian and Estonians and Lithuanians had great hopes for having independent -- you know  want to be independent of Russia  you know  they always been an -- you know  under the Russian thumb  as it were  you know  and so maybe that -- somehow they felt that that would be some way of -- of maybe getting Germans to give them some independence.
They came  not only that they came  15 people  bu t there three children in the age of five to maybe nine and I was so afraid that they may cry or say something loud.
But when you walked on the streets  wasn't there a certain element of fear  a certain element of risk?
The peasants at night havethey used to take out their horses to feed them  and they wereso we were afraid to cross them.
Five years occupation is a lot  and -- especially in the last part was a ve ry hard one  and you were afraid.
We realized it from the very beginning  and I do remember there was no fear of not having enough food  because you see  uh we had gotten bread and French...and especially those of us who had been in Vernet had been hungry  oh there was plenty of bread  apples  and I think even pate  French pate in big...in big...so there was no...we were not...I wasn't afraid of uh of starving  at least at this moment  but...and also with the water.
People were afraid because they said if you don't give it to us now  when we arrive they will search you and shot you.
Bad food is in all institutions  one of the main cause for trouble  because people dont have so many things to fight about  and they let out all their hostility  their fear  their anxiety  on food.
So  there were few killings between the peri od between the time we got into the ghetto and went to Riga Kaiserwald to the concentration camp  but it was still the fear everyday.
we were all scared  so Im really not sure where the fear came out of  but the fear was constant  you know  thats constant  of being discovered  of being you know  seen  of being left behind  of being killed  you know.
The gentile com  the gentile girls who were supposed to go into the Olympics they had their own meets which I was not  not admitted and I think the whole deal was just if I did fairly well they would not throw me out because they were still afraid that the boycott would happen so I think no matter what I did  I was pretty safe at that point  even the  you know in Munich when I did not do too well  they couldnt  they couldnt afford to throw me out at that point because they were still afraid the Americans wouldnt show up.
I was afraid of them  but we just stayed away from them as much as we could.
RL: Im afraid -- SL: But the only thing -- the only thing I want to go back  I want to go to see my fathers grave.
There was a little town not far away  where from time to time people were summoned for various reasons  and there was always a great deal of trepidation and fear attached to that  because you didnt know it was usually somebody that they either want ed to recruit for some other work  or it was some oth or they suspected somebody of being what they called the bourgoi you know  before the war  and they wanted to look into it.
There was a lot of sewage people working  you know  sanitation  because the toilets had to be -- the outsi de toilets had to be cleaned regularly because of fear of epidemic  so that traffic was going.
And uh I stayed there and I don't know how long - maybe a few weeks or a few months and helped her  which was was a welcomed changed but there was also this fear that maybe my mother and my brother would be caught or that I would be caught  so...I mean...it was very very tense is all I can say and very fearful.
And all of a sudden he came to the girl  and he start to talk to her  and she get [indecipherable] sudden  she was afraid.
Okay  so these  these  the feelings and that  that  so that involved fear and also it was because during the war  I  I had this real sense that I had to be perfect  that I couldnt make any mistakes  that I couldnt do anything wrong  I mean that was  as long as I just stayed perfect  that wouldnt  I wouldnt be killed.
>> Bill Benson: So at that point  do you recall  through your family or did your father say afterwards there was a tremendous sense of relief or was there fear they would come back?
Well  it was  we would make; it was more lik e fear  it was different.
So we reall y  up until 1944  we had a great deal of anti-Semitism  we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives.
So -- so there was a kind of fear -- Yeah. --
>> When you finally reached London and you were 13  did you have the fear of maybe having the same as when you were under the Russians or under the Germans?

And not just fear spelled out normally but with a major capital letter.
My father at that particular time was afraid continuing with the work that he was doing over there  so we decided we are 13 going to go to the forest; which  this going to the forest would build up the future later  serving as a base  that I knew the roots of how to escape from the ghetto  although we didn't do it with that in mind  but it turned out to be  yesterday's bad things turned out tomorrow's safety and so on.

And so I got to school  and they called me into the deputy director of the school  with my mother  and they said  oh  you cant come bac k. And Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 90 my mother said you know  I was probably afraid of the guy my mother said  why not?
There was no such a thing as not being...there was no such a thing as not having fear.
So my mother was afraid  and my father didn't know the language.
No  I didnt go back  bu t not because of any fear of being overcome by emotions  but simply for the following reasons.
The Jews had fear here  because there was a Father Coglin who was on the radio constantly  telling [indecipherable] and was very anti-Semitic in -- in the 30s and -- and in the 40s.
I have never  neve r  never experienced a night of fear  that I did on that night  never.

If they want to be independent or if they want to be annexed to uh into Germany  and Hitler obviously was afraid what uh the result of the and two days later or twenty-four hours later  German troops rode in and uh goose-stepped into Vienna and from uh my parents'  or our apartment I should say to uh...we could uh...we lived on one of the main thorofares and we could see Hitl er's troops marching in and his tanks rolling in and Hitler standing in the back of his uh car  his armored ca r  with the Nazi salute and greeting and the Austrians were enthusiastic about it.
In fact one of my little sister was just grazed  and she pushed them from one side to the other  and she was also afraid to push them because in case the sand start coming down but the Germans thought the sand was coming down from their picks.
They were afraid of being recognized  thats how -- and  you know  ﬁWhat?
And s o  I just... a college had to accept me on my word  and apparently they were afraid to do that.
So I told him  I did some fast thinking  but I was full with fear.
So I was really afraid in a time like that can happen anything with you.
Was no reason  really  in my mind there was no reason to be afraid.
So they were afraid they're going to come back and get it back from them.
And these people came from the Ukraine  and they came here to Radom  and they came on the police  and I was afraid somebody would recognize me.
So I was hiding out in the heap of dead bodies   because in the last week when they have ----------------at all  the bodies are just building up higher and higher  and I sneaked into among those dead bodies because I was afraid they'd come back or something.
And  uh  in fear of not being punished  I hid it under my mattress.
He didn't have to be afraid that they come and take his father.
Maybe they jumped out  out of fear  when they saw the troops.
All that boiling water and soap  we didn't have soap  so we made soap ourselves  they couldn 't call the doctor because they were afraid.
I still remember I was rooted by fear   and I had an immediate impulse for flight.

Pela used to go every Sunday to church and she learned how to pray and how to act and uh then in the meantime of course our daught er developed from those wonderful things that she had around and the food she had  she developed tuberculosis and uh Pela took her to the hospital in Warsaw because uh men were afraid to  to travel.
But  of course  Venice and Fiume are pretty close and they were afraid that some people from Fiume would recognize them there  or [indecipherable].
But I was really really afraid of her and I think what scared me the most was at night when she...she would just take me over to this little cubicle and she'd say  \ Now get down on your knees and let me hear your prayers.ﬂ And then she would just turn around and leave and then all the lights were shut off  and I was left completely in the dark there.
Did you take any abuse on the street from othe r kids  or where you afraid at all being on the streets?
She was afraid  and those the reasons I was working later on in two firms.
Because we figured its not a very good idea  you know  we were -- well  were not afraid really  but we feel we better lay off  let it -- let it cool off a little bit before we start again something.
And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream no  night dream I was dreaming about ho rrible things and I was a afraid of getting out of the of the bed.
Do you have any memories of what was going on in the community to your community that caused this fear in you?
I think I want to stop now and change the tape  cause -- [indecipherable] -- I dont want to start.
And my father was afraid that I'll be taken away from there  so he found out from a chemist that there is some kind of powder that in large amounts it make bombs  but in very  very small amounts it colors you  like  you would have like symptoms of hepatitis  you'd become all yellow and feverish  and you know places like that were terrified of having an outbreak  and he knew that if I get that  I would be taken straight to the Jewish General Hospital where he was on the staff.

It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the regime and they stopped circulating it.
He just tear my dress to pieces  and of course  I froze because I am afraid of dogs  like especially touch  you know  the mean dogs that bark so  and the teeth were so bad  and he stopped at him at a certain time and started again.
Was it -- did you have to overcome your own fear to go do that?
I told them that I am from Czechoslovakia and so  but only the truth  because I knew that they have been so afraid  as I was  because their 11 life was not guaranteed.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006 85 Ive been told that there were Jewish leaders who went out of their way to lobby Washington not to let European Jews into the country  back in the late 30s  early 40s because they were afraid of pogroms here and -- and the backlash cause of the depression  that there would be all thes e immigrants coming over and taking jobs away from Americans and -- Well  you see  that started the trouble in Germany.
Only had the sister's...the sister's hus band was a alcoholic  and they was afraid that being a alcoholic he can start babbling  you know  and telling.
The -- the partisans [indecipherable] if you left the city you expose yourself  because they were there to -- to hit and kill as ma ny Jews as they could -- thats many Germans as they could.
I am afraid of my shadow  you know  that kind of a situation.
If I knew I would stow it away because if any German would notice he would kill me.
I never forget  we tied quickly the bed bread a nd wu instead of carrying bread  were pushing it into our pants  you see  because were afraid that well be hungry tomorrow.
I should ha ve been instead of being afraid  I used to think it was sort of very exciting to have these battles going on  and thinking it was quite great fun to sleep down in the cellar where there were always some frogs jumping around.
And so it's c ouldn't even enter or sleep there because after the extermination  which took place in   it was smelly and we were afraid to sleep indoors because we had the impression that's the sa me gas they have used for the extermination  but they've used on  on humans  so it took awhile until the whole barrack was allowed  of us  we were able to enter  to breathe  to sleep and to work.
I wasn't afraid  but I was still...had plenty of fear and there were a whole group of Danish  young men going to out of Canada to do farming  farm work and...uh...I attached myself to them because I spoke the Danish language and I felt they were....The Danes...I owe...I owe the Danes a lot.
And the greatest fear was to hear the knock on the door.
The other ones were afraid  you know  its cold  they didnt want to  not all of them  ninety percent washed.
But  you see  thats how the ripple of fear goes to -- to 1990.
She was afraid of losing the kids and separating from the children.
I was afraid...be afraid take my wooden shoes off because the swelling was over...like over-flowing my shoes.
They were afraid to keep them because even though Lutek  his Polish was perfect  but he had Semitic looks  which is true by the way.
Its true  its a democratic country  and its  I think to me  its the most -- the greatest country in the world  but its also frightening for me  even though I live in a democratic  free  beautiful country  why am I always afraid  why am I always worried?
We were being protected from the allies  right  I -- and well  actually  I had absolutely no fear of the planes.
Several times  actually  and when the worry about this became so great that we were afraid to be in the cellar -- again  I dont know whose idea it was  I dont know how the grown-ups planned this and talked about it  but it was decided that we should hide under this display window in this three foot wide stretch that was under -- that -- that was  you know  probably three feet off the ground and three feet wide  but maybe 10 or 18 feet long.
You know  it was often an ir ony to me  that when the Germans took us into the concentration camp a year later  the Soviets had done such a job on me that I was not able to be mo re shocked  more afraid.
Well  shes -- just [indecipherable] is a very educated woman  and she was a very [indecipherable]  not afraid of nothing  ever since she was a little baby.
They also suffer and cry and shake when there is fear  and often would do anything for me as I have few friends like this  like these non-Jews  I refuse to acknowledge that I am so mehow the chosen smarter  more talented  better and more adept than my fellow citizens  or good friends  non-Jews.
After two weeks the lady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the house because the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found in their house that their house will be burned and the family will be killed.
And I became obsessed that he should ne ver be separated from me for a moment  because I was afraid of what was going to happen.
Afraid that any moment wi a German was going to sh-shoot in where or what direction.
So my sister and I were so afraid that they will shoot us on the spot but they didn't.
They didnt have a fear of losing their lives or their mothers or fathers or their cousins or their - you know friends.
And very few mementos because I remember that before we left our house and went to the ghetto  we were afraid to take the pictures and then we were destroying them so th ere was nothing there left.
We we tried to tell her  you know  that there is no reason to be afraid  but sh-she just listened and we saw that she she just doesnt believe us  and she was right.
And I was always afraid to go to that room  because there was one wall was the glass  the opposite wall was composite of doors.
I was always afraid  she was strict wi th me  because the time was -- you know  I was [indecipherable] you know.
One is  what do you remember as your time of greatest fear during all of the Holocaust and war time?
And how we did it  because we were afraid about neighbors still.
Im not afraid  but I would be more concerned about the process than the end result.
And later  he told u she was also afraid someone might snitch on him for other activities.
He was afraid that the Greek custom officials would see it  or the American custom officials would 45 see it  and what would they say  so he burned it without asking my permission for it.
I might have heard the name but I think I was protected from hearing too much being afraid about too much  because again the atmosphere and the thought must have been at that time that it wasnt going to be so easy for the Nazis to overtake Europe the way they did.
I dont know what she did  but oh  I was so scared  dont ask.
So it's a very...uh...complicated thing to look back as this... something is in the...in the human race or 43 in the nature where a living animal recognizes the weakness  but for the human race to...to be without any feelings that th e other person is the same...that I walked around the street and was afraid for every human being.
Yeah  end of January he got the divorce and then I moved into his flat  but I didnt want to get married  not before -- I was afraid of the bureaucracy and all that.
They wanted the world to know and to fear that whatever they did is by law.
And he says  my God  arent you afraid youre gonna break your leg or something?
They are afraid we were taking jobs that Americans would ha ve.
I'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here  right here  and I was afraid to go  and I don't know what I did but I put a piece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just healed up and I used to go to work  and I used to be sick.
Like you said you feared when your husband was late  do you still or does a knock on the door ever trigger a fear or a siren?
Big laughter in the room and I laughed most hilariously of course.
At the same time one of the musician friends was afraid for the so he was able to have well  in the very early time  when Holland was not invaded yet  he had a suitcase sent to Holland and then forwarded to me  with some clothing and papers and photos.
And were you frightened when you saw the Germans come in  the Wehrmacht come in?
In Italy  everybody knew that she was Jewish and they were afraid of deportation.
I was afraid to move to where we eventually had to move.
My mother and father were very pr otecting of  of me  so  we were not allowed to uh  I was not allowed to go outside  other than to my grandparent's home  which was uh 3 doors down  and uh  everybody was afraid.
And finally mine turn did come  I signed papers  did get a nice package of food for and I was no m ore afraid.
This time  the terror of all of us  especially the parents who had to worry about their children and what their condition would be next  the fear was so great that actually no one spoke.
I didn't go to say goodbye to this man because I was afraid if he wants to come with us to the station  he's going to see me walk-walking out with uh with 2 blankets  so I didn't say goodbye  I didn't say thank you  I  I stole those 2--to us th is wasn't stealing  we called it organizing.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 10 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Lets wait because were just about to run out.
They were going after the Germans  so they were bombing us.
But over the decades  that was totally covered with sand  and some of the Nazi Dutch people must have known that  so ha -- they had unearthed that station  and they were afraid to ship us from in The Hague itself  they thought -- and -- they did it in Amsterdam  and there was a big riot  and a fight  that the underground wanted to liberate the people from there.
I -- I go -- I -- I afraid we gonna miss a very important parts.
But I know why they show no interest  they do show interest  but theyre afraid of it.
Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in Boreslawiece except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were  where the...my mother's family lived.
I am afraid because people are hungry  things are unjust for them  and they might turn again  became again some kind of communist or whatever  fascist power come to power and then we start all over again.
I was always afraid my uncle would marry one of them  but he never did.
So they really were afraid unless like that guy who gave us to eat on the Pripet that he knew that he's going to find a whole pot of gold someplace.
So -- 64 Did they talk about what was going on with Jews?
Oh  there was one thing that anti-Semitism probably got to me.
We we been afraid that they going cry so much for us.
You know  when you live through such a traumatic time as the Holocaust  and you know that this people  them  SS and Gestapo and people in uniform mistreated you  sometime you make mistake and even this police was being kind to you  you were afraid.
I told you that life had become full of fear  nervous stom ach  that kind of fear.
And he Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15  2010 91said  the only but he was also afraid  you know  the only thing what I can give you is my no  the pferd.
My two aunts  one from Warsaw  one from Krakow  came to our area  to our house in 1939  when the war broke out because they were more afraid of the German occupation than the Russian occupation.
And then everybody was put in some kind of a quarantine center  because they were afraid of diseases or something.
So  Mother was afraid that they will arrest me b ecause I was the newcomer and they were already there.
I -- my mother always said  ﬁAs soon as you see these black shirts  or the brown shirts marching down the main street ﬂ in Battenberg when we were small  because that was a nest of Nazis  ﬁyou come straight into the house.ﬂ They -- they put a -- a fear into us children.
And a nyway  as I-I walked ahead of him  he sort of pressed the muzzle of his gun in to my back  but somehow at that point I wasn't afraid  I-I-I-I sort of felt that was just a ruse.
Again  while there were many Jews in th e system  they were all afraid to talk about the Jewish problem.
And every day when I would walk from the house to the job  and the I would pass by the soldiers  I would just feel the fear that they might ask if I was a member or not.
Because of the time when they were picking they were picking for the gas chamber  you see  so everybody was afraid but you didn't have no choice.
From 1943 to 1945 I lived in fear they are going to take me away.
There was a situation right in 1945 when they conducted in afraid to walk into the car when they were former prisoners you know.
And other Jews came running and I was afraid that a riot might ensue.
They breaking in  and they started to shoot in th in the on the ceiling  you know  and the kids started to they got th ey scared the first they tried to scare the people  and make a a -- behollah means  you know  with noises and with Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20  2009 28dogs  you know  this was their motive always   to scare the first the people  and to  you know  to make them afraid of them.
I didnt particularly like to sleep on sacks of flour  and I was afraid of the rats.
There were some good Germans who tried  and were afraid of their own lives.
They would always say  ﬁsing and dance because you never know tomorrow what's going to be.ﬂ They are not afraid of anything.
Word had that they escaped but he was so afraid to to be in contact with any of the Jewish.
I was welcome for two months as a -- as a guest  but they didnt want me as a refug ee and I suppose his parents had said -- were afraid they have to look after me or help me or something.
I wasn't that afraid of re jection  or at least I thought that I may not take it that personally.
So there was a certain period of time he did that but after that he pretty much gave that up because he was too afraid.
So he said  please dont repeat what I said because he looks like he was afraid for himself  you know.
And it was very danger -- the situation was not stable to reveal that I am Jewish  because in case the Russians retreat  the Germans come  then they -- Im exposed as a Jew  and they kill me.
Maybe  yes  some houses had cellars but they were hiding and trying to get away from windows and they didn't want to be seen; and there was fear.
Dont be afraid  he underline me  its not to the crematorium.
With my -- In -- in the ghetto  when you went into the ghetto.
I think it was really one great uh feelinlg of fear.
But he was very afraid sometimes because he said I don't know this patient - how much can I do  but nothing happened.
And I accept because you cannot bring -- you cannot change what -- what God designate for each person  but Dad always told us --ﬂ and this is really what he told the family always  ﬁI'm not afraid to die  I had a wonderful lif e and a wonderful marriage and -- and I -- ﬂ he was 63 years old  ﬁand after all  some people live 80 years and they have a miserable marriage or they have no children or they have children that are -- that are in jail or th -- I had everything  I-I have no worries  no financial worries.
And the door from the back part was open because you have guards  they are not afraid you run away  you know.
And it was announced and we lived in fear and then there were cards se nt for each to fill in  because it was a census to be filled in.
I took it on the other hand as an expression of something from the past  wher e I always had to say that I was Jewish  where I always -- you see?
She was afraid of my reaction  at the same time she couldnt control hersel f. So anyway  he sat in there  i-in the other room in a German uniform  cause he was six so mething.
You never know what went on in people's minds  but th e fear was tremendous.
Then I decided this -- I see its dark outside  I have to go out.
And of course the doctors weren't armed  we had to find somebody if we wanted to go to another little town if we wanted to visit a friend or something  we had to find an armed escort to go with us  but I was always afraid of that Hitler youth group  because I don't think they'd stop at anything.
I think Im perfectly honest in saying I was never afraid again.
And I I was afraid  because he could hurt killing me.
This nation became a world leader primarily because of its moral values and innovative science and technology that you can embrace without fear.
And to me she–I mean she was resisting what was going on but in a silent way  but nevertheless she had the heart to think of that Jewish child who might wanted to eat those rolls; she wanted to do some kindness to that Jewish child  but very afraid to talk to me  but she realized she was Jewish.
My father ran away  and then because he was afraid that they will arre st him  I run away and this time I run away to Russia  which later I came back.
I think  yes  there was a certain amount of anger in me.
You know  that was always -- they were such nice people  but they -- most of the time theyre afraid to come out.
Yeah  my parents would park me there and I would be with my grandparents but you know Ive been in therapy and some of the stuff thats co me out you know in the last ten years even would say is that on some people I was afraid th ey were never gonna come back and that they wouldnt take me.
But it's 21 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD legitimate.
And I was so 20 afraid to go out night to do my things.
And I have to come back to the big word 'fear'.
It was in the 1960's and he wasn't a good student and I was afraid by 18 they'll take hi m to Vietnam.
No  th -- and real things happened  it was not simply a -- an anonymous or kind of general unexplained fear.
When I was with my husband  I was not afraid of nothing  nothing at all.
I -- there was -- These are German Jews  or German non-Jews?
We were afraid to move  th at the camp was being mined  that if we take one step  it is going to explode with us.
And when I saw that a letter was too impersonal  too badly written by a prisoner  too much afraid  I pu t some things in.
They were not afraid of the Americans  terrified of the Russians.
We went on the other side and we had to loose our dog because we were afraid he can  they were lo oking for us when we left.
Were there other ways that you personally ran into anti-Semitism after the war?
Then I was caught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the ghetto and handed over to the Gestapo  and they start beating me up.
I was afraid of Germans  I was afraid of Ukrainian police  and I was afraid of the youngst -- young people that might spot me and really take me to Germans  so -- because we were not allowed to walk after dark.
Some people would point out to you and say  if you don't get out of town we're going to tell the Germans and they're going to come and get you.
But in the end they took these people away and -- and then there was -- so we were in the cellar or everywhere -- everywhere and I think I was the only one who wa s asleep  because I was not so afraid as the others -- the others.
I said well we ran away the night before and we were hiding in this home for the night  and they said we don't know but all of a sudden  about three o'clock in the morning  we didn't see no Germans  so we we re afraid because like I said there were (indecipherable) my husband says bombs  it was not bombs.
In the same way -- it was no normals  because it was terror  it was fear  there were -- I don't -- I didn't have any social life.
So -- and the Germans were afraid to go into the forest because they would encounter the resistance.
So now  when they knew the Russians were coming  they were very much afraid and they took that road back.
He said  \ You're in there working in the Hutercar  what are you afraid of?\
What should people  grownup people that were hungry and were afraid  talk to a child that was not their family.
We didn' t want him to because we were afraid  but he said  what is it you want from us Jews?
And I said  ﬁWhy do you want me to do that?ﬂ And he said  ﬁBecause Id like to say some prayers  but Im afraid that they might turn me in.ﬂ Because in the atheistic system in Russia  that wasnt allowed and he was afraid of his USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 18 own son  that he would turn him in.
And that  before you know and I was afraid about army come  but they nobody was running after us  because he was running so fast  this horse Yeah.
Im afraid so  in 1939  before Slovakia Republic was born  March 14 in ‚39  my father got papers to Bolivia  to immigrate.
He didnt like he was afraid of dogs   so we stayed with him for about a few months in Long Island  watching the dog very carefully.
I could not talk before they know that I was Jewish.
Then I kn ew I you dont have to be afraid any more.
We were mostly in fear  so–we didnt–I dont have any recollections.
They were afraid to drive in the field  but they circled it and whoever got up...and there were a lot of us still hidden...whoever got up and surrendered  they shot.
We run and run and  we came to a spot and then we saw a whole bunch of people from Sobibor  and we were happy to see some more people  and  but they were afraid for me  because they didn't that a Dutch woman  you know  that  I will be trad ed  or  you know  and how can I will make it.
And I used -- I remember one time  I say  ﬁWhat are you afraid of?ﬂ I says  ﬁWe all leave  they cant keep the store going  they need us.ﬂ You know  there was six or seven of us worki ng there.
So  early in the morning  before the sun came out -- early  early in the morning -- we took our rug and  you know  with us  and went to sleep in the cave because 7 13 we were afraid that these men might be the enemies and they would find the bunker and kill us.
Some people did get married because they uh  because some of it  you're afraid you not only will take people out to different camp so people didn't want to be separated.
They consider themselves Americans and they love Israel  because I have taken them couple times to Israel.
Why didnt your mother cut your hair  wasnt she afraid not to?
I don't know at this point if I was more afraid of dying of cold and starvation or of being put in jail for breaking our curfew.
So when the war ended  the -- the British w-were afraid that the -- the army of -- a -- of ELAS  which had communist leaders  they were afraid that they might take over  so what they -- what they did is they -- they landed troops in Greece but th-they needed allies who would be their natural allies.
So they were standing guard  guarding us until the until the British arrived; because they were afraid there could be a pocket of Nazis somewheres and  and come back and still kill us.
And then they were uh  um...they were all taken away by Germans  of course.
So th ey asked  oh  these people offered us a deal  but they did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the– Jordan had the best military force  the Arab Legion  trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with  with Israelis.
I didnt want to lie down  I was standing because I was afraid of rats.
So we were afraid that they would take away everything  we will be discovered.
And I didnt want to know anything that I didnt have to know  because I was so afraid th at one day I would be arrested  that they will do -- one of their tortures was pulling you r nails one by one  and then your feet  and anything  I thought I -- only what I have to know  I dont want to know anything else.
So how soon af ter the Germans  do you remember hearing that the Germans had invaded?
And so I sat there absolutely stricken with fear  and I hated that they argued about me like this.
Im still afraid  because of whats happening with -- with this mushrooming groups of hate  what is going to happen?
Do you think that this sens e of fear  you carried this?
Did they fear that there would be some do you think that they were afraid that something would happen to them?
That really used to frighten me terribly and  uh..I think that's why I am afraid of thunder up til this day frankly But..uh..that was one of the things I remember the most.
Did anybody ev in in Chzanow   did your family feel any fear because this was happ For the Germans?
We went to the hospital for the doctor to look at us and I remember the very first time  especially because Rene -- I always felt he was a crybaby and I was afraid that he was going to cry  and I knew that if he cried something terrible might happen to him.
The only thing I knew th at I do recall that I lived in fear  that I was afraid to go out re -- there was no need for parents to restrain me too much to not go on the street  I wouldnt go on my own.
We came to a border like  we landed and they took us off from the boat and whatever they found  a pair Tf illin  it was used for morning prayer  and the Germans found it and said whose is it and na turally everybody was afraid.
They would distance themselves from fear  anger and simply concentrate on what they have been trained to do and I find myself doing that in difficult situations.
I was young enough to just do what my parents wanted me to do  and there was enough fear there that it couldnt be any worse in the United States .
It was not that dif -- kind of fear more than ha d it occurred in 43  or 44  when it was the [indecipherable] Now  is there a period of time between wh en the Germans leave  and the Russians come  when its just all of you inmates in Terezin?
Over there it's not like that  and I was a little bit ashamed of saying I was Jewish.
And I...it was talking to her to sooth her out because she was very afraid  and I was telling her  \ Don't worry.
I'm afraid of police when I see a policeman  and I'm afraid of this and that.
31 No  but I have to say that some people were amazed that we -- that I went back to Vienna  because they were afraid what will be.
And she didnt she was afraid of Syria  because winter  they have a winter.
You think that if they werent afraid to lose th eir business  that they would have been inclined to push for desegregation?
As soon as it got dark becau se we were afraid in case somebody would find us.
We mentioned as far as I remember it the idea was it was butchery  senseless because they simply acted like animals and they just left so much destruction and fear because everybody was psychologically -- the Polish people were very very worried after that.
When th e time came they evacuated us from the ghetto  I remember distinctly they told us that the front is lying where they were fighting the Russian was getting in danger because they were afraid that we will provide information  we will turn espionage or traitors or partisans against them to help the Russians.
People children used to play -- jumping on one foot and making -- I was already bigger by this time and the ghetto was around 12 to 13 years and -- you don't jump on one foot -- 16 and Hitler was not in this because we were looking for survival  and he asked me if I was afraid for my life.
I was holding her when we were liberated -- getting ahead of myself  but we were liberate -- I was carrying her because a lo t of dogs and other animals came  so I figured she might be afraid.
And this was a woman who cursed and shouted and I was so much afraid of her.
I somehow was without any fear  stepping out forward  stepping up to Schindler  practically shouting to Schindler  Herr Schindler (c. 970).
I was afraid that the revolution is going on  from what I heard what happened in Russia  you know  with all the cruelties of the revolution might happen right right here  right now  you know  in in Panevžys .
I wondering if the Germans were sensing what was happening and if there treatment of you changed  if you could feel their fear?
I said  ﬁIm not afraid of hard work  and I am afraid  however  of having financials problems ﬂ but of hard work -- and I worked very  very hard.
Because they ar-are afraid about -- that somebody who would -- who would confiscate their house  their apartment.
But I heard I was very sick  but I heard this crying  this begging  th-this German woman  because they also afraid to be in Russia.
It was a frightening time because it was scary that people were -- you were afraid to talk to your neighbor.
I was afraid to go over the bridge because maybe some patrol or maybe some policeman with guns  they are standing and they will kill me right there and then.
I was still afraid that any minute the Germans were going to overrun the place and take us back.
Pela  I think maybe you... Answer (Pela): Adam didn't mention that when he came from jail  from this prison when he escaped  he didn't sleep home anymore because he was afraid that maybe they would catch him  so he slept by  by neighbors  by fr iends and uh got in touch with these friends of ours who were on the other side and got the false papers.
And it just so happened -- happened that in that farm where she was  I -- I came there to -- to be with her  because I was very much afraid.
So I asked her  ﬁTell me  how come that you said to the child  stop crying because the Jew will come and take you away in the sack?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 36 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: it was addressed to a Dr. Bloomberg and we had friends--Dr.
17 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: Right.
But do you know that we were afraid t o come out of the basement for days.
And the farmer where I working as a cowhand  he was aware I'm Jewish and he was afraid to let me in the last minute  you know  never know what could happen.
You see  it was really -- they were not afraid for the Russians.
And were -- did -- did people get afraid because they were losing their menstruation  the women -- wondering what was going to happen?
We Jews who survived always thought about the Soviet and Russian pogroms under the Czars an d we were afraid once Russian come to Czechoslovakia once again the anti-semitism for wh ich the Poles and the Soviets are so very well known that there will be another Holocaust.
And I'm afraid when I see people saying  ta king things so leisurely and so  and so easily  but no  don't worry  it's always the same answer  don't worry.
And I forgot to tell you  this Russian told the Russian other one to give us enough bro -- bro -- bread  so I got two breads and I was afraid to touch the breads because he told me I will starve in then -- in Lodz.
That's why we weren't really afraid either when the Germans were occupying Denmark.
And one day two men came up and told my father to sign; and Father was still under the spell of the Germans  in fear.
And somebody warned I have to come back wa-was about the fear.
It -- the whole time we were in the ghetto  there was always an enormous fear that we would go to the Kripo.
Okay  and did you feel like  I mean  because originally you had sort of thought you were going to Palestine Yeah  well. --
Then she told her they have to check the papers  so again we lived in fear for weeks.
I was I had no time to have fear  I had to survive.
I went to Switzerl and and the same thin g. I had this constant fear  that I would end up having TB  beca use there was no medicine.
And I shouldnt have been afraid  it would have been better had they had they taken him.
Anyway -- and before he left me  he said  ﬁIf you denounce me  I say its all a lie  what youll say.ﬂ But then he got afraid of it  I suppose and -- and he wanted to meet me again and -- and made me a date and he even gave me an amulet  a Christian amulet  what his mother has given him  so that it is -- that I see how much he wanted to 89 meet me.
My father just about forcible put her in there because  you know  she' s not afraid of the Nazis  but she's afraid of the potato bugs.
