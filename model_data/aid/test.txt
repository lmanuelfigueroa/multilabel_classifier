I wanted to do it and mainly I wanted to help  to weed out those who were real henchmen  murderers  criminals  who woul d -- who should not be fr -- walking free.
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about   because I think this is in your first interview  and i-i-its just in speaking to you again  youre clearly asked over and over  why did you do this  why did the Danish peop le help the Jews?
Then I went to a school  you know  and I become know...to know Russian language more.
And with that  your father made the decision I'm going back to Paris.
At home  did your mother keep house  or did she have help in in keeping house?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 >> Bill Benson: She had to have been incredibly resourceful to help get you through all that you've described for us.
To find out if they would be able to help us getting out  because we want to get out.
Whenever you're goi ng to be in the east  try to collect something and maybe this will help you to live.\
If you remember  through researching a ny dates  maybe that would help me too.
I mean  that sort of  so I had to pitch in  come home from school Friday early and help my mother or watch my brother or both and I didn't have much time to be a kid  you know.
So some of the people were placed in ther e and the soldiers brought in doctors and medicine and tried to help us and my moth er and I was among those that was placed in one of t hese homes.
So  I was very fortunate without the help of those strangers who stretched out their hand because they felt sorry for me or I just looked diffe rent to whatever they were  I can't explain it.

Of c ourse  this was help for the Jewish people  but I think it was well in line with our policy towards the end of the wa r that we show up.
And they started to shoot  but they were drunk  and it didnt help.
Do you think that the people you were workin g with to get out of th ese work permits  do you think they were operating independently or that they had had some help and instruction from another organization?
But Israel at that time was not in finan -- well  not in very good financial status  and they wanted foreigners who have some m eans  to help  and w -- they formed an organization New York  and I was invited to come and -- and I took an active role in -- you know  at meetings and so on  and I became a vice-chairman .
But I have also to give them help as much as I could.
Now  you must remember this was -- she was  of course  in 1942  she was just 17 and since people didn't talk about what was going on  it was just the feeling she had and she knew there would be help.
But th they were very pleased  they were by by the time I got there  the operational troops had called for help  and they got some some very skilled medical people  by the way.
Uh during the early part of the 17th century the then king who was King Christian IV  declared a city in Denmark  in the southern part of   an open city  and that was  for good reasons he needed to have people come in and help finance his various wars  and uh he also uh wanted to what at that time must have been called industrialize the country so he took in people who knew about tobacco trade and tobacco manufacture.
Oh  my dear -- God will help you and you will stay alive.
Uh I didn't have a chance certainly to shave myself during all these days on the   but one of the first things with the help of sn ow was that I sh aved and when... 19 Where di d you get a razor?
So basically my zeal at that particular time was  end goal  to reach Israel  and I enlisted myself with the illegal party -- not ill -- its not the party  it was the part -- the Zionistic party  that they were doing  that helped to help those -- those who ran away  the runaways  sort of  to bring th em in this year.
And amongst it was a  a request by the Truckmay family for me to contact the Quaker in the United States  that was very important because the Quakers had given their support to the Luchombon Pr oject and to  and Pastor Truckmay was entirely dependent on their financial help.
And really at the strangest sound they would help us to fight the cold.
So I never learned to ride it -- my -- and my brother used the car for -- help my father  he knew how to drive.
We had quite a few Jewish friends and we tried to help them as much as possible.
Were you mostly speaking in German while you lived in Belsen?
And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans  and they really wanted that.
And so they you know  in that  you also were not allowed  supposedly  to have help of a nybody who was Catholic.
Only the street boys which were there to help me  yeah.
And we went there and we threw packages of food in there  and we tried to help them.
My father said previous  as I mentioned to you  that Hitler would be -- would be a good means to keep communism at bay and help us save our properties.
I tried to be like I'm also Dutch but I don't talk too much and we happened to have -- Selma got acquainted -- there was a Dutch officer what he happened to be a nice man and she told him about me  so he tried to help us.
So he did not only go out when he got there was help here needed  he went out.
But he was very  unusually nice  and friendly  and he showed me things to help arou nd over there  all kind jobs  and -- You were a nice looking young man in a very good suit.
Hundreds of people volunteered to go to work for the Germans.
And so he went to see him and -- in Warsaw   and to ask him if he could help f -- to find the -- the job for both of them  for my aunt and my uncle.
>> Bill Benson: And the commitment was there to try to find a way to give you some form of education during that time.
Also the I would say that it would be for everybody  strike your own  and help other people.
In the first year  he was constantly called to help them because th ey trusted him.
There was no way...nobody abandoned us when when my mother and my sisters were arrested and brought to the main road  and the farmers also...this came back from a farmer that I have no reason to doubt them  that they tried to help in saving the children.
Then the then they stopped  they didnt let any more Jews come in.
You are here a group of soldiers  you are here in this building  surely they need some services performed on them  cleaning  laundry  cooking  whatever  w hy don't you take my wife and two daughters and they will help you here and we will all be here together.\  \
The Lithuania police   the same policemen that I was told as a little girl if I get lost  I should go for help I had to be afraid of.

I had the good papers  so I usually took a train o -- up to border town called Kongsvinger  and from there  then I had that -- who did help me there?
Wh en you hear footsteps at night on marble floors  boots  and theyre not  you dont know but theyre not stopping at your door but they are stopping someplace else and you hear conversations a nd it gets loud you cant help but take this with you when you go to sleep or if youre awakened by it.
I remember when a a thing was introduced in the general service administration  wher e to help citizens with questions about government  which if youve ever tried it by yourself  can be very  Interview with Peter Masters September 25  1998 75very difficult.
49 He tried -- he could help more   but he helped.
Anyhow  we would -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 4 How did it -- how did it happen though?
They had no -- so they went back to Germany to DP camps where they -- at least they be -- theyre being fed and they had help.
And then I  one of my fathers acquaintan ces lost his wife and he needed somebody to take care of his books and help him in hi s praxis.
One of the Russian soldiers took Margaret's father along to help him carry them in a-- in a sack or something.
Some years la ter  when my sister was born  we were quite well off  we already had six people in help.
Well  what was your understanding of what the Germans were doing with Jews?
At the time  the British had sent soldiers to France to help the French to stop the German invasion.
On my mothers side  my mother had a sister and a brother.
No  were too far we would do all we can to help  but I dont know what we can do.
She was -- she was very sympathetic and very  very lovely.
02:43:52 Did you  as the staff  have to help in getting people to these transports?
Her husband had died several years before that and they were ready to help with the expense of bringing them over but once the war had started and the Consulates  both the American Consulates were closed in Germany as well  that was the end of the - 41 - that was the end of the... any chance of anyone leaving.
It was very  very heavy for me  but it was  as I told you  the next night  with the help of my friends  I passed again the fronchar  came to Michalani  we had some Hungarian money  and the next day we went with a bus to a town  Shatarajawihe  and by a bus to Koshitse.
Was not like some survivors at that time who couldn't help themselves as far as -- not that I was so knowledgeable  but I was good enough to do all those things  and through this  we had a store.
And then they sent people to Germany to help organi ze it.
They were  they did not kill or help kill the Jews but they hated the Jews from time immemorial.
But if you are qualified  really qualified  I dont see any reason why you shouldnt go to the Pentagon  let them help you out.
But anyway  somehow the it was in the news  so you couldnt help even overhearing what they went to the to shop  or where they went in in the tramways  because the tramways were the way the communication was quite well-developed in in Lvov  and So okay.
Its name is Ogygi There we escape from Athens  and from there with the help of the partisans  we pass by sea to Turkey  and from Turkey  we go to Syria  and the city name Halab.
Now I employed my best friend to help me  we had so many to do.
My parents arranged to -- with these Gentile friends  they said  in case of a problem -- that we have a problem  we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 9 want to -- we w -- would like to hi -- you to help us  we would like to hide there.
That was in 1939  and at that time  we had relatives in Germany  and one time they sent us a letter asking us to help them  because they had this store.
To  how you call it  someon e to help my kids with e ducation because I wasn't knowledgeable enough in this country to learn English.
Well  it  I  the rest of that first day when I met the young woman uh is a ---------- somewhat nebulous in my mind  and I had to go back to my  to my unit because the next day  May 8th happened to be the official end of the war  and uh  there were masses of surrendering German troops  and I had to help uh process  and uh  so I was kept quite busy for a number of days before I could go back to ---------  but uh  I did manage to go back there a few days later  and uh  I  of course  I uh would never have forgotten the  the impression this girl had made on me  and I I found her soon among the many others to whom I talked in the hospital  and I uh  at that point I learned that she  she had collapsed on being admitted to the hospital and was listed in critical condition  but um  I talked to her  and  and she seemed quite lu cid  and we had a lengthy chat  and...I  I  so I made it my business to come back to the hospital as often as I could do it  all  not only to check on the progress of  of all the others  but  but in particular this  this girl  and the more I talked to her  the more I realized uh what a sensitive human being she was and that she had had something very special about her  uh  call it an aura or whatever that that certainly interested me  and uh  so from that point on uh a relationship uh um developed uh that uh later became even closer.
It was dangerous  very dangerous for non -Jews to try to help us.
Then I decided that because I didn't care for what I was doing  checking on products  on the pharmaceutical products  but because I could speak Russian  even though I could not read nor write  I would be a better help to the government during the Cold War.
They had brought us in and we were supposed to help them out or you know  relieve them of some of Interview with Louise Birch 26 July 15  1995 their duties.
That seemed better somehow because no matter how hard I tried  everytime I took a shower I could not help but remember waiting in line and how USHMM Archives RG-50.549.01*0004 15 humiliating it was and how cold and how scared I was.
And my mother  just a pair of earrings she had put into a cake of soap  hoping  you know; she pushed in a  in cake of soap  and she hoped that this will somehow help us in the in the long run  because everything else was taken away from us.
And I said  I like to help but they  I used to do theŠ We used to call once a year to people for donation  for pledges.
I can help you out when you need it  so they gave me in the office I I write up pass...passports.
My father was a traveled man   and he know that this is something not to believe ; and he was saying: Oh God  help me.
They said you could work for the Germans  you can work for us too.
And but the ran radio was full of Goering not Goerings   but Goebbels saying that God saved Hitler and he has hes has to have a s Gods help to let him stay alive and all that  otherwise he would but then wh en they started except that when they started hanging up the people who were do ing it  that was at the same time that I think the Warsaw up ghetto uprising was going on  I think  so that That was spring of 43 was the Warsaw ghetto.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/CELIA YEWLOW page 4 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: but I took the people who took us in  they took them and killed them too.
They were of course helping; they had to help  but the Gestapo and the SS were the main characters that came in to play that horrified the Jewish population and there was a day they picked Jews at random in the street and they tortured them.
I thought they would probably kill me by beating me  so that was like the end of 1943  and my working in the kitchen  I had the opportunity to help myself  help my other friends and especially help my elder brother.
And then he...somebody spoke up or aske d for some help  and he shot him right through the neck.
But -- But USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 138 I -- You know  and I -- I dont think the Holocaust affected only the Jews.
My name in Europe was Ipp  but I came here to America  my sister said   ﬁIpp  it doesnt soun d so good.ﬂ So she said to help me make it a little better  so I now have got the name Ipson.
They even tried to take me along  I should help them  the cattle to  you know  to take with them  to hurt them.
We know that 2 days later  they declared war against Germany  but no help.
And they also had another a group calle d self help  and they were mostly the German Jewish refugees here  that sent packages over to to people.
So that's why Paul  that lawyer said  \ Go  and you're the only one who could help.
And were any of the non-Jewish Greek population able to help Jews at this time?
Yes  a tiny anecdote which might help to clarif y the date.
And it took us quite awhile to get that over  but finally ...finally they realized that the Americans were there to help them the very best they could possibly could.
And of course we wanted to come to somebody who was able for a short time to give us help.
This was the so we started to  to plan how we could help my sister.
The army  of course  provided us at that particular time  I must say  with blankets  and so on  because they couldnt rebuild it -- the -- the military academy  but they gave us help.
They had a textile business  and he was the black sheep and he was the chief of the Communist Party and...not the chief of the Communist Party as such but the chief of Poland for the help NORP it was called  N - O - R - P  help for the prisoners of capitalists.
And did you did your mother still have help around the house?
I says  lady  you know  I would very much like to help you.
You might very easily do that in Ghetto if you can help it.
The Jewish hospital was there  and a lot of poor Jews lived around this section and one night the SS  with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanians  they came in and took out all the Jews from there and they drove them to a place  Ponary [in the] outskirts of Vilno there and they shot them all there.
Most of the time the kids were the more educated and understand  and they can read and they can go through certain alphabetical things to find ou t what to do in a case like whatever it is  and we was given -- instead of having just the armband  the star  the Jewish star  we had the Red Cross on top  and able to go to those sick people and help them because they was afraid to go.
And he help  with another capo  a Jewish capo  helped to kill this Baker.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 Again we had a problem.
I mean  they had help getting out of the concentration camp  but I think they had not set on this course yet of genocide.
As the front lines started to move forward  the Russian armies kind of joined up with some of the partisans.
Then 1936 when I graduated from there  through the help of a teacher  a Jewish teacher in Bremen  I went to Frankfurt am Main.
I really thought I wanted to serve and at the same time there was a relationship with -- I wanted to help liberate Luxembourg  so theres a little bit of that entered into it as well  so it was a -- a mutual  satisfying agreement.
Well  I want to thank you very much for talking about -- Thank you very much for inviting us  and actua lly Im very thankful that my story makes sense for you and I feel that I have like obligation to take a [indecipherable] this place  like Beshbagir  like Zhmerinko has to be mo re -- more [indecipherable] museum  and I will do my best to help you with it.
Tell us a little bit about that time between Kristallnacht  after your mother had to sell the jewelry and help pay for the fine and when you were arrested in 1942.
So they used a lot of German Jews  who -- for that purpose.
You know  this is were here to help them  not for us t-to take.
If you go out to ask help for a little  they give you out.
We raise money  we do all we can to help Israel.
When I got again and I say  because he...I mentioned as he's my God and he can help me  because before the word spread around between the Jewish people  as they  you know  a street  street  strict you know...the strict come  you know  between us we give each other the word  the pass word was strict  strict  because he had a habit to beat up lots and lots of people.
So we started  and I looked for Interview with Lena Gitter July 21  1998 22somebody to help with the packing  and I got this young libra rian at Catholic University who is very interested  and when hes off he comes and works a few hours and packs a thing.
However  I saw a nice lady walking in and I figured I'd try and help her.
And how we found out is some of these Hungarian Nazis  they wanted to help Raoul because they knew that the war is over  and he was like me too--\ Oh yes  I promise I help you.\
And so I used to go around picking up  getti ng all the bed linen  all the towels  all the kitchen utensils  anything that I could pick up in my truck and take it back to the new camp to help furnish it.
Did you help her  either in the garden  or with preparing any of the foods that you mentioned?
And we started to to [indecipherable] at Gliwice  the commandant unloaded his stuff  his furniture  and and it occurred to me that I will ask him that maybe to hide in the furniture and I will help the family later on.
When the Poli sh man came to us  I went into a once with him and he said  see  they tell that Polish people did not help.
Before we did that  I decided to go 22 Help (Yiddish).
They worked on it for about a month  with a lot of help  and it was a nice home.
07:06:01 Help in the sense -- one time they brought us a piece of cheese and another time he brought us some eh  eh  medicines which were of great help to us.
We came  we came first of all  we needed always help now from this Markuszow people.
So  I took my suitcase and - when we got our school certificate at the end of the year  our marks - so  she says  ﬁYou come  well have lunch at our house  and Ill take you to the station  Ill help you.ﬂ So I went to her house.
Anyway  it didnt help  couldnt avoid them  and they hit him with the stick and he fell to the ground.
But he was all the time afraid that h e was put there because he was an Iron Guard  so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him  and he told very vague  not in detail  that he knows his past  he regret it  make a big mistake  and he want to pay somehow and want to help the movement.
And the police comes in with the rifle  where are you hiding  what do you think you are hiding and turns out a new  the Hungarian captain who was in charge of the whole ghetto and the whole everything  now he was spitting blood that my fa ther managed to get out his kids and his wife  with the help of an SS officer and not with his help and there was  that SS officer was ordered elsewhere and there was a new one in charge and there was a whole  again an American expression  a whole new ball game.
And here I was doing and making beautiful things for the future.
Well because  as I said  that was the reason  because he tried to help your wife His wife.
Red Cross  they help me and after I went to UNRRA and I was very good there.
So she said that if that's what I want  then her job as a mother was to go on with me   to help me surviv e and go on and try to make a new life for myself.
I would  you know  mix plaster of Paris and help make false teeth  now  you kno w  to put peoples that had problems with their dentures and other things like that  and I would assist this and learn how to give the right instrument to this Was dentistry And that was a Jewish je single   young man who was a doctor  and I was assigned to be his assi learn the trade  as a mit as a dental mechanic  or whatever it was called  and because I couldnt go to school  there was no school for Jewish children.
Thank you so much for joining us and for being willing to be our First Person today.

So the people themselves were still dying because they were beyond help.
We have to manage to help each other  because typhus is raving.
You put them into a holding place until the Germans came with the trucks.
And they put hay on the floor  and we were laying on the hay  with no pillows  with no nothing  but all we wanted is help.
But I help myself.. And like any woman in the golden age  I dont complain  I get up.
Anyway  I s -- when I got out of the service  I had decided that Im not going to help my brother in-law in the store  Im not going to get tied up again  Im going to go straight to California  because I always wanted to move to California.
My surviving was only because I knew my mother and two sisters  I have to help them  I have to reach them.
Every day I go down and it was very -- at home -- that was nothing to eat  nothing  and I had to help them.
The Russian military sent some officers to help to organize the partisans into a fighting group.
Me -- I remember  I knew that we were trying to get an affidavit.
I  Michael Willner do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States  the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia  and the ordinances of the city of Falls Church  Virginia  and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as a member of the public safety  and human relations advisory commission for the city of Falls Chur ch  Virginia  according to the best of my abilities  so help me God.
There was a hospital there before and they turned it over to the Jews.
I will help you with anything I can.ﬂ A very  very lo -- I couldnt say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent  with intelligent you have to be born.
And I used to pick up the food for them and there were a lot of potato peels.
They dragged them to the ditches  but they didn't have enough help.
One guy there  a boy  20-something years  they live near us  he said  \ I'm going to help you.\
And a number of us got together and got the idea that if we held a number of meetings  it might help make a contribution to fighting this -- this racism and contribute to the broader education of students.
When she came to me  she could not help to grown-up the child.
She had to go a nd come and help my father and help in the store and cook and have all the problems.
Because she was the youngest from my parents sister  my mother.
Well  I became...in order to help myself to feel worthwhile I became a psycho-therapist and working with other people  helping them to realize who they are  what they are all about and help them to develop a healthier self-esteem.
So  I dont know who was the person to help us  but we went through Polish committee legally  absolutely.
But she left a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 message.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 34 >> Edna Friedberg: Along those lines  when you exit the theater down the hall to your right  our current special exhibition explores this question  \ Some W ere Neighbors \  about the choices some people made either to be collaborators or complicit with the Germans a nd allies or to take extraordinary risks to help.
Actually they asked me how I could help and I dont know if I helped in the kitchen maybe one day.
And if He couldnt help  well who -- who needs Him?
There were no bad people because we really had to depend on one another so much that nobody had much  but still  if they saw you in that situation that you really needed help  they were trying to assist you.
And the Germans said  we dont have any food  but the American army is across on th at river  and if you cross that bridge  y-youll find the American army and they will be able to help you.
However  it didn't stand...it didn't help me in this s ituation because when we came in I was so embarrassed.
We had to go a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 different way   different direction.
Im -- Im wondering  obviously  it was extremely disa ppointing how little the -- y-y-you had had -- you men tioned in your first interview that your family had had good friends before the war  who were non-Jewish  and that they didnt  for the most part  help during --during the war.
I remember  you know  whoever  as I said before  whoever knocked on the door  they were always  always more than willing to help  but beggars came around  you know  they used to give me like a coin and said  ﬁGo out and give it to them.ﬂ They were never asked to come in.
Finally a neighbor came in and help with the -- ope -- to lift up some [indecipherable] a nd fix the house door a little  so she could close it.
It looks like it must ha ve been with the help of the Israeli government or the Jewish government  we used to buy that soap out of the markets  wherever we saw it being sold and eventually  I understand it  that so ap went to Israel  it was buried because it was made out of Jewish peoples fat.
Oh  when we ended the war  basically th e 8th of May  we m oved southward about 50 miles into an area of occupation  and it was at that time we were notified that the 30th Division was prioritized to come back to the States and have a 15day leave and do some 30day training and go to the Paci fic and help finish the war in the Pacific.
And those people have to be put to gether  those people had to have help with the from our technology from farming and for everything.
Then there were many orphans that Jews started collecting them  you know  who survived  looked  some knew where they have hidden their children  and one Jewess  although she converted    she took care of the children.
And the surgeon realized that they were who they were  or what they were and he decided to help them  I presume.
The Germans were some very -- we were go -- go out from our yi -- you know  went to work or what  and were -- we were still working.
If that were the man that Esther had to go and engage herself to become that queen  that through way she could help her people if it meant her to go in on that thing and become at that moment to get married to a non-Jew and the outcome was that she remains the hero.
No  I think this is an [indecipherable] that is now very you know  people do it and Im going to say something thats going to shoc k everybody  but I think that I myself feel that theres when we really needed help and support righ t after the war  and when I came to Brazil and and  you know  I had a need to talk abou t what happened to us  in order to inform people I had close c ontact with  schoolmates and so on  nobody was interested.
But then you had to prepare for all those exams and my husband and his fishing friend would stay home and help me with this thing.
The reason why I -- I could be of help  because I could find out from camps  when people were ga -- got their visas to come to America  to find out from Poland  not from Jews  from pole -- because I masqueraded as -- well  then I didnt masquerade  but I could  to find out who was a collaborator  and who was not worthy to enter America.
Im surprised that there was a maid because -- because it was really Frau Raizy who had been our cleaning -- cleaning help.
The study was had to have a organizational sponsorship  and so we set up the rules [indecipherable] institute  and with the help of Henry Wallace  I was able to recruit a board of directors  who were very  very prominent.
I had an uncle who used to fix them beautifully for me.
And the British Expeditionary Force had gone to help the French.
I used to help all those girls to cook and to be together because I thought it was my duty to help them because they wa s orphans  no parents.
But this how it was  and I remember my mother  after lunch  with everything had to be spotless  and cleaned  and God forbid something was on the floor  had to be polished  you know  and was a Did she have any help at home?
I was accred ited to the British authorities as a spokesman for Jews living in the cities  so we had a certain standing but what was more important  we had also established a close uh line to our friends of the World Jewish Council in London uh who as members of Parliament like Sidney Silverman and and and   were able to help us in whatever was to helped.
And they have women who came in every morning to help in the kitchen or some things.

My father  of course  joined immediately a group of...uh...people who...to help other refugees and...uh...he also got himself an agent and he contacted the Free French.
And we had been told in Le Chambon already that if we need help we should look for a Protestant minist er.
So -- and she of course told me where to go and maybe to look for help  that she should be released.

Then Im calling called in the office and they said  would you like to go and be a kitchen help in this mans this is a private firm  but they getting concentration camp people and Russian a nd God knows they had some Frenchmen too.
So there was a guy who worked for the police who was prepared to help us.
I wished I had been able to help them  but I wasn't there.
We had more food because we were able to somehow  you know  we  we even found food sometimes in among the clothing  and um  anyway  whatever my possession was at the time  I threw it across to help him out.
There were like four of us I believe  and we walked in and we told them that we needed help  that we have no place to go and they asked us if we were Jews and we told them.

She should sit in a bathtub with a few inches of wate r  and practice like riding a bicycle before -- and take the tablets before  and that might help to ha ve like an abortion.
The Jews went there when the king  the magnificent  gave them a constitution  invited them to come to -- from Germany to Poland to establish trades and settle the country.

I...uh... had no knowledge of the fact  and I had no 10 understanding of the fear of being infected with the...with the illness; because of my mother  because I wanted to be with her and I wanted to help her.

>> Bill Benson: And you'll tell us in a moment where you went.
But anything that was to help Palestine or Israel or the cause was fine.

And because conditions were so difficult that my parents also  to help make a little money  rented out one of the bedrooms in the apartment to a young man who was from Austria.
There was SS guards on the watchtowers with machine guns  and then I realized that uh  uh  we had reached a point  uh  where really a question of survival was of utter importance  and I said to my friends w ith whom I luckily had found  we were always trying to keep together  may God help us to keep us  to ge t out of here alive.
Now -- the funny thing was that we -- very  very few of us Polish boys -- Polish young -- youngsters wanted to go back to Poland.
And people come up to you and say  ﬁCan you help me?
And I wanted to see him and  if possible  help him with money or whatever I could do for him.
And he said oh  okay  dont worry  I am going we going help you.
The men -- I tried to help him  and I saw a guy in a striped uniform.
So when you see the people walking hardly being able to put one foot in front of the other and knowing that they have to go to do some job otherwise they wouldn't eat  you couldn't help it.

So she would go to the offices and get the books for my father to be bound  and I knew how to bind the book  because we had to help my father.

And they wanted us to work in an ammunition factory  and we did.
Applause] Margit  thank you so very much for joining us and for your willingness to be our First Person today.
And he said I will help you to go into hiding.
And because she was already a nurse back in Hungary before they took her away young  they had  they put her in the infirmary to help the German nurse.
Theyre close by and also my father in a way  was privileged at the camp because my father was a German schoolteacher in his -- when he was young  World War I  and the German help him a lot.
However  that didn't help them after the Austro -Hungarian Empire lost the war.
Also at the time when potatoes are ready  I don't know how that is called  that the farmers needed help.
I told David  if -- if this will help your father  I'm going to become religious  I'm going to keep everything.
If you going to bribe me  if you're thinking I am a person like this  I...I'm not going to help you.\
Sh e she hugged me and and she says  Ill Ill help you.
But my brother Roman   he was already in administrative position  he was trying to help all these civilian people get relocated  or taken care of  he says he said  Mother  you leave with my sister  you go  and go to Persia  and I will take care of Tony.
After that he went to help my father in the store because he needed somebody.
So  apparently she must have felt that there was also in her life  that she did  but her I definitely know that she could not help it because as I said  if you  you had to be  when you have thousand people and you are  and you have to keep order  you have to see that they should stand straight and in a line  and nobody should ever take out a blanket  and nobody should ever be missing and nobody should  should ever go without your permission to  to bathroom  how can you control unless with  with fear  and unless with  with  with beating and yelling  and this is what they did.
So in between we went to watch the wedding  the owner comes over to me  he says  can I help you?
You know  those days you couldn't take a train or trucks or cars to Warsaw to help the other groups of the Home Army you know but he said they couldn't do nothing for us and so on but they make sure not a hair on our head here in this village.
We build it  we paid for it  with all -- and -- Did you -- you help build it?
Oh  he said  you look very  very tired to me  you look very tired  so I have to help you to rebuild your strength.
What happened next  I saw a farmer in the field and went up to him and in my broken French I told him I was an American pilot and if he would help me.
But my father want us to be educated because he was not comfortable he my father was in big business  so all the time he was he was asking us for help  so for this he moved out from the little town to give us a little more education.
And I -- w-we -- I talked to him and they promised to help us  or this -- or the -- or the comrades that were in that -- i-in our group  and I wi -- I-I -- they had connections to the communist underground  and they would help us.
You know  and we always had a Christmas tree because she loved Christmas.
And my mother  of course helped her  did what she could do to help her.
And I think most of us are not going to affect hundreds and thousands of people  but we can help one person.
One group would kick them out and get other ones  with the help of the Germans.
This was a time that Maya had started driv ing  and she said  ﬁIll help  Ill help  Ill do all your [indecipherable] driving for you.ﬂ So everybody pitched in and I did go to school.
Clearly this is something I feel that one has to do and one has to see it and cant help being affected by it of course.
And as I said before  I mean  it  it left me great guilt feelings that I  I wasnt able to help him.
And  frankly  for us  we would often look up and  and  and pray that they drop a bomb  maybe  on the Germans  on  didn't matter to us.
But i-its ju st he  when I first saw him  o-on Lehrman Miles with us  his goodbye dinner or something  you know  and he he was talking about how Mr. Lehrman Miles help him after his wife died  and then Mr. Miles said the same thing about him  how wonderful Karski was  and how a courageous man.
And you got some sort of material help from the Polish authorities  that was sent through Americans and British?
She would do repairs and -- and a -- do some dresses for them.
I want you to help me get a picture  and actual  so I can make a little movie and describe  what kinds of trees were in the woods  did you walk through the woods  was it dense  was it dark  were they poplar trees?
When you say you were able to help  maybe  a couple hundred people... Yeah.
The Russians I only came to them and I asked them for help.
Eventually a social worker came around and asked my mother whether she would let me go to a village in Fr ance  Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon where there were people who wanted to help young people to survive  to get out of the camps.
We didnt know were going -- were being taken to Germany.

How we did walk to the working place thinking that when we come back  60 people would be dead  and so you couldn't help it really.
And it had a tremendous impact on everybody  not just during the time you were si nging  and gathers others who were not singing  were sitting there and listening  to the point that not just that hour  hour and a half  you forgot every -- that the reality of your actual circumstances  but you took with you a little bit of -- like a care package  a -- a spiritual care package to help you carry on i-in -- for the -- until the ne xt time when we sing.
It seems that until September 11th  all the other horrible  horrible situations in Rwanda  where the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 118United Nations promised help  an d I went to hear General -- Im terrible with names -- Diddio.
Did the organization work to try to aid Pragues Jews  thats what it was set up for?
It was difficult enough for her to have been away from us while we were sick and that bothered her tremendously and eventually she needed psyc hiatric help -- much later  in order to get out of all of this.
And  you know  she couldnt take all this  you know  and I -- I am very  very glad today  that -- at the opportunities developed in a way that I could be with her  and I could steady  and I could be of help to her  because I loved Mother very much  I -- she was a very special lady.
But I did not find out until the war was over that when she broke off a piece of bread and gave it to me  that she not only gave me my portion of the bread  but she gave me some of hers  to help me survive.
Choose one and get married  we'll have a man that will help us and take care of us.
So I -- it may have been more than one trip  maybe several trips  bringing in as much as a -- you know  could by -- but by that time you see  there was no help  my brother was already in the camp  my -- my oldest was in the army  the Russian army.
I was in the hospital many times with him because that he needed help there  the nurses and the sick people.
Im a member of the central board of [indecipherable] and I participate in everything that I can help them.
So he probably had a quota of so many patients  and so many physicians  and so many nurses  and so many help helpers.
But they releas ed him several hours later  and my father tried to help my sister but there was nothing he could do.
How coul d Russia  America  England  how could they let to take people  take people and just kill them out   or destroy a people  but help never came.
So when they when we came to Uzbekistan   Polish authorities   which were already trying to help this civilian population  say that we are going to move you away from Russia   into Persia.
Your mother  did she also go to work or did she stay home with the other.
apprentice for two years  and then he will try somehow  th the boss where I was working  he will help th my father  but he will buy for me a small store End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic .
It was still a time of waste  it was still a time of waiting  but at least there was an opportunity for us to nurture each other to somehow help each other in healing to give us a sense of importance and value  but that was displaced person camp.
And they were very fond of me  and were nice to me except for the money  they were not too generous.
So  the animal  the human just disappears and the animal takes over; 117 07:16:45 but it's not the way it's supposed to be  a lot of people can't help  right?
And they were all upset  you know  that he didnt help him.
And I actually helped with -- I didn't really help  but I was there and they let me do some sheering of sheep.
If you want it to bury Germans  I will help you.\
And the man said  I'm going to Budapest and to my family  and I will help you  and put up the kettle and raised it up like a helmet and right over the head and the water right over the head and spilt it.
But  he uh  he really thought this would be  what he was doing was really uh searching for help  but there's nothing  not one thing  and was uh  many people he killed because absolutely unrealy uh the  cutting this out  and cutting that out.
Yeah  my father used to communicate with them  not that it help him  but -- So  did you ever communicate with the Germans at Bergen-Belsen?
And had no s -- German citizenship  they expelle d ex -- to Poland in I th -- I remember then that the -- our community  Jewish community tr ied to help these people who came out from there  and they set up a sort of a camp  and I remember we collect some  you know  money or something to s -- support this camp  or whatev er.
I mean my brother -- my brother was very much of a mentor  and so when -- whenever I needed any help or anything  he was there until he -- he left  a-and then -- and he also -- I think he also used me as a kind of guinea pig  because I mean  he was much older  so you know  when he was already in high school and college  I was -- I was still a little kid.
>> Bill Benson : I know this is very difficult to talk about .
And I just  and I wouldn't give them the satisfaction of having taken my life  if I could possibly help it.
The emotions sometime get a little bit ahold of me and perhaps you noticed that and I cant help that.
I couldnt help but think  of course  there but for the grace of God  go I. I and my antecedents were all from Russia  and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp  had I lived in that surrounding  in Russia.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/CELIA YEWLOW page 7 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: there.
They were hiding somewhere in Delft and he would kind of bring them in and have a Sunday meal and then there was some uh...and you know  it was all very small but he kind of wanted to help these people.
So I told I I he offered to help me edit  and and to advise me.
They figured they could help us  at least as well from the United States as -- better then from England.
Uh...Then my mother had to do the cooking  and...uh... she didn't like to do that so...uh...as soon as she could  she would get herself a cook again.
The men  my father  you know  paid for their apprenticeships to become diamond cutters and diamond whatever  but one uncle then to ok that on  so  and he wasn't going to help in the household  I mean that's just unheard of.
He used to take him out to help to bring the corn for the bread.
I always felt I wanted to help people and do things.
You had to do some convincing occasionally so that they would help you.
So we try and work together because Jewish people and Polish people go through the hell  through the second World War  and we should understand each other be tter  and -- and help each other  you know  in a many -- when you -- so-called political matters.
But then he would send probably he would ask someone like James  do you know somebody wh o could who could help out in the house and clean and wash dishes?
I don't -- that I don't remember  because I was in such situations I -- when I cannot help myself I become very introverted  introverted  till now.
Then when they had Polish Nazis questioned  I would help them question.
So that's why my number is not 2000  but 2 318; because so many times I run with the girls to help.
Everyone said   you know  if we need -- you need help  you go to the HIAS or you go to the Joint and they will help you  and -- and I imagine they did.
What they did over there was trying to help us out to stay on our legs.
I dont know what the English were going to do with them  but help the English people fight Germ any.
And I remember they came to me  if I can help -- they organized a Polish school there  if I can help them teach math.
An unbelievable way of putting that in your mind  what people could do to save or to help other people  in spite of all the evil all around us.
S-So we -- now  about the -- we wanted to  of course  emigrate.
But '42...yeah...my son born '42...and uh in '42 began the...life began to be more serious and more pressed and uh my my husband begun to make the possibility through physicians to get some false uh uh paper that he is ill in this illness or other illness  not to 4 go in in the labor camp  but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to play this way  and he made some operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess and uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to find a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to speak with this physician or professor to pay something  give a longer time for for this illness to   but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military service so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their ID when he he can go in a in a mental hospital.
And everyday before school  after school  seven days a week  I had to help feed the chickens.
I was supposed to help her in the business  but I had a girlfriend  and I met a girl there  friend of my husbands  his wife  she just got married then too.
So  bartering with them  he made a deal with them that whatever he pays him sometime  he'll help him to bring inside the ghetto  because what good is it if he gets it outside of the ghetto.
Uh I don't know that there was a underground organization that uh that had plans to enter into combat  but there was  there were many underground organizations that dealt with the cultural and social life of the people in the ghetto and and uh uh approved and...I shouldn't say approved...but uh supported activities that were really prohibited by by the Germans like teaching or having some religious services or having some social services that provided whatever little help one could provide to to the inhabitants of the ghetto.
So his knowledge was so vast as to how people reacted to whatever may have come up  and whenever we had a problem in the military or with their own headquarters  he would help us fight our battles.
How did you help Norman with his feelings about [indecipherable] We survivors.
I got every day an egg and milk  it didnt help me.
And if he didnt have the time  he send me somebody to help me.
As I said  th-the people really they tried to to help in any way they they could  including th-the priest.
He saw the limp and I showed him my leg and I told him he said I can help you but I cannot help you with no medication.
And  uh  the ones who were very sick we moved out into field hospitals and  uh  some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to find out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and we had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go home.
The net effect of this was that uh if people didn't get help from outside  parcels or some help in some other way  they died after about one year  and many people died there.
And just before...a year before the war...I think 1939  with the help of my grandfather  who you may recall was a tailor  opened a clothing store in Delft  the nearby small town.
He asked that teams of Jews from the then called Palestine be permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the staffs of those administering the camps  people  JDC people  to be of help to the Jews in these camps in several ways.
DL] How did the British try to help the Jews  I appreciate youve just spoken about the soup you would leave for them but were there other areas where you tried to help the Jews by providing cigarettes or any other sort of support. [
They always had to have Catholics  they came to Catholic organizations  they had Jewish  they came to a Jewish organization.
And they go to the English government  they go to the American government and nothing help that time  nothing USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 89help.
People looking what they lost in the Second War  what they go  how to give them direction  what they do  what they go and how they can find help.
And when we came there  they were so nice and they tried to help you.
None were sent back but the ones who could prove they were political prisoners  they left for political reasons  that their lives were endangered  they received extra help from the Americans.
The screams of help  please help  help my children  help my wife  uh save us...still ring into my ears to this day.
And after that  they put us in an echelon of wounded; my sister and his two sisters  as medical si sters to help the wounded.
As soon as the regular Nazi  you know  they left  then these political prisoners -- Yes  these political prisoners came out and tried to help -- they were not just Germans.
Did you help the Brichah in any other way at this time?
Now  my job then was to try and help the young people to be placed in jobs  to begin a life that would be possi bly creative  or would certainly give them some sense of solid -- solidity.
My brother wanted again to help them  so he ran away from the forest to help them.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
But it didnt help  because after awhile they said it didnt c ount  that -- you know  at first  yes  theyd leave 39 you alone  cause now you were not Jewish.
Its interesting  because everywhere you go  it appears as if people are willing to help.
But I can't help always wondering  with all the other stories I hear about  could somebody have pushed him?
So the only thing he wrote about  how he felt  how he missed my mom or he missed me  and how he hoped that the good Lord would help them one day  that we are going to be reunited.
Interesting though  that you had -- that experience was  very clearly what moved you in the direction that you went in   to help other people who were -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 60 Yeah. --
Who was born perfectly healthy and 10 weeks he died of starvation  and I think I said very clearly  that had nothing to do with the availability of food or medical help  he couldnt absorb.
But -- but even being a memb er of such an extreme right wing group didnt mean he wouldnt help you as a Jew.
Mrs. Hayward was the cook  and we had certain assignments to help.
So my father survived and they were also  he had some access to the kitchen as a help.
Just have a lot of interests that Id like to pursue  that happen to be  I think  in areas that can affect other people and help them in a positive way  besides me.
And I said so that means I can really help them and they said no  this would be too confusing so I said well how about the job you have a job as a law clerk.
She objects to me when I talk to my cousin  but I try to help them.
Well  I suppose my mother must have sort of a ppealed to him or written to him and asked for his help.
But during World War I  my father volunteered with the German Army.
We s -- we -- we were -- the guys we kept together trying to help one another  we did.
>> Suzy Snyder: He took a risk trying to help you.
6 Committee  it was...they tried to help me as much as possible.
I probably should mention this that in Mauthausen we needed help and lots of it.
And when he got to Hodbomo  that little school for the blind  he said  well  now I realize the full impact of what I saw in Germany and he decided to help.
And was somewhat disappointed when I realized that it didnt much help me.
And this is how the camp was liberated from that um  at  at that time  and um  they um picked me up and wrapped me up in a blanket  and they took me into the uh showers  and the inmates  the Germans that they caught  they ma de them uh put white uniforms on and  and they took care of the inmates who were very  very sic k  who needed care right away  and they had built a hospital outside of uh  uh Bergen-Belsen to uh put those terrible sick people and to help them to uh bring them back to health  and this is how th ey wrapped me up in a blanket and showered me and cleaned me  the German SS did that  and th en brought me into that uh hospital  and uh  I understand  um  Canadian doctor who looked at my leg  and I could see in his face that my leg was terrible  and he said  uh  he had a translator  and in French  they told me they were going to try and save my leg  and um  afterwards I found out th at I had gangrene in my leg  and he almost amputated that leg  and I was still fighting for 2 months in that hospital because I still had the typhus  and this is in the conditions that they found me.
And after a few days some were walking  and this way I ge t to Budapest  and we were told where we can 46 go to get some help  Jewish organization and so on.
Was it through her they were trying to get That was one of the venues that they tried to get  they were not able to help.
On the other hand  you had people who were working with the Nazis.
Well  you see  first of all  then we have offered to them a promise to help if we can and this are another case because they came to also with some difficulties in their work  in their lives.
And little by little he got enthused about going to help the partisans over there.
But they needed money  you know  they wanted money  they did it for money.
I would like to help him because I knew his father.
So that was start  we made several sabotage operations s-so we could help this  and it was stopped  finally.
So  when I came to the Russian army  I found people who speak almost so well  how I am speaking Russian.
She apologized  she cannot help me anymore  that I will never forget to go back to school.
So  that even if I didn't know a passerby I could approach him and say  \ Look  help me.\
And what -- what happened was that when -- by the time she applied for the job with the Germans was because she felt that if she had an ID card in case they could catch up with us and ask for papers that this might help.
And I had with me what I could put on a baggage carrier.
In Stanford while I was there  I met Alan Dershowitz  who was also a fellow like myself with -- to whom I entrusted my -- my desire to -- to come and he say  ﬁMichael  if you want to come now  I will help you now  legally.
Well  I'm sure...uh also you had said at one point that people usually tried to help one another but sometimes they didn't.
And otherwise  I enjoy the museum  I enjoy the people here  nice to work with them  and I know that my work here will help for future generations  that I do something constructive for the museum.
I think I think the idea of the -- of the various tests and -- and  I guess  you know  a methodical way to help people with deciding on careers and what to go into.
So I told Anna  her name  ﬁI will help you financially .
The the ar our our allies will come and save you know  help us.
>> Bill Benson: They know what you experienced   what you went through.
I mean  he had no knowledge of who these children were  but it was just this -- this -- its a question  can you help  can you take children.
They -- I had two uncles here in the United States  and -- Mothers?
And here we are and so shes getting help  you k now  for us to immigrate to United States.
And if you can  help people prevent things from happening and do something where you go home  look in the mirror and say I've done a good deal; I have helped somebody ; I have advised somebody ; I have done something which is important.
And uh  so everybody laughed hysterically to kind of help me because my mother was so mad at me  you know  and then she had to laugh too  finally.
He didnt help him  until the re al section came up  and it was too late.
We had family in New York  but sadly enough  the one in New York didnt I dont somehow or other didnt want to help  or wh atever.
Sure.ﬂ And acted very civilized and took a walk around and as they were walking  the gentleman meandered in talking about the war situation which could hardly help because it had been going on then for about 4  5 years and he said  \ It's a terrible situation with the war.ﬂ My father said  \ No doubt.
And three farmers  the last three wagons  got off their wagons and tried to help out one of the farmers.
Th-This is how far he would go out of his way to help people.
You better come in as I says  as soon as I feel better  I says.
And then when the war was coming to a close  the Germans decided to evacuate the camp.
Well  I was a housemaid there  I lived with the family  which didnt help at all  didnt make it any better.
When we moved into Pomortsy  my grandmother was running the house  but she always had sleep-in help.
But that was the limit of their responsibility  to keep the people alive  to give them some medical help  to give them shelter  give them some clothing.
I started having nightmares  and so  I needed to help her.
He sa id that the -- the girls are -- you see while 168we were working there  I recommended some of the Jewish girls for him to help because he needed so much help.
He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to Champagne  the University of Illinois  and he ju st left.
Nobody asked from help and a mother us ed to say to a child  \ A stomach that is not made from glass.
So of course we had to say better to stop the the the the extermination process and even if it costs some lives  but where is this ....how is it possible that all the high military people  that nobody even made some kind of an effort to understand this and to help.
After the war was over  and I think it was after the civil war in 44  there was help that had come from the United States  you know  in -- relief.
And my husband  who is a physician  advised me to seek professional help  which was in those days  in the early ‚40s  a stigma.
Somebody used to say well  somebody in the  in the United States consulate maybe could help you.
And she told me  \ If you feel so strongly about it  lets leave it.ﬂ It was written by Bruno Jasienski  who was a Communist once and he -- who believed in Christ that have to help people and so on.
The hate still was 20 imbedded in them  so it was embedded all the way  you couldn't help it.
So one day he propo...offered me this while still my father was alive.
So they catch us  and they put us in the camps  British camps in Gaza Strip  and from there  we escape with the help of the Jewish agency.
During this whole terrible period  there were Jews  in addition to others  who risked their lives to help other Jews.
I did see you and did come out for help to you.
Another place was we were in a mai on a main street  then one night there was banging on the door  and we thought where somebody reported us  but it happened that it was an accident be tween a motorcycle and a car  and they were calling for help  so they were banging on the door.
I was a humanitarian that needed to help because I knew my rela tives could be on that boat.
And he said  he'll come three days later and I will tell you what we can help you.
You might as well leave it here  number 1  and number 2  whatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford it.
I dont mean to be unfair  misunderstanding  but we di d not get the proper backing and help from the western allies.
From the Swiss Embassy the the help gave with their .
At the same time  do as much as I can to help these people.
I think the– in the last few years weve started a migrant farm worker pr ogram up in Richmond  wher e we got some money from the legal services Corporation to help mi grant workers throughout the state.
So it was like uh  we were chased around  want to buy food or get food  and later on  we came in   and they saying \ Gentlemen  how can we help you?\
Did that help you to feel more human again  you think?
And what I want to try is get -- take a course in speed reading  maybe it -- it would help me get more reading done.
So  what memory do you have of your father and what he was doing to help other Jews?
Immediately  they organized them selves to work with Jews and they sent ambulances and they sent trucks over the hills into Austria and they began to move Jews into Italy to get on ships  illeg al of course  to go to Palestine  and would I help with this enterprise?
speaks foreign language here] I: And I  then I was trying to help  in the block where I lived. [
And they put us there  and they gave us a room there  and they brought us food  and we wash ourself.
And also  when I finished sixth grade  and of course I could have gone to the seventh grade  but since fortunately I was a good student  and I -- I also studied with -- with help  so I was advanced  and I was able to go to high school.
I think she meant decent liberal people who felt a -- a sense of -- of -- of desire to help people who were in less fortunate circumstances.
Uh my father was an idealist and a naive person in a way  because he believed that assimilation will help him avoid anti-Semitism.
And he basically made trips on behalf of the religious -- the chief rabbis religious council of England  to Poland  in order to find Jews who had survived  to help them  to try to get children and see whether he could transport them to England  get permission  and they were able to get a certain number of visas from the British government.
At the railroad already there were women  our own women  waiting for us like a welcome committee saying where is a shelter  wher e you can go  who can help you... You know what that meant already.
And those were to help her -- people who were either anti-Fascist  or Jewish  hiding .
The who who had hired you to help catch other Right.
>> Bill Benson: Your grandfather wanted to help Lucia out for all that she had done  as well as Mr. Bereczki .
And then  actually with the help of mother  to try to forget the past  I realized that living a normal life  and continue being to  be able to feel and enjoy  that I was not destroyed.
As we were supposedly strange animals  yeah  they sent us a psychiatrist from Chicago  who was supposed to help people.
Now uh the next point I would like to underline is the support which was given to the actlvities of the underground uh in order to help Jews on the spot uh to survive through uh thanks to false papers which were used in great masses  uh papers of every kind uh especially uh ration cards which had to be renewed every month uh could use in the tens of thousands and the hundred thousands probably.
I said  ﬁGod damn it  would you ge t off your you-know-what and help your wife.
Yeah  I believe that you can help yourself to live–that you mind also  your way of thinking has/does help too.
Then Truman recognized the state of Israel and promised to help.
>> Bill Benson: So as you tried to piece together as much as you can  has Bertle been able to help with her memories ?
Only to do charity and to help others an-an-and m-my mother was -- was such a charitable person  we -- we had three tenants in our house  they were so poor and we are -- were certainly not rich either and not even one paid rent because they didn't have money  my -- my -- here you would be on the street if you don't pay rent.
And you know  another one I I didnt help much  you know  what I could do?
Every day still we are loosing I don't know how many in spite of all the attempts  especial ly by the British army who is giving us wond erful help  but if you want to try to do something in order to to alleviate our situation  we have to join hands.
So for us it was just a matter of stepping in there and help them out too.
But in America  under the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 72 Roosevelt administration  know ing full well at that time that a delegate came  and telling all of that  and since the United States  at that particular time  under the Roosevelt presidency did not see fit to give any help whatsoever  to stop the menace of destruction that it went on in Auschwitz  and so on  by ohm -- what that means.
Probably somebody knocked on the door and said don't let in the Russians  even if they say they are Jews and they want to help you  because they are like animals.
She can help you more in this case than I can.\
I bought her a ring  small ring and a watch  gold watch with the money and one day the whole group  with the help of Bricha.
Well  I thought they  maybe they they can help me  or whatever.
People fell into the ocean  the breakers are very high there  and all you could hear was screams  \ Help me!
Winter help for meals for -- for indigent people or money being raised for unusual causes  and you realized  of course  that the causes were the party  but you had to give.
I says  ﬁI dont think its [indecipherable] to leave it for your children.ﬂ So I -- I couldnt -- couldnt help it  so I took the check  you know  I -- but I didnt deposit it.
For quite a while  I I wasnt depressed  but I I recall even having to go to I went to a group therapy; they would help me.
We were sent to work together with the farmers  to to help the farmers.
I had an army paper: To Whom It May C oncern  Miss Irene Hass is our interpreter and we would appreciate it if all help were given to her.
You know  when -- when they was no -- no help.
So -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 64 So it was not really a help for you in this case that he was also a survivor  and that you could [indecipherable] And -- and -- and he was worse when he survived than before  as a survivor  because he got -- he made a lot of money  he had a business.
I walked into them and I told them to help me how to go through with that.
After that she got married  she would still come and help Mother  but al -- we had later on only one lived-in -- live-in maid.
The relativ es did not offer any help  but he did.
We get to the other side  and we find this gentleman who was going to help us.
>> Bill Benson: And you're doing all you can to help share that lesson.
They turned towards us  and I said to myself  God  I wish  oh  I wish I could help Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 36you.
And  the Germans  and the police  the Ho--the Dutch Police came  and they  and when I was there  I say to them  the  the  they ask me the passport  and I show my port  uh  passport  and I say  \ Oh  but I'm a nurse  and I come here to help these people  and they loo-hold my passport to the light  and they right away saw there was a  there was the J  from Jew  was in there  and so there was nothing what they could do.
They had an old grandfather who usually stayed in his room but that was enough supe rvision if anything terrible happened  he could take care of us  and that they would be gone trying to help the Polish Jews in whatever way they could.
And I was going with my mother and with my other children.
We went in to see a couple of friends of hers with whom she was in camp together.
We cannot go and do anything b ecause everybody  because we know if we go over and try to help them or something  they  they shoot right away.
During the war  America brought itself out of the Depression  after  you know with the help of Franklin Roosevelt.
So by the 5th of May when we got there  and a couple of days later when the engineers got there to  to start digging trenches to bury the dead  uh  they were pretty much  uh  they pretty well knew what they had to do to help these people  so we rushed in supplies and  uh  emergency supplies from  uh  the Army medical  uh  supplies and surplus  uh  Army uniforms and  uh  the  uh  various factories and warehouses around that the Germans had or the Austrians had were utilized to supply foo.

And these were Ashkenazi -- Jewish people from Czechoslovakia  or Germany  who had found refuge in -- in Greece  in escaping the na -- so one couldnt help being sensitive to this  primarily because my parents talk about it  even when na -- friends came to visit  and we could overhear their conversation.
As far as how people  people that wanted to help us out and they wanted to offer us food some of them would offer what they had and that was pork and other meats  but coming from a background like we did  we refused the type of food that they offered us since it's not kosher.
So basically  the Jews were treat ed the worst of the people there?
We'll help without a Jew going by who needed a place to stay or a ration card  but it didn't make any difference to us.
They had  I think it was one representative at the time  a man called Reuben Resnick  working there  and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to this outfit so that we could help them.

The husband had been a Nazi  but as he said  if he werent a member of the Nazi party  you couldnt run a business  and I must say  I believed him also that he was a decent man because  when I was there  he was often sent packages from Jews who hed help to get the Argentine  and they were sending him food packages.
I don't know if they received any money  but they were especially elite like  and they started to hire help.
And it all was done by the Red Cross and the Red Cross was just going along with our wishes  you know  at that particular time.

Applause] Jill  thank you so much for joining us and for your willingness today to be our First Person .
So  I feel that the work we do  we represent about 7 000 clients a year and much of the work we do  whether for each of those clients  the case we help them on is the most im portant thing in the world  whether youve got to talk about an abused spouse or someone whos about to be evicted from an apartment or someone who were helping with social security benefits or something small  or whether were involved in some major issue invo lving the Broad Form Deed or safety discrimination  the cases that tend to get the headlines.

Ernst Laqueur died while he was trying to help somebody not to die.
So what happened was such people  if they came and asked for help -- I am going to be very candid here -- we would take out their documents and tear up the document.
But the morale of the story is with your help  with President Nixon's help  with Mrs. Krushev's generosity and interest we succeeded it  in this big project to get my parents out.

We wiped out the 3rd Panzer Division3--uh  with...with great help of our artillery  of course.
And luckily  when I met my husband he was also from Germany  he was from Hamburg   but he had established himself over here by that he came a little earlier  1937  and had become a photographer and and had opene d a studio  and I felt it was my duty to help him  so I became like the manager of the place.
Interview with Fred Lorber December 2  2011 23 Did she have any did she have any help around the house?
We have  I have few close friends  very close  we were all very close  we know each other  but I was in a much luckier position  uh  uh much lucky b ecause I was a professor before the war  and I was teaching in every Jewish gymnasium in Krakow  and lot of my students were in ---------  and they were a very  very close friend  and I tried to help them as much  and they were trying to help me  and many times happened that they helped me i n  in  in  in the ghetto  for example  one of my students was a  in the police  in the out there  he asked and beg the German to let me go because I was already in a transport to go  and they let him uh  the to the-----------this is a very important person  and he  he let me out  but you see  the  the  the  the respect and love was tremendous.
And in some small ways you're supposed -- ideally  it's to lead a life that would help to do that.
I di dnt do too much culture  but you see  I used to help a whol e lot the Jewish poor people.
And they the only one in this situation they could help -- can help us  because the Gestapo wouldn't bother with th em because their son-in-law the chief of police of Volitus   a city.

When they started with the ghetto and they needed people to work for them.
There was somebody represented American Jewry to 17 help  and that was exciting.
We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.
You had a Bell  who wasnt saying any of those things  he was saying we care for these people  we want to help them.
It was sort of help because it was fixed and it was -- they could trust.
I dont know what he was doing before Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 118the war  but when the National Health Service was starting in England   he was supposed to help as an ad visor  even without the English language.
We need you people  we need more culture  we need -- we need help.
We did it ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 anyhow.
The police wouldn't help you or do you  because we hardly had  even with a city like this  I don't remember  maybe we had one.
So you see  the...already from before the ghetto  they were rationed...Jews were not allowed to appear before ten on the markets  open markets  because let the Lithua nians buy whatever it is and whatever the rest  were taken to Jews  but then we were now forbidden at all and this order of the 10th of July  1941  Jews were forbidden to appear in the open markets to buy from nonJews  to hire vehicles from non-Jews  to use help of non-Jews...absolutely.
Stood over there for awhile and inside that train  with God's help  it was hot like Hell and that was almost the end of September where usually in Poland  end of September is nice and cool.
She was able to help these people  and they helped her.
But this was not a big deal  cooperation did not help to save me.
Im wondering if -- if your experiences  and -- and the things that you went through after the war  the depravation that you experienced  and -- and the danger that you put yourself in to help save people and yourself.
And we were like sisters  and she had the quadruple or quintuple bypass in Boston at Brigham Hospital  and unfortunately it didnt help her  she passed away two years later.
And they help me with clothes  to get clothes  you know  and they give us food in Vienna   and then I ask them  I says  I want to go back to Poland .
However it came in the Polish Army  which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army.
And told him  you kn ow  this is me  and [indecipherable] the incident of our -- our -- our visit and said that I was trying to get ticke ts for the opening performance and if he could possibly help me I would appreciate it  etcetera.
Did your mother have any help at home with Yes  we did have help.
Because he had to have a lot more help than that.
So he used to write letters to the...to the US Consul  to help me about this and this.
Okay  maybe  but I dont know which patriot they were  but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians  of cour se  because they wanted to help the Germans  but the Germans wanted to mobili ze them to go to the army and to fight the Russian [indecipherable].
Did your mother work or did she stay at home the whole time?
I well  I didnt have the language capability to talk to them  but I tried to convey the idea that I felt sorry for them  and that we were we were trying to help.
Go to United States  so I write...the next time  next letter there was  have address and next third letter was another have address to uh Derby  Connecticut  so I have a full address and I wrote to uh to my aunt in Derby  Connecticut and an uncle and also my mother write to them in United States to ask them to uh help me  to bring me to United States but uh uh my mother  she was suggest uh I finish school so that was not so easy for them  my uncle and aunt to supply me for for college education  so so I was waiting for a visa five year  and during the five year I was teaching in a displaced person camp in Polish school and Polish Boy Scouts.
It was a great help  a great help that we got this extra food.
I mean  they never had to help us monetarily  but still.
We didnt know -- You mean that Jews were -- that Jews were being roun -- taken to [indecipherable] and other places?
And when you ask me now how I survived  I really don't know how  how we could survive without money  without anything  only with help from other people.
And then my professor who became Rector of Polish Catholic Mission in France  he came also for the celebration of my priesthood in my parish where he was a vicar and then invited me to come to Paris just to help in his Secretariat.
Did you -- and so you -- you did certainly identify with being Jewish?
They have been asked: What made you sacrifice so much and help other people?
The sister wanted me also to help out with other small children and give them some lessons in pian o. These were not Jewish children.
You kept men in the house if you could help it.
A client comes -- Well  like somebody wants to set up a store  so I help them set it up.
She told him ﬁPlease save us  ﬂ because there was no other way we could ever leave Germany without their help.
It was very expensive  so I had to earn money to pay for the high school  help with my sister  and...uh...I was very much alr eady involved in...in...uh...organizational life before the war because mine generation grew up in a...ge neration of idealism.
He said  \ If you want it  I can help you get a job.\
01:40:00 When the orphanage was evacuated 15  I remember I was there the day before  and then I went over and help my mother bring over the bread  and at night I spent  either I spent home  or I was out of the ghetto  because I managed  I figured out it's better at night to 14 Korczak enlisted in the Polish Army in 1919 and se rved as a military doctor.
I will not take Jews and help  because that is death.\
He could -- not help us  but make it more pleasant than it's supposed to be.
8 The Jewish consul there is nothing to say because nothing can help them.
On uh a hilltop in was a castle of the King which of c ourse was then occupi ed by what was called the Viceroy of Italy  and uh who was a representative of the Emperor of Italy to Albjania  and uh Yakamony was his name  and to present him with the case and ask for his personal intervention and help.
My help was one way  their help was moral support and sometimes financial support and we -- we sort of survived.
And what about a -- were you members of a Jewish community there?
But that -- that was the thing to do at that time  he went to the university and -- and the k -- and the -- and his parents were very well-to-do  and he -- and there was a lot of poverty in Germany at that -- at that time  and -- and he wanted social programs to help the poor.
And the -- then it came Poland  and a lot of people spoke Polish.
And I know these people can help little bit more own people.
Well my father went to Mr. Jansen and he told us that he could help us.
I didnt know too much because I was yo-young when I learned  but I help him out   you know  he feed me and I was there.
You know  and this money would just -- just help us  you know  to go a little bit farther  away from this -- from this place.
Only super gian ts  men that were ready to give their lives to help other Jews in need.
I discovere d my.... I suffered like a Jew in Romania; but I didn't know I am Jew  because I never considered.
Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back  so it didnt help.
Was there a sense that hiyas was going to help you in some way once you got to -- No  we were finished with hiyas.
And with the help 02:15:00 When you say  you did could you describe one such action?
She didn't do physically anything  she was in bed  but she was kind of keeping an eye -- she was the one who alerted them that I was coming down with the crisis  so she did help me.
O-Or whether people would be given help through the organized resistance.
So  uh  the money that I was making  I gave to her mother to  for me to help with the room a nd board  but then naturally I started to worry about my aunt and uncle  and I knew... We have to reload.
I attended a school that I felt would help me if I ever s hould come to the United States  I'll be able to get the same kind of a job and be able to support myself.
And we didnt have a lot wo rk to fight to the Germans  so we had enough time to help the civil population.
SB: So  then the ghetto got formed and your husband went where he thought hed help build the library.
And then she came to us and we tr ied to make a disinfection and to help her.
And he made a commitment to go and work with German musicians after the war and to help build the symphonic system in Israel.
They started to help out a little bit  because doing nothing all day long is very difficult.
No  she didnt want she wanted to help to support us.
He had told us sort of to take the path and there was nunnery...nuns and they would maybe help us.
But I was especially close to him and to all his children and to his wife  and I felt a great sense of loss when he left so suddenly without telling us and still preaching to the last minute ﬁStay  be calm  God will help  God will send rescue.ﬂ And in the meantime he had already arranged for himself a job in Paris.
And these...the Polish helpers start to help them  rip out the...the panels.
Even if you feel guilty that you couldnt help them  that you didnt help them .
03:46:09 And he would help you get the documents or money or weapons or whatever?
And the sister went to help her because she was with me  I was three -- Right  right. --
I want to say thank you very much for them for they...for they...any way they help us to study  to know the language.
And so we could organize food for other people and to help them.
And they took us to the organization  to the Joint  and they told us that we can go to Israel  or we can go to Germany  you know  and they help us  they give us food  they give us some money  you know  and they they put us on a pla in a plane  in Czechoslovakia .
And he said  ah  excuse me  if I can help you.
I came to him  and I said  uh  \ You know we're Jewish people here.ﬂ \ Oh  yes \  he said. \
Well  tell -- well  that sort of begs the question of couldn't your father help pay for these expenses?
There was a - I remember there was a flood  somewhere in Poland  I really dont know  but I do remember that there was money being collected in the community - not Jewish co mmunity - for the cause  to help the flood victims.
So he thought  \ Well  if Raoul could do it then  maybe I should go down to the riverside and help these people out.\
Why don't you help me get this lady to the barracks  and we carry the lady that behind us and they thought that we're part of the troop over there caring for the sick and disabled  etcetera.
So  he approached the committee of National 62 Liberation  and said  ﬁI want to help you.ﬂ So he would give us the name of the people detained in the particular area if he could  and also to let us know what was happening.
7 01:19:52 So you did the fact th at you knew Yiddish or some German help you later on?
They co uldnt do this in France and Belgium or Holland because enough of the population would help us  or at least there would be an outcry about it and things like that Lets see.
So nine months later I was born at home with the help of a nurse.
there are people that can help you  so and I was trying to get a job in New York.
Believe me  my father had to help me because the salary went to pay the rent.
But one thing I know  that Im ve ry sensible  and I try to help everybody I can help.
But the thing is  you see  we were brought up to respect people and -- and to help people.
They can not stay with us  but in the next day or so  their backup units will come  the medics and they will help us.
Maybe I can help them to come on the Aryan side.
And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children  mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from England came over to help us.
I said I'm going to help you with this and whatever because I worked in the kitchen there in the 12 camp.
Its just a point  to suddenly find Muriel  and she said  ﬁCan I help you?ﬂ and when I see her  I dont know who she was.
At that particular time  Hitler was tremendously trying to influence the Spanish people  first of all that they should join his armies  then help him defeat the enemy  and above all help him defeat the Jews.
They didn't raise  we didn't hear a ny screaming  didn't have any help from anyplace  and we felt very  very bad about it  angry.
Was there a system for you to get f ood or get medical help or anything?
So this was my job  to help them  you know  improve their spelling and reading skills  one of my jobs.
There was nothing for a person to do then to give in and maybe help you to breathe.
My mother immediately called the orthopedist at the hospital and was told  sorry  he isn't treating any Jewish people and he can't help.
Because that may just help unravel the roots of those events. (
So these 50 years  I am proud of what I did in my small measure  to -- to help.
All what I know that it was done  and this little village  and possibly other  I dont know  these little group of nun  with help -- with the help of the s -- mayor -- you call it mayor   its Sindaco  who is a Fascist  the head of the fasc -- he was helping  and his sister  being a city hall employee  was a -- crucial.
She was I mean  there was a period in the Kai serwald concentration camp where I had access to clothing that could be traded for food  and during that period I could (you know) help her with some-some food.
And I was so proud of our house help  because she volunteered  18-year-old girl who was helping my mother in household  she volunteered as a live torpedo.
And I remember my mo ther in those days  she was very agitated to -- really to help and warn us  dont tell an -- anybody about this  and she was really taking care to try to find places for Jewish people  but I dont re -- remember if she did this for other Jewish people  to o  I dont know about that  but she did for Alfred.
And -- and so he took a job in a factory  and you know  he -- but really  I suppose any job  you know  beggars cant be choosers  to put food on the table  and pay the rent  and -- and -- and so forth  and th -- perhaps the one thing which one can say is that whilst he was free to do what he wanted  or was free to -- to live quietly  with nobody bothering him in En gland  that didnt mean that the English government was going to help him get a job.
And I -- I surely am thrilled that I was able to do it.
And please  he should help us to get out from the ghetto.ﬂ Thats the way I got in contact w ith my uncle.
And  but it really got very bad in 1942  that's when it started getting very bad and where we lived in the City Hall  the notary  which he was the head of the city government  lived in the same balcony as we did  on the same balcony  and he had a heart ailment and was very grateful for my father's closeness  he could help him a lot  and I taught his children English and small children  young children  and he came to my father one day  and he said  \ You know  doctor  you would do right if you would send your daughter away.
We tried to help them join families wherever we could because what is life without family?
But we had a good time  we -- When you started looking for -- for -- for work  what -- did it help you that you spoke languages?
Its -- Its -- It -- Its very hard to -- to really judge and to say  well they could have saved more  because everybody knew that if they did help Jews  they would be punished like Jews.
They need our help  and I'm going to gi ve it to them.
Yeah  cause after you were talking about  you know  nothing German -- I know. --
And if I could supply that help  she asked me if I'm willing to do it and I agreed.
I was trying to hide and figure out when the action will be over  I can go to my frie nds in the city  and stay outside  and eventually this way I can help my wife who will be in the camp.
They were very courageous people to do that  and they were great human beings to be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk  yes  because if anybody was found to be sheltering Jews  could be shot  he and his family.
They said  ﬁWell  theres really nothing we can do or help or say.ﬂ She then went to the   but I dont think she did give anything to the people in terms of gold co ins or diamonds  et cetera.
A nd that kind of stuff  and ﬁWhos going to bring up my child?ﬂ By that time in Engla nd  people were having a lot of household help  lets put it that way  and also  on top of it  his parents were divorced  which was another horrible fault.
After the war  we tried to help in nearly every cause through every means available to us.
So -- So  well -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 119 So anyway  so thats the main help that I think I got  if you want to call it help  was being sent for this summer vacation.
Not -- not only me  but th is way one can help each other  you know?
He say the Germans say we will work  we work and we will cooperate  for working.
There was the I.D. cards did not help you in Auschwitz at all.
Now  the fake came in very easily because there was a polish gentleman who saved people for 2 yrs  a Polish Jew in Poland  and when he was finished  he figured somehow he makes his way to Hungary  maybe he can help because by that time he knew we were occupied.
He not only carpenting  but he did the he build houses too.
you couldnt help them  and they didnt work  because of the -- so  whatever it is  my sister and my mother stayed home.
We always had boxes for orphan children  we always had a box to help Isra el.
I found her and I they let me in  the guard  because she was being interrogated  and she was in a separate room held.
She said that they  we couldn't help it that we were in the state we were and that she–. Excuse me.
So at meals  we were good of the help and some people.
He would make homework with me  and help me out and he would read to me.
I want to convert in being a Jew  with your help  I would like to be one.
They dont make any ti metable  but said  you know   they helping other people  whatever you give us back is going to help somebody out tomorrow.
23 I -- I must have said  ﬁWell  if theres any way you can help us get more supplies and to create more camps to relieve the overcrowding in Feldifing.ﬂ And I know I traveled around.
I was not very knowledgeable in religious things  but I had the help of our first permanent rabbi -- oh no  the second permanent rabbi  who was brought in from Europe.
Being that we are young we should go back to United States  build our life in United States and try to help the family as much as we can.
And I was saving money from my wages to help my mother.
He had a certificate to go to Palestin e  but he forfeit his certificate in order to help us.
And she -- he took my suitcase  he wanted to help me.
And Raoul and I went to him because we wanted to have some more -- some guarantees from the Germans that they  after all  should try to help to protect our 40 houses  you see  and all th at.
And then Where did you get food and things like that?
And they used to meet people who were in camps and what do you know where people are.
See we knew we had to help in those places a number of times.
Why did you want to go to Germany at this point?
Just the real story  that Id kind of like to get out  to help bring the fame of the the real accomplishment of the 90th troop carrier command  bring it into the truth.
And then  because they checked us  and the other girl had to make the twine  and I was picked out there  ﬁOh  youre a maid  you have to do the laundry ﬂ of those guards  and from a whole bunch of guards  and I got two other girls to help me  but I was the maid  so I have to be the leader.
The the baby brother was okay yet  and my mom but he had very clean she probably had enough powder or whatever  y ou know  to to help him to heal and but thats thats all she ca she could do.
And it was a most wonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their shoes  and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing.
I will teach you and learn and you can help me.\
Very nice  what about the 200 people He  God didn't help?
Again  I was all for the U.S. to help out with troops over there.
Put on the train with a ticket and -- and a tag saying that if -- ﬁThis person speaks no English  if you can help him  please do.
And then he said if I could help him get information; I was very eager to do so.
Anybody that walked in the door  that came for help  I could ask them in German  what do you want?
And then make your way to the exit  and go to the streets  and when you find the -- a place that has a kosher sign on it  theyll help you.ﬂ And thats exactly what they both did.
And now American and British jump to help him  and a not just help him  but embrace him.
And she before -- I learne d later on that she would try to help Jews with food in the ghetto.
We have  in a retirement place in the -- this is in-independent  they have those -- those help you -- those retirement arti -- but in a retirement place.
And we did eventually get them out of jail with the help of the Kentucky Council of Churches  I mean the National Council of Churches.
Military preparation and training  so you will have to join us and help us.
But the worst thing was that we had no help in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 transportation.
I went  help her clean it up and I took her carpets out and put them on a fence and beat the carpets and I made whole 50 cents  big 50 cent s piece.
Each one got pocket money; and on Sunday  in order to make something extra for us  or to help our parents  we made...I remember that I delivered flowers.
We were three sisters and I. We had had to work very hard because we got just a couple workers to help us on the farm and finally they said there is some...some...after the war in Poland  they were saying that it is a possibility that you get a worker from Poland  and my father put in the application to get some worker from Poland and we did.
She was an old lady  she was a widow  and all she had around was just servants to help her.
The rumors were actually in that ghetto that those people who work will be much bette r off if they don't work  meaning that you better have a place to work and then you'll be ge tting some kind of iden tification card that will help you survive.
And we went to the concentrati on camp [indecipherable] You -- you mentioned in that case a -- a Polish person who helped somewhat  but -- but generally did -- could you rely on Polish people to help you?
Later on  it was...and when it was visible the Germans were going to help Czechoslovakia uh they uh the Czech were very easily taken over by by German  by Germany.
I was sent over to the neighbor to help  apparently this neighbor was somehow partly German  so he had the right to have a laborer for free  so I was sent to help him in the kitchen.
He fina lly got on a ship  Dad and Mom tried to help get him into the States  but somehow he wangl ed a way to Canada  got on board ship in Spain  Ernst Pollit did.
So -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 40 But you didnt know this.
My grandparents who were our only close relatives they had gone to South Africa through the help of my mothers younger brother who was five years younger than she.
As soon as I graduated from high school...in the first place I wanted to go to college and my only ability to go to college would be with my uncle's help.
I like to help the people  because I know what this is.
Im a Jew and I have my own prayers and I have to say those prayers and I have to talk to God and he will help me.
And so he -- he needed someone to help him there and he -- he s -- he send me a telegram.
That was a big turning point for us  we felt that that was one way -- we even hoped that my grandparents and aunt would surv ive somehow  because now the Americans were going to help us defeat Hitler.
From Budapest with the help with the same thing the Bricha; we we nt to Graz  Austria.
And then I was working as as a as a help in some household with children and so on because I had no money.
But I wasnt sure whether my studies would help me and whether I -- whether I would succeed in getting a reasonable position  or a reasonable job.
We had to go to the Schreibstuber  and the Zaehlappell had to be correct  yes  so that was -- now  and beside that  we 137 help  from -- we order  and so food came  too.
But of course  some of the help youd always had  would stay on  and you also got help of somebody we had a French governess who was a Protestant.
He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to love each other and we used to fight each othe r and we used to do things that 13  14 year old boys used to do.
And we are proud of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 47 them today again.
And uh if he was called to help somebody  or to...to bring so mething to somebody  or you know to call a doctor or something; he would do anything for everybody and anybody.
I had to start in a Polish school and learn Polish and all the subjects were in Polish.
And then of course  I still never could understand why nobody wanted to help them  and us t oo  to help them.
Yeah  yeah  oh yeah  oh yeah  and Did he look Jewish?
For the first year  was very difficult  but our son thrived and he gained weight  and it -- you know  for me it was a full time -- fu ll time and a half of -- of  you know  taking care of him  and without my husbands help and in a stra nge country without knowing the language and the customs.
It's 2164 Street  and she had 24/7 help because she -- she was getting ill.
There was a Red Cross  and there was Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 142that help e help.

And then  while he was helping her  he says  theres nothing wrong with this bi cycle  but while she was getting up  she brushed on her he brus hed on her coat and well  they both end up in jail  and they said He saw the P  you mean?
First of all  there was the so-called Polish industry  and the other one was that I did not speak Polish and I could help myself with a lot of German and a little Polish.
In addition  the umb divisions that first liberated the camps  did everything that they possibly could to help the strickened men and women and even some children whom they found in the concentration camps that they had liberated.
After all  we were helpless  we had no means of support or help or food or whatever.
The lessons that my father taught me  whatever I do I become  if I lie I'm goi ng to become a liar and I'll help him and others.
In fact many times  me being able to go out by myself  they required my help by bringi ng in guns that were bo ught on the outside.
My mother's brothers were in the family business  the older ones  but her younger brother was like my older brother.
The Communists were the only  the only group you could really turn to  during those terrible years that  that would help you.
That is maybe one percentage on the million that we can help and be alive.
It didn't help -- the medicine didn't help any more  and the food didn't help any more.
And the soul is desperate  hoping for Gods power  but he doesnt see  and doesnt help.
That was taken away from him because what happened was  the man he hired to help him  stole everything  and moved it out of the bank.
And people who came to our house could not believe first of all  we had a very large kitchen  we had help.
And she ha -- was registered al ready  you know  she had a uncle here in Long Island that she wanted to co -- times were bad in -- in Germany  wa -- so she wanted to come here  so finally with the help and Cy Wolfe  well  she had a chance.
She gave it to him  said whatever it will help him  keep it then.
Pretty unemotional  which made it difficult  but also was a help at times.
They had a bunch of rules for the Jews  what they can or cannot do.
You were a friend with my father.ﬂ He said  \ Look  I cannot help you.
She sent a few cards from the trip to Riga and we still have them today and she writes on them ﬁwith Gods help well see each other again.
And my father said to a rabbi  give me the name of the Jewish peopl e that need financially help  because we got some money from the government  and we can help.
>> Susan Warsinger: You saw in the beginning  you explained the little tag  it was like a tag -- Eleanor Roosevelt  she wanted to help a lot of the children get over here.
But probably -- the fascists are fascists  they always felt the -- with the help of Nazis they tried to achieve Ju-Judenfrei country  you know  so -- but this is not the first time  and I hope its the last  but Im a pessimist about this.
We tried to help  and we had very little -- Q. I was going to say  what could you do?
>> Bill Benson: You were forced to go to work in a factory.
A tremendous guilt feeling of being alive  and how do you help 54 people to get over that.
And I enlisted to the SS in order that I can help you.ﬂ We were shocked  you know  ﬁyou helped us?
I I was a floor boy on in garment center  but to help myself a little bit I used to go in in the factories for sweaters and buy off a few gross of sweaters and buying like uh two for a dollar  and I would sell one for a dollar.
But when the time came to disperse everybody  help was indeed forthcoming for everybody but four of us -- my friend from Gurs and two other somewhat older young fellows who were not Orthodox -- we were told to help ourselves.
And  uh  that uh  opera tions have to be set up  and uh  he wanted to help me because there was the uh  the uh  the uh  the uh  organization had wonderful social workers  but these uh  uh  uh  uh  especially ladies  had hardly any experience in technical work  and how to run the operations and so  I was not trained in that but uh I ha d a certain  a certain  uh  uh  uh  capability for organizational things  which I also picked up during my existence in the youth movement  and I uh  uh accepted the offer to se rve there.
We heard confession just by walking with some person who asked us for this privilege or we were hidden in some corner of the concentration camp because to hear confessions...you see it was really for the Gestapo some cause of a torture  and we tried to help the people that really in such way that these are became the victims of torture.
I met in Geneva also  some acquaintances of my parents  just by chance  and told them that I had to go back to Germany soon  but I had no job and if theres anything they could think of to help me.
I think that if I had a family and if there was a threat that my fa mily might be killed or if my family would  uh  be hurt or that I might be  I don't think I could have made that decision and now I will think differently because I lived through that  but I  I hope that people don't have to live through that to make the decision to help another human being  to save another human being  and  uh  so that's why I think it's so important  you know  people like this  uh  talk about their experiences so that other young people and our children and  uh  my friends' children and future generations will think about what it is to do the right thing and what it is to save human life and what it is to risk your own life  and that's I guess all I can say.
And I want to thank you  the audience  for coming to our museum and being witnesses to the story of the Holocaust and for listening to my story.
Did your aunt pay Mrs. Niederman any money to help you?
When he arrived  he received temporary asylum with the help of ESRA  a Jewish aid organization.

And the rabbi's talking about how we must help because he hears things are terrible  you know  and I'm sitting in the back -- I've been there.
If you had the money you ate  if you didnt have the money to ea t  you didnt eat  unless somebody maybe helped you out once in awhile  but they couldnt do it every day because a lot of them didnt have money also  to help you out.
I rather see somebody will help me  and have physical feelings  than somebody will tell me he has sympathy for me because I suffered.
And you said you want to help the muse um carry out their mission.
I don't know if they didn't have the money or didn't have the power to help  but they didn't give us anything to protect ourselves.
We are to help each other  and we will survive. \
Now  when youre talking about the help that your father got from the government and from Ronniker  youre talking first World War.
And by the time  1974  I get an offer from a friend of mi ne in Switzerland to come and help him  he was a director of a school in a childrens village in Switzerland  Pestalozzy  very famous childrens village  Pestalozzy Childrens Village.
So  luckily  when Polish women cam e to work in the -- whole night we were sitting on a bench  and I see theyre speaking Polish  I said  ﬁYou help me out?

Ill pay you whatever I have  Ill -- you know  my money  and whatever I have in terms of furniture  and anything that I have  I will give you and Ill help you to settle.
I said  \ Well  to give you some idea  I work for people who need help  who are very much in help.\
Well  I knew that everybody had to help  and I wanted to do my part.
Anytime somebody got sick she made them chicken soup  she went to the house  she was flying around from one Jewish family to the other  see if she can help them  and all that.
Some of the people that came from outside tried to smuggle in some food  some a piece of bread  a potatoes  something to...to help their families in ghetto.
They and the Gypsies were screaming hilfe  hil I mean  help  help  in German they say hilfe  hilfe .
And one of the few countries...one of the few nations that did more than their share to help the Jews all over the world and they...I am sure they would repeat the same thing and do it today again if it happened  if it should happen that they would be willing to help with money  deeds and everything.
And if I can help one soul  one person to get rid of hatred and to get rid of suspicion and -- and understand another -- we -- we speak always all -- we have to understand the other  that we shouldnt be always treated as the other  but we ourselves are treating very often the others as the others.
I would say the intelligent people  and not only I mean educated  but th -- illiterate intelligent people  Polish people  they couldnt help maybe  but they would never do a thing like this.

And one of the families had said they would take me and the other family said theyd take my mother and her mother  my grandmother  who  remember I said  had been left behind in Germany  and came to live with us.
Wer you said that some of the Russians arrested the Soviet army arrested some of these people.
ﬂ She said   ﬁNo .ﬂ She said  \ If I accept help from you  it may mean that my pa rents saved you for a reward.
Oh  anything you know  I tried to help the nun with -- with convent -- even the whole convent to supply  make sure they have enough food.
So Im watching this and Im reading this and a lady coming out of the house  this building  she sees us and she says  ﬁCan I help you in any way?
That's where the Red Cross came in to help with food  some clothing  and  of course  the idea for us was to try to get into the American zone  for one thing  and to try to get closer to what was then called Palestine that is now Israel because that's the only place that would accept us.

And I asked him to help me fi nd my uncle.
And there was a organization  I know  because my mother knows her he she wasnt pa-part of the organization  but her good friend  this doctor I talked  Dr. Bridges  who talked with the Jewish doctors about  you know  the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation  his wife  and other  mostly from Catholic organizations  made a a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.
And so we did have some help as far as finding an apartment.
I was afra id to do it and besides it was very painful  you know  to see these people in that state of  of...of humiliation  and I couldn't help anything.
And uh she showed that people could help individually and she did.
ﬁYou should help me something or give me a piece of bread or something.ﬂ And I came over to the farm.
On the beginning they said that  we brought you freedom  we have to help Polish people against ru Germany .
But anyway  they wanted to express their  you know  their sympathy and help us if they co uld.
Because he was a teacher and a pedagogue  but I was asking myself why did the clever Jews need this German Jew to help them to build the school?
They said  \ Well  if they will come here and fight  we will maybe help you to kill them both and will be war over.\
Uh and uh in fact the last one I got we were desperately trying to help  finding people to give an affidavit to uh a whole family.
Any other thoughts about what you went through in the war?
Didnt seem to get a lot of guidance  but got some help.
So that was -- we went to Germany  smuggled  of course  you know  through the border.
You had described ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 that right away .
It was very important that we knew more about it  and h-he -- he more or less described it so what help -- was later  that we saw later.
When we arrived in Poland  the school authorities advised us that the best thing would be if the language at home became Polish rath er than Yiddish to help us get along a little faster and learn the language.
They did not like what was going on anymore than anyone else and they would try to help whenever they could within the limits that they were entitled.
Th-They did help you  without you being aware of it  because I remember things  you know  where -- where they would -- li-like for example  I remember when my daughter  she wouldnt eat at all.
And the grandmother still co uld sort of walk  I mean with help  so it was very difficult because at that poin t we didn't carry about the suitcases but we wanted to help her and we had to help the father to get out of the train and they were shout ing  they wouldn't let us leave the 53 suitcases in the train.
And my father  after his demi se from -- from the German -- from the army  with the help of Canaris  he escaped the concentration camp then.
And then somebody pointed to me and says  thats she and says what are you doing here peeling potatoes when we need help in th is Polish office?

The next week my father came back to sweep that area of the market  the old farmer came back to him and he said some of our farmers agreed to help you and here 's how we're going to do that.

He wa -- he will be given the authority to leave  and to get the help of -- assistance of [indecipherable] authorities -- Uh-huh. --
He was always my big brother  he was always there to help me out  all my life.
I never forget that I also was caring  and to help people  and if somebody wouldnt have taken me and -- and -- and thrown me back  then I would have not survived  and so on.

Theyll be able how to -- be able to help you how to -- into -- handle it.
The king was very popular and he was much against the German occupation  and it was a great help to many people when he rode through Copenhagen completely unprotected  and I believe that this star that is a myth sprung out of this popularity which really deserved.

And my mother -- this is -- and my mother was hysterical  everybody was hysterical and I started to become hysterical because I didnt understand.

I go back to a sanitorium to be taken care of and that was from Bomberg I left to a hospital -- sanitorium rather than a hospital  to bring back my health and I stayed there for more than a year before I got help.
My division was stationed near Dachau  and they needed somebody to help interrogate the guards.
They were far between but there were people that tried to help.
We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the field  like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that  cause the farmers couldnt get it  because the man didnt go outside  they -- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in Germany  I guess.
And we try to help her  you know  as much as we could.
Civilians  you know  electrician  whatever what they need  professional people to help  you know  in this to build this factory.

If Im not going to school  I have the time to help others.
And I told him again I had applied for aliyah  I hadnt heard  can he do anything for me?
And I said  well that happens to be my Aryan side.
And do you really think theres something very special about the German state  and the -- and Prussian history  given all the help that Germany got doing this?

We had  after all by then  the major part of our family here and one part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help us at all.
Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation  and the church  information about certain prisoner  or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by some family desperate to get help for their pr isoner.
Did you speak  or do you -- did you speak German at the time?
And they -- they had also Lithuanians  Ukrainians  and -- and there -- thats what they help us  and dogs.
So it wasn't only the point that they didn't want to help  because we knew some very fine people that were patients of my mother  and my mother told me she gave them stuff to hide like candelabra and linens and fur coats; in case we ever needed them they would be outside the ghetto.
But this one man helped us during the time  all this time  all the time we were in hiding and if we needed help he would help us to find another place.
And -- and happened to survive mostly because I could do something -- thing what -- what the German needed  and I could help on -- with the machines  with all this.
Well  some how with the help of the little English that I knew at that time  I did join the Air Force.
Everythi ng was done to help us as Jews without any financial reward.
And somehow he said  you know  ﬁIll help you do whatever I can.ﬂ In life  what I found out everywhere  you need a little bit luck  but other people will help you.

Occasionally when I have 108 Come there [sic] (German) 109 Yes  we help you  we help you. (
And something whic h is most important  during the last year  from January 1944 to end of May  the end of the war  in May  '45  that twenty million dollars were channeled through the War Refugee Board -- Jewish money  not other money --this we also have to talk -- were channeled to -- for efforts to rescue Jews  to help Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution.
And it's so surprising the power we all have  even with little things to help another human being.
Well  as soon as my -- I -- as soon as I found out my brother came to Toronto  to Canada  he had no money to help me to come.
So but it it helped  I wouldnt say it didnt help.
Later on I was very worried that maybe it is the truth that he was a real soldier that he wanted to go into hiding and my conscious was bothering me so much that I didn't help him.
I attempted  with the help of the proprietors of the company  to do something in that respect.

In the meantime  I have a lot of German people  my patients  if you want to come and help me in my office here?\
Yes  and my grandmother  who was well in her  I would say 80s  who was more like a mother  she really brought us up  because my mother worked with my dad  and there were other workers; so they obviously were well off enough  cause there was help.
It was the desire to help the Jews to get away from that life they led because they were not educated; they had no profession  no skill.

And he was so proud of it  you know that  I mean  people were so genuinely good in wanting to help.
He had to have  there was a lot of help  or Mengele.
03:26:00 Well  let me tell you how didn't help to be w ith friends or with  because people got pushed in just  just shoved in the wagons.
There was a special German corporation built just to receive th e money and to distribute it and with the help uh of uh of uh fellow survivors who checked applications and so  it took quite some time.
I was still -- I was still a person who had certain  certain -- I wouldn't say powers -- but I could help my father  I could help my brother  I could encourage them  I could do something for them  I could be with them.
There were no families that were going to help them bring up these children.
And he was tremendous help to us in the preparation of the Dachau case and the Mauthausen case.
Uh and then on a few occasions Martha actually was able with the help of someone else to remove the number that was written down for me to go pastures is the only way you can put it.
Is that something youve had to work on at all  or are there any things you do  or -- that help you feel more secure  or things that you and your husband have done?
And then Did the welding have anything to help you Well  it because of the welding  he found me some other j-job in a machine shop.
Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 186 -- that he would help me get -- well  I didnt need anybody  was soon as I came here  I got the job  you know.
He said  \ Because Rumania is already occupied by French  British  Russian  and Hungarian  and that is the only available embassy  Swedish embassy in the whole Balkan  and somebody has to go there and ask that Ambassador to help this one.\
And I see how people are coming from different country  working in my capacity  what the help they getting  what the chances they have to be somebody  to develop  to educate.
So you have to be aware and help yourself much too.
One day he told me  he said  Heinz  tomorrow morning we expect some German artists to entertain the troops and I want you to help them with the luggage.
They did have an underground of people who were anti -Nazi who tried to help.
>> Bill Benson: Can you tell us a little bit about that?
But then when they took my mother out  I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys who also took mother out to Gestapo headquarter s and then she was going out to our area where we lived.
A few days later  medics will come and they're going to help us.
This is before us girls came  help get the bodies in the graves and whatnot  and the -- so the chaplain could have his services and you saw the pictures of the big cemeteries of course  that we had  you know -- but he did a great job  but -- just werent enough of our boys to do it all  you know?
And I didnt see what they could do to help her  because we had no papers for her.
Anyway  didn't help  we had guns  we said  \ If you want to die  you're gonna die  we're gonna do something  we have to leave.\
And so she asked th-the man if he would kindly help her.
Do you remember any really striking experiences with the 12 Russian peasants that either they were really terrible to you or really tried to help you significantly?
I dont know why  I think he wa he feel like hes responsible to help us  the younger  you know  children.
Uh of course the Nuremburg laws uh immediately uh ma...we were forced to dismiss immediately the uh uh very nice young lady  young girl who had worked as as the household help of my mother and we had to take a woman uh I think over forty-five because that was a law that only uh women uh supposedly uh safe from the hyperactive Jewish male sexuality uh would be protected  and so she immediately left our household.
However there were organizations that were help ing across the borders from Poland to Germany and this was also an ac tivity  there was not much publicized.
My cousin  who lives in Essen  Germany  tried to help her but there was no -- no way.
And stories from our own members of our family who lived in the Jewish quarters that people are running to the Jewish Community Council asking for help.
That I woul d not change 180 degrees the minute it was convenient to me and the minute that was over that I could get help from Jewish organizations.

But its not going to help emotionally because you see we were very young and when youre young youre strong.
So you would try to help people  y our Polish people would help you get them?
In other words  when we asked  why didnt the allies help?
I know you had lots of friends who helped you and you had -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036 31 No  they didnt help me  because I had th e money and I had -- I needed contacts and -- and [indecipherable] by the way  when I came to Israel  the first thing I did  I went to the American embassy.
With the help of a man who was a very important Dominican  fiercely anti fascist  fought with the partisans later.
Did you try did you try to help your mother arrive to England?
But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a f eeling of that  the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible.
To help with this exhibit they reviewed and transcribed several filmed testimonies and made recommendations about their potential significance to the exhibit.
And Self Help has become rowt -- right now  an a ll around agency  that has a -- a very large homemaker service  with almost 3 000 homemaker.
And the Russians tried to help us but they were very clumsy and very badly organized.
No  some were German doctors  but th ey tried to help everybody to do some -- So you -- They were not -- Did you feel comfortable working with them?
So when we had one operation  we -- the first time th e man that should help us  he had -- he had overslept.
So that was all fine while it lasted and it was a big help  but.... It was a rare opportunity because very few  if anyone  had been able to work in a foreign country in Europe during those years.
There may have people there may have been peoples that tried to help  or bought f with with food  or w ith with the but like I said  Quakers  for instance.
So  he figured that when he goes to his friend  hi s boss that he will help him - he will help him.
And we said to the doctor or the captain in charge there  he says  \ Sir  we're supposed to -- supposed to help you with any way we can.\
And even though it wasnt well meant  it turned out to be a very  very good recommendation  because it was - there was no -- the reason he went there was that there was no Jewish ear  nose  throat doctor in Dayton   but [indecipherable] he built up a very successful practice  partly with the help of the medical society in vetoing his admission by passing an expos facto law on a Friday night  sometime i -- after he made the application requiring citizenship.
They were Polish army officers and the Polish army in exile in London decreed that they work in these camps to help repatriate the Poles.
We didnt have really nothing  only but that fish help us a lot.
Again  I have to tell you  Belgium is still the only country when you think how dangerous it was to help somebody  when I help somebody  just to have somebody stay overnight with you or share a sandwich with you.
This place where you were waiting and hiding it was outside the ghetto?
Well  for the first few weeks of my job  I think  was trying to help Henry to get some sort of order into what was a fairly chaotic situation  and to try to formulate some kind of strategy for the administration of a headquarters.
And  underneath it all  they were looking for the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out informing the links between various camps for Jewish DPs  who were coming out of the Russian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of reasons that weve already talked about.
And we  we didn't help him  because he was dead already.
This was the example how what other persons can can make like (cough) when there in ...this is a other uh other section when when the death march went to ...he sent his people on the way to help and they helped people.
End of Tape Four  Side B Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 151Beginning Tape Five  Side A This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure.
We talked about that and  and there was the notion that somehow if we got out  we might be able to help the others get out.
I -- I knew what the Russians were going to do.
He said I will begin to shoot and everybody will help me or --.
Those who will fulfill a mission of   they can never fail and they can never be harmed and we will be...go with you until the end and we will help you and we will assist you.
No  no [inaudible] My mother e-eventually  she gets the affidavit  she meets up with the brother who had written to me  you know  for help  and whatever money she has  not much  its some spending money  she she gives it to him.
And she said she had two friends in that camp  and she would like me to contact them because they might need some help.
And the fact that I cannot see that much now  but I live here  and I have a great deal of help.
And David -- did you tell David  or did he share it from [indecipherable] Oh he -- he knew also.
I met him on the street one day and he wanted to help me.
Well  I couldn't help it  my number was given and I had to go.
They have connectio n  you know what I -- we knew certain farmers worked with us.
We just looked at them and saw what we could do to help them and what the officers told us to do and that was it.
So  they made plans for underground activities because they were hoping that the Allies in the West  England and France would definitely help.
And by that time there were some guides  and people who would help  for m oney  would help you cross and so on  but you had to wait  because they couldnt take too many people at the same time.
A nd -- but also some peopl e who were there  who tried to help.
They will help you.ﬂ So when I came to Berlin  it was nighttime and there was no place for me to go and I didn t know really what to do.
She wanted to help but she was scared stiff and I understood.
They did not try to proselytize  they tried to help me in any way they could.
They didn't have enough help to clean everything 96 so when the British came  the place was just absolutely covered with dead people.
He was also half Jewish like I was  I didn't mention that.
We couldn't even escape because on the outside there was nobody to help us.
Because Chamberlain came to the Czechoslovakia   he made an agreement with Hitler  he Chamberlain was very trustworthy  and he carries a piece of paper that Hitler guaranteed peace in the in Europe  and guaranteed after the Sudetenland   Czechoslovakia gave  with the help of Beneı   and actually Chamberlain was pushing him  gave the Sudetenland to Germany  and Hitler promised thats it  and Czechoslovakia [indecipherable].
Not to be afraid to ask for help but also be ready to give a hand or to share your goods which you received and you consider yourself lucky.
And then  you know  I heard that there is a job on a farm  to milk the cows  to help with the far I was all used to farm like now I would go  maybe as astronaut I would be better.
So they in the summer they send us to a camp where we could help  you know  with the harvest or whatever  to work there  or do something.
We were in the hands of this 17 y ear old girl who worked for the OSE [indecipherable] the Secours Enfant  who managed to save 10 000 children out of the concen various concentration camp s  5 000 of which we re recaptured  and 5 000 of us who managed to surviv e the war because of their help.
Few days later he came and said  ﬁYes  you can go and help them.
And then on the other hand there have also been more countries that are willing to help them I think in the world.
But we were still young and we got  later on we got help from home  you know  with bread and stuff like that.
My husband continued to work with the children home because there was one or two place where immediately when the Russian army arrived here people was running out and left the children without any help.
I started school in America in the elementary school level  had no help from anyone in th e languages.
Went back to Berlin for the first time in '85  to the Olympic Stadium  uh  to help prepare for the celebration of Jesse Owen's golden anniversary of his winning those four gold medals.
But this is what we had  and we had to be satisfied with whatever help we could get.
She said  \ Oh my God  I'll be happy to help you.\
But there were conditions  and the conditions were ridiculous  and my father had refused help.
And and I liked my work because I was with people all day  talking to them and trying to help them and whatever I could in my capacity.
I wanted to help him escape so I gave him 100 000 marks.
But thats where my leanings ought to go  whatever I I I can do that will help other people  you know.
So I said  well  God help me  and I go to 88 both of them.
Chaim cannot see blood and there came once I remember was a train and all people died almost  and he had to help and all these sick people cutting off the legs; and they're very primitive there still in that time.
Anyway  my father set off  and he went to Barnfeld  and as he -- and now Ill have to quote him  because he tells this later  also in the interview  he -- he -- he reaches Barnfeld  and he goes there into a building  and behind a rickety table  he find three older -- older men  yeah  three older  Jewish men  and the -- and they said  ﬁCan we help you?ﬂ And as -- he said  ﬁYes ﬂ he said  and -- and Im trying to express this as naive as we were still.
And then a girl came who worked in the kitchen .
She was a clever woman and she said we'll give you some help and she brought in help  tutors and I needed help in mathematics  this was a high education in mathematics already.
And the primary job of these agencies was to help improve the conditions of the people there  because the camps hygienic and physical conditions were beyond descriptions.
Yeah  I mean -- I mean lunder -- yeah  lunders help men and -- and bergermeisters and -- and the mayors and all of this  what you feel in the mi nistry -- in the ministr y. Judges and -- and all what -- what you think in ministry.
They just knew that they  that they had to help hide people.
I even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the Sunday school maybe.
Well  question: When you got help from th ese farmers who let people get across  did you have to pay them anything?
But you know  I couldnt help feeling that I was not accepted.
And in August  in spite of the bombing  my father had asked me to drive his car  a small car  to drive the children of this family  to Valdentelvi  and stay with our friend Hua Pastore  and bring the children to Switzerland with the help of Tonio  who was a smuggler  and the Pastore  who were dear  dear friend  an elderly couple who [indecipherable] known for many  many  many years.
To a God that didn't help me when I needed Him?
My mother was look ing around to see if there was anything to help with me because she was carrying my sister.
Villagers were very generous  very helpful  the they realized that we were not equipped for this kind of life  and they were willing to share their tools or or kitchen materials of to to help us manage.
And your mother  did she work or was she at home?
Ha -- why dont America go to Tibet  and help them?
I dont know  I– how can you be that close  and then all in a sudden looking at you like  ﬁIm going to come at you and kill you?ﬂ And I got the picture of– well  thats  the picture wouldnt help you  and I got– here.
I mean  he was a very sick man and his son did not help him.
Now that Frieda  the one of the daughter...I use to help her and oh for some reason we liked each other.
And hes supposed to go to the airport  help her to go to the airport in New York.
And my father  special  helped many Polish people give some medicine  maybe not help too much and sti ll help some.
So it was hard  but with the help with others  they covered me.
And after classes I would go to the store  send him home to help in the hous e with the child.
An operatic singer to help me conduct a service  so at the beginning it was very cold because they did their Germanic music and I didn't get in to it.
I know that this world will take care of itself  with or without my help.
So if you don't mind  we're going to have ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 35 you all rise for that occasion.
I could have never done it without their help of strangers  who really didn't want any reward.
And there was confusion as to what language -- should they learn Hebrew?
I always figured  if something doesnt go our way  we have to accept it  because we never look -- she was trying to get medical help  and everything  but it didn t succeed  and so finally we gave it up  to take it as it comes.
And it's not the pain of my -- what hurt me but the feeling of my father  who was he lpless  that he could not help anything to his son.
So was a way to  to find more and more information what you want and to help and she  we gave to her to keep books and to give some other written material which were uh some leaflets for example I remember was at one point against the Germans  against the war.
Once they found out ...after maybe 48 hours  found out what we were trying to do  they tried to help themselves  you know what I mea n  a little bit  trying to get organized and...and getting the dead bodies  and we did make the people in Ebensee come in there and help too.
The -- as though -- programs were set up for claims by -- from the Germans  to property th-that had been taken away by the Germans and the allies set up s -- I mean the Americans  the British were less interested in it  I think and I dont remember what the Russians had -- we had four powers  but the Americans did something to help people claim back either what the Germans had confiscated or which they had left behind.
So -- and the organization  Kopernik organization  right after that decide d to give a -- help students in college  you know  give a grant  you know  give a scholarsh ip.
No  I am happy that I found out  but I am somehow angry that they didn't have any medicine to help him because to help some  how you say it?
I know that there were -- I think more Polish  maybe they were Polish Jewish  I dont know  than there were actually just Jewish people.
What would you like people to understand that perhaps they dont understand or fully appreciate about the Holocaust and the experiences you had?
Now -- and because of that  I engage sometimes  people to help  and to draw those colu mns  and to mark the different columns.
They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest will be confiscated and he will have to help to load up the trucks  himself.
But I think that every one of them and the Polish people and all the other people in the world that didnt help -- we need to remember that there were 12 million people killed during that time.
And when then this didn't help because we did know the truth  the Germans and the Ukrainians dragged down the houses.
How do you know  ﬂ I told her   ﬁ that God didn't bring me to your parents so that now I'll be able to help you ?
Regardless if that someone can help you or not  it -- its -- you know  its good to feel youre sharing something with someone.
Of course the people that helped us  I must say  we had a lot of help from certain Polish people and we were taken to a family of an engineer who was from the Underground and who kept me and my brother until my husband and the whole group -- they arranged a w hole group to go to Lublin.
So he told him...uh...a German Jew    10 uh...is here and he wants...and he wants to...uh...to...uh...make me to help him.
And I felt if I could help that kid  if I could do something for him but I didn't know what I could do.
And maybe what could help most for the...for my story now is that there was a time when in England when all the windows had to be black outed.
Some of our people are stupid enough to help the Jews?ﬂ She said what did that mean.
SE: He lives -- and Chaim had typhus and he helped -- Chaim helped him when he has typhus  when Chaim had typhus -- and t yphus  when you have typhus  you just dont know what youre doing  you go -- and it was in the winter and he didnt help Chaim.
Among other things  she got a sewing mach ine so that if necessary if she had to sew clothes  she could do that.
But finally after a while  put it this way  was a lot o f uh discussion  a lot of uh problem  the relation with others  not only with him  Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be democratic  to be communist and to help the communists.
Well  first of all  we didnt quite know what to do.
And he says: God Š where could they take us to Poland?
Maybe we were wrong  maybe we should have asked them 18 for some more help.
And of course  the Judenr at hoped that they would be a buffer to help  you know  mitigate some of these things  and so -- and then in November is when we started to go into the ghetto  and they gave us [indecipherable] a deadline of 30 days or 35 days  but they extended that because they just couldn t manage to get everybody in that they -- and then on the way to the ghetto  they would pick out older people.
You're from the market   he said  I'm going to try to get toget her with a couple of other farmers and see  perhaps  we can help you with some additional food.
We -- we -- because we had help with the children  so we could travel and we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 103 took a big trip.
Turned out th ere were people that were going  men mostly  that were going to go to our camp with horses and to help working in the woods  in the logging.
Saw a couple of people passed out  and they beat them up; and we tried to help  and they wouldn't let and wouldn't offer any help.
Now  I tried to help him as much as you could.
So he re was another very important...I don't know how much did help.
Did -- did you have anybody -- I mean  did you have a cook at home  too  to help prepare the meals?
So he lived  I rent ed the apartment to him and he gave me like  $25.00 or $3 0.00 a month  so that was a big help with paying rent.
And my mother com communicated with them in Polish in Yiddish  that Shapsa was coming to visit and he doesnt know his way around  and will you please come and and and help him with his luggage and pick him up at at and pick him up at the station.
Dutch police that went over to NSB3  as they called them; and when police came I say I'm a nurse and have come to help these people.
People became a little bi t more religious looking for help.
He used to help my uncle  which actually that was my father's uncle.
And was not lucky  my sister  Irena  who we please  we ask Ir ena help this family son  because the parents was a good -- not friends only  good business people  and we respect this.
She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka   which is called her charity box  and she would tell me  \ Yit-cola   to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our mitzvah   our commandment.\
And  I  I didn't I didn't get much to eat there.
Well  I have a a a very distinct memo ry of of him when he came out after he moved into the eastern Poland  he came back  you know  to help us get  you know  loaded and and things.
He found a box of ration cards and made some contact with uh with a Polish worker who was there who was willing to trade those ration cards for extra bread  and he was able to help me.
But again you couldnt officially call it Hach shara so we were assigned to help the farmers in the country as unpaid labor.
This was the only help  what I had from my sister.
Uh and these friends  they helped me an awful lot to get through it and I hope that I was able to help some of these people too.
And we were  and they help us to get down from the cars and was  they give us to eat Hafenflock with milk.
On th e other hand  we did have a Christmas tree  supposedly for the staff  to honor them.
Its quite an accomplishment to help put your husband through college  you know Yes  yes.
And I went to New York with my dad to help him buy inventory.
With the grace of the one of the few decent  non-Jewish-hating Christians  Jonas Petronis   I was able to become very successful and help all my family  and help all the people with whom I was ever involved in business  and many of my friends.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 13 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (rolling) (Camera roll 80  sound roll 46) (Take 18) EL: Yes  a very important movement in my creative work in the ghetto began when after Mr. Tory had talked to me and he introduced me to Professor Hy Nachman Shapiro who was in charge of the education of the  the art of the ghetto.
I had to help her everything  with everything  because she couldn't speak one word in Slovak and he couldn't speak a word of Slovak.
He needed transcripts from Pisa  so I  I sort of got a second thought and I said  ﬁI'll get you your Pisa transcripts ﬂ I was in Italy at the time  ﬁits no problem  but help me.
Well  there were axes to help  you know  sometimes  to start  you know.
So theres a what we ar e -- the [indecipherable] must help.
We followed it  you couldn't help but follow it  it was in the headlines all the time.
I dont like -- they look to -- to help other countries with the children  how about the children in America?
So there was an organization that in a way was trying to help them  with the language  with the daily life  with the profession  with health  that was called [indecipherable] brotherhood of America.
HL: -- which they were running  in order to get any help  which eventually they didnt give us anyhow.
And by the time we got there  the guide had already left on another assignment  and there was no one there to help us across.
I know its a lot of help  even for the children to go to camp  to he lp them in school  which I appreciate those things  because this is a very -- extremely important.
And even if you did get out in one piece  who would help you when you got out?
And the Poles were not so hot with the Lithuanians  and he may have been willing to help me  give me some food.
And all my classmates were ready to help  everybody help ed us there.
112 claims effectively  pursuant to the German laws or the military government laws  they would need legal help.
Then finally they came to the point  that is my knowledge of German  and with my experience in this work  I can build up myself a great career for afte r the war  and work with them  and do it -- help them [indecipherable] and so on.
And therefore he used to  so to speak  help out  you know.
The -- but Morris Fishbein was the director and I tried to -- we tried to help him as much 30 as we could.
I had a group of about USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 9 12 people.
I want to know and help people  eh  becauseŠand  and to educate people because some people are very naive.
I run away  and I run to a uh  friendly  gentle farmer  who had promised me to help me hide.
But that was uh a break we got  because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened.
We didn't know where  what's going to happen  but just...if any where we're taken or we can come back at any time and we need something to...to help us survive...whatever.
And we got into his place  and we told him the story  and he kept us  hiding  uh hiding  but later he used us as to help him work  and this was uh  I don't know what to say now... Tell me how big an escape it was.
I mean  the the English people help us with food  whatever  but what can they do?
I remember somebody said something about food  and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun and shot a cow and said help yourself.
And if I need some help  I could go into the Kommandatura   if you know whats Interview with Ezra Sherman May 16  2014 88 Right  yes.
They took them to help  at the place  the Auschwitz had Jewish people...uh the kapos were all Jewish too.
And to help people escape off -- unfortunately many were caught  because there was no way we could find civilian clothes for everybody  so we did the best we could.
Mrs. Blochman  my mother wants go to labor camp and please help us.
I had to take some food to help because starvation in Warsaw my mother and father heard about.
But this time they took a German and they told him they were dealing with him  like I told you  the Jews were help dealing with them Germans there.
you know) How can you (you know) look for that as your help?
So it happened that our family  from all the families 3 belonging to our big family  as it was so  wanted to help us.
Q. In what other ways di d you help each other?
End of Tape One  Side B Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 40Beginning Tape Two  Side A This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure  and this is tape number two  side A  and you were talking about how you we nt to your friend  the Ukrainian law student who was going to help you out.
For example  some -- we -- and we have not power for this  ou r organization I know -- not my unit  si -- in our organization help Jewish people who stop uprising.
But it was my parents knew about that  and I had that fever  and so I-I didnt even remember quite a lot.
He started to go to several banks in Cuba and asked for a loan to help him get started for a business.
And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help  then I...maybe I can do something  so we went to Sanspritz and I told him I'm available if you need me  and he said yes.
Not that I need -- I wanted the help to give out -- even to loan me the money  I wasnt -- because you must remember  I had no collateral.
People risking their lives and their families lives to help strangers.
B ecause I couldnt help her in high school or university like other mothers can And then you picked up English  right?
I 12 couldn't help it  and I went down with this Mrs. Niederman.
Ziegler Sargent of the Sargent lock company  who went out of his way to help these little Italian boys became a a very good friend of my parents  as a result.
I said of course but I can't  I have to help Mama feed the kids.
I didnt -- I knew thats -- thats -- I -- I -- I appreciate and acknowledge the help the Russians did to us.
I knew that I had some Gentiles  farmers  over there that I dealt with  with the hope that may be they could help us out.
So I asked them to give me help with math  to teach me math a little  and everything.
I looked at my father and he said  \ Well  you are a Jew.
In other words  give Akar  Armia Krajowa prepare a-and train Jewish people during the ar -- wa -- jury -- Jewish uprising and help was not possible.
So somehow I got with Selma there  I had some people help me  and we went from  from Poland we went uh  Odessa  with it was with the Black Sea we went  no  it took us first three months  it took us to Odessa  and then they kept us there for 3 months  and then with the boat we went to  to Marseilles and to Holland.

USHMM Archives RG-50*0244 15 Now under the direction of your troop  did the inmates themselves begin to help organize things?
Well from there which was a huge camp we was moved out to Auschwitz. [
It was at that time when my father had helped to organize or I mean help...with the help of the people because he made a small hospital of 50 beds which was called the contagious disease hospital.
So the next day everybody must help to clear out the dead  on the street.
And my husbands uncle lost a little boy by the name of Jerry so my son is Gerald David which he hates until this very day but he has to forgive me  I cant help it.
And there's a reason why Germany made all that camps and all the concentration 11 11camps  made it on Polish soil because they know that they will have good help from the surrounding  from the people because he didn't do it in any other country  not in Poland those things.
By contrast  although the French and the British were neutral  and in fact at times m-made terrible obstacles to try to help the -- the loyalists  you have to remember that because of -- of speaking French  I have to say that we were a very Francophile family  so I -- I had read French history.
I cant blame them hundred percent becaus e I know how dangerous it was to help Jews.
So -- but -- Did you get help from -- lets say  people who were living in villages  or -- No  no.
So I did go to the Judenrat  and told one official over there if he could help me.
I took my cousin  which spoke a beautiful Russian  and they told us ther e is one mayor  Pukavnik Straffski  we should go  he is a Jew and he is a very high rank officer  we should go to him and tell him the story and let him help us to find wher e Moishe Sonneson is.

Some were in very bad shape physically so we tried to help each other.
This is when the help should have co me  not today with the sending Clinton sends the army over there now?
I went there  went to the employment office  and there was a -- a real New York woman  a l -- I was going to sa y a lady  but to me she was not a lady  she was a woman who said  ﬁWhat do you want?ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  Im looking for a job.ﬂ ﬁWell  we have -- were looking for ri ﬂ -- this was just before Christmas  they were looking for Christmas help.
Two days later I received  Maxie has to come to stay here [indecipherable] I went over to my doctor to help me because I got cancer  I got operation that time.
They were talking  saying that nobody was there to help the Jews.
A. Well  it wouldn't be a legal thing to do  but let's say if somebody died in a house where we have that sitting shiva thing  there would a few other people to help out  but was there a place where we prayed  Rosh Hoshana  Yom Kippur?
And -- and then there were [indecipherable] where many of the religious young Jewish boys attended.
And they had formed this Vaad  just for the purpose of helping the Jews the war was ending whom they knew would come and needed help  even in Europe.
The story was I wanted to go to college   I dont have no money  could you please help me out  give me a ride  little bit.
And the American Consulate was of no help   as everybody knows.
No  he always had -- he -- hes operated a small business and he was not forward-looking enough that he would expand or get more help.
So when something  we  we could help each other  that's what we did  so  after the I don't I  I remember that the camp got bigger and bigger.
It was getting very bad in Paris in the beginning of 1942  and we knew two people that we had contact with  the Germans are really going to go after us  with the help of the French police.
So  did you make the soup because you didnt have any help?
So that was the assumption so you couldnt have a full time live in help but you could have part time.
And I -- with the help of an assignment from the World Bank  where I was working [indecipherable] in the 90s  I made my way back to that place.
The Italian officers would measure  and find the appropriate place  a nd then you would -- the villagers would help with labor to cut the logs  and also with materi al such as nails  and things like this  as well as labor  to assemble the bridge.ﬂ A nd so he gave me official orders signed  whatever it was  I dont even know if it -- there was a seal.
Did they have any help  you mentioned the Ukrainians and the Slovaks lived in the area  did any of these people help the Hungarians?
And being disturbed by it  I  my battle was to give these people back their humanity  give them their names  connect them to family  tell them where they are in the scheme of things  and uh  just to help them to help themselves back to a uh  a dignity that uh  they were entitled to. [
I took my wife and my daughter  who was born in the United States  and we went there for a visit to the place where 17 500 Jews of that city was shot  murdered by the Germans with the help of the Ukrainian police over there in the place of Susneke  the woods  which I knew before the war very well and they were all shot.
That I think about it  you know  because m-mother was thinking of them  of the soldiers  that they need help  too.
And and you know  when that war started  I remember  God help the Hang on a second.
I remember I w -- I tried to help out as a nurse  and when they brought the -- a wounded soldier and I was supposed to wash his head -- he was wounded in the head -- I was supposed to wash off from the blood  so that he can be treated  and -- and I kind of blacked out.
Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible.
And that was one of the reasons  as a matter of fact  that we were saved is because the man who gave us  was his name  who gave us the false passports  said that he he had selected us to help because we did not have Semitic features.
Under the help  under the supervision and help of Lutheran  Lutheran Church.
He ca me before us  and he said  \ You come to America.
And we left everything  and we moved to this town  to Lida with -- compar ing our -- our conditions that we lived  with the help  and with the luxury and with -- with the -- with all kind of -- of what do you call this on the floor  the rugs  the Persian rugs  and all that going and its such a mess  its -- it was like th -- going in a stable.
I kn ow that they tried to help  there were people who tried to help each other.
So  she was so disappointed that she wanted to go back to Poland  and the brother's children they tried to help her.
What did your mother do to help get herself and -- you described her to me as she was motivated solely by trying to make life better for you.
I told them I didnt like it  but I had to help support  you know  the livelihood.
She started thinking we had nowhere to go  but with the help of her friends they came up with this idea of g etting papers from a priest.
And the main purpose is to get together and to make some drives and collect some money to help our older people who are destitute out in Israel.
It would have been a point of reference  I would imagine we would have attempted to -- to go there  thats the only point  just out of sheer gratitude  and they -- probably knowing them -- th eyre long dead now  and I honor them accordingly  Im sure they would have done everything possible to -- to help us  or to put us up  or it wouldnt matter what it would have been.
We thought  well  we ought see this man who's making such a difference in our liv es  and low and behold   one of the horses kicked my mother  and the police were very solicitous and wanted to know our names so that they could  I guess  give us some sort of help  and we were very anxious not to tell them that our name was Nusboum  and my mo ther looked just like a Christian woman.
You just were there to -- to help them with any  really  bureaucratic problem.
If -- if you get hit on the -- on the street  I help.
She said  \ Help me  because I am unable to do that.\
Because we said he came in later  we sit down  there was Jimmy Glynn  there was a couple wh o help us move  and we had dinner with them  and this white guy  he said  ﬁHow come you dont invite me there?ﬂ ﬁWell ﬂ I say  ﬁyou a southerner  you dont like black people  I didnt want to have any friction.ﬂ ﬁDamn it  Im going.ﬂ And he came in and sat with us.
And that way I could help shift people from one hiding place to another or like American soldiers -- shot down people other people who were underground -- .

And he said  because you know  because the we have some problem here  maybe we you can help us.

>> Bill Benson: A couple of questions before we get to that.

German guards were standing around watching us uh with uh--uh machine guns and towers.
They had many friends  in quotations  but none would or could help but rather left them to the hungry Wolves  the Jews.
And there were German men who were the people who worked all the time and we had to help them .
In the prison  we just we just tried to help her.
We were alwa ys clean  I don't know when she washed  when she used to take us from school and bring us from school and help us with the lesson what she could and give me private teacher when I needed  when I was a little worse in some st udies or somethings.

People ask me -- I go and speak  they ask me  what percentage of Pole s would kill a Jew -- Im not talking about Germans  Im talking about Poles  what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew  what percentage wouldnt kill  but wouldnt help  and what per centage would help?
And uh I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors  I somehow...I suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person or some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to remind me of... But I...I can't get it back.
He would say he was going to help us  you know  with the studies or whate -- very friendly  very nice man and I -- I was always lacki ng a fatherly figure.

Now  she was a  she was  she liked to cook  and she was– well  I had a help in the house too  not all the time  but a couple times a week.
I had  and that is  goes for so many of the refugees.
Maybe the main reason is because I experience hunger in my life so I can understand it better  and I think being in the riches country in the world we should  we help everybody else.
And over there we came and we came to a family .
My mother did go to a number of different places where she got some help.

And did you know of did you know that there were people wh o were Jews?
I went to the German  please  help  help me save the lady's life  just give me a little wagon so I can pull her.
B ecause if you full  then you lo ok for something else to do  to help somebo dy else.
We knew each other for about... Basically  she had a fiance in Holland; and I was doing everything trying to help the girl back to him.
And  because they would give me help  money they would give me  they had money.
Why should -- and the se -- the -- the aim is the same  to save -- that time was the Russian army  to help the Russian army.
He should see you and see whether he can help you to get rid of it.\
So we then we tried to tell the local population  the local Jewish population  our our own people in in the Jewish Community Center.
>> Bill Benson: One other question I want to ask you.
I remember even taking lessons because uh .. to learn how to make marzipan so that she would be able to have something that you can make a living in if she came to anothe r country and I would help her do that somehow  it never came out too well wh en I did it.
We're trying to assist her a little bit  we help her.
I was singing  and two other girls  we made a trio  and we sang Shuman's \ Dream\   and the melody and we sang our prayers  an d we knew  we had an organization  the help to make it  to help  it's the hand who helps.
So we had to start a little bit to help to work  but we didnt got no professions.
Two beds and a wardrobe  you know  kind of a wardrobe and some help to us this   because people can occupy any apartment where they wanted to do.
And then after the  she had a baby  and we all pitched in to help.
>> Bill Benson: In fact  you had a very frightening experience when your mother tried to help -- >> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
You know  I belong -- I donate a lot of money to the Jewish Federation.
At that time  Lithuania  in origin  people who could create Lithuania didn't exist  so they asked Jewish people to help them.
It is part of what was the reality  and what somebody had to do in order to survive  and help a loved one get out.
Anyhow  I know th e ideas were very good  very nice  to help each other -- yes  freethinker.
Shes very good to us  you know   she know both of us survivors and she try to help us.
And um...they tried to...to help us  you know  with  you know  what we needed to have; everything we needed  you know  our parents.
What you did and what your family did when--and what happened?
But she was able to help us out in that part of our family tree  so the internets a great thing.
And I told you  over a period of time it just sort of built up in me until I really began -- any chance I had to help holo caust victims or whatever it is  we did.
For instance  the Kapos would help themselves before they would divide it.
Uh  it was painful because we gave our hearts  we gave our our efforts  we gave everything we had to help.
What they say they help the Jews going to  Poland and Germany  but they went after it and they know that they made a mistake and we were already one or two days.
He offered to help me and this -- this was like a miracle.
And she said  \ Oh yes  I can cook and clean.ﬂ And he said  \ Fine  and you can help out.ﬂ And my mother said  \ What about my husband?\
It means that th ey should clean  they should help when the prisoners  deportees  came.
Help him get -- well  he chopped the wood and all this and that.
He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was studying to be a teacher.
So when I came back and I looked down what's going on  so I figured -- I went  I went to a farmer and asked if I can be a help there  as farmer's help.
Well  my journey in the united -- to the United States  was basically at the time  that I had family  and I thought that they would be of help for me to get organized  and settled.
So I was wandering and finally I have seen a shop  a bicycle repair shop and I asked them if they need help.
The other question of the help for the rescue of the children and youngsters  and bringing them out to Spain and to Switzerland.
We were there to help and do what we could do.
She had a maid  and her youngest sister came quite often to help out   and was the recipient of a lot of good deeds from my father.

And she's always have  by that time they were doing well and so she had full -time help  and she would just absolve me of any responsibility of any kind and we'd come and we'd each have our rooms and in each room there was new things han ging  clothes for me  clothes for the kids  I mean it was just amazing.
And you cant help yourself that you struggle  because otherwise  if you look what people went through  and for how long they went through  and still looked for ways (you know) to survive the day  I think theres a lot to that  that And then of course everybody will say luck plays a role.
Now  the problem with that was first of all  there was a built-in anti Semitism on the part of almost all of these non-Jewish workers who had come to help the Germans.

As I say  the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well  probably because I felt guilty that I couldnt do more to help them  that they all have forgo tten the bad part  and of course  compared to the concentration camp  this at least meant some secu rity  but that they didnt know to which country they would go.
They were guards more  the guards where we worked  sometimes they help the Germans  or were by th emselves  so there was just somebody watching over us.

Anyway  and he told  said to me  that I pray that God should help you should survive.

I used to get up in the morning  if we set  if we were in the house  I used to help her peel potatoes  make the pancakes for  the men used to co me from the field.

My town  nobody would help you  no one would help you.
They would help out with things a school would need  they we re especially instrumental in providing vitamins  winter clothes and help with sending children to camp s like the one we had been in  in 1940.
indecipherable] who were coming to Poland and need help  so helping  and somebody informed the Germans  somebody who knew about it  I dont know who it was  that they have money  they put money in the wall  and the Germans came to the -- to the houses  they took out the money  and they took Marek  and they hanged him  and they called the whole Jewish -- I dont know  every -- the whole Jewish people from Richmond  to -- to -- to Shinkaveetcha  I forgot -- I forgot the number who had -- we had USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 70to come and s-see how he -- th ey hanged him.

Because it's up to each one of us to help our communities.

If you help me to get a passport I will go out.
And I think the the help came from the good  old U.S.A.  you know  so and then fa I th ink contribution was also made by the Polish president to build in the area where they have nalewki   and that was that infamous Umschlagplatz .
Because in Auschwitz if you dont have somebody to to support you  to help you  y ou cant be live.
And I was sitting in Germany and waiting and in 1948  when Truman was President  they passed a law that all the DP people  displaced persons  can come in  to to be admitted to this country  and my uncle from Brookline  Massachusetts  sent me a contract that I won't be a burden to the United States Government and he is taking full responsibility to help me and to support me  and then I got a visa  permit to come to this country  and while I was sitting in  and while I was waiting to be interviewed by the CIA...they interviewed me and everything went fine.
I was going with a fellow then and he said  ﬁThe word is that youre too friendly.ﬂ I says  ﬁI cant help it.ﬂ I said  ﬁTheyre nice young men.ﬂ Most of them were very young.
And so  but we saw Arolsen  how it is organized and all that  and and I dont think they they have enough help.
There is nobody out there in this whole world that's going to give me a hand out to help me.
We were doing everything to help each other  but we coul dn't do anything against the planes which were bombarding and thousands upon thousands of people...civilians were killed from the German bombardment  Jews a nd non-Jews.
He expressed his regrets that he cant help in any other way.
It was -- because I can now understand how my parents felt  of me being so fa r away  and not being able to see me  help me.
They liked me and they felt that they could use me for purposes because they did have a lot of German prisoners and I could help them in interpreting some of their cases.
And when I came from school at four oclock  five oclock  I had to change into uniform and help serving dinner.
A. Well  at that time the soldiers were coming up and they tried to help us to get where we wanted to go.
And he said  \ Yes  because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas  and you are going to be able to help Jews.
Nothing but help from the Christians  you know  some passengers helping  helping  they helped to step how high the boxcars from the throwing in the  helping  pushing and shoving into  the Jews into the boxcars.
It was an appeal to the Poles to help our brothers fighting in the Aryan...in the Warsaw ghetto.
If I take her out and get married to her  either we stay married if I want; otherwise...but she will help me with a lot in business as a businessman.

So we...we have done it for about week  leaving money in the ruins of the ghetto to help the...the Wodawa girls.
And and she th-they had a boy and my mother had my sister.
who also wouldnt help the resistance in many ways  or would denounce people.
7 So he dressed -- h e got Mr. Bereczki help him  dressed as a Polish peasant with the typical kind of coat  jacket that they wore.
What can I help what my grandfather may have done  and so forth.
They needed to get out  and could he please help them get into Kenya.
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 69 We are here to help you.
And I came to the idea to try to resi st  to do help people to stay alive as long as possible.
And then they started helping my father in his four leather shops  and that was a great help having family to run these different shop s. It was not a leather shop in the way you think of it in the United States.
So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.
So what happened  I worked the first room  the dining room   the chandelier.
We knew that he was sick  we didn't know -- he says  \ You know  I could use your help  and it's better for you to come there.
An-And -- and was it that general situation that you were i-in opposition to  or were there specific cases that you were -- Well  in the meantime  the arrested all the -- the activists that -- all those who applied for exit and were refused  so we had the list of refuseniks  and we produced bracelets with their names  and some sort of hanging with their names  and we went to various synagogues and as ked them adopt one of these refuseniks and com -- and correspond with them  a nd send them help.
That was something that we have to do  to help others.
And my father was helping my -- my mother because it was easy fo-for him  she needed help.
And this is the Christian family that was of such help to us in Poland  helped us survive.
And then I think  ﬁWell maybe I should get help w ith this ﬂ but then -- then I dont like that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 108 idea  because thats -- thats -- thats like finking out  or you know.
So  then  when I lost my job fa -- in February  there was a -- a group -- and every town had a group  too  just -- the work that I did later on  i-in Portland -- there were some people who did it before  they used to help refugees find jobs  find unemployment  find apartments a nd so forth  because there were some had families and children.
And I  it came out  I made very good money  so I was in a situation to support myself and help my parents.
He said  ﬁYou think this guy  you know  this doctor  can help me?ﬂ He was in bad  bad shape.
And Rottenberg had some family in southern Germany still  and he asked whether he could help him to -- to bring them out.
I mean people found work due  due to the Olympics  or help the Nazis to  to succeed.
They were  in those days  to give you another example  they were -- to help a Jewish girl find a husband and get married was a big mitsveh.
That what youre trying to do is really not a turnover  turn everything upside down  that were filing law suits every time– but what were trying to do is help the community and be good citizens.
And I think I went through a very bad time  and I I I got help  and I think it helped a bit  but it it made a mark.
My sister always sit in school  and there were many childr en who needed help and education.
This was a very short time help from place to place.
So the Jewish community was organized as a community and in that way was uh there 8 was a liaison to the Germans.
In recalling the events in chronological order  I will mention other people who opened their homes and hearts and decided to help this relatively small group to escape the evil Nazi intentions.
Anyway  I was in Bombay now and I wanted to get -- learn something  something that would help.
She had her own contact reels  yeah  the Belgian Jewesses  and she could help  because she could come into our o ffice  and ask for favors any time  and she was [indecipherable] yeah.
Well  be that it was right  be that it was wrong  maybe the legal heads that we had trying to help us were not the greatest  and the best  but its a known factor that American people  including the Jews  do not ever want to see a change in the Second Amendment of Free Speech.
But I didn't want that my son should ever think for one day that I didn't try to help his father -- to save his father.
Did your grandmother help your grandfather in this job  in this work that hed had for this I ha dont know.
No  it was not -- it was not funny for them  it was not funny for my da -- but she -- Mother could not help.
They were supportive  they helped you if you needed help  th ey were nice.
That means that she takes care of the Block  and she has a little bit more to eat; and she could help us out.
ML: There was no help and besides  within a week  I had a job.
How did -- well  let me ask you it this way  how did it come about that you decided to help these Jewish -- these 12 -- Because how many times we was there?
We first went to HIAS in Vienna  and with their help we were able to take care of the formalities in a rather uneventful way.
And by the time  1974  I get an offer from a friend of mine in Switzerland to come and help him  he was a director of a school in a childrens village in Switzerland  Pestalozzy  very famous childrens village  Pestalozzy Childrens Village.
In his work with [indecipherable] the other German  he was simply calculating how to save most of Jews  how to help as many as possible Jews to survive.
Unlike in Lvov  for example  89 where -- where there were just volunteers galore  you know  to -- to help to enter the ghetto.
I went to Sweden to help Denmark acknowledge as Allies  also by Russians.
I mean  I myself was already Lutheran for uh so many years; but that didn't help  that doesn't he lp  you know.
Uh  for instance  the Germans  the SS  the guards  they were trained how to treat us.
Yes  because  as I said  because of the people who were coming to my father for help Okay. --
Im doing well  Ill help you.ﬂ I said  ﬁFine  fine  fine.ﬂ And every month or so  I used to go to see him in Tel Aviv and we were good friends.
So...uh...that's when the Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the refugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country  from...if it's from...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France  etc.
He wa -- because of the person he was  he knew people and -- and he wo uld go out and say look  theres a school here  you know  so cant you help?
I help you  and let's make it.ﬂ We didn't have any material so she took off her bra and in the bra was a double lining so she took the lining and make for me a...a little bag  and I put in all these pictures  and the pictures thanks to this you have it now.
What he dwelled on instead in hi s talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people did to help each other survive.
But I really  honestly and truly  wanted to do what I could to help.
If you would go  it was then  you know  agencies took care of all that  and they would help you and do it.
Save me  help me.ﬂ And thats when he heard my voice.
You can go after a career  or back to school  whatever you ﬂ -- but they couldnt help me.
Boldratt said you may have to help him out many times because sometimes he cannot get off the bed but once he does get off the be d and you put the crut ch under his arm  then he's all right.
So we felt we had to help  but we didnt know what to.
But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn't really help.
And then we wanted some help from some organizations he re and my uncle  who was a brother to my father said  ﬁLets go down.ﬂ I think they went to the HIASs.
We have -- go and get -- get some --ﬂ I said  ﬁNo.ﬂ I said  ﬁ I don't budge from here til you don't help me bring in those potatoes.ﬂ She -- she helped me bring in those potatoes.
Was she passing information that would help people in a resistance?
Help is gonna come from th ere  you know  that was the promised land.
And he tried  with wh at limited medical facilities he had  he tried to help these people  but there was malnutrition  there was starvation  it was sores  it was beatings  it wa whatever.
I don't wonder... As you think back and uh as you've certainly shared with us many interesting insights  was there any one experience that comes to mind through these years of internment that you haven't shared with us that could help to characterize your feeling as as you've expressed it before?
Maybe he took advantag e of me at the time  because I was able to help him.
The Germans were coming to help the Italians celebrate  so they [the Italians] had to demonstrate how good they were as far as the Germans are concerned.
So actually many Russian people then stayed there  even the Russian army told them to stay there and help through the uprising.
And as we came to Vienna  we were aided already by the Joint Distribution Committee to and they  they really encouraged us not to go any further because they said that they would like to help the students.
They asked to help -- the same Lithuanian people  they slaughtered them.
And he asked if they would go and see him so that he can help me so he can possi bly return to France.
I told my help don't call me unless the house is on fire.
I have Russian officers who quite frequently looked for my help.
So he says to me  you see  even them  not all of them  but few Im sending this  I cant help mysrlf.
All of this happened with the help of the official Hungarian police force and gendarmerie.
You said that your uncle tried to help your family leave Poland and come to the United States  where was he living at that time  your uncle?
If anyone would help you  it was the girl who laid next to you.
Thats it.ﬂ And then the -- the pain got so severe  that even the 350 milligrams of morphine -- she used to get a patch -- didnt help no more.
You need help and other people too to 111 advise you.
And none of them had money over there  so I tried to help my brother  help my -- both of my brothers.
But the overriding factor  I believe  was something inside me that just wanted to help.
Did you help out on the farm also  or it was just Well  I helped out if I didnt bother anybody.
But from the other side  we got some financial help  but we saw them for the first of January or something  but not– But not on a regular basis?
And where you find Jewish community there who c ould -- who -- they knew that they would take care of them.
Uh  the transport that I mentioned and the date I found that after war because uh there is a book which was made uh  uh  published with the help of the French governme nt and I think the Krazfelds had the hand in it and I have the book and in this book is my name  my parents  name  nationality  date of births  and the people that I was with on ou r transport  and from then I found after the war that our transport was transport number 31 out of Drancy  and I understand there total of 75 000 people involved in transports out of Paris  out of Drancy  and  like I say  we were transport number 31 and that transport left on the 12th of September  1942 for Germany.
They could not give us so much as an apartment  but I got a room and my moth er could help with the garden  which she loved to do and I can go to school.
Nobody was able to help me and I thought OK  I will find...and they began to ask which way  which how how looks like this...and I thought that when I went in there was in the middle was the staircase and something I thought and then I thought OK  I will find.
He said well the Germans left that establishment last night and I found a wonderful desk which I'd like to take home  but my wagon broke  so if you' re not in a terrible hurry could you help me carry that.
If a relative in New Yo rk or Kenosha  Wisconsin came to them and said I have a relative  so and so  can you help them ge t out.
Maybe the they were too religious and b-believing in something that cannot help us.
First of all  to help give medical care to the contagious sick person.
It's one they decided to liquidate the hospital and liquidate the doctors and just burn the whole thing up...the whole flame  and didn't let anybody to go and help them.
So basically  basically  uh as the international situation  there is a war help us to be liberated from the pr ison.
The disadvantage in this respect was that  no matter what parents would say to their children  they always had a place to go and because these rock groups had open house  you could help yourself at the fridge  or whatever  eating  or no matter how young you were  you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it.
You have to suffer.ﬂ They say  ﬁJust a minute  let me think about.ﬂ Its psychosomatic  I mean  everything is in your hea d. ﬁIm going to adjust you  but I dont know if I going to help you.ﬂ ﬁWell  so dont touch me. [
People who went -- came alone  I tried to help a lot  because I felt so bad for them.
At th is time you have to pay something  dues for this time when you should be over there  it was not so simply  you know  that I just see my mother  I was on cemetery my father  cemetery because with my wife my wife [indecipherable] cemetery his pa rents  you know  because his parents -- her parents was in the cemetery  it was [indecipherable] few friends  and go back right away out to visit  when we go to Austria  to the cousins  one she was help her to get out from the Poland  stay over there  you know  free country  the [indecipherable].
He said that this guy was arrested; that he killed I don't know how many Jews  and \ He is calling that he saved your life  and he wants your help.\
So when you come there an-and tell them  hey  Ill help you get to Sweden  and they -- they are inclined to go along with you.
And she said  \ I want you to help me when we go through the main door\  -- not door.
So  I was also a domestic help working for other Jews who were still wealthy in the ghetto.
That once he could help them  but who knows what would happen the second time.
That  of course  was a big help  because then  during those two year s  I used my furniture  rented an apartment with borrowed money  and sublet rooms to other st udents.
And if they help me to tell it better  perhaps I would do better job at it.
And we had a friend  a good friend of the family  he was like dealing with the NKVD all the time  you know  trying to you know  to [indecipherable] the money  to help people out  or whatever.
Could I possibly help with getting food supplies because even had they the money  it would have been very difficult to buy food in France at that particular time in history.
Came an order from the general  right 28 away was help because I was laying there and bleeding.
And they were  they had to risk their own life of course too  to get all this  and having to take care of all those children  which I didn't know at that time  uh they they had an enormous job  so sometimes they brought me cards  and the family that I lived with had to have some help because we had no food.
We have nothing against those people; they didnt help us  but they didnt kill us.
Actu ally  you felt good that they asked you to come in to their house to help them out with these chores.
And finally we came to -- shortly before Warsaw  we came on foot so -- and -- and -- and then the population  mostly the Jewish population ha -- had prepared drinks  and broth  and everything to try to help us to get [indecipherable].
And with the help of the uncle which came  we we nt to Belgium as I said.
Did you have any classmates who you felt were struggling  that you had to help out?
The Joint and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established 24 camps  with the help of the army  for various gr oups  eventually for all people.
And did the did he have any help to do it  either by hiring people  or with the children?
We accepted a family who stayed with us till  till the uh German took over Krakow  some of those people survived  some of those people perished   but the hospitality of Polish Jewry to those people who were expelled by the Germans from Germa ny  this spirit of ------- was the best you  in the most humane way  everybody was trying to help  and shelter them and feed them  and protect them even though they were outsider.
In that time we had a lot of work and the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular transport from Minsk.
But I think the pictures are very help ful because they trigger... Yes  well  we were able to id entify for them qu ite a few people.
And your mother  did she work or was she at home?
Well  as I told you before  the conditions in ghetto were very  very bad  and because I worked outside  I could help a litt le bit and we could surv...we were not starving  and also because my aunt was a nurse  she found herself also a job.
He started marching us out  what help ed us most was it was dark.
Some of the leadership or most of the leadership was in favor of trying to enlist the help of sympathetic Bulgarians and the Church and the courts rather than engage in demonstrations and clashes with the police.
So we decided we are going to go wait out  and we got affidavits from my aunts  and with the help from the HIAS  we came to Bremen  it was October  this was two days before Rosh Hashonah.
And they did it with great risk to themselves  you know because the Germans were particularly you know against the Jews and anybody who would help them.
So  and the other thing is that we never went off on too many vacations with our children  without our children  you know  fri ends of ours would go off and leave the kids  you know  either with a grand parent  we didn't have a grandparent to leave them with  or with a maid and I never di d that  I never had a full time maid  you know  I only had help  but I didn't have a full time maid taking care of children  I was always there and consequently our children always came on vacation with us.
Because most of these people were in a small farm [indecipherable] and all that  so they needed help.
And so the help that he gave you then during th e time that your father was away was enough for you and your mother to– [talkover] Yes.
And they said if you help me she said with the children on this trip I'll pay your expenses.
So  unbeknownst to anyone  we we had could no longer have help in the house unless they were Jewish.
So when I had a chance  I was trying to help.

They were very interested and very helpful and he said  ﬁYou know what  I think you need to go to university.ﬂ And I said  ﬁI dont think I can make it  because I dont have the ccredentials.ﬂ And he said  ﬁWell help you.ﬂ And I said  ﬁAnd I dont have the money.ﬂ And he said  ﬁWell fund you  and I want you to discuss it with your family.ﬂ But the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 43 family felt I should not accept it  it was too much of a responsibility and a burden  which  in retrospect was a bad mistake.
So he didn't succeed with this either  so  it's a few things that didn't help him very much.
Now  if they have a good one of the family who was a Communist and he was not afraid to help them  not afraid  some denied  \ Okay you are my cousin  but I know who you are  so please leave me alone.\
Later on in 35  when the general conscription started  he was off trying to help people.
Because they know if I can help  I will take them out.

As you were growing up  did you meet any Jewish people?
With the help of the...uh...villagers and priest  found a small house in one of the villages in the valley and so we...uh  you know  settled in there.
Yes  and it was tragedy  because these people were very honest  very good friend  because when my father  in moment when Germany wants to finished with [indecipherable] he propose to hi-hi help  especially this girl which was my age  beautiful girl  to take as child.
But to do that  you need the help of everybody to understand  to begin with  the danger  then this government represents.
So we are in Buenos Aires now and I stop people on the street  asking them to help me with a pesos or two.
And then he asked me if I would like to go back to France  work with him  to get French sign language recognized in France.
A lot of -- end up institution  a lot of my friend end up insti -- one of my friend which she help me  when I dig out mine uncles at the -- and I wa nt to send her to Israel  send her a present.
Look  I have to start the war against Poland and if you don't help me as a good friend  then the whole thing is for not.\
AG] They would  they wouldnt believe what the Germans had been doing [DL] And did you try to explain to them? [
First I stayed in bed for six months  that didnt help because I was do -- what happened was  when I weighed -- I mean  I came here  I weighed 150 pounds  you know?
Yeah  they had the school  trade school  and the arch  one of the [indecipherable] And in addition to that  were they asked to take care of any of the administration of the center  or help in any of the duties?
So  I walk up to Bauer and I say  ﬁCaptain Bauer ﬂ I say  ﬁI found my sister  can you help me?ﬂ He says  ﬁWhere is she?ﬂ I said  ﬁShe's in the ba sement.ﬂ He says  ﬁDon't worry  I'll help you.ﬂ And he goes down with me in the basement and Lisa sits in the basement.
And the Russians were there to back us up  to help us with this.
Is this something that you arranged yourself or did you have somebody in for th -- I had -- the paintings I arranged myself  I had -- I had a professional help  she helped me out the -- to put together things  but the paintings  I take full credit for them.
Did the people in Tresse know that you were Jewish  apart from the woman who help [indecipherable] Yeah  yes  some people knew we were Jewish  yeah.
Also  when the husband was arrested  wh ich happened very often at that point  or had some running in with the police  it was the women who went in and tried to to talk to the police and tried to help the husbands.
And interest ed  very  I should come and hell try to help in every way.
Jews have more than almost any other group has tried to help blacks.
She knew how to sell  but she didnt help out in the business either because she she did the cooking.
But nothing ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 happened.
So I  what I s tart   I had my mother to help me so I did an internship at the University of Maryland in Baltimore   preventive medicine.
A day I remember with great joy and great pleasure  but it wasn't a day that help the kind of excitement that one would expect to see in the movies.
It didn't make any difference to me as long as I was able to provide a little help for my helper.
There were a lot of informing going on which would help?
They were just going to trial and they needed some help in getting the thing going.
He was thrown down by a parachute  to help the partisans  whatever.
I used to help a whole lot  you know  some people .
And I shouldnt say that  because I help people write their grant proposals  thats how I make the major part of my income now  you know  and -- and thats fine  they just dont know how to write it  and Im teaching them how to do it.
And sometimes people thought that certain filters would help it or -- they tried it and they -- It didnt.
We can always make it and they will help us  make illegal.
And we try to you know  to help you along to understand why you should le ave some money  why its so important for the museum to stay open.
Yeah  well we got word from Umschlagplatz that my mother was there and she was asking for help.
To help people  you know  if they needed a transition from a difficult period.
It would help me considerably  rather th an just answering my question  if you could say something like  \ I remember this for me started in Europe.\
Even in danger  its its a its a tradition  and i-in fact   in danger  they they sense that there is a common enemy  and we have to help one another.
As I said  we lived along the border  and people came to us illegally and we had a sort of an underground railroad  where we would help the people that came in  got a taxi for him in the town of Arcen  where we lived.
Today you would have to put the equivalent of billions for the kind of help that we had at our disposal.
Even we went to a village where they sounded an alarm and chased us with picks and shovels  and we  way down  we went into the same house  armed  said  \ Good evening \  and they says right away  \ How can we help you?\
During the war when -- when the -- the Hungarian Nazis took over the government and they rounded up all the Jews.
I tried to help out because my brother  he was six feet and two inches tall  and he got four kids.
Like here  we have neighbors who will help you if you need them.
They used to go around and ------ask people for money to help the underground.
Its just quite– when you think about it  I mean I think that always  you just couldnt help but be impressed by these folks  who were  many of them were just hard-working peop le  who wanted to have the same opportunities or just to have the same right as everyone else.
There was a lot of people that they were smuggling like food and other articles from villages  the food probably mostly  and she started to talk to somebody on the train and she gave an address to a German Volksdeutsche  that they needed help for their homes.
I had to go over with them to help th em there.
She said  ﬁDo you have people you would like to help and you cant.ﬂ I said  ﬁYes  Ive got heads of families who are non-Jews.ﬂ And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew because they would fit into a new community.
So they were very  very happy to see us and welcome us.
No nothing would ha ve help it  just miracle thing  and and thats what happened is the way we pulled through.
Uh so my brother had kind of a place where he could go and so when we heard that we might need to go too  my mother contacted the Catholic priest again and said  you know  we have to go too.
We have to help these people but we have to help each  our own people too  because hatred/they its so big against the Jews and the whole world ?
And I was very stubborn and so they had us both go and we went to Balmal   to another convent and there it was  it was a farming convent and we used to help take care of some of the livestock.
Has it been– is that something that you really think about a lot  about the Holocaust era and about your family and about– maybe can you just talk more about that?
So  they want to pa y back to him  to help him.
They always did it for some better reason  to save thei r mother  to save their somebody  to help someone survive.
Im sure it wasnt eas y  you know  but there was nobody else that could help me at the time  only her.
We went in the back  they told us that we can help ourselves to food  which was in a ba rrel  there were herrings.
But we did have to walk a little bit because if the horse needed go up on a hill  we had to go down and push the hor push the whole thing because help the horse along.
Of course  we we didnt have this this help  the necessary you have to hel have to you have to have outside help in order without outside help  you cannot you cannot do anything  you know.
And we manage ag ain  with the help of a -- how would you call it  of city manager of a little community by Opa tia  you know  in the northern -- little commun -- maybe 1200 population.
If you want to give me a fine  I can't help it but I don't have money.\
I don't remember this but they tell me -- my sister told me and also an aunt that there was a 45 -year -old woman who used to come in and help.
We only had the Swedish and help we got from the Portuguese.
We would help them contact their friends and relatives and people they wanted to find and generally provided  or course  food  clothing  etc.. 21:30 This was a complete job which we had to do apart from our military service.
But theres just too many people that need help  w ho cannot help themselves.
It was called a st first it was Standard Oil of of Ohio  and dus she apparently talked to him and so forth  whether he would be willing to help and so send an affidavit and described to him th e circumstances and he agreed.
We know it that they couldn't help to save the tanks  where would they save.
And its a very funny thing  I served the whole time in the service and I was not even a citizen  but a -- and being in the service didnt help my citizenship because it took another while befo -- when I got out of the service  to find out why I didnt get my citizenship.
They were...they were involved in contacting the underg round and trying to plead for help...sending informa tion to the...to the world pleading for help.
Well  by uh sheer accident  I was awarded the uh by the French government  the Croix de Guerre and I was asked to obtain the uh  oh I gotŠI see the puzzle in your face I was awarded the Croix de Guerre because of my help to the French Jewish survivors during the year that I was in Paris and I was asked to come from Frankfurt to Paris  to the Hotel de where the medal would be given to me by uh General deGaulle.
So she agreed that she will  with our help  will help make Matzahs for us.
All we needed him for is to  to  to help us survive  to  to protect us from the outside world.
This wa s the very early days  to come in to help us with that.
I think the factory was bad for her  and she used to go and  you know  kind of help my father a little bit.
And -- and I use -- and he used to be on the block first  where I was  and I used to help that baby  a boy  he was nine years old  a lot.
And he gave me a needle and he ran out fast because he was afraid that everybody want and he didn't have the help for everybody.
Most of the time they ended help me  I don't remember.
She would some times invite me for a walk  to go with her  she would help me a little with Swedish.
So  it's excused to eat anything that help you to survive.
Shes staying there to straight out  to help out a little bit  because they put a electric station in the water.
If in your mind you have the question  How did they know you were Jewish?
She tried to get help for my husband and she  she really  she wa s just absolutely wonderful  she  I must say  she was just the most understanding boss I ever had.
In other words  that we will be able to help create because  you know  since there are surrogate partisans so we want to be on our side and do our work.
No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph.

Instead she should help  she  you know  screamed and cried my mother. (
I was very involved in scouting  which was a great help  and in some othe r civic stuff.
