And then afterwards  when we joined Germany  then they called over my husband her husband and they asked him what did he do with the Jews  you see?
Now  that kind of relation between poor and -- and whoever gave them help  it always amazed me [indecipherable] because all my friends were the v illage children.
Now if that Jew was in a concentration camp --Buchenwald  Dachau or Sachsenhausen--and the Christian buyer was fairly decent and didn't know how to run the business that he just acquired from the Jew; and the wife  let's say  came to him and said  \ Do you need some help running it?\
We still were in our homes  we had our belongings  we were  we lived a normal life and we happy we could help them.
After a very short time  I realize that I have to help  if I wanted to bring my children in a certain   I had to help.
The DP camp was in Maastricht and there of course we had had a business and my mother knew people from the earlier days and even though the the conditions in the DP camp were very ba d and we were treated more like prisoners  locked in and so on  nevertheless we had these connections and they came to see us and my mother was able immediately to notify our family in America and in Palestine of the fact that we were alive and to and to ask for their help  and the communications that I  that my mother wrote uh in those days and in the weeks following that she wrote to my family in America and in Palestine  those letters with all her recollections are in my possession and many of the documents that uh uh we have from from the tim es we were being returned after the war are in my possession  and uh the uh eventually uh the Dutch people took care of their of the Dutch citizens who were brought back to Holland.
I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who needed help.
I enjoyed doing all those things  and help  and I was very interested  we had our own machinery at home to to cut the to burn the hay together  bale like bale Oh  so put it toge yes  bale the hay.
Said no  I am here  I have a my house  I have the the works  and Im managing this  and he will help me  and I have lots of friends.
He need them for the archives  because of the communists run away and left behind him so many papers  so many archives  in the Russian language  and the Jews knew Russian language perfect  that the Jews should go and help the -- how to take 31 out the paper and check them  and then know wh at's all about them in the paper.
On the other hand  I can help you  so they won't riot if you'll give me an okay to raise the money.ﬂ And he did it.
But they needed help and we were willing to give it.
And we got out and they put us on the trains.
Did your mother have help at home  hired from the outside?
So again  they used their tru -- th-the railway  not to help people to come back into the city  or send them ba -- to transport [indecipherable] people than they took  allegedly for labor  and the immedi ate work of the Resistance was to organize assistance.
At some point  one of the boys  in fact the boy who asked us to come in--there were stories coming up that pretty soon the Germans were going to conscript able -bodied Gentile Slovakians for labor in Germany to help with the war effort.
He felt it personally that he wants to help him  although he never met him.
Before  in Germany   in Hamburg   my husband and I asked his aunt and uncle they lived in Michigan   Detroit   Michigan we came as an immi as immigrants  and they were very happy to help us  to support us.
A nd when she came to live with us  I was very  very happy  because she did give me a lot of attention and she was always busy knitting  knitting sweaters for me and for my friends and would bake cakes and cookies and I would be allowed to help her.
I sold them my share in one building and they sold me their share in the other building and then  with the help of a very capable supervisor or whatever-- {Unidentified woman: Investment advisor.}
Yeah  all the except that sometimes is the Gestapo file is sometimes is some now right now w-we had this new Polish archivist  Mrs. Alexandra Boretska and she works I do a lot of stuff for her now  to help her.
So but then  you know  she came to the one conclusion with her friends help  very helpful  as I said  that we were three females -- >> >> Suzy Snyder: Can I again just jump in and ask a question?
What I think is people that didn't work or sick people that they got help from the soup kitchens.
Oh  we went to the Jewish Community Center  for example  you met them there.
Well  in the beginning the Jews that went to Israel  they were more Zionist type.
But that didnt help them any  they had to go in.
you see  but he is RGO  or this was something called like help to the people Okay.
I was in the line and I tried to run out to help but I was pushed back.
I enroll in the engli -- English classes through the Jewish social services  and then the army came  and my both -- both folks got sick  my mother and father  and they got the co -- help through the Red Cross  87 with the commitment that when I come up from service we will pay it back.
Because I was praying  because I was talking and -- and  you know  to God.
And  of course  we couldn't help her because we were not allowed to say mother  sister.
Why dont you start it really  in United States  where the possibilities are better  and larger  and you will be able to help us out in Israel.ﬂ And this what we accepted  and I must say modestly  humbly  we have done it.
And uh they said no they had to send people to  to Germany for other work in  in other  other camps.
Uh  to help  as I said--going to hospitals  [as] volunteers  or going to uh...to the canteens to serve.
And when the French Army came in Frei burg later  quite later  he looked for me and wanted me to help him go back to France.
And so  we could 37 help to get these passports for Jewish people to get away.
And they -- she told me to -- a part of the thing to tell me to start -- she interview -- to try to help some ladies  and they were the Lubovitcher ladies.
Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21  2011 103 Did you have after you were releas ed  after you were again free Im jumping ahead  but Ill come back to the other topics  did you have any kind of medical help after the war?
The camp leader  because his secretary was an friend of mine  a nd when she saw me there on that big heap of people to be -- just to be taken on the truck  she was running to him  and as king if he would help me.
To my mother  to help in the family  in the house.
04:42:30 So  that same night I went to the waterfront and I saw a sign \ help wanted\   and I went in there and the foreman was also of German descent so we spoke German so I got the job.
Originally  I wasn t worried  well if -- if the Russians are going to help me to go home  that would be fine.
The only medical help that Im aware of is that one of the Ukrainian guards was paid to bring in leeches from town.
But as I said  all pe -- a lot people who are brought for fight  who f -- f -- to give us th is opportunity  they help because this one - one -- wa -- one [indecipherable] did not come back to self.
In the prison  when I lost my senses    I pray  I said  God help me.
if you need help  go to Arie  hes gonna help you.
His friends were fishermen  shepherds  prostitutes  all those things because he wanted to help them.
When you were active in trying to help the Jews in the ghetto -- it sounds like you were quite active.
Said  maybe I you know  if I have because you dont walk 20 kilometers to just help and wa when you are needed in the summer  the busy period.
She -- they had money and  you know  gold coins  whatever they had they lost  and they were poor like [indecipherable] so we had to help them  too  in th at situation.
You broke the bag cement and you sabotage  so he jumped on top of me  and with his heel he was trying to kill me  knocked me down and uh and hit me and made me a mess  I was laying there  my whole bloody  bloody mess  my face  my body  and he walked away  my father wa s standing next to me  he couldn't help me  he couldn't help with nothing.
So and the Zionist organization became very active in Hungary  and they told us anybody wants to go to Palestine  they help us to go to Palestine.
Now Im an officer  but we have a group that we keep up this organization  and th-they if youre interested and if you know that we can help you out a little bit  you find us.
When she saw us  she said  \ Well  as much as I like to help you  the Germans will be here in a half hour.ﬂ And she start to pull out drawers and pull out big pieces like the table clothes  the covers to cover the windows because we're here.
It turned out that she was the mistress of the ma n who was arranging all these transports and she told me  \ You know  I can help you.
Their food supplies  they tell us  ﬁYou know  you don't need Jews  you don't need you Jew bastards  you don't need this anymore.ﬂ So  my poor mother  you know she was she used to in desperation in desperation you know  to call the Lord to help us  you know ﬁShema Israel.ﬂ 3 She was determined.
You're trying to throw her out of her house  and all she did was help her Jewish friend.
We dont need your help  you worse than the Nazis because its after the war and we walked out.
So he decided that we'll try to get to the Iron side and maybe some of his friends will help us or to or will harbor us  will help us.
Then these women said that I should stay in Boston and they will help me to get a job and I have to be the soroptimist there and I called up my best friend and their little daughter was three years old by that time and the little one was six months old and I called up and I said I'm here and I'm going to stay in Boston.
Not because they wanted to in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 some way avoid their Jewish affiliation.
And the Rabbi sa id  \ Mr. Schwartz  I would gladly help you  but I want to tell you four weeks after liberation  they still buried thousands and thousands of inmates without name  without any list  who is buried where.
Because first of all  we were working too USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 78 hard  and my wife used to take the kids to s -- to the store to bring them  because at that particular time I tried to save as much as I could on help  you know?
We didn't do these things at ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 that time.
And I took a woman who um...from...from the camp who was going to help me; and she was inexperienced.
And we tried to help people who are in need  that there was a hospital nearby in Hoffgastein  my sister who had some nurses' training was working in that hospital.
They were human  they were good  they help ed us in everything.
With the most the more respectable was this the Wallenberg shutzpass  the Swedish  but beginning the most was the the Spanish  and that was a a argument what uh Dr. Farkash used  may maybe some breathe that we are the the...someplace was very flexible and it was not a very difficult thing to to make an influence to help to the Jews.
>> Bill Benson: Fred  I know you want to talk about this.
But I had lots and lots of help as I was growing up and I had lots of people who were very important to me.
I used to help also to bring the refugees to some...some new residences since they were not quite familiar with Lisbon and I was quite familiar with Lisbon.
As we found it out  the next day late  that Army was called to help some on the front line while they were going towards Warsaw at that time.
You see  when you are deprived of any spiritual assistance and help and ordinary conditions of human dignified life  when you take part in such a great ceremony then you are liberated really and strengthened.
There was one of my grandfather s and two of his sons  two of my uncles.
Uh...I was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and uh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement.
And self reliance and -- and things like that to -- to help them to -- to make a living  to help them to make something about themselves.
Then when he had Polish Communists sneaking in  I would help them question those.
One of the girls told me later that when they were taking her out--she had very black hair like I had but I don't think she wa s Jewish--one of the people helping her said  \ Why should we help you  you are Jewish\   and pushed her away.
But his explanation  I have it from him  his explanation was he did it for the group  what tried to help the -- [indecipherable] other people.
A nd he say to the lady he can help us  the three girls.
He says  \ I'll wait for you.ﬂ Spoke to my old friend and he's telling me  he says  \ Look  I can do anything for you in money  but I can't help you hiding.
By the time the German guard offered to help me  I was very  very sick already.
Yeah  because they used to come to Naches on weekends with their airplane and they would help the people  you know  prepare them too for for their rights.
So -- so we decided this what we have done  and we were able to help with a wedding  with everything.
Why dont you go with her to whatever it was  Cooks   and help her make the arrangements?
I said  \ God help-- helped me  protect me to save my life that I will save  save other lives.
But I'm quite su re that that never happened  anything more than she wanted to help  and he used her as a tool to wards her husband.
So I am getting very angry and I went to him and I told him  \ I asked you to help my brother.
So we got out  and we w ent -- some self -help organizations were in town.
If I am in a situation wher e I can do something  I will do every possible thing to get help.
The Rabbi told me  yeah  you have to help him  HaShem would help you  mit us.
So I walked up to her and I said  \  May I help you?
However  fortunatelly  during that period  either the Americans or the British had bombed Weimar  which was a city not too far from Buchen wald  and had done an awful lot of damage in the residential areas  so the German s took us out to the town of We imar in order to help clean up the damage that was caused by the bombardment.
And so  many times she went to them to the English Embassy and asked for help.
So the local committee would do run across students who needed help.
And he used to come and help us [indecipherable] he used to teach us  you know.
By day  they would help him and if the Germans would come  or the police would come to the area  they would be signaled by one another.
Then  after war and that  then I think from Poland that the communistic government was so was sending delegation to take us back to Poland.
And also towards a print advocation of -- with intent to instill hatred of these minority groups  and to help to create an atmosphere in which the authorities could  with reasonable support from the general p opulation  engage in physical persecution of these individuals.
Forced work means we just were taken for help after the bombing and actually they took the people who actually died by the bombing and took them into the  so there couldnt for example  happened som ething with a mill or something like this when the corpse would be a longer time in the bombed area.
The doctor is here to help you  to help your psychic.
An d we finally with the help of my two uncles and two aunts  with their affidavits and so on we came to the United States in the in the late  the last part of 1945.

08:09:20 A. My mother was a very strong woman because whenever she saw a German  she used to stick that piece of paper in front of his face  ﬁI'm an American.ﬂ Not -- they never honored it  but she saved it all the way  and it could be her help  could be the fact that I just didn't feel like dying.
As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver Kike the neighbor and I delivered our household goods to her apartment with the help of her husband.
So to help  give time the units to go To retreat.
And -- and that obviously was a tremendous help also in our -- our  you know  for our budget.
And the German expect that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 83the Polish people gonna help Jewish people.
He or she  he needs help immediately and doesn't know his relative's address.
They knew my mother very well and they respected her because there were times when they needed help my mother was always there to help them because we were a little bit better financially off than them.
And really  the need for help was in -- in a very bad way  because his mother an-and -- and his sister could not attend to it.
When it was quiet down  two boys  Russian young soldiers  18 years old  kids  come over to me  I should help them to take out Germans  surrounding the white flag from the trenc h. I said I have no right to leave my cannon.
So you couldnt  even if you found a job where to work  it wouldnt help you because the British were very loyal and they didnt want you to be in trouble.
Th-That is true  because I was the oldest one  and my mother was [indecipherable] your father has this money  pension  you know  so it will help  you know  she wanted at least one.
And I heard...word was passed on that there is a uh organization to help people to go to Palestine.
Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28  2015 81 No  because Stalin gave to Sikorski   you know  they sign a treaty or something  that Sikorski ask  if you release all the people  Polish people from Siberia  from Russia  and he will form the po army from Polish men to help you to fight Germans Right.
This Polish woman noticed it and started to run after us screaming \ You dirty Jewish help ers.\
I mean  what -- was it more difficult to be a Jew openly  or -- No  not at all.
And they were in charge of -- and they chose me to help them because I was Polish -- speaking Polish for -- if we g -- went out into the local places.
Rochelle used to come and to help me  she used to collate the forms and they were with -- with carbon.
And we knew it  but very few in the camp office  maybe it was me and Katya  who knew what the real -- and that why we could help.
I remember that with my with my cousin's friend uh help it took me only two weeks to get a job.
And he could speak Dutch  and I remember that in that car he says to me  ﬁYeah  now I cant help you  youre a young girl  and I feel so sorry that you go to prison now  but you didnt tell any  now you have to go to prison ﬂ he said.
Pretty good  and [indecipherable] the Polish girls could be accommodate d. Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me  yeah.
That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money.
Needless to say  my upbringing was mostly by the help in the house.
So that uh uh they will help th em to settle the war in China.
That was funny  because my parents always tried to help everybody  and what do you call it in the church  the guy that takes care that the ha -- is clean  and whatever  the janitor -- Janitor? --
I was welcome for two months as a -- as a guest  but they didnt want me as a refug ee and I suppose his parents had said -- were afraid they have to look after me or help me or something.
It's hard for me to see with the lights so I'm going to need help.

The Jewish people ta ke him to the hospital to help him.
It was the story of when the nurses came to -- were taken to the Kasalen to help these people a-at the Fabric transport.
Because we feel we were children when it happened to us  we want to help children.
But that coul d have been behind me not remembering that there were at least one German who tried to show sympathy or tried to help.
We had to cross the Alps; we crossed the Alps and we came to Terevisa in Italy.
He didnt help me any  so what good he done for me?
Well  it was when we manage -- when we finally got into the Jewish agency groups and everybody was Jewish.
And secondly  maybe you can help me if you get out.
