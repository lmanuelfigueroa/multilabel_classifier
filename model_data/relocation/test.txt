We were put into the ghetto in sort of late fall  early winter of 1941.

So the Russians had moved into your apartment then . . .
And the Russian army came closer and we evacuated  the whole army  Riga  the German Army  so the ghetto was eliminated and old people disappeared.

What they did--this was put under what they called War Relocation Authority.
Q So you are talking now about the time when you -- all the Jews of Kaunas were ordered to go into the Ghetto in the summer of 1941  yeah?

I was going to ask you another part of the story because what I heard from Chris was that your mother  the day before the liquidati on of the ghetto  came to Paliszewski– No  my mother couldnt have come to Paliszewski.

When I saw the movie  ﬁSchindlers List ﬂ I realized that we left 12 Krakow a week or two before all the Jews were rounded up in the ghetto.
This mother was taken away and this father was taken away and this...and this is how...you see  and this is how the German was liquidating the ghetto.
It was relatively safer there and that is what led us to believe  that when the order finally came for us to report to the ghetto that we could survive somehow and maybe wait out the war by living in Borek Falecki without reporting to the ghetto.
My grandmother came to us and stayed with us and went to ghetto with us.
It was very unpleasant time because it was time for very easy quick bucks for  mostly for Polish people who lived in ghetto quarters.

From typhus epidemic that was raging in the Warsaw Ghetto from famine because the sanitary conditions were very poor at the time and the overcrowding brought in lice and lice begot typhus.
And of course  then an orange in the ghetto was  was impossible.

I was two and a half when I entered the ghetto so obviously my vocabu- lary wasn't very extensive but and in the house we spoke Yiddish.
So its so  around March of 1940  you are already in the ghetto  right?
It was a small place  we were 500 prisoners and these people from Smolensk told us that the ghetto in Smolensk has been closed.
And once there were Germans right next to us because they were occupying the apartment upstairs from us where that family had fled already.
At that time the -- the Jewish police in the ghetto already had a stand  and -- Yeah.
But I left the ghetto on  on uh December  for December 43 and  and after I left it was  before I left it was already announced it is a concentration camp.

That he found a work brigade that worked outside the ghetto.
He became absolute ruler of th e ghetto and to us he seemed like a man that was drugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our services to the Germans  good part of the Jews might survive.
It was a matter of timing when s hould we escape from the ghetto and this was a very important question...which one of the f our leaders of the Zionist uh resistance movement were all the positions in the ghetto life  so it wasn't just a matter of once a decision.
Did you hear about concentration camps in other places from people?
Because both in the Ghetto Uprising and in the Warsaw Uprising soldiers used the sewers to travel under the city  some of the entrances were open.

There were competition and there was a theater in the ghetto.
And how did the city look to you when you came back  since when you left  there had was no ghetto yet Yeah.
Of course  it's not easy to take out ten letters from the ghetto because if they would find...if they would check him on the date when he goes out as head of the brigade and finds the letters  it was the end of him and of all th e brigade  so you you you had to be very  very careful.
There was not enough work within the ghetto to fully employ everybody.

The Germans and the Poles could come into Ghetto  and they told you not to go.
When did they decide you had to go to a ghetto?
I said  because they had no windows out into the ghetto and I said  we don't know what's happening in the ghetto.
And they were not allowed -- we were not allowed to walk out from that ghetto.
Uh...Some people did  but...but we did not know...the ghetto itself didn't know that there was concentration camp.

They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly enough that people would think about those kind of things in the ghetto but I guess  love is a pretty powerful influence  it comes right after food.
The ghetto was in the area that my father lived in because my father lived in the Jewish community area where all the other Jews lived so I dont think they had to move but they did have other people moving in with them.
Is there anything else about the ghetto th at you want to tell me  or that you want me to understand?
And...then uh  in the beginning of 44  they said they need people to work in Germany in factorie s  and whoever wants to go out of the ghetto can go.

Are there any sights today or sounds or smells that bring back the war years for you  in todays world  anything that reminds you or I dont believe so.
They really transformed the ghetto in a work uh Laga--in a work force.
I was sick that they wanted to take me back to the ghetto.
The moment they started importing people for execution  for exporting  they changed it and I've got the order where it was changed from a ghetto to a concentration camp  Konzentrations Lager  so that when it became a concentration camp  the people had different ways of at least hiding something that if you got out or were able to  you could barter with it.
You got the star when you went into ghetto or had you worn one before that?
You did have some uncles that were in separate sections of the ghetto.
And from the Wilna ghetto they are going to K ovno  it was a city in Lithuanian  to build a big plant  a big factory.

The rations they were giving in the ghetto was hardly anything.
I was hungry  tired  and I came and throwing me out of the ghetto  Dr. Ebner saved my life.
He got homesick a nd eventually he left and went back home to the ghetto.
With this  in this time outside from this children home  becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people didn't...certain area what will what will be the ghetto  but the ghetto was already opened.
And sometimes I would see a colu mn of me -- of people  of Jews from the ghetto being marched out for -- obviously to be taken somewhere to a transport  to a concentration camp.
By that time already they start finding people hiding in the ghetto.
So therefore I had to take a -- I lived up here  I had to board a trolley car and tr-travel I would say about 20 minutes on a trolley car to Ribna  which w ould be -- this is Balskirinik  its somewhere right before Balskirinik  because it was duri ng the war in the ghetto boundary.
And then we were being marched down the streets where there was the small ghetto.
We stayed only one night  and after the Aktion was over  the next day we returned back to the ghetto  and by that time we lost everything  a lot of my friends  a lot of my family.
A ghetto is an isolated part of our city situated in what used to be a very poor neighborhood and consisted of several blocks of buildings and small houses.
One section of the ghetto  the cemet ery was adjoining it.
Eventually -- and he went to a village  and he figured hes gonna go in  and in the village were Germans  and they caught him there  and he got killed.

He started to establis h so-called ﬁarbisinﬂ  they were shops which manufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people who administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people working in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto.
In every town  there was a big ghetto  and later made it a small ghetto.
I have to give place to everybody.ﬂ The other partisans  they didn't want them  because when -- if somebody was going away from the ghetto and you were a Jew  sometimes they were killing them.
In ghetto there are others also  but theyre not from Lodz.
And the farmers were all ready with their sleds -- this was winter time -- with their sleds  ready  lined up  all over  inside and outside the ghetto.
And they build a bridge from one ghetto to the other  from the small one to the big one.
The neighbor called that-- took the family in those on e-family homes  in the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: In 1944  Marty  your family was then forced into a ghetto.
And those police officers  whenever there was a day that they were trying to round up people and deport them to Auschwitz or any other place  they were -- that Jewish police force were working wi th the Germans.
01:16:20 I want to stop you before we get to the ghetto part.
And other streets in other part were lot of Jewish families over there.
In the fall of 1941  the Neumans were forced to settle in the Czernowitz ghetto where the living conditions were poor and the Jews were subject to deportation to Transnistria.
Q. What was a normal day like for you afte r the Ghetto?
I know I used to travel a lot and I used to go out in the ghetto  I took off always my armband  because I didnt look Jewish.
23 A. In the ghetto as I told you what they did  they destroyed all Jewish synagogues which the only synagogue as I told you was the   which is still left.
And the second they cut off the ghetto and I had to go in another place.
Were they shooting from [indecipherable] They -- oh  it can -- yeah  for instance  there was a very tragic story in the ghetto  which happened to a half Jew  Argie Saviskas.
Q. How many people are we talk ing about that were still in the Ghetto approximately?
We built a sled with a double back and big one and he was able to -- the ammunition was outside the ghetto. .
At that time you are already hidden in ghetto and the building that we were there were quite a few people with us.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 By that time there was already a shortage.
Was there a period at which point you al l had to go into some sort of a ghetto?
So what I'd like to start back is on those first days of the ghetto.
When they started to speak about the ghetto  I didnt know what it is.
That was a--a suburb where mostly Jewish people live in it.
It started to get very bad the beginning of '41  when they made the ghetto.
I took my family  my mother and three sisters and we went out of the ghetto and we stayed overnight in an empty house.
Instead  the ghetto hospital sent a surgeon  accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers  including my brother Moshe.
When -- can you describe to me what it was like when the Germans came?
I mean you were living in the ghetto  did you notice a different kind of feeling from other people that were there?
Oh I want to tell you about just so the Jews had to go to a ghetto  but in the first one was to move into a  an area of 33 streets.
Before  I am talking about the general life without  I am not talking about the ghetto.
They mobilized from the ghetto five thousand worker s  seven days a week  twenty-four hours a day.
And the fact that it was an open ghetto made lif e in that sense easier.
15 Tell me  tell me a little bit about the ghetto itself  not just the kibbutz.
My intention was if were going inside the ghetto and see if I can get in touch and can find my family and see if I can find Lisa.
Ghetto was very exotic place if you had some imagination  you were very young.
When they came/took me from the ghetto and send me to/away.
I also want to say that other people tried to sneak out of the ghetto.
And it became -- we had a lot of clothes on us.
The reason was because it was already a little bit out of the town  and it was easier to petition it off with wires  or whatever  to make it that you cannot just walk out of the ghetto as a free person.
But  we used to get together with friends  you know  and since our ghetto was not closed ghetto  it was an open ghetto  it means that part of the town wh ere there was a large concentration of Jews was  got to be a little more crowded with the fact that there were newcomers coming through from territories that were incorporated in the Reich  and also the few who lived not really in Jewish sections were forced to move out and to move into the designated ghetto area  and this is what happened to us in the 40s.
So he took us out and he said  \ You have to run with me.ﬂ Now you can imagine that Oldsa   the ghetto area  and St. Stephen Park....St.
So...uh...but we knew of...we heard of other people being...uh...transferred to different cities; and there were many people that were transferred from small little towns near Wierzbnik-Starachowice into our town  and they were all...uh...you know  put into the ghetto.
And there were seven entrances to the ghetto and during the first week we were completely isolated and then the Germans decided to lose  to use the working force of the  of the Jews yes.
So that was we were there in this house for about a couple of days  and from there they took us and we went to Malteszalka  that was a ghetto.
15 And I...knowing what ghetto is from not only because I was so dumb.
So when I didnt came  the Ge rman locked up the whole the whole ghetto you like a ghetto  and they look for me not for me  no  for other ones  where they hiding.
And he went right in the ghetto  pass the German gate  find my mother  find my sister  bring them food regularly.
And  you know  going to the Holocaust Museum and seeing children of my age walking in that large -- y-you Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 45know what I mean  the -- the large kind of photograph  blown up photograph of the ghetto with the trolley car coming through and everyone wearing the armbands and so on.
And suddenly  during the ghetto  when there was not much available  he just went and begged you know  to the Joint 11.
I found myself that morning  early in the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspr itz had left and so I got up and I  I visited the 35 international ghetto thinking what do I do now?

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 13 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (rolling) (Camera roll 80  sound roll 46) (Take 18) EL: Yes  a very important movement in my creative work in the ghetto began when after Mr. Tory had talked to me and he introduced me to Professor Hy Nachman Shapiro who was in charge of the education of the  the art of the ghetto.
I think I mentioned to you that I worked on the Lodz ghetto book.
Before they closed the ghetto  since we were foreigners in Poland  my father was arrested.
We saw a big group of Jews running from the night shift going back to 41the ghetto.
And during the period of time I was in a ghetto  again  I stayed upstairs  never went down to the cellars  walked around with bullets whizzing around.
So  theyre going to take the ghetto as it is with machines and shops and all of us.
Two weeks later  naturally  while the army was going deeper into Russia  the Gestapo came in and the first thing what did happen in the ghetto  going back to the ghetto.
You came out from hell  again into a normal life  you know  becau se you see in very small communities like Zarki there was no ghetto.
Rachel and her mother sought shelter in the ghetto in Glebokie  a town North of Dokszyce.
You didn't work at the rubber factory the whole time you were in the Lodz ghetto?
And b ecause it was still a large ghetto in numbers and there was still quite a young people in the ghetto  we tried to look every possible way to get in touch with the resistance.
Later on  on the same yard  was the Judenr ight -- the Judenrat of the ghetto.
And before they took out -- this was the ghetto -- before they took out the Jewish people completely today  I wasn't affected.
At that time the ghetto wasn't so hard to get out of the ghetto.
We lived on the Operowa and the gate was on a Operowa and I learned later that it was the head of the Judenrat  Gershon Kwint that came in when this Einsatzgruppen group  and this army of killers came in to the gate to march into the ghetto.
The Germans created the um  a Jewish committee  they were in charge  and we had orders to  they gave us barbed wire  and we had order certain blocks  so many blocks to surround uh the ghetto  and there we start a new life  a new life under the Germans.
How were you able to get some education while in the ghetto?
This was a ghetto in Poland in 1942 and he expected us to have  or be able to get  cognac in the middle of the night.
Well  it -- it was -- the Judenrat  because they still believe this was already the last minute -- beca -- the Judenrat was at the responsible job  while -- while you -- the ghetto isnt existing.
We had to go to the other side of the ghetto.
But as far as providing food  and I remember my sister was having a baby in ghetto.
But you s -- you said you -- when you were in the ghetto  that you felt you needed to bear witness  yes?
To cut a long story sh ort  he gave me half of the portion that I needed  but I was the happiest man to come b ack in the ghetto (laughter) and she teased me when I gave her the the paper  you s ee  and then they played...you know  the famous play of and Esther and was was elected to be the .
So being in that...in that ghetto  we had very little to eat.
03:10:18 Do you think within the ghetto life was any different for women and men?
But in order to get out from the ghetto and become a partisan and they were located in the Runigso and Narah forests.
Like  they took away in 19-- when they got into the ghetto  that was I think in September.
>> Bill Benson: Henry  if I remember right  just before you were forced into the ghetto  you and your sisters went to work in an ammunition factory.
So  the trucks are passing by  and by the way  our ghetto was divided  the main thoroughfare  all the trucks had to pass by.
Women were fainting because they had children  mothers...the ghetto still had  you know  a lot of people and I had...knew Abraham...I had him and I (inaudible).
And they were trying to get out as much as possible Jews from the ghetto.
We actually moved into the ghetto but we had passes to go to the factory where we lived half-time in the ghetto.
And the other one that I have  I -- a dream  like I dreamed that I will be able to escape from all the -- the -- the bad things that its going on in the ghetto  and so on.
And  of course  at one time it was not thought it was a ghetto.
And since they took us out from the ghetto [indecipherable] resistance wasnt working.
So my father learned that if he is assigned as a slave laborer out of ghetto  at least he will have the chance to barter clothes for food  whatever...bread was really very hard to get.
So the other escape was planned for my group  plans with our arms [indecipherable] in our basement [indecipherable] but still it was on the other side  the ghetto was cut off shorter.
So  at what point  and -- and was it -- was it a -- a real change for you when the ghetto was then sealed in or fenced in and -- and what are your recollections around that particular time?
I was  as I said  prepared to go for the woods but not for the farm  but since I got such a a word from Pnina so it was nothing doing  so I had to escape from the ghetto.
Mordecai Anielewicz  the leader of the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto  who perished in 1943  was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941.
I want to ask you  were there any deportations going on from the ghetto before they began to liquidate?
And very seldom do they took seven  a family of with seven  eight  nine people into the ghetto.
Mother dressed again in her clothing and me in the clothing  and we started out with him  following him a short distance behind out of the ghetto.
So he was one of the 70 000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of '43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto.
And you wouldn't believe this but there was  in that same building there was 02:51: a patisserie  a Jewish woman and she was making ice cream  she still was making ice cream and the ghetto in Munkacz had two sections which were divided by a street and people could run across that street from one section  ghetto one to ghetto two let's say  with the good will of the police guard and my classmates from gymnasium  the girls were running in on Sunday to this lady who was making the ice cream and Mrs. Such and such  Mrs. Such and such  are you going to make ice cream?
>> Agi Geva: Then we had to go to the ghetto.
On t op of that  they were the worse killers in the ghetto.
And he was guarding the gardens in the ghetto  where we were growing some potatoes or something like that.
You know  so no one Jew on the street  only father was  and he went to the stores where he make business  and was still making business after -- almost wh en the Ghetto start.
What I want to bring out  that one particular night when it -- they decided to evacuate the orphanage  to take the childrens to Treblinka  to gas chambers3  I was out of that ghetto  particularly that night.
Somehow my brother got a sleigh with somebody  and they took me out from the ghetto  and they brought me to the ghetto in Rzeszow  to Dr. Heller.
So one in a certain way  when we came into the ghetto  we felt a little bit safer in our surrounding.
I was born in Warsaw and...uh... the city where I lived  in the apartment...I...in those days people were givi ng...were born mostly in the homes and I was one of those from that generati on...was born in the same house where I lived  probably until the end of the ghetto.
The ghetto of course had always bad air  also many people  and there was nothing to give air to.
So after a month  say you left you were taken from the ghetto and Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2  2010 20 We were we were we were walked  we were not thre we we they didnt see  lets say this is Budapest  Hungary  and this is the border to go to Austria .

His children he sent  because of bei ng a rich man  he sent his two children  his son and his daughter  to London and this is Professor Elkes who you met in there  he was then in London  and this is the last will that they allowed to him and to his sister  and this is will that to be passed to him (laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto.
You know  rationing was establishe d. Could you tell me something about -- okay  before the ghetto was being established and the unirat   were Jews prohibited from public places?
They divided the ghetto  this is only what I've heard ta lking from the grown-ups.
So the walking of the ghetto  from our apartment to a friend  was really eliminated  because we were afraid that they were going to kill us.
To cut a long story short  she was hiding it and this messenger that I...we were in the ghetto...he worked with me in the secret ariat of the ghetto  he used to bring this every morning under his shirt  you know  the the entry of that day and bring it to her.
He couldnt testify  he was -- he was illegally in the ghetto  he was hidden by the parents.
By the way I want you to know that we were the very first survi vors of Auschwitz to reach this land.
What about this -- this -- This is a collage -- collage of -- of phot ographs  which I took some  and some of them I acquired  and plus with my food stamp  which has came fro m the Lodz ghetto  and plus USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 108 Ive pak -- pictures of the Jews which came back after the war  and were killed  which -- which I gave to the Holocaust Museum.
We did not have a 5 Ghetto yet in Lodz so we were living in our own homes.
Was --------Rumkowski  the head of the Lodz ghetto  God of 200 000 Jews  a man who  who  who make you live or die  he thought he is   he is the man.
After that  you know  when it became obvious that the Jews driven out from the ghetto are being killed  so this was the turning point in the whole existence of the ghetto.
A book...you can imagine...where did we have this pl ace to to to keep them in the ghetto or to or to store them  but this is what he wa s very excited about that he should...it was one of the outstanding monumental work...the history of the mode rn Hebrew literature and uh 75he was the head of the of the cultural department and he...you know  we had also from the children  you see  we tried to keep for them the holidays children should know.
The ghetto was not what you consider a ghetto here  just an area where people live and are kind of segregated.
What I remember is that they cr eated the ghetto  they were the conquerors  and they created the Jewish police to more or less supervise any [indecipherable] that the Germans had imposed and also in a way  take care of -- so thered be no crime.
In ghetto itself  after it got some kind of an amolity--whatever an amolity could be in ghetto.
We made it to the ghetto  looks like the ghetto knew about it  the Univad  and there was sort of no punishment on us or anything like that.
All our po ssessions  all our material possessions ended up in their hands because when we were ordered to go in to the ghetto  we could only take with us what we could carry  nothing else.
I will take you to the ghetto when the group is finished working.
Of course  then there -- we came to the Warsaw  first contact with the German.
By being thrown into that open ghetto  I  and being totally limited to a certain place  while looking out the window and seeing the other side across the street  which was the Aryan side and seeing people walk freely and children playing and I was totally isolated and deprived of the sun and the moon.
They needed strong people to be able to go from house -to-house because the ghetto became a ghost town.
And the same thing I thought maybe when we left for the ghetto.
Then there was a part of the ghetto was a place where they would bring in Jews from some other places .
When it was decided to burn the ghetto down  did you know immediately what you were doing?
But this is -- this is as far as my -- was the worse than in the ghetto.
And however  you know we had  of course I always had a great --------------  so I was not particularly religious  I had a great deal of respect for religion and books  and um  one of the things I wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father  I wanted to I  I knew what would happen in the ghetto  you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June  and um  I asked a friend of mine to go with me and collect uh prayer books  you know  I  I was afraid when they'll find it  they'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that.
But what was inside the ghetto  we didn't know because it was a wall  total isolation.
And they were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 19already were -- were -- were chased out from that town  Lunenietz  from that town and they came to our town  in the ghetto  in there where they stayed in this -- the grandmother  this -- this -- this son  and they -- End of Tape One  Side A Beginning of Tape One  Side B And in the morning  we wanted to find out whats -- whats goings on  so we send -- we ask this gentlemen -- this Mr. Loudier  the son of this grandmother of ours  we send him  we ask him  ﬁPlease go and find out.ﬂ He went in th ere to the -- whatever he -- they ask us to gather together.
But the inner of the village was like a ghetto  and that's where they chased the Jews and that's where they put us in.
8 It was easy to come and go from the ghetto?
After they took us from the train  they came back and blew up the Ghetto  dynamite and who ever was left  hidden in the Ghetto underground or any other place was killed  dynamiting the area  including all my relatives  my cousins.
Except for the physical exertion  cases when she would take me to the ghetto in Czestochowa.
I think they received they had to go out of the ghetto and they were taken  of course  they were taken to Chelmno where all people died of the Wartegau  and these people also.
What wa -- I think so  yeah  because perba -- probably rumors were already around the city that the ghetto will be organized  and when they started to see how they are throwing out the people  the Jewish people from the houses  so my mother started to p ack.
The other question I have is  I assume there were also Communists cells or other groups and I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate responsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the ghetto.
Besides  he didnt -- being a Jewish  he didnt have the -- the -- a level of secrecy he -- he would -- the -- really he -- hes supposed to have on his position  a foo -- over there  he -- hes supposed to have  but they didnt give it to him because he was Jewish.
Anthony: So you were able to stay in the ghetto because you were pretending to be a brother of–Did your brother  did he remain?
How did your family get food in the ghetto  did the Germans provide any food?
End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B Okay.
And here  maybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has been formed and of their functioning  that they were able to provide everybody with what little it was.
I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski  who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in ghetto.
Well  I had  I had  I have an uncle who wa s married and -- to a Polish lady  and she was with him in the ghetto all the time.
They knew that if they would go to the ghetto they will get killed because once Tuvia got to the city to take something and they took him.
And then I remember that the Germans did not allow any synagogues but there was some sort of an apartment complex and in it was a  they had this hidden synagogue and I was bar mitzvahed in front to the whole ghetto  amongst this whole horror going on.
Whoever went to the left was resettled out of the ghetto.
Dont forget  this happened in April and I left home in March  the ghetto  about a year I think since I left home.
And I want  I came to take you out from the ghetto.
And a matter of fact  one guy who survived the war from Berlin -- from Minsk ghetto  and he was killed when he -- he came to his hometown to visit.
I said  \ What do you mean go home  the ghetto was on fire  where am I going to go?
So the only way people got out of the ghetto would be with a work brigade?
We were liberated by the Russians in the spring of 1945.
And this relationship was also a special relationship with Armond  the German...the German...the German director of the labor exchange in ghetto.
And also when I left our ghetto  we had to wear the arm band  a white arm band with a blue star of David.
You must understand that the ghetto was an independent state with their own money  with their ministers of all the departments and it was really a .
They -- they -- yeah  they took 81 out the s -- they went into the ghetto the same time and they took some children and elderly people the same day  in the morning before they went out  we assembled  we got -- we were out there -- out again  the SS called upon the -- our president  the Jewish president  the -- to his of -- to the office  and they demand three thou -- 4 000 people.
oh  star  they knew you are Jewish while you still wasnt in the ghetto.
You see the ghetto was made in a...where farmers used to live...farmer country.
And so once the whole ghetto got em ptied  because we didnt know where they were taking them.
But Mr. Visipka did not want to stay in ghetto  since he was used to roaming the villages.
The the thing  the Jews lived in the ghetto because there was no other place to live.
We were basically uh we were basically conditioned to to to obey the laws and the restrictions  the demands  until early in 1942 uh the ghetto was established in in and uh slowly the various uh Jewish communities both in the town and the neighborhood  the villages were compelled to leave all possessions behind and move to the ghetto  so in the spring of 1942 my family uh was required to move to the ghetto and the ghetto was in the oldest part of town.
I just remember that they were forced to go to ghetto.
So -- So you didnt know of the details of resistance activity in Vilnius ghetto.

Then when they start already  the liquidation in the ghetto  they used to come and they used to say  we need for today  2000 people.
And they came back to the ghetto and they told us about these horrendous train rides to a place called Treblinka  where our people were gassed.

Did you learn much about what was going on in the Ghetto or anything else that you didnt know before you talked to these people in jail?
Those were basically the toys that I had  other than I had free reign of the ghett o  that area  I was extremely familiar with  between the small ghetto and the large ghett o  where we had the bridge  there was a bridge that was connecting the two ghettos  and an aunt of mine lived  actually it's my father's aunt  lived right next to the bridge  so I used to go visiting her quite a bit.
And half of the outfit was from Miskolc  an d the parents parents were in the ghetto  and we help them to pack and you know  because they were deported.
But the cops  the guides ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 took us through.
And nothing happened until about a week and a half later where two policemen came and these two policemen told us that we are going to be taken to the ghetto.
It got worse and worse for the Jews because the Germans soon after decided they want ed to move all the Jews  concentrate them  in the Warsaw Ghetto.
about those I think  you know  not not about the ghetto so much.
I cant do too much because I was inside of the ghetto.
Because normally  in all those years  they were they were  most of the times  guar-guarding the ghetto from the outside and they were hardly not too frequently  they they used to come in and and and look for themselves  look in in certain aspects of the ghetto.
So I said  ﬁWould you please don t cut my hair ﬂ I sai d  ﬁbecause Im going to meet my father pretty soon  and I dont want him to see me like that.ﬂ And he said okay  and he took care  he treated me and everything  and he [inaudible] you know  and then we -- we were there  all Jews in this ghetto  and -- and they would come to me and say Rachelle -- the Russians -- After the liberation  yeah  yeah. --
Umschlagplatz was on the periphery of ghetto   you know  but it was inside  inside yes.
But the Germans in those days knew exactly and they got a few collaborators....when the Warsaw ghetto was already liquidated  September...liquidated in May  I don't remember exactly...was it September or October  they spread the news around from it spreads that there's a possibility to buy...uh...foreign passports to be exchanged through Switzerland.
We were the only transport from Lodz Ghetto that did not go to Auschwitz; he kept his word about that.
And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us  about.... Yeah  and this  of course  was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the ghetto so that the Jews would be together already.
And how many different camps  and ghetto  Sylvia Green 75 January 11  1996 Page 75 and– and factories I was in.
I mean  minute we got out of the ghetto   you have also -- look how many different rel -- Judaism we have  five of them  I think.
They used to do that not only in [indecipherable]   but in every single ghetto that they had.
This place where you were waiting and hiding it was outside the ghetto?
You weren't allowed to go no place  only inside  whatever  there was nothing to do  you were there was [indecipherable] How many people did th ey put in that ghetto?
I don't know how the history of the Jewish uprising in the ghetto would look today if these people were caught and  and annihilated because you know history is made by  by what people tell you.
The Jewish gmina members  the highest instance in ghetto  that were ruling spiritually also and morally entire population  they never believed that the Germans would liquidate them and that was the biggest mistake because they had whoever wanted to go  he could.
So from that ghetto we were sleeping in houses on the floor.
Well  while we worked while we were i-in the Warsaw bomb ghetto  we we Did you know about the Warsaw uprising  or not?
He used to bring us food  and we in turn would bring him clothes from the ghetto and change and this way we could bring in some food.
Some people  you know  would make a hiding place in the chimneys of the houses  and some of them went and dug cellars and tunnels  all this within I think like two weeks after we moved to the new ghetto.
What you're telling me is that most of the underground in the ghetto was young people?
Naturally  Lyebish was with me in the ghetto  he was with me in the camp  he was with me two years in the woods  and he got killed.
Instead of going and cleaning the lavatories and and and to build the roads and so on  so there appears five hundred thirty-four  and they took them out from the ghetto and they killed them in the very same day.
Those were the Jews from the Ghetto were brought in  dug out the graves and put some petroleum and burned it.
We had suitcases packed  bu t they didnt let us too much to take  only clothes  a bag of clothes and lets go.
So about and...say you know  \ I run away from the ghetto.
And I opened up the gate and I went...wait...waited where the men's ghetto groups comes out and I ran in in that group and the men surrounded me because they knew what I'm doing.
And did you live in a Jewish neighborhood  where your family was?
She was not a felczer   because the ghetto had a lot of doctors that were like  what should I say first-aid man  or medical corpsman and they were called a felczer  from falsifying the word comes  but they were called doctors because 103 there was a scarcity of doct ors and hospitals otherwise  and she was too smart and too intelligent and probably sli ghtly amused.
I [indecipherable] my mother to o  but my father -- even in ghetto -- can I tell you this?
We paid him  he took us  another couple  Jewish people  he used to took  take us out of ghetto and say that they are taking us to work  but they really took us to  we had clothes or something to trade for food  for bread.
You were in the Munkacs Ghetto for about three weeks and then all of you were deported to Auschwitz by train   not knowing where you were going.
And there was a farmer with a wagon driving by so she came to him and she asked him if he would drive us to this ghetto if he knew where it was.
So  I knew about this ghetto and I did this camp and such camp  where there is true transl ation or true people I know.
We were to put up a resistance in the ghetto  in the walls in the ghetto  but after what was happened to when we say this...the masses  they are not sure they will go behind us so we decided to leave the ghetto.
He owned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us pack ages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuania.
We already was in a ghetto that -- they decided in mi ne town  should be a mustard -- they connected to Klein-Berlin.
I'm just trying to get a sense of what was going on in the ghetto.
>> Erika Eckstut: That was against the law to get out of the ghetto.
And do you know  was your father working in the ghetto?
Right before you all went into the ghetto  there was some shooting of about 1 000 men in that area.
After a while  the rule came out to go into Kovno ghetto.
He was the commander of the -- he was known that the when-enever he came the different ghettos  that he was the liquidator of the ghetto.
But when I walked in and there was Souter  who was the head of the ghetto -- of the kriminalpoisi  sorry -- I left.
Youve got -- you know you borrowed from people in the ghetto  you know that you offered to repay them and yet here are people without proof  they only heard from their relatives or they had -- they had -- th -- there was not -- know diday were no records and so we set up this Claims Committee.
I dont remember whats in these photographs you know of the dancing and all of those  dont remember that at al l. So you were in the ghetto until when?
But  in the ghetto  was ther e observance of the holidays?
I was asking you  did you know of of transports of Jews outside of the ghetto  while you were in Warsaw proper.
The Germans -- and they say  can we throw it to ghetto?
When the day was over  we were marched back into the ghetto.
Now you were probably in the ghetto for about six months or so  is that right?
One day she came and vi sited me  and I was glad to see her and  you know  hear news about our friends because she was that link  that courier who  between the ghetto and outside people.
Because we still lived in our own homes  and we had some little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the outside and I even had a paper that I could go outside of the Ghetto  because I worked in the office and I worked in the labor department  in that section.
So all of a sudden we realized we can leave the ghetto without having the yellow star pinned to our chest and were able to go to different places.

There were no more soldiers; and it was made up like a ghetto  you know.
The ghetto was approx 3-4 bl ocks around  was the ghetto.
Now  did you initially live in the small ghetto or the larger ghetto?
Actually  Russian became my first language because while I was a 2 -year -old or 3 -year -old kid in Poland  I know my parents -- even though they knew Polish but they talked with each other in Yiddish  a Jewish lang uage .
In 1943  in March  beginning of March  they liquidated Krakow ghetto.
And  I mean  she always invited people  even in the ghetto  when she saw a little urchin  a little boy  or -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 126or a little girl by themselves  and there were lots of them  she says come and well eat something.
One man had been taken along from the ghetto beside s us 50 girls who operated the soup kettles.
Second there were old men or sick men that if you would put them on the register of the in...inmates of the ghetto  they would have been killed  so this two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food  so we cut off from the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams or eighty-five grams of bread so that the othe rs can get also.
On the top  when you go out on the street  there was the overpass to go out  outside the ghetto.
That's the way they dreamed  and my men finally came off the off the bus and they surrounded them and we had a real - my men always have little food or a little schnapps and then they had the party that they didn't have in the ghetto in Shanghai.
I guess that they had uh--in the ghetto court  if somebody was caught stealing--we had a little ghetto jail.
Also in Kovno  the uh the escape from the 9th Fortress  the legendary escape from the 9th Fortress that you read later   so I uh but the main...I always am trying to stress and this is what I' ve done in my diary I think  to stress the fight of the each individual  of the inmate  the pl ain man or woman in the ghetto  even the the 56boy...child...for survival of one day.
Because  in the ghetto  as I told you  my brother would risk his life and go out to get a little food to keep for them going.
They were people simply that came from the Krakow Plas zow ghetto and were no longer the same people that were working with me in the enamel work s at Oskar Schindler in Krakow.

They also have a violin that Bert took out of the ghetto and ended up with.
My sister and I were taken to  by trucks to ghetto number one.
Once you moved into the ghetto were you ever able to leave it.
Now uh the the situation prior to our being incarcerated in the ghetto behind barbed wires  the uh terrible attacks and killings of uh Jews in the streets of Kovno  right after the outbreak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto  called for immediate resistance because we had a...also even under the Soviet occupation  1940  June 1940 to June 1941  we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zionist uh movement or leadership let's say it was  but this is entirely different character.
When I got the permit for four of us Im included  we went inside the ghetto.
We did not at the time  but now we understand that everything went to the front because it was very cold  till the day...and every day was terrible news coming into the ghetto.
And everybody was living in anticipation of what's next  and next came moving to the Ghetto.
I asked about the Western Jews who came into the ghetto.
So that its winter  the late part of 1940  you were still in the ghetto  and then -- and then what happened aft -- And tha-thats a story I can tell you  yes.
In Muhldord  I met many former inmates from Birkenau  those who left during the mass evacuation in October 1944  as well as those from a transport of non Polish Jewish inma tes who were shipped from Birkenau to Warsaw in the summer of 1943 to clear the ruins of the destroyed ghetto in that city.
Usually the ghetto was right and the Jewish cemetery was on on the hill.
In order to cross from one ghetto to th e other  also you expose yourself because there was the main street.
And he became the head of the committee of the Jewish ghetto  and probably other people.
In the neighborhood where were there many Jewish neighbors  or was it Oh yeah.
No  didnt know anything about the Warsaw ghetto  didnt know anything about I knew that they were deporting people to camps.
SB: Can you just tell me what day to day life was like in the Ghetto.
But not long wa s taking  a few days and we had to leave the ghetto.
They put us -- and have to go back to the ghetto -- and they march us back to the ghetto.
And then on the way back  he would pick up these people and bring them to the ghetto.
Because when they closed up the gates nobody can go in the ghetto  nobody can come out of the ghetto and the policeman told us we supposed to go out to the castle but we couldn't go out.
Did your parents talk about that  that they were coming in and just taking people and shooting them or taking people out of the ghetto?

EL: I went to the pottery and uh this was already the time when there were German advisors and supervisors everywhere.
We didn't live in an official ghetto  as they did in Warsaw and Lodz a nd places like that  in Poland  but for all practical purposes  once we wore the star we might as well have lived in a ghetto.
He told us that when it was the liquidation in the ghetto  he told us exactly.
They probably the people that were left behind to clean the ghetto.
Now  what happened  they built a wall between 10 - 11 feet high w -- brick walls around the ghetto  and on top of the wall there were barb wires  you know  cemented into the top of the wall  of the brick wall  so people couldn t jump over it  you kn ow.
In the ghetto  I had a barber coming every day to shave me and when I needed to give me a haircut.
So I wasn't registered Jewish be cause that's when you had to register  when you went to ghetto and I did not register because I wasn't going to go there.
For that purpose  you don't need all of the 30 000 inmates of the ghetto to report on on on the democratic square.
Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply  I read that in Orad the Wolomin was totally destroyed in 1942.
And one day he was arrested in the ghetto for killing his mother and keeping her body in his place  and using his -- her ration cards to get bread.
Used to come in the they want to collect another couple kilo gold  came in  two SS  or three  thats it  they didnt go into the ghetto.
Well  I have to tell you that around the ghetto there was nothing  which is plain fields  for miles and miles to a house and it wasn't like you could run into a building or something  there was nothing there.

He is from Wilno ghetto to send Rudnisky  that's another wooden area where they send some of the partisans went to Naro ch  that's where we were  and some went to Rudnisky forest  they called it pushcha36.
So  for the first time  a new life starts again  ghetto; which it meant they mapped out a few blocks of the city which could house only probably a tenth or maybe less than a tenth of the population  and it was with barbed wire surrounded all the way around  with doors and we had the police  the local police which they assigned to; it used to be on the outside.
We call them the ghetto  or the -- the drek commando  you know.
I dont remember exactly when but it was quite early  maybe 1942  we heard a rumor that the Lodz ghetto was sealed.
And...but I was lucky enough that Esther and Joseph Schleslinger   and then there was another...another uh...on the 11th of January  1942  the German Gestapo ordered to the one area of the ghetto  the area  to...they should vacate their their dwellings within four hours and whoever will be found in the in their dwelling in this area after the expires the four hours  you will be shot on the spot without any clarifications and whatever will be remain of their belongings will be confiscated.
And the the books I I read was actually about the events in Riga  and there was a ghetto in Riga that was a-and th-they killed the people in that ghetto in order to make room for more to people to to get there to be killed  and and this Interview with Norman Miller April 15  2013 55Jungfernhof was outside and and not too to o many details about the life  or existence of the people  their treatment.
What thoughts went through your mind as a 14 year old boy that when -- when this happens  that you have to leave your home and move into a ghetto?

Uh...I mentioned in many...in many occas ions  the important role that...uh...your father  Dr. Moses Brauns  played in the ghetto from its very beginning because...uh...30 000 Jews were ordered to move in the sma ll area of the suburb of Slobodka  which was inhabited about 8 thousand normally  and now 30 thousand Jews had to...to be squeezed in an un...impossible density  and this crea ted the first...the first big problem of contagious diseases because Slobodka was a very famous...uh...a very famous suburb from the point of view of big scholars were world famous.

I was 13 years old when the war broke out and by the time I was liberated I was  um  four-four yearsŠ three and a half years in a ghetto because I was born near the German border so the Germans arrived at the same  the first day  and schools were obsolete for Jewish children.
It was this role reversal in the ghetto that the young people were made to take over  make decisions  give yi -- e-etcetera.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 >> Bill Benson: Where were you then taken?
And when the ghetto started  we had to find somebody to exchange apartments.
I just translated a book about the Krakow ghetto and of course  I was given a lot of mat -- othe r material about the Gypsies  about -- sa -- Im telling  the last 10 years  I do still commercial work  you know  legal work and the positions and such.
When they liquidated that little ghetto from the 2000 people that they have left  they took 200 to send them to that factory to work.
And what happened  I said  ﬁWhat happened?ﬂ These men  they took them from the -- by mail  wagon mail  from the ghetto.
Because certainly you had talented people in the Warsaw ghetto and they had work shops  that they ran quite differently.
I dont remember I used to fight with my brothers  I dont remember one fight in the ghetto.
That evening when I went back to the ghetto  I suspect that I was the first person who notified people inside the ghetto that that had happened.
It was a very  very hard time for me because I didn't bother to find place in the ghetto because I  I thought uh I  I could try to  to save my husband and my brother.
At that point  we knew that the Wilno Ghetto had a lot of actions  that a lot of people were being killed and taken away and the Judenrot had to submit the people.
AT: Well I  I buried things in the ghetto in order to keep from the Germans you understand.
October 13 - Rumor has it that 300 ghetto inmates will be sent to Riga.

I could see the ghetto on fire; I could see people burning on fire  to the water because the little lake  the river was passing by.
And...uh...there Vladka was  as the main courier  moving arou nd a lot...much about this  but came after a few days...came .
Of course they were all very glad to have to get out of the ghetto and have someone to talk to.
So it means that from June 41  until April 42  in Mlynov there was no ghetto?
I remember there was...the commandant  the German commandant of the Vilno ghetto was called Weiss and he was an SS man  Gestapo and the...the commandant of the guard was Malver .
That sort of continue d until 1943 when the Ghetto was eliminated.
Actually  it was in the section of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews.
There were special stores for Jewish people  already in the city of Kovno  so maybe they are moved to the ghetto.
You had to m ove to first  to so-called Jewish houses that had a big star on them and  eventually to the ghetto.
Well  let me ask you a question and then Il l ask you about the ghetto.
In the summer of 1941  perhaps even in the la te spring of 1941  the Topor ol organization  that organization that was dedicated to the agricultural work  sees an opportunity of utilizing all empty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for the starving ghetto.
And whose -- in the ghetto  were there -- were -- was anybody working during the day?
At five o'clock in the morning when only one sentry is at the gate...they start only at six o'clock th ey start move from the ghetto  so you come at five o'clock in the morning and he bribed the the the sentry.
And I got in the ghetto and I drove to where my mother and father were and what happened was my mother was so worried and so nervous and upset she used to bite the back of her hand to keep her --- she bit off her flesh because she was so upset.
And I dont remember how many people were in Terezin at the time  but the ghetto was very full of people.
Then they made them go into the woods  dig their graves  and then they shot them.

We arrived in Wilno and we were able to go in into the ghetto without any problem.
They took Jews out  but still the ghetto  they keep it.
But coming back in the ghetto  that was a big problem because on the gate  the Germans was searching you and you didn't...you was not allowed to bring in the ghetto anything.

And at that point my father thought that it was too dangerous to stay in od  that there were talks about making a ghetto in one part of the city where the poorer people...where the poorer Jewish population lived  and they were going to push everybody in there...uh...and since my Mother's home town was a small town called Wierzbnik-Starachowice  and my Mother still had relatives living over there  we...we thought that it would be easier for us to get there and  you know  we were hoping that the Germans would not be able to follow us.

>> Bill Benson: I don't want to slow you up because of the time  but you told me that while in the Rig a ghetto  the Jewish community did its best to try to have some sense of normalcy   to have a place of trying to educate the kids to the extent you could.
When we were being gathered -- when we were being taken to the train  while we were in the ghetto  in our hometown  these neighbors never came to ask if we needed anything  if they could help us  if we were hungry  if we were thirsty.
Interesting is  that when we  there were some neighbors in the house and 7 they said  ﬁYou know   well look at that  theyre taking us to a ghetto and theyre  they will deport us.ﬂ And my father  who I told you was a lawyer  he said  ﬁBut this is against European  the .
In those days you had to get a special permission to be able to  and I travelled by train  and even then  before the ghetto was not closed in Warsaw  I was not there when the ghetto was closed  I was there before it was closed  but all the Jews lived within a certain district  and it was just terrifying.
Now let me tell you a little bit about our ghetto  because it was a little different then for instance  the Lodz ghetto.
They had -- we had our own Jewish police and a Jewish sort of committee  government thing with a -- with a leader of that.
It was a very  very hard uh feelings already in the ghetto.
In the ghetto we came ri ght in and I have to say this because there's feeling I have.
He said  \ I know of a treasure that was buried in the ghetto by my father.
Maybe there will be too many people in the other ghetto.
In the ghetto of course  the situation was disastrous because we had to share - in the ghetto we were assigned a room to share with another family.
They wasn't  when the ghetto was - 02:23:44 31 they came out and they mixed with the other ne ighbors.
Now  my brother was influential  but because he worked for the bergermeister and because he was able outside  even though he was picked up everyday from -- the SS man used to come down and pick him up every day from the ghetto  from the gate of the ghetto  march him to the bergermeisters.
Once they put us into this ghetto  this area  each family received one room .
The...as an aside I suppose I could uh relate an incident uh...and you can bring me back to where I am later if you can  if you remember...uh I was delivering a talk at the uh at the uh I think it was anniversary  thirty-eighth or fortieth...I some how can't recall...I think it was the fortieth anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising uh at that uh loca...in uh the and I was asked to say a few words uh as representative of the Allied Forces and their effort in that direction  and having done so as I left the microphone a man ran up to me and said General  he said  don't you remember me?
So  life wasnt easy  but Father was pleased that he could occupy peacetime in a very constructive way  and he was instrumental in creating  so to say  a controlled atmosphere in the ghetto  where Jews did not have to be grabbed in the morning  you know  whether they were on th eir way to a morning service or running there was no synagogue  anyhow  because the synagogue was burned on Yom Kippur day in our town.
We are five or six  whatever the figure was  we are going back to the ghetto  one missing  that's death.
And they decided to make a ghetto in the -- in Vilno.
The Germans could always go inside to the police  but the restriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go inside the ghetto.

And they uh the orders that to come the ghettos what the remaining the ghetto was already small.
Germans selected about 20 or 30  I don't know how many  young woman to take them to a farm far away from Ghetto to dig out vegetables that were ripe to pick up vegetables.
They were one of the first to be deported to Auschwitz.

What was there -- you see  the Jewish bakeries from before the war  that were there over on the ghetto  they were baking bread.
It was a duplex  and in one part of the house was the owner  who was Polish  on the side of the non-ghetto side  and this was kind of still considered to be part of the ghetto.
There was the Jewish street and they started making the Ghetto all around.
And then she added to that  I brought it from the ghetto.
She got papers just for herself and her son  and father was very active in the ghetto also being a custom tailor.
And  do you ever talk to anyone else before you leave the ghetto?
Did it become more important over time or did you lose  did you lose faith in God because of what happened or... Many times  when I was in the ghetto suffering a lot  I used to think  \ I don't think there is God because if ther e would be God  something like this wouldn't happen to my little sister and  you know \ .
And  and when the ghetto was closed  did your father get a job and you got a job and your brother?
And -- so they start bringing in in Proushinna ghettos  of ssome -- those that are fortunate and the ghetto swelled from about -- we had -- like is mentioned  6000 Jews  1000 from here  2000 from here  so finally the ghetto swelled to 12 000.
100 So even i -- di -- did people in the ghetto know that he was married and had a child?
I helped to moved this -- my old lady with sons  with husband  to move to ghetto.
No  I know that  but while you were in the ghetto did you  were you aware of the Judenrat  did you... Sure.
And when we were in the ghetto  we did not have much  because we were taken away our homes.
We understood they were the two Jewish bakeries that they could only bake bread for the Jews.
02:50:39 It was hard for me to separate myself from th em  but on the other hand  I was  I was exhilarated  it was a chance for me to get out from the ghetto.
We couldnt take too much because this house we lived in in the ghetto  they organized the Jewish Judenrat.
And it was just an area where there were barracks for people to -- to -- to -- to live in.
And nothing will happen and usually when it was dark they let in the workers from outside  the slave workers in to the ghetto.
And the -- the most unfortunate thing was that the ghetto area was small  and the population in Vilnius was big.
He went at the time to the Germ an ghetto  his girl friend.
They lived right by the gate of the...by the...not by the gate but by the fence of the ghetto.
SB: Miriam  can you tell me what the workshops were in the ghetto.
So father decided that we have to leave the ghetto and try to find hiding somewhere else.
And when you came into the ghetto and you're registering there are almost 200 000 people  right?
That was in France  then  like I said  I got the job in the Toyota Company  which helped me get a pass out of   out of the ghetto.
Of course  now  because I have translated a lot of works on the Holocaust  I discovered - I have been discovering constantly new phases of the war that I was totally unaware of  because I didnt even want to dwell on it So  now  all these years later  50 years later  I am first finding out about   okay  I knew about the Lodz ghetto  I wrote - I translated a book on this.
Is there a po ster that says Jews have to be -- Oh yes  it was on poster  that at such and such date  all Jews have to be transported -- transport themselves to the ghetto  to -- a-and says what streets there were -- you know  w-what quarter  that means.
So  there were people in th e Lodz Ghetto from around other places?
7 Q. Did you have any other experiences in se eing what was happening in the ghetto or knowing about it?
Now  the emotion that I had  to go back to the ghetto  was very  very hard.
So ma ny times even though I promised my mother I wouldnt do it  I would sneak out of the ghetto.
The ambulance pulled inside the ghetto a nd they took away Behnker and and and the commander and all went away.
Look  I left the Warsaw ghetto in late summer or early fall '41.
We took grandpa's diary  selected sites we wanted to see; for examp le  where his house was in the ghetto.
They had some plans  they had set up their way of doing things  and uh  they decided that one day  was the 28th of November in 1941  that there are too many people in the ghetto  old ones and chil-children  crippled one  and they can't feed that many.
Wh en you had left them in the ghetto in Lvov Yeah.
Q. What about institutions in the Ghetto  lik e hospitals or soup kitchens  did that kind of thing exist?
Two weeks later  the entire family was sent to the ghetto.
There were no beds or kitchens in a brick factory  so we brought some blankets with us  you know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the ghetto where we stayed  where we had our little place on the floor.
But I'm  what I'm thinking -- in this abnormal condition  with enormous pressure of the German from the outside  with the population probably being very often not very happy with whats going on  to have this kind of an administration -- so that since we're taken care of  no matter -- no matter what  I think that people who survive the ghetto  if not for this kind of an administration  would not survive it until August the 25  1944  because the ghetto would have been closed.
Tell me  when did you s did you find another job  during the war  when the Germans were there?
Ovariotomy there were separations  by the time they liquidated the Ghetto it was tiny  maybe six thousand Jews were left.
Eric Yakobovitch was in charge of all the all the industry in the ghetto.
So we went to him and we told him we didnt feel well and wed like to go see a doctor  we actually wanted to go out and see what happened to the little ghetto.
As my name is Schier  my maidens name  so you -- I was almost from the end -- to the end  leaving the ghetto.
He wrote a book called  ﬁThe Lvov Ghetto Diary.ﬂ And he was a -- He was good friends with my father.
But I got into ghetto because I wanted to see what happened to my mother.
They called it peat moss  and they use it for heating and cooking  and so -- and they would take the young girls  mostly young girls and young men and send outside the ghetto about 40 or 50 -kilometers outside the ghetto  and there were big fields and we had to dig out peat moss from there  and that was dug out and put on bridges and put on the lawn to be dried and turned over and dried up again  and then it was shipped into the city.
When there were the factories  the German factories opened up in -- in Warsaw ghetto  there were different factories in different parts of -- of Warsaw.
I didn't see because when I was in the ghetto was in the beginning  you know.
The night before...so I told...of course  I told Dr. Elkes about my plans  that I have to escape from the ghetto  and the the last night I spent in the house  in the tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes  the head of the community  and his deputy Garfunkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the very full sense of the word.
And we got back into the trucks and we drove on  and then we came to a place with barbed wire and it became the Ghetto which was known under several.
And my other sister came to the ghetto somehow  hiding  asking what to do.
And the ghetto -- can you just give us this frame  the ghetto existed from what date until your fathers execution and then beyond.
Youre caught within the Jewish ghetto at that time  that is within the area they designated?
Then the big action came from the big ghetto and then  of course  they run around with the loudspeakers.
And in the beginning in the ghetto  families were still allowed to be together which was a good thing and didn't last all too long because every few w eeks there would be a selection -- oh  yeah.
I thought you said you and your husband also received a relocation order.
And then I went  and they took me right away back to the ghetto.
And my stepfather had to register to move into the ghetto  which was being raised in Krakow for all the Jews to get in.
So he tried to avoid the fate of Kaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate   because Kaunas didnt have forests.
Two days later  they said that all the people who remained in the ghetto  they have to march seven kilometers  which is approximately three miles in our measurements here.
And this is a task that will be written always in the annals of the three years of the Kovno Ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: David  before you go on from there   when they liquidated the ghetto and took the 8 000 away  before they did that  besides your sister  you also sneaked out of the ghetto.
As the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller  the Germans have been giving the Jews smaller quarters to live  and because they wanted them all together  they were forming what wasn't even a ghetto yet but an area that was dedicated for the Jews.
Well  how I got out to the ghetto  as I had to get at night to -- I cut the barbed wire with a pair of pliers  opened up a big hole  and crawled through that hole.
But the big problem was after a few weeks  maybe  they decided to move back to their old neighborhood  the Jewish 8 neighborhood  where there were lots of vacant apartments since the Jews had been taken away.
My mother  my father  my brother was in one side and my uncle was on the other  and they took us from the ghetto and they took us to the place where the people are working  to the airport.

SB: Um  tell me a little bat about--a bit about the ghetto council.
When did you -- can you tell us a little bit more about when you began to think and talk with your friends about your -- Well  this happened in 1942  this and then -- see  we had so many brought in in that ghetto  escapees.
This soon changed  because my mother approached me and she said \ Regina  you have to leave the ghetto.\

You had mentioned to me that it was considered an open ghetto.
We were only allowed in the area which was considered the open ghetto  but the non-Jews  the Poles  could come into our area  and so could maybe  and so cer tainly did the Germans.
Look  when we came into the ghetto  we tried to ma intain the same life style that we had before the ghetto  because we didn't know what the next day will bring.

So  then we walked from the ghetto to these concentrated places  to serve them jobs like I told you where we lived  all day long there  they took a big apartment building and from the bottom to the very top  which was the six or seven stories high  was --one was the place where they made the boots for the Nazis.
And we stood in ...in Warsaw ghetto and many times people came with regards from their were very religious town so we could get from time to time a kosher meat  what they smuggled in from...not from this town  from Sobolif or from Otvorz   and they came to the ghetto and they had their clients or sometimes we had meat also which was a holiday at this time.
We know that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough  so we want to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are now only for those who don't work in order to make sure who is...these who are working  so we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto  th irty thousand  should report on the 28th of October on the big square democratic  families-wise and groups of working-wise  you see  and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one place those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't work will get the same rations as now.
My mother was caught in one of those raids  and they let her out because she had no J on her passport  and many people asked to tape on the back of her bag or  or on the back of her bike or in the bag of her bike  a Jewish baby  take out of the ghetto.
But there was a lot of these hiding places  and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in ghetto  that a lot of people were safe this way.
And then we realized that whatever w ill be  we have to go to Raddan  to the ghetto.
The hospital was located in a T-shaped area that was cut out of the ghetto  but inside the ghetto.
Now  anybody caught between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning outsid e the ghetto only meant one thing  the guy is trying to escape.
No  I -- at first  we were living like a mansion to you  in a basement apartment where we came.
We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the ghetto too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening.
And the engineer and my aunt from Warsaw ghetto probably she was already there.
We wanted to go in and the ghetto was surrounded by Polish police  Ukraine  other kind.
The hospital was on the small ghetto  on the other side of the bridge.
They are taking out the ghetto the Jews.ﬂ We escaped the first transport of 5 000.
As far as Sonder Commando  to  what I know about them is I saw them working in ghetto in the beginning  a little later.
Well  not in the street  they came in -- into the ghetto within the compound and they would just grab people [indecipherable] men and women and sometimes some of them wouldnt show back up.
It's...it's our....\  So in a way  we started to be very independent and kind of rebellious  and continued to do that even in the ghetto.
Now  we had a big dilemma because if they escaped and we knew from the ghetto I b Qd if one did anythi ng wrong  all of us would be done.
But we married very young  my wife was less than 16  we got married in Warsaw ghetto.

Can you go back and tell me about how old you were and what you were doing at that time when your  when you were in the Lodz ghetto  what life was like and what you decided to do.
And so we were told approximately where the ghetto is  and we had to take whatever we could with us  belongings  and we went to the ghetto in Chernowitz.
How did the ghetto change over the time that you were there?
But I don t think she fully expected the hunger  and the filth  and the sickness within the ghetto.
We hear about it  that there is a ghetto in Czechoslovakia  but we didn't know what it was about.
So we are dealing with the era within ' 41 and ' 42  May. See  that's the interim period  that's when I'm talking ghetto life  you know.
And the reason he brought us back is because he wanted to destroy the ghetto  because they didnt want to leave anyt hing that was Jewish  so we lived in the synagogue and made the camp and every day went out and we destroyed house by house.

I see many Polish and Ukrainians  no  Polish and Germans  right there watching the sewers and th e top of the sewer comes off and Jews from the ghetto trying to escape and theyre being shot on the spot or taken aw ay.

And as I told you my brother was graduated high school in  in the ghetto was a group of  a lot of young people went to school and he 8 got a very good position in a  this food distribution store.
So -- so as a result  thes e people who went into the ghetto were obviously the same -- same groups  of social groups.
There was a building  barracks  if you like  that was all fenced in  inside the camp.

So  we lived in my uncle's house until they closed the ghetto.
But -- And they knew about it  of course  but they didnt -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the Warsaw ghetto  there was a little column  one column  but about four or five inches tall  about a revolt in the Warsaw ghetto  which was liquidated by -- the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers.
What did you eat for breakfast and dinner in the ghetto?
Your work forced labor PT: I was not forced to work because they at Altesten- rat  they managed a work in the ghetto  so mother of little children had not to go to work.
By...by the end of 1941  many people had been taken out of the ghetto  but again if they were taken to Auschwitz  we didn't know.

We went to work in the ghetto  we called in Werkstaton (SP?)
We were fortunate that my brother's apartment was in the ghetto  so we could move into his  so he had two rooms  so we moved in in one room and he had one room.
We stayed in there for almost three years in that area  two years in the ghetto  one year in the slave labor camp.
He had to go downtown to where later on it became the major ghetto.
That's  again  an interesting story of how Jewish life continued to strive in the ghetto in spite of the circumstances.
Do you know that the ghetto was divided by bridge and the people went from this holder on this side was what you would see when you see from the other side still where  and it disappeared.
It was May 5th or so or -- that they started the last liquidation of the ghetto and they collected all of the people and at that point the realization was that something bad was going to happen.
That means in the ghetto you don't go never back again.
And his father was not Jewish  so he didnt have to move into the ghetto.
So they started with the deportation out of Theresienstadt   you know?
Not only the Jewish people were frightened but everybody was frightened of the Germans.
Do I go do I believe Tadek or go back to the ghetto  live or there or go with Tadek to the unknown?
And we -- And couple weeks later  they round up all the Jews from the city and around the city  suburbs and they put us all in this place and surrounded us with walls and a gate.
We had big workshops that worked eighteen hundred  mostly women who could not go out of work from outside the ghetto  a nd there were a carpentr y and tailorship and and plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing  cleaning...all for the German army  but we...and so so uh the German supervisor of the ghetto used to come to the Jewish committee or he used to come straight to th e workshop.
Now  in that time  what was going on in the ghetto.
And so it was that we got first...the first contact with the with the Zionist underground in the ghetto of Vilna  and we developed later on also to send letters from families from the ghetto of Kovno to families in the ghetto of Vilna.

Acro ss the street from one of the streets in the ghetto  you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs  and they were begging for bread.
I didnt go outside the ghetto  we just crossed the bridge.
So my mother--we were not allowed to take musical instruments into the ghetto so she sold the piano to some Lithuani- an family and she use to work everyday.
They  there  they were  I me an  yes  no  there were some Jews who did not live in the ghetto.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 4 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: to such a point that when the Germans came  we found a relief because they stopped that indiscriminate slaugh- ter.
And her -- the women who worked with her  who hold her during the ghetto for some times  Vera  also find out that she came  and she helped her.
One day  I with the father  we work in the farm and we didnt go to sleep in the ghetto afte r that what the guy say what the German take from him all the gold stuff what he need to wo rk around that.
As a matter of fact  the ghetto could get almost any food you wanted  but you had to pay very highly.
He was allowed to leave the ghetto and report to my father  and to Leist.
1944 was the year when they started liquidating the Lodz Ghetto.
And at that point  one uncle died from starvation in ghetto.
But every ghetto Univad would pay basically to send Gentiles to the Slovan ghetto or to the other ghetto to find out what's going on.
And my father and his family decided to escape from the ghetto.
Never  never -- I wanted so much to live as I -- as -- and to survive as it was in the ghetto.
To me it was a step backwards to move to Great Neck  which is kind of a gilded ghetto  and I prefer Washington for that.
We thought maybe they had taken them into a camp someplace else  but that they were killed?
So we stayed there for about two weeks  hidden in the basement  until one day we hear the Germans civilians coming into the house and chasing us all out.
And she  when she saw the disaster in the ghetto  she put her child under a convents door.
From the time of the ghetto  you were wearing the armband?
SB: Tell me about the--there was a time when everyone had to assemble from the ghetto.
The old ghetto is the people what they are not registered to work  and we were in the young ghetto.
And what  how did you feed  how did your family support itself during that time  before the ghetto  that it lost the store?
One was a location order and since the Jews tended to live in a certain area anyhow there wasn't really that much relocation.
Let me now  let's just talk a bout the ghetto for a while; okay?
We knew  we expected the ghetto  you're going to be rationed food.
Anyway  there were certain places to deliver food  very small homes  very small at the beginning of the ghetto.
And on that day 10 000 people were separated and uh driven to the little ghetto first.
A ll the goodies which we had before the war and the ghetto which is called Poland.
A little furt her up  oh about 10 - 15 blocks  they had another se ction you had some more ghetto another ghetto.
Then when this rumor started around the Ghettos that Lithuanian underground does not accept Jews  then Jewish people in Ghetto probably felt that this is not the solution.
And the -- we moved to a place that was almost like a ghetto  because it was an very old house  and most of the people there had to move out quickly  had to move into places like that  so that was quite a shock.
And you saw people jumping from roof to roof while the ghetto uprising was going on?
He was the -- the -- th-the -- the head of the Jewish ghetto.
This wasn't over for the whole week  for everyone in ghetto to see it.
So I uh spent uh--that was the extent of my schooling during the ghetto period for a period of some months where I uh got lessons on--on--on the Bible.
The Germans even tried  they made some of the people to write notes to the ghetto that they are fine  they are alive  and they are working.
So anyway  so we went there and we went back to Warsaw.
And so at that point  I went back to the Sweedish house  and shortly after that  the Sweedish house was evacu ated and taken in to the ghetto.
You ha ve to think and to understand the the Nazis who had time enough to learn their mentality  so they disclosed the whole thirty thousand books of the library of the...of the ancient library of of the ghetto and they take  of course  immediately Rabbi so Dr. Elkes stood up and he said  excuse me  gentlemen.
And then I went again  pick ed up the wire  and I dont know  nobody looked  and I went I went to her again  ask her please take me  I I cant be in the ghetto.
Oh  all all the time  but at at the very beginning of of the of the ghetto  there was optimism.
First thought was  we probably going to go to Auschwitz or one of those places.
And you know  the -- the ghetto was so packed  everybodys on the street and they see you.
Uh  luckily that I was...I got a room where uh where there was a uh (pause) the leadership of the camp - there there was at that time there was leader of the camp  of Theresiens tadt was [Dr. Jacob] Edelstein  and he went probably uh and also uh... Pardon me  I was where at the ghetto [wahe ] it was winter  a very severe winter  and we we had to stand there for many hours in the uh uh in the barracks.
As the ghetto was tightening  and the Aktions became prevalent every couple of w eeks  we were lined up.
So  a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the Ghetto because the Ghetto was very bad.
And so we u we went we went to another place where they made like a ghetto  you know?
I cant quite understa nd because it doesnt become a closed ghetto.
01:15:36 Well  also during that time  as I had mentioned to you before  during the night many times the  the SS2 or the police not the Dutch police but the German patrol  police or whatever their designation was came to various homes  looked for Jews  wanted to see their ID papers  wanted to see whether they had special permits to stay away from being sent for relocation in the east  and these special stamps were sometimes that you had a you did quote  unquote  \ a very important work\  or that you had the possibility of getting a visa to get out of Holland via Portugal or that maybe you had instead of four Jewish grandparents you had only three Jewish grandparents.
It was quite a distance  and I know that we had quite a lot of stuff by the time we came to the Ghetto  so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really -- it's blank.
A. There were  there were liaison people who were coming from the ghetto  mostly by sewers or other ways.
Somehow they managed to get back to the Warsaw Ghetto  to Treblinka.
Children in the ghetto  you drew some of the chil- dren.

Until the end of 1942  the ghetto in Sosnowiec was what you called an open ghetto  which means that we were not...we were not walled in.
In the morning  they take out us from the...from the warehouse  and they brought us to the ghetto.
I was speaking German and Polish not as fluent and then my father taught me Russian  and some Hebrew.
You uh...you uh...there were approximately sixteen to eighteen hundred Jews in that little ghetto.
Somebody picked it up and ran to the ghetto in Siau liai.
So he didn't ...uh...he asked to go to and asked him to get...allow a permission to go into this small part of the ghetto where the 10 000 were...were...were concentrated and this permi ssion to take out very hard cases.
About my father and two brothers  we weren't sure  but this man which was a neighbor in Lodz Ghetto  he was in the line behind them.

Actually  I want to stop you  because as far as I can tell there's a period when you were living on this kibbutz in the ghetto  how many  and I want to hear more about that and just the ghetto life itself.
Was it can you tell me like approximately what size the ghetto was?
I dont know if thats by an accident or what  he be was a fire on the roof in in the ghetto.
They were in Lodz ghetto and they perished and they probably were the first to die from hunger because they were not able to work.
I have to tell you that this engineer  whose name is Selek -----sky   he has been honored with a gold medal from the Israeli Government and h is is the first place in the Valley of the Righteous that these people established  because most of those people survived the Warsaw uprising  not the ghetto uprising  the other uprising  he got them all out ------.

One night  one night before the transport from this Lodz ghetto came in  they clean up the camp  and they burn all the gypsies in one night  the children  the wives  and the woman  children  everybody else.
And the  at that time in ghetto  we were approximately thirty-five thou  thirty-five t housand Jews in the Kovna ghetto  and this was uh too many for them.
Martin's family was transported to a ghetto in the nearby town of Munkacs.
Was this camp somehow in between being a labor camp and a ghetto?
But it was very dangerous to bring it back into ghetto because you were searched lots of times.
I went with my husband from this first ghetto to agricultural work.
Remember I said I walked out from the appel and go out  they  they choose me to get  to go out a nd they keep me there  because they left in the ghetto 300 people to do work.
We have  I have few close friends  very close  we were all very close  we know each other  but I was in a much luckier position  uh  uh much lucky b ecause I was a professor before the war  and I was teaching in every Jewish gymnasium in Krakow  and lot of my students were in ---------  and they were a very  very close friend  and I tried to help them as much  and they were trying to help me  and many times happened that they helped me i n  in  in  in the ghetto  for example  one of my students was a  in the police  in the out there  he asked and beg the German to let me go because I was already in a transport to go  and they let him uh  the to the-----------this is a very important person  and he  he let me out  but you see  the  the  the  the respect and love was tremendous.
AR: As the rule the Kovno ghetto police--they're rea- sonably decent people.
But the ghet -- but the ghetto mone y functioned inside the ghetto  right?
The Warsaw Ghetto U pri sing began on April 19  1943  and continued until the final liquidation of the ghetto   May 16  1943.
and a couple months..) We used to  people used to go out from the ghetto to work in factories or in railroad station  wherever they 4 needed some help  workers  they sent out our Jews there.
Also the streets were more wealthy people lived  not just the neighborhood where the poor people lived  also where... And from that ghetto nobody could leave.
But you moved to -- when you moved into the ghetto  th-the name of the streets really short.
Now  our group  considering the way we were armed  its unbelievable  having -- because I -- I -- y-y-y-y-y -- in -- come to think of -- I was mention  in -- in Warsaw ghetto  it was so rough to -- you know  it was so rough to smug -- to get arms in.
We have to try to bring people from -- from the ghetto s. And he wrote a letter to his cousin  it was still in a -- in 28 [indecipherable] in Novagudek ghetto and he told him  organize as much as you can  because they had another pes -- farmer that spoke beautifu l Jewish  you would never sa -- say that hes a Gentile.
For example  people would pour milk down the drain-pipes to the ghetto part.
It did condition us  however  to be really fearful and terrorized and made us realize that uh we have virtually no choices  because the community  the the Christian community  the Polish community outside the ghetto was not supportive or sympathetic.
There were two friends of mine who came from Lodz ghetto  twin sisters  beautif ul girls.

My father was -- he volunteered for the ghetto police  which meant that he had twice as much food as everybody else did.
Means that the Jews were taken out and a lot of people escaped and settled down  so there was...was a big conglomeration of people in the Vilno...in the Vilno ghetto.
But we could -- I could still see the starving Jews who would escape from ghetto and die on the pavement from -- from starvation.
A gentile should work so much to bring people out of ghetto  but he done it.
So the sled came and I -- you know  to the ghetto.
If I remember correctly  the windows were not blocked in this streetcar that I took  and shortly after this it was some change in the relationship between big ghetto and small ghetto.
And then we were the last transport out of the ghetto in '44 and we did not go to Auschwitz.
When when the Germans build the ghetto  he was taken with the children there was about 200 children Were they Jewish?
He went to th e ghetto  and...uh...an d...the only way I hear d from him was the day when I was in Juliana's house in another room with...uh...with the Blachowicz family which lives in Israel.
Linkova Street and the Old City quarters were cut off from the ghetto.
And anyway  I would come to the ghetto and bring her the food and whatever else they ne eded and I went there practically every day.
Because I a -- I ask him  is that all the ghetto here?
Now  is that where you lived  or wer -- later were there -- was there a [indecipherable] No  I think that is a mistak e. It was no ghetto in Turka.
In other words our building was on the inside of the ghetto which was the last building by the wall.
So everybody was making groups to take a room in the ghetto.
We asked  \ Why can't you take us back to the ghetto we just came from?\
And I dont know -- I think I mentioned it in my a -- interview in Washington  D.C.  after I was taken out from the ranks of those who arrived that da y  around 3 000 we were  fr -- between the ghetto from Piaski and Izbitsa  they asked for textile experts and I raised my hand and I was taken out.
I didnt sit in the ghetto  the eight month of the ghetto was  I don t know if I was a month in the ghetto.
And it wasn't going to get any better before the ghetto.
So  I assume that thats how we got out of the ghetto.
What do you remember about that first day the Germans entered your town?
In the ghetto  we were til approximately 42  the end of 40  the beginning or the middle of 42.
So as we went downstairs  at the door  the Germans were waiting for us  and put us in the ghetto.

Then my Mom my father talked to the head nurse and she gave her a job in the orphanage i n the ghetto.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Bill Benson: They were doing what you were doing?
But that was not -- they used to come into the ghetto and line us up and pick out people out of this line for deportation.
In the Altestenrat  how was the mech anism and what role my father played in the beginning in the ghetto  and later in the ghetto?
Then they told them  \ You are the Univad \  and they said  \ You are going to be the president and this is where we'll begin to have a government \  and a ghetto was formed.
Even in our ghetto in Lublin  the situation was not as desperate as in Warsaw.
Uh  I worked in the bakery and the uh bakery was obvi- ously was baking bread for--for the ghetto residents.
Well  I oh uh I know  uh  uh  we all were in the ghe tto of Krakow  and by that time I was already married  and the ghetto of Krakow comparing to ghetto of Warsaw was not as terrible when my mother could not stay  when she stayed with us in Krakow during the pre-ghetto days  when ghetto was established  oh  oh even before that uh people who came after September  1939  to Krakow  who were not uh before that then  had to leave the city  and they could choose  uh  any city or town within the gen  gen  general government  which wa s not the Deutshe Reich  the uh German Reich proper  so she chose to go to Warsaw  and for a  uh maybe twice I went to visit her with a special permission.
I believe  that was the first 6 we knew wherever we were going to be taken to  it was not going to be freedom  and it was not going to be a great relocation.
Nobody send in to the ghetto to help  which consul send in?
Somebody in the family acquired it  some sort of forged paper that said that he was Hungarian  not Jewish which would have allowed him to leave the ghetto and move away.
I may have known some of  some of them personally and often they had to perform very hard assignments like rounding up  like making up lists or rounding up people for relocation from lists that were provided to them.
It is it is out of bounds  so I I went to the commandant of the ghetto and I told him that since it was it was October...in in Lithuania in October it is already cold and very cold and we had no firewood in the ghetto and what they used to give us  just like the hundred grams of 64bread  this was the same story with the with the firewood  so I told them in the small ghetto  some families left some firewood.

I had met the Eichengreens on the way to the ghetto.
Of course a lot of Poles were coming in to work in the ghetto.
Before even I came to work  my Christian acquaintance was standing behind the gate of the ghetto and she said  don't look for your father.
I mean  I -- Yiddish I speak fluently  I would say.
And the final life in the ghetto was until May the 20th.
She gave my mother some bread and food and of course the photograph  and mother came back to the bigger ghetto  basically again  walking with 30 kilometers.
A -- Murer used to come very often to ghetto to check on non-working population  because there was supposed to be no non-working population.

You and your mother and your brother went out of the ghetto together and then you met your father there?
We got the sense that we got to move into the ghetto.
As a result  the Lithuanian health department immediately flooded the ghetto  and it is in your book written the dates they came and flooded because they justifiabl e looked for the...for the cause of the...of the disease.
The ghetto was formed around the area where we lived  so we didn't have to move  other than give up some of our uh  rooms and so forth to accommodate other people.
My father and my sister had to leave our dwelling because the Germans who were shrinking and shrinking the size of the Ghetto.
You know this is those people they used to call them in Polish in the ghetto  Schmaltzovnik .
I  my wife is many times surprised people much older than I  ten or fift een years older  know my father  knew him ghetto  knew him in concentration camp  he always tried to help somebody.
We would sing Jewish  Polish-because this was my language at that... I was educated in Polish.

Janis came to pick me up one day at the Ghetto and marched me to the next apartment.
They think its they have kilogram of gold and two kilograms silver throughout the first three days; so the ghetto was established. . .
I was in ghetto with my husband three days and then they took him to work.

So they start -- first of all  in Warsaw  there was a big ghetto.
Unfortunately  they paid their way and the survival was not in place because what they did not ghetto in Slonya  not necessarily did they do in the ghetto in Jatel or in the Rachen or someplace else.
Because this was in the woods and the ghetto now  Ill describe the bunker in just a moment.
Were times hard for other people in the Ghetto  or was this Ghetto not too severe?
And what we saw on that train  they came from a ghetto  Lodz still was a ghetto at the time.
To tell you also that when we came to the ghetto  there was somebody who was distri buting the apartments.
My aunt knew the O.D. man [ph]  the one used to march us from one place to another  and he had to be in the ghetto.
Inside the ghetto we had shops that were making shoes and wooden shoes and toys uh and--and--and clothing--there was a tailoring shop and--and all sorts of different things and--and many Jews were employed to work in what they called eh the Verchstactin.
And he was taken right away from the ghetto  and the second they came in with trucks and wagons and made a liquidation.
I got caught once  I ran  I walked out of the ghetto and I was going to my house.
But they had a suspicion  anybody hiding there  they burned the--the uh houses to the ground when the ghetto was liquidated.
Nobody could leave the ghetto and everybody was taken away in last moment to Estonia  Latvia  and we didn't know exactly what's going to happen.
How would he recognize me  I dont know  because I had I And you were walking on the streets of the ghetto  or outside?

She took my sister under her arm and my father took me under his arm.
To own a book was an act of defiance  capital punishment  punishable by death; yet all over the ghetto there were secret libraries.
There's a lot of things that were hidden in the ghetto  because Jewish people don't give up their culture and their stuff.
45 The Jews that you are meeting in the ghetto  were they not of your economic class because the Russians had sent out most of the Bourgeois?
And here is where at what date the the ghetto was  was effect.

There was a point when I was with my mother and my sister and we found out that the ghetto is being liquidated.
He was doing PR for the Germans to o  you know  they were advertising what {type of} ghetto do you have and how the Jews are working for them.
So  I should say that you survived the ghetto in Lodz.
They were the ones appointed to rule the -- quote/unquote   rule the ghetto and provide the German Army with whatever their requests were.
You know  in ghetto they used to say  look at commandants face when he is on the street.
Now in June 1943 there was another razzia; and  well  this time...I think it was the 20th of June  uh  another razzia took place where they took a tremendous big amount of people  whereby my husband's family who had moved...who had lived originally in Rotterdam...they were obliged to mo...to move to the ghetto as Jews  to Amsterdam  and now um in June the 20th  June the 20th  they were picked up in a razzia and taken by train straight to Westerbork and from there on.

And I just want to ask  how long were you in the ghetto?
And that brigade  when I said  ﬁSee me ﬂ they grabbed me right away and they brought me in the ghetto.
You know  well  let me ask you  were your contacts mostly with the administration within the ghetto  or did you also have contact with the German authorities?
For example...uh....a suit what is cost a lot of money  and you go out from the ghetto  you just for 100 grams or quarter pound bread  you give the suit.
Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10  2014 15 What was a typical day in the ghetto like?

So if you are out of the ghetto  youre in your home  a nd the Christians who were in the ghetto to get out.
But the 28 flames were so concentrated ar ound the whole ghetto that it illuminate the whole city.
I get lost in Washington  DC  if I don't see the Washington monume nt and here I sort of directed her within two blocks of where we were in the ghetto and found the house.
You were born in 1941.What were you told about what happened when the Germans first came?
And then we had to go to the ghetto of Minsk.
and sort of how you felt day to day while you were living in the ghetto.
There is a morale...and...and when I ta lk about...about your father when he was in the ghetto  I'll come back to it why in the very crucial day before the 28th of October  when the great selection of 10 000 inmates of th e ghetto were taken out  he didn't want to comply with the order of the Gestapo that the Jewish Council should order...should not publish...should order all the inmates of the ghetto...then the population of 30 000  to report at the 28th of October at 6 in the morning at the...at the Seventh square.
in your head  that hey -- Well  Ill tell you  because I didnt -- I want to say that in 19 -- when they established the ghetto in 1941  in -- in October -- now  in beginning 1942  they broke into Proushinna ghetto from surrounding towns  from Ginefcare  from Narefkar  from Bielovairsh and Karminitz.
It was so bad  we didn't want to leave th em  you know  but for one thing we couldn't stay anymore and then it was still not ghetto in the smaller towns.
When -- when the ghetto came into being  did you feel vindicated in any way?
Out of 170 only 65 went to the ghetto and we and we lived in horrible circumstances.
So we arrived to–.O h I should mention that now  shortly before our departure  ghetto uprising took place and we saw through our windows how Germans were systematically going from one building to anothe r dropping napalm bombs into the basement to be sure that entire building will catch flames .
What sort of a Jewish Community was this town  was it a large community?

You know  we worked  we didnt get anything over there  no more than you -- you eat a little  whatever they gave you in -- in the ghetto  you -- whatever your portion was and then when you went to the factory  they gave you a little bit of soup in the factory at that time  and then back home.
And then they found these Germans guards up in the little village  and that's the reason that led to how are troops getting in there.
What I did  I ca I I had anof another friend what he had suffered in ghetto and he I told him the story  he said oh  Im coming with you.
My husband wanted to work more effective and there was there was a lot of handicap in the meantime that they already wanted to bring in the children home in the ghetto.
I  uh  for some reason  I was only 14 years old at that time  and  for some reason  I did not felt I should move uh move to the back of the crowd  keep on going backwards  and hopefully because uh my father promised us he's going to rescue us from the ghetto and he's going to bring us back.
But uh in the ghetto of Radom uh where I still saw uh the uh uncles and aunts and uh both sets of grandparents until 1941 uh I was able to see them.

This one fellow who kept us at the beginning and who said to us  \ Don't go back to the ghetto  I have no gain for you going back to the ghetto.
And we were assigned a room in the ghetto with a family.
At the same time  while I was in that concentration camp  my beginning in that concentration camp  trucks were still arriving from  what was then ru mored in the camp  as those that were killed in the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto.

I remember one time the farmer came over to him after so many months and he said that there were some people actually telling the authorities that some of the farmers from that area are helping Jewish people in the ghetto and it's getting to be very dangerous for us and our families to continue to help you.

Well  it was the first days -- we were able  the first days  to go outside  because the ghetto wasnt established  and go out and trade with the farmers because the stores were already -- the stores were closed under the Russians  to close.
And as I said  once we were in the ghetto  we could not get out from the ghetto or get in to the ghetto.
Do you remember how you felt while this was going on with Jews  when you were going into the ghetto?
Because I thought I was always under still the impression that this is where Jews were forced to walk  on the -- in the ci -- in the ghetto  very few people si -- tried to stay -- to go out  in order to survive  because otherwise you didnt have what to eat.
As the Ghetto got smaller and smaller  were your parents talking about trying to run away?

I was in Budapest for the last 2 years living without papers  and uh the SS  the  the Nazis came into Budapest and uh I wanted by all means to be with my family because there was nowhere that I could hide anymore  and I was determined under  under any circumstances to reach my mother  my sister and uh  whatever would happen to them  I want ed to be with them  and we knew already that there will be a ghetto and that uh  I cannot uh  uh save myself anyway  and I didn't want to save myself to begin with  I wanted to be with my family.
Father and I had remained in Majowka  and Hania and Renia were sent to Strzelnica  and as I mentioned to you that due to the fact that Father was running that 49 employment office in the ghetto  he was put in ch arge because he was familiar with the work in Majowka  and Hania was assigned the same job in Strzelnica.

The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps when the order came that we had to move to the Jewish ghetto which was the shabby  remote part of our town  quite far away from where we had lived  because it was actually in you see.
In fact  one I remember l ike in the Warsaw Ghetto -- the Warsaw Ghetto was big.
So  the warm sweaters and the coats that we left with them because  once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto  we met with Polish people at work  and if we knew people who were willing to take a message to them  they have seen to it that something was sent to us  even in this slave labor camp in Starachowice  even after th e ghetto  you know.

They used to take then not even back to the ghetto.
Why dont you describe for me a little bit about more go on with what you were doing in the ghetto collecting these weapons  and then when I guess  when you escaped  or they took you to Novogrudek (Navahrudak  Belarus).
While going there to look for a place that we had to move into the ghetto  we walked into some of the abandoned houses that Jewish people leave before and the blood that we saw in the beds; beds unmade; cribs full with blood stains--in the cribs and that was right after the Germans came in.
21 to the ghetto  to  to pick up their things and to bring  I decided one day also to go to Kovno.

She knew that it's not a good idea to move where all the Jews are gathered because then they were very easily identifiable and sent into the ghetto  sent later on to the concentration camps.

So in the ghetto there was a synagogue that one day the Germans ordered... OK.
It means that she was selling the jewelry and bringing us food to -- to the ghetto  otherwise -- she was selling.
A. Daily life in Ghetto depending on wh at the Germans had in store for us.
After a while  we ended up in a town more or less in central Poland  called Kielce  and eventually ended up in the ghetto of Kielce  and so forth.
And you can imagine how they live in the ghetto when I've got a house with six rooms and I have to give up five rooms for people  and people bringing in their own people and they lay in the street and then they take our bed and change their clothes.
See  my father was -- it happened s -- I think was in Oct-October -- October 1992  we were at that time still in the ghetto  I remember we were operating our group and it came an order the same that all the Jews for the ghetto h-had to get certain -- certain -- certain warning to get ready ce-certain place  this was  I think be -- by the -- by the market in the center of the city  and be ready for transportation the same way as the last time.
And a lot of the orders prior to taking us to the ghetto were handed down to us by a town crier in the center of town  in the circle; the town crier with his drum and his little funny hat and his uniform with a very important air about him.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 28 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: and  and we sign.
It was a small town in Lithuania  not a big town.
You could see that like  for me  it was clear that the ghetto is being liquidated and it looks like nobody is going to be able to survive.
So was this before you had moved into the ghetto  before Yes.
I remember s eeing them over the  over in the ghetto.
And right after that they had the the big aktia   and then they they eliminated completely this small ghetto was completely  those few people who still were there were evacuated  were passed to the to the to the bigger ghetto  because it became more room available by by eliminating 10 000 people  it was too much room  you know  basically  based based on they on their standard.
So I grew up with Polish people in the ghetto  I lived with them together next door neighbors were Poles  my best friends were Poles  went to school with together.
JL: After liberation in Austria  there were--there were a hundred and fifty Lithuanian kids who wound up uh from the Kovno ghetto uh in--in Lansbury which is near Dakaw and taken from Dakaw to Auschwitz and subsequent- ly--matter of fact there are about 50 of us survived out of the hundred and fifty.
It was a small ghetto...was two ghettos in fact  a small ghetto where they had a little hospital and they put the old people in the hospital  and then there was a larger ghetto.
We are standing in front of her house in the ghetto and the slaughterhouse  you had to go through the ghetto  the gentiles  in order to reach the slaughter house.
And so from there  one fine night they circled the ghetto  raus  raus  raus  out  out  out.
This bridge I remember well  and that portion of wall  and the main gate to the ghetto  I remember very well because my school was like during the occupation  you know  the secondary schooling was forbidden for the Poles.
Ah yeah  because in the first place there was this big thing that no no Pole can get into the ghetto  theres gonna be a Big sign  you mean?
But as a person who lived in the ghetto from the very beginning to the very end  my assessment is that so it was hunger  so there was deportation  so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow  we knew what is happening.
It was the ghetto  which was an area that was totally enclosed.
And that became -- thats the ghetto that ends -- ends up being a weigh station to other places.
Before Yom Kippur  they let the old people out from that ghetto.
The guides were Jewish Partisans already that were in the underground and were already  so to say  ﬁfree people.ﬂ They took upon themselves the risk of being killed to go into the ghetto and to lead groups of Jews out of the ghetto.
I didnt know any person that did escape but like I mentioned before  we knew in 1942  early on  that the people -- they take out a few from the ghetto and they tell you like youre going to a shower and they give you soap and a towel.
So then my boyfriend located he r  and thats when I say Edgar is wrong  it wasnt yet opened the ghetto  he had to get me a false document  of another girl to -- so I can go to visit her into that house.
Very distinguished looking people there  and I recognize him because I found in cars before  I found money with his picture  so I knew this is Runkosky  he had his own money  you know  in the ghetto  they had their own money  and his picture was on the money.
It was already going around in the ghetto  so the Germans probably knew -- know there is part of th-the -- you know the -- theres a group.
They surrounded them with barbed wire  and had Jewish police with helpers staying there 30 at the gate  where you going in and going out from the ghetto  stayi ng there and helping the Germans who getting already there -- you sa y to German soldier and just stay the Jewish with young men  and all day long stand by the gate to help each other how to not to run in any troubles.
But then they were short in people to sent out for certain jobs outside of the ghetto and they didn't have enough could they send and they had to--to say that the men would of give me 60 men or a hundred men or 300 men and they were short  they'd grab whatever they could.
And he separate into thousand and thousand of people  and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean ghetto  back where they burned the hospital.
That they were meant for death because  you know  there were previous sel ections in the ghetto.
I don't think I know very much more about the specific ghetto experience.
A lot of people they want to send the children out of the ghetto.

No one could live on a hundred grams  but also this hundred grams of bread  the uh the inmates didn't...the the the individu al inmate didn't get because we had kept secret two thousand souls in the ghetto.
Well  you know the ghetto was ruled by the Judenr at  by the Jewish council  which was appointed by the Germans.
The apartment that your family was living in  it was outside the border of the ghetto?
For a long  we had heard nothing about it  and we got used to a new life  quote unquote  which we  we would start facing us  life of hunger  misery  the si-the sickness  and just torture  and um  as we were staying in ghetto  th e life  we were very accepted  we were get  got involved in a life of the ghetto  the ration of bread  we go to work every morning  and uh  we established ourselves as part of that particular time and place.
And you would spend your next three years in the Warsaw Ghetto.
And so they emptied a whole district  so they coul d take the -- from the other districts of the city and bring it to -- to the streets who -- which belonged to th -- to the ghetto already.
And at the time so  lets talk about now the escape from the ghetto and going to the Bielskis.
Then talk began that there would be a ghetto  that all the nationalities in Warsaw would be put into their own zones.
What do you recall of what happened when the Germans came in and being forced into the ghetto?

And she said  well maybe you -- maybe you would like to stay tha -- and she said no  because the parents are in ghetto.
So -- a-and you know  my encounter with this Sonderpoliceman was as we were the last day in the ghetto  as we were transported to Auschwitz  you know  before -- before being [indecipherable] to the -- you know  to the wagons  y-you know  that take us.
They didn't have their privacy or anything  but this is how it was in the ghetto.
And as he was leaving the ghetto  he was accosted by detectives.
Like  I guess  you can move in  bring in the ghetto    certain -- each person  a couple  what do you call it  pack?
In the same time  we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of the train and we went back to the ghetto.
And then wer -- then came the uprising in ghetto  and telephone from my sister that they are going to - with Tebbins [indecipherable] and that was the last time I heard from her.
I remember that he would be annoyed with people who pr esumed - like if he would discuss - in the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they would just eat the horse meat and people would say  horse  how could you eat horse  and he would say  lady  you haven't been through a fire  you don't know.
A. The life was always normal even life in ghetto was normal.
So as I mentioned to you  it came a day when edict came and all the Jews had to abandon their possessions  their apartments  their homes  and they were taken to the ghetto.
Ana I snuck back into the little ghetto so I stayed with my brothers.
And on the way from the town was we went into a hous e. That used to be a Jewish house  but the neighbor ours  a Pole  was living there  because he has to leave his house  and he got the Jewish house  the different  becaus e the ghetto was there.
And he took the money and he gave us bread  and some margarine  and he came back  and tomorrow  for tomorrow she went -- I -- I dont know  maybe I went together with her  and I 36 -- and we gave it to my brother w ho worked also outside the ghetto  and he used to bring it in the ghetto.
When I say in school I was...I was getting...taking lessons  even though somewhere around '41  I think in the summer of 1941  I started working somewhere in a...in one of those ghetto resorts.
With re verence and with   we take over the task to judge the Jews in the ghetto and we'll do it to the best of our understanding  to the best of our...taking into consideration the specific conditions in the ghetto that nothing was alright  and also their rulings...their rulings they took into finding any law book in the world  and I I... You know and you know Hebrew and you know Russian .
So  we moved and this apartment has been giv en to us by the Judenr at because they knew which homes were in the ghetto where you were permitted to live a nd  on the basis of how large the family was  they were so to say its like my father  who was running the department of supplying the labor force to the factories  there was a person who was in charge of allocating living quarters for people.
Then one day all of a sudden we are told that a changes are going to be made  a ghetto is going to be.

What happened was  every so ofte n in the ghetto  they were rounding up people to send them to concentration camps a nd he  they rounded him up on the street in the ghetto and he jumped out the window and he fell  he was going to run away and hide somewheres in the ghetto  and he fell  he broke his leg.
And when we arrived in the Warsaw ghetto  I don't remember exactly what happened  but once I was 17 storm troopers (German) 18 Swastika (German) 19 ethnic German (German) 23 laying on the floor  and I was in a hospital and they wash myself and they put me in a bed in the hospital.
Some people went through Lodz also  but in Lodz where I was born in Lodz  raised in Lodz  lived in ghetto Lodz.
For example  at th e same time ghetto had in Vilnius theater  there was a play called ”mogus Potilto.
One of the guys told us  the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated  dismantled now.
Then in 1942  they start to take so-called Aktion3 -- take people from the ghetto and make smaller ghetto.
I a little panic  keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some people maybe from a different ghetto or something  so I kept quiet and we went to the German's house  and we cleaned up the house and there were six girls and we were six girls...they had two Germans watching us and the brigadier  the Jewish fellow that went with us  so there was no way of us going out into the town and trade something for bread or milk or things like that  so what happened is that I ......how long does it take to clean up a house  as even if you're weak and don't eat all day and everything.
The front is coming closer and if you don't provoke the Germans to liqui date the ghetto he has a chance to save the Jews in the ghetto.
After two years in the ghetto You stayed for two years.
AR: I think what happened to--the S.S. I think took over the administration of the uh --of the ghetto.
So therefore  I am saying  if there was a -- if there was a Warsaw uprising in ghetto  they were our troops fighting for Warsaw ghetto.
I will give him a blow  and I will jump to ghetto.
Well  maybe not  maybe I had it  because we had to go in in the ghetto back again  back and forth.
But the big problem was after a few weeks  maybe  they decided to move back to their old neighborhood  the Jewish 8 neighborhood  where there were lots of vacant apartments since the Jews had been taken away.
And it is in this 18 ghetto while Herschel Lipszyc took Aron on slave labor to remodel a house for the Gestapo that Aron befriended a Pole.
The things that I remember is even when we were running out from the second hiding place  crawling over bodies  the things that stand out in my mind is that we crossed the river  which was one of the boundaries of the ghetto  after crawling over bodies and hiding in the shadows and uh encountering two men with rifles  and my mother had some valuables on her and she said look  I I can make you rich.
Q. Before we get do that  I want to hear a little bit more about the Ghetto.
No  I did get there  but this letter and the request for work was only for me to be able to travel  because otherwise I couldnt get out  being Jewish  I couldnt get out of the ghetto.
And when we broke off before  we were talking about 1941 1942 in Kaunas   you had heard of you had s heard of neighbors of your grandmothers who were Jews  who were brought to Vilijampole Slobodka   to what became the ghetto.
I was supposed to go visit a friend who lived next to the ghetto wall.
I believe  that was the first 6 we knew wherever we were going to be taken to  it was not going to be freedom  and it was not going to be a great relocation.
We had no papers  we could not get a job  we could not get a place to live  we really couldn't go out and stay on the other side of the ghetto.
I was bent over on all fours practically  carrying the big sack of coal back to the ghetto.
Did you have any other close relatives as you were growing up  with you?
Some of them were brought to our camp  to our ghetto in the in the place of of our people who were executed.
But really didn't work out exactly they way we want put up a resistance in the ghetto.
It started almost like a play in the very beginning when we were in the ghetto  it was still summer  and we said  we got together  had nothing to do  all we talked about is hunger  we said  well  let's try and dig a tunnel.
This was in January 42 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I had a mastoid  a middle ear infection  and they had to smuggle me out from the ghetto so she had to go with me with my younger sister to the hos pital.
more -- I worked until the fall  when th e man who managed this dining hall told me that he was designated to become a member of a council of elders in charge of supply and feeding and economy  in a ghetto to be created to hold all the Jews from the Czech lands.
>> Bill Benson: And you and your sisters were not in the same schools.
Was there a second time when they were going to be put into the ghetto?
She was in the hospital and we didn't have enough medication to help her  and she died in the ghetto.
But going back to the little ghetto  finally the...the Jews got smart and says  \ We're going to try to defend ourselves.
As people were being reduced or eliminated in your ghetto  first of all  did you know some of the people and when did it start to encroach on the people that you knew  your neighbors  the...?
Then we worked in there to clean up the ghetto and whatever usable items w-we found  we shipped it to Germany to be reused.
Who had carried the information  I dont know  but it was common in the ghetto to trade information  to talk to the administration about anything or to denounce people  to no particular gain other than maybe you got a little reward for it  but just to carry gossip.
But half the people  they right away killed them in the [indecipherable] not in the city  not in the ghetto  they took them outside  and they kille d them a-away from the ghetto.
We had there three women  and those were Jews from the villages when they had to go to the ghetto  they never came to the ghetto  and they were in the woods.
There were no reliefs in th e ghetto  but still there were some -- the for -- the year 42 was a little bit better than 41  and ther e were not so many aktions  not so great aktions  and we managed even to orga nize an orchestra  and -- What do you mean we managed?
You know  there was a cemetery just a - just outside but it was still in the ghetto.
So in the beginning  when we were in ghetto  we have to go.
In the beginning there were books  in the beginning there was a hospital that had been established on ghetto grounds.
First of all  my father was heart broken when he had to take the patients from the contagious disease hospital and bring them to the ghetto.
See  I can understand German a little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish.
They run away and they pass  and we have to go  they send us back to Warsaw to the ghetto.
I was petrified  and I didn't give away the hiding place  the hiding entrance  I marched back into the ghetto  or he threw me back into the ghetto and that was the end of that.
They never were able to  to get out or to escape it  and we know from letters we have gotten and from facts that my grandparents were deported to Lodz ghetto in Poland in 1942.
The ghetto by that time was sealed was closed with barbed wires.
>>Bill Benson: So there you were actually in another ghetto in Glebokie.
So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.
The actual numbers I dont know  but the ghetto at any one time had roughly 160 000 people.
So the Russians had moved into your apartment then . . .
There was Zionist group -- like I say the Zionist group there were -- there was Shamir -- atsa -- Holatsim and -- and -- and -- and the Istad  there is a lot ou -- ou -- a lot of groups from the Zionists and then there were the Bund.
Next to the ghetto there was a carousel because at that time it was Passover  1943  and at that time it was also the Christian Easter holiday.
Yes  ghetto money  which was worthless anyway  so it was sort of -- what could you get for it?
The directorship of the ghetto was almost hundred percent Zionist  because that was Jankov Edelsteins work  because he -- he believed in that  I think.
My brothers and I we went to Krakow  because we were going to move from this small town to Krakow.
The Kripo was the place in the chancellory of the nicest church in the neighborhood and this church fell into the neighborhood 15 of the Ghetto.
End of Tape #1 15 Tape #2 Now  let's go back and talk about you as a boy in the ghetto.
They were also prisoners like but it was families   not like we lived in the ghetto.
but you ended up being in the ghetto - Well  it wasn't open yet on that day.
One of the leaders from the ghetto -- I don't know  you probably heard the name before.
And my two brothers and my father  we didnt know for sure  but then we met a gentleman that was in the ghetto  a neighbor  and he was behind them in line  and he told us that they went the wrong way  so there was no way we could find anybody any more.
While you were in the ghetto  what did you know about what was happening in other parts of Poland?
This was death if the German catch us  but it was some people in ghetto that hided in a basement  a short wave radio  and they would listen to London  and  at that particular time apparently  it was already known what Auschwitz is all about  and what the Germans are doing in Auschwitz.
They used to take out groups to work outside the Ghetto so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed  the Germans did not especially check those who went 19 out  they only checked those who came back  so we used to go and beg for food.
Those items were on the Black Market  but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some middle man in the Ghetto.
We were talking about the children being Where where where where in the ghetto  at the childrens aktion   it was specially devised to get out all of the children from the ghetto.
Yes  me and my husband and we went  a Polish policeman was standing there we said we would give you money  open the wooden was closed  the ghetto.

You know that white stuff what I don't know it doesn't make you smell bodies or uh they say it was uh you know in there ghetto there was probably there was a pit from that.
It wasn't really let's all survive  at that point and again I think because of Wallenberg...the ghetto was undermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute  but I think because of Wallenberg we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids and a lot of fighting  but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that liberation couldn't be too far off.

They just made our community smaller and smaller and they put us in a Ghetto.
Before we went in a ghetto  before the Germans came  my father went back to Czechoslovakia.
Do you remember what happened when the Germans came  can you describe that to me?
End of Tape Five 82 Beginning Tape Six You were talking about there were 10 000 Jews in the ghetto  or -- 12.
And at th at time  my father had Czech papers  so he was fairly safe  and we were able to get once the ghetto was being liquidated  we were able to cross over to Czechoslovakia .

I never escaped another deportation  Lodz or otherwise  you know  it -- but when they liquidated the ghetto it was automatically -- but where I was -- you see  I -- I dont know  in my life I always seem to have been luck y.

Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: A panel called the atrocities total read  reads \ From August 1941 until December 31  1942 there disappeared from the ghetto in the back the abyss through various methods 13 421 Jews.
I knew  for example  in 1942  Father talked to the Germans and explained to them th at ghetto has no way to heat the buildings and he asked for permission to send Jewish workers in faraway woods to cut the timber and bring it in ghetto  and finally je -- Germans agreed.
So he was one of the 70 000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of 43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto.
Talk about that at that point in your life  you -- you had talked about losing your confidence in the ghetto  you were questioning your faith.
I think that when you strip a human being of his dignity slowly  he is not the same person  a nd I think that in a certain way  what the Germans were doing  by putting us into an open ghetto  by taking away some of our rights slowly  it was a conditioning that permitted us to  it made us  that made us uh.
sol sort of a recap  your day in the ghetto in the beginning was yours and your fathers  you would go to your respective works.
That was in the end of 1942  we were told to move--people had to leave their place of wherever they were living  there was a special area assigned for the ghetto.
The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of Siaulai.
While we were there  they announced they're going to form a ghetto in the city of Lodz.
Do you think he remembers a good deal about the ghetto?
But the  it was still in the ghetto but it was not to the  he took us back to the ghetto but no t in the railway station.
Yes  from the ghetto  we were all women out of the Lodz Ghetto.
They just -- I am -- they just came into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons  they ordered a gehsperren  which means  you know  a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take all elderly people  they would take children  and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide in the apartment  they would be shot.
>> Bill Benson: And you were able to go and place that.
The clothes you were wearing were the clothes that you brought from home originally?
On the third floor of this restored building -- at that point  the Germans were methodically blowing up and putting fi res to every single building in the ghetto.
The ghetto  like I said  was quite a large area and they had like a central prison  the Jews.
They took everything they could and load it up on those uh carriages and wagons  and it's on backs; and they stormed into the ghetto.
We wrote letters to each other into the ghetto to my uncle  Isaac Levenstein   who was my mother's brother.
I also rememb er that there was a Jewish ghetto just where Jews lived.
Within days your city of Lwow was occupied by the Nazis and your family was forced into a ghetto.
The war was around the ghetto and we had we had to move to the ghetto.
We know we saw there was something wrong because the army that was guarding the ghetto changed completely.
from the hiding places to shrink th e ghetto and take them all at once}.
We found out that the ghetto was going to be closed down for the day.
The Germans needed people  and it was like groups that they took them outside of the Ghetto to do some labor.
So then you get to the ghetto -- Lodz -- the Lodz ghetto  and lets talk like again a little bit more specifically about that  where -- where you lived.
Well  after we got out of the ghetto -- How did you get out?
Another of the jobs was to put the posters on the walls at night to raise the ghetto to arms  that type of thing.
The ghetto was completely self-governed  but again  just like in Lustig's case  they were complete puppets of the SS And so I applied to get into the nursing phase of the ghetto  and I was lucky.
Uh I remember quite a number of people who would...wanted to get out of the ghetto  wanted to escape.
In order to to to make it more more visible for you  we had in the ghetto vegetable gardens  free  open space so we built the potatoes so that in the harvest  we worked potatoes  but the people were starving so they couldn't wait until the potatoes would be ripe so they we re...they all jumped on the on the vegetable uh gardens and they took all the unripe potatoes and they ate them.
And yet in this inferno  immediately the Jewish people organized themselves i n self aid centers.
That one family was in the Soviet Union at that time before the war broke out  so they were saved from the agony of the ghetto and so on.
In your testimony you talk and give many instances  I think of your mother saying  this was when you were in the ghetto  dont go out after we get back from work because . . .
So the ghetto was formed -- so up to that point you managed to avoid having to go to any camps?
People  Polish people gathered on the roofs on their houses which were surrounding the ghetto.

My grandmother lived w ith is in Warsaw and during the time  wartime  she didnt get any letter from her daughter in Lodz ghetto.
He was in the ghetto  and he became the...the head of this...uh...group of repatriation .
You could walk out  yes  because between shooting and killing so many people there was no more ghetto.
Of course  wh--it was not comfortable but manageable according to the ghetto standard.
It took two hours every time to  to  it was a long  long row of vehicles going to the ghetto and the I came there.
Look  when we went into the war  and into the ghetto  the structure of society was not dissimilar in th-the structur e of my family.
And my uncle was taken into the Paszow and he left in in the ghetto his wife and two children to be hidden  for the children were not legal.
>> Bill Benson: When the rest of the family was then forced to go into the ghetto  you described to me that that day is one of your grimmest memories.
I went with my father to an assembly point in the ghetto itself.
I took one or two or three with me in the pocket  and this is why I could submit it uh present it to the to the fellow who called him   a Lithuani an mayor who was nominated by the Nazis as mayor of Kovno and when he was brou ght to trial and he said I laughed so about Jews  and he...what they talking about...so I presented to the uh to the Federal Court 11judge this publication  expulsion...uh uh all the number one from the 10th of July  1941  saying that the Jews must leave Kovno  old and young  men and women  Lithuanian citizens or Lithuanian citizens  whatever Jew  must go to the ghetto  signed by and by the the Lithuanian commandant of Kovno.
I remember that  that you know  you had to -- you couldnt -- you still free to move outside the ghetto and deal and trade with the farmers if you had a little money and all that and so you couldnt work already  a Jew  you had before  the arm band.
We had to prepare to go to the ghetto  the Srodula [ Ger: Schrodula] and I remember that our  that they were attacking people on the streets  young ladies  and they told them to dig graves.
When I went out  the Polish youngsters used to say    a Jew runs away from the ghetto.

He told my grandfather that the political prisoners were let out to make room for more Jews because the Nazis were going to burn the ghetto soon.
So we had no way to stay in the house  but in the morning I heard that the Germans came in and shot my father  because my father still was in the ghetto  he was one of the last left ones.
So they opened the gate  and they did let me -- I was the last one to cross the gate from one ghetto to the other.
And that was the situation with my father  too  when they went to Czechoslovakia.
Take this to the police and we had a car to take and we called  and we use to write all the people in the ghetto  their names and all kinds of things like that.
Were the borders already de fined of what the ghetto was?
And next day I went to the ghetto  and this brother  he was waiting around.
They found out that some people still live in the ghetto.
So it is -- but in doing the ghetto  and in the -- during the life on it  was a different story.
So  did you talk about the plight of the Jews in Europe?
We talked and we a when I arrived in Auschwitz the first day  on the ghetto  we were outdoor on the ghettos.
Before I left the ghetto -- it was before the action -- and I remember my father got a coat for my mother.
and then he became the Altest e of the ghetto  but I didnt -- And that was it. --
Now you're going to the que-next question was-- It was about a time when you were hiding a nd you knew you were going to--tell me what was happening--- Now  you see  this happened in 1943 when they were liquidated the ghetto.
And so the cont -- the ghetto -- here he is -- and then  other people went to Auschwitz.
So  he gave me the address  what I marked down on my body  on differe nt parts of my body  I didn't want in case I'm caught to give out Tadek  and we walked back to the ghetto.
They closed the ghetto and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans  there were no more beatings  there were no mo re shootings.
Then before they came in  I mean came back to the ghetto   to the camp  I used to smuggle in and went to the ghetto with them.
The city was [talkover] But for Jews there were no discrimination during [talkover] For  for Jews  we already  until  that was October 11 th  we were already ta ken to the ghetto.
And I -- and she was  after such a hard operati on and I was told by women prisoners who came out  and I met them in the ghetto  that my mo ther was very proud  and she would -- she was singing.
Because some of them surv ived the massacre in the pits  so they came  wounded  they came back to the ghetto and they were in the hospital.
And they were changing -- you know  we didnt know which is the ghetto.
>> Nesse Godin: I want to tell you  I want to share with you one day in the ghetto of Siauliai  Lithuania.
You know  as a kid I did not -- I di d not -- not -- I did not question  but I knew she was -- she had all kind of -- but she was very intelligent and very well read and so I used to meet her a lot during and in the ghetto actua lly  when they took us in and down to this enclosure  I went up to her and I said  ﬁRun with me.ﬂ She said  ﬁNo  Im not leaving my mother.ﬂ What was her name?
So he had gotten some Nazi uniforms  got a Nazi truck -- well  command car.
If you can remember mo re incidences of the first two months  what you were doing before you moved to the ghetto   I think that would be very helpful.
Was there any guarding  or any police service inside the ghetto?
And this was the Warsaw ghetto memorial  of course  which we visited.
And after some adventures I did reach Stockholm and that was just at the time of the upr ising in the Warsaw ghetto.
Except the head of the ghetto threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my mother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me.
The big ghetto that was connected with the small one through a little bridge called Chlodna  they had other factories like in one they were making brushes  combs  other things probably also for the army's supplies.
Uh  one of the things  if I may just say something  the way they liquidated  the Germans  the way they liquidated the ghetto is by telling people  \ Take your belongings  take your tools if you're a  if you're a  a  a professional  whatever you are  a carpenter  or whatever  and we  what we doing  we're relocating you  this was the German strategy away from ghetto  at least in Lodz  and I know this from a fact from a lot of people that been in ghetto  and this is what they tell them  that they relocate them  due to the war  the Russians coming in or whatever.
From the ghetto  when they start to c (301) everybody  they used to be Judenrein.
I mean  it wasnt somebody who would particularly strike you in a crowd  not in a ghetto.
And the hunge r in the ghetto was so great  was so bad  those people were laying on the streets and dying  little children went around begging  and  uh  everyday you walked out in the morning  you see somebody is laying dead  covered with newspapers or with any kind of blanket they found  and you found those people used to carry the death people in little wagons  used to bring them down to the cemetery and bury them in 5 5mass graves.

By being in Slonim and being in the ghetto and surviving two kinds of massacre and surviving practically sole survivors in a ghetto of thousands  of close to 20 000 people.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 >> Bill Benson: How did you survive?
But when the Germans came into the ghetto  the first thing they did  they went to the hospital.
If you work as a militiaman  you can keep your family a little longer in the ghetto.
What was that time like when you were under the Russians until June of 1941?
Interview with Felix Nicinski March 6  2007 30 And did you see a lot of children in the ghetto?
Before I left him  my father told me news was spreading that theyre going to liquidate the ghetto.
You see  when the war -- on a Sunday morning  the Germans were commencing to drop two bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.
Do you -- were you aware of efforts to sabotage work in the factories  or for people to try to get out of the ghetto  any kind of resistance?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 7 >> Marcel Hodak: Well  my father had a decision to make.
Leave family and ghetto behind  a place to fight and hide.
When I was in ghetto  sick in the hospital  that I will tell you later  one of the woman who escaped between th e dead bodies came to the ghetto and in the beginning when she was just a little lucid  she described what happened to her  so we knew for a fact that it was happening.
Actually  he was taken away before the second ghetto was uh liquidated.
And  I then got closer and closer to her because I used to come and say how are you doing  and eventually I used to meet her in Ghetto and eventually decided to marry her.
DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 19 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: there.
So  this is  and then when I was in the  in the hospital at that time  it wasnt a hospital  it was the  the  the Pen Club  a tremendous apartment there and they made it a hospital in the ghetto.
And I think that is maybe be one of the reasons that Kovno ghetto survived longer than other ghettos.
Now  in the ghetto there were places where food was available.
Did let me ask you a couple other questions about the ghetto.
What was it -- can you describe in the beginning the ghetto  what -- what your living conditions were like  who were you living with  how much room did you have?
What was your attitude about this committee and about the Jewish police also?
How can...but meanwhile they organized...they took out five intellectuals they needed intelectuals to drive them from ghetto  scholars  teachers they needed them for a special job to go in Latvia.
We were afraid the policemen just to take us  so on  take us out of the ghetto.
Back to the ghetto and back to the room where we were in barracks over there.
But it was exactly  I mean the part of the ghetto  that whole area -- and the lack of any remembering  any effort made to remember that 20 000 people had lived here who had died.
The gate of the small ghetto was the end of one street.
I have to take you to the ghetto  and then Ill commit suicide.ﬂ And well  I think we did talk somewhat  but not much  only maybe in writing.
And eventually  after months  when the relocation of the women  in August 44 -- no  42  occurred  th-the relocation to Birkenau  it was still cow -- chaotic  but people were already used to it.
We had to le ave our homes  everythi ng we had there  only what we could carry that was very little  find a place and move into the ghetto.
Because later they bring these people from Warsaw ghetto to the concentin cap.
The only who -- from the whole family who survived  and my grandparents lost al l their children except this aunt  and with my grandparents  I went with them to the ghetto.
When we are talking in the beginning of the ghetto  we feel that we are together in one bad position  and we didn't know what we knew afterwards.
Okay  my husband was working also in in in the ghetto.
She said to me -- I come to work in th e fields and the one that I told you was in charge of me  says to me  ﬁToday youll work later.ﬂ I said  ﬁHow can I work later  how can I get to the ghetto later?
So each one of the Germans -- they didnt come in in the ghetto.
The people once bombardment started  outside the ghetto was a little field we all would go in there.
So when there was a ghetto– Ghetto was already open and second arrest by Gestapo was I was across the border to ghetto many times because we buy some small part of the machinery what we own and before the war all the supply was in the ghetto area and we was forced buy something because we cannot work with this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto.
And he was in the ghe tto and he was never deported out of the ghetto.
And I left in the afternoon; and on the way to the ghetto toward me was coming a Polish man.
Had you heard  in the ghetto  had you heard about what the camps were like?
I remember an incident -- and these things come to mind as you -- as you sp eak  is that my brothers  Moshe George  grandmother was with us at that time  and we we re crossing a bridge on Peltewna Street into the ghetto  and what they were doing is they were picking out old people  or frail people and wouldnt even let them into the ghetto  they just took them out a nd -- took them away and shot them.
And we went through the place she used to live before the -- before the ghetto.
After Rosh Hashanah in 1941  the schools were closed  and western Jews were brought into the ghetto.
RG-50.030*0580 16 So  do you remember any any contacts with your peers there  other people your age in the ghetto  or or you were spending most of the time with the family?
And when it was  uh when I flew from the ghetto they  they begin  the ghetto began to be a concentration camp.
Some were -- but I were -- like I told you that my sister went to a family and she want to pick up someth ing to eat  and a son [indecipherable] went out through the other door and bring the Gestapo and she was arrested.
We went to the ghetto and took it to Czestochowa  and we got into the ghetto in Czestochowa.
Then when you're in the ghetto  you realize you no longer are in familiar places.
I have to tell you there is a very interesting story about the man in charge of the Vilno ghetto.
I see in front of me some times  I I wander around the ghetto of the street  I come back all mixed up  Id wa Im afraid Im gonna hit somebody.
I happened to live in a ghetto because th ats where I lived when they established the ghetto.
His studio was outside of the ghetto and uh it was known that uh who he was and what he was.
Iasi was an open ghetto  which means Jews were able to move around within the perimete r of the area.
They came in into the ghetto with Fritz which was one of the Wehrmacht  regular soldiers that worked in the Verpflegungsamt and he waited for them.
Now when was the ghetto set up  do you remember how the ghetto came?
Me  16 years old  sta nding there surrounded with some women from my home town but alone  all alone  very different than this nine people in the ghetto room surrounded with electric wires  guards going around and around  you are scared  people are whispering from one side and another what's happening there.
How long did you and your family stay in the ghetto?
I was the only one that could leave the the ghetto to get food.
And this is where my -- when my mother was wa lking with me  and showing me the doors of the -- of houses which used to belong to Jewish people who were killed in Zhmerinka  because they didnt belong to Zhmerinka.
And I mean they were right there  we were surrounded by our neighbors before we went into the ghetto and I-I mean especially in the very beginning  the Germans when they first came in  they had lists with names whom to take.
So she said  like for example about Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 173 said theyre going perp she they they give the date  exactly date what they come and kill the Jews from the gi left the Jews in the ghetto  for example.
Do you have any memory of how you escaped from the ghetto?
It was outside  it was in the old ghetto  but outside the little ghetto.
So when we -- when the ghetto became a dead end and my mother  after she came back from being in hiding -- after the Germans caught her on the way back -- th ey beat her up  they told her to dig her grave  and because a German patrol brought out other woman -- I think I have described that part -- a-another woman and that woman was shot  the -- the -- the -- the SS man let her go and she came ba -- she came back to the ghetto  I saw -- I went ba -- I was abl -- I was working outside the ghetto  so I skipped my -- from my -- from my job -- from my pa -- from whatever we were doing.
In the ghetto  in the apartment where we were  there was several families.
Do you remember the day you left your house and went into the ghetto?
A. So  now Lodz started developing and developi ng and setting in motion the Ghetto  in '41.
Describe  if you would  what happened -- there was a night that you went into hiding in the ghetto and you mentioned it in the first interview.
His aunt and sh -- and so we -- in the ghetto  she had a -- her ow -- flat in the ghetto.
There there's no criminal activities whatsoever  and my first reaction  my brother's and I when they asked for volunteers  we wanted very much to volunteer for that too  because it meant have a uniform  have a little bit larger rations of food  not to have to go to work in the city  be inside the ghetto and all that  but my father  God bless him  was very much against it.
My mothers name was Royter  but very possible -- in ghetto she was by the name Dukorvitch  which is her maiden name.
We were in ghetto Lodz and then I was in the Ravensbruck and in Zh-Hna.
EL: Yes  when you watch my pictures I did in the ghetto  so around all the houses there were fences.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 >> George Pick: Right.
And that was going on...the ghetto was...each time you marched in at night.
And eventually  six weeks later  we were assigned to various rooms througho ut the ghetto on both sides of the bridges.
02:10:28 You mentioned sabotage  was there sabotage in these factories in the Lodz ghetto?
Well  when we left Poland  I mean ghetto Lodz  a nd went through to go there  there were people working in the fields  and there was a woman there.
Because I was in a in a camp when when the war started and the Germans took over.
Or maybe they pulled it out of the Ghetto  and she saw the flames  but it was in her presence she saw that.
Was everyone who lived in the house with you in the ghetto  related to you in some way or were there people who werent related?
But I would like to go back to a few scenes in the ghetto that I omitted.
Only in later when I was when the German commanders discovered that there was an artist in the ghetto and they  they built me a studio so I could paint for them yes.
In April of 1942  a reign of terror started in the Warsaw Ghetto.
What did you know about what was going on in Germany and Poland before you went into the ghetto in 1943?
The next day we come back  half of the ghetto was taken out and killed.
The Lodz ghetto pa per resort is what it was  so it wasnt a comb fa ctory  it was a paper resort.
Everytime a German pickup like this came into the Ghetto  everybody ran because you never know when they're going to catch up  but I was a little from far I could recognize these were airmen.

The   they were named after Mr. who was the absolute tyrant in the Ghetto.

When  when my mother had told me that  when she fin--finally made me come down the h ill  and we made it over the fence  the uh  there was a street uh in the city  and Polish people were walking back and forth  and it's as if they didn't see us  that we were escaping from the ghetto.
But many of those who belonged to the council  and then the council instituted a ghetto police.
In Lobartov  they're supposed to make a huge ghetto for all the Jewish in the area  which did never materialize.
If we remained in the ghetto  we knew what would happen to us.
well  she when they attacked the the ghetto already  the last thousand people  because they packed the [indecipherable]   they they packed the [indecipherable] and went to Germany   and they all they are surrounded with the ghetto  and they they surrounded the ghetto and no-nobody could escape  nobody  because the wall that was around the ghetto  and nobody could escape  and they all was killed.
You were telling me also earlier that there were young men when you were you know  when you were still in the ghetto in Mlynov   who went to the Judenrat  and instead of giving the gold to the Germans  the young men were saying  give it to us so that we can get weapons.
When they made the little ghetto  that was where the Jewish quarter used to be before the war.
So  as long as that regime in the ghetto administration--the German regime remained as is  you felt safe.
What was your sense of things  was it a -- a fa irly large Jewish community for the size of the town?
Because the trains come in constantly  and there were people not from our ghetto alone and everything got mixed up.
So 1941  the socalled ghetto was established by the Iron Guard.
Friday morning on November 14 th there was a knock on the door and a neighbor came to tell her that they are killing all the Jews in the ghetto  a nd the woman became frightened and would not keep us as much we begged her.

They were trying to hide and wherever they hid  they obviously were not dressed properly.
We didn't want to stay in the ghetto -- do you know you had to stay in the ghetto even if you didn't want to.

He was sent to the Lodz ghetto  the Litzmannstadt  and then from there to Czestochowa and he walked over to him.
But she was also one of the few...Isaac Zuckerman and Miriam were one of the few Jewish 21 people that were able to...to get out of the Warsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive.
Is there anything else that you reme mber that was striking about the ghetto?
When they had the ghetto  they clean up the ghetto  they ask all the people who had a trade  go to the right  and all the other people  my father and mother with the other children to the left.
The rest of us remained un til the last minute until the liquidation of the ghetto.
I want to ask you a few more questions about the Ghetto.
They brought them in the ghetto and give it to the Jewish people  and here's.
And his son was later in the ghetto in Warsaw and my aunt was sending him Packages.
And what I didn't know about th e girl  evidently she was outside the ghetto without papers  hiding.
And you fiance  Henick   he told me that you have to come back to the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: Leon  hunger was so ever present  and you told me that sometimes people would be able to get a prescription from a doctor within the ghetto for potato peels.
This was a camp that was taken away  a working for a summer camp or some sort of thing.
What do yo u mean  we're gonna to leave the ghetto?\
Well  I should add that I made myself as presentable as I could  you know  after that existence in the ghetto  you know.
Before the insurrection  before the ghetto up-uprising  we already knew  but Okay.
To tell you the...the...that deaths...how many deaths I saw in the...in the...in the ghetto in my eyes killed  how they teared out children from the mother's hand and they throwed to the German shepherds  how the... This was in the gh etto before... before we went over to .
It was the \ small ghetto\  what they call where people were laying on the ground  dead  covered up with newspapers; where there was absolutely no food.
And whoever survived the ghetto is a testimony that Vilnius was very well run as far as the feeding  the hospital.
I knew that with my family I had to move from this place after certain couple of months because the Germans were making the ghetto much smaller.
Do you remember the move  when the orphanage had to move into the ghetto; do you remember that?
But then  this was already 1942  and I found a -- i-i -- in -- in -- in June  I found out that they liquidate -- liquidating the Warsaw ghetto.
They built a huge wooden wall ar ound the ghetto and  according to the rumors  they would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or  but they would not let the Jews survive if the siege had lasted another week or so.
It was a small place in a small--there might have beenI don't know how many Jews  not too many.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 32 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Partisans  underground.
This is now late June of 1942...I have to take some water...(pause)...announcements posted on all the buildings in Polish and in German and in Yiddish I believe  basically saying that the ghetto is being being evacuated  being moved or the inhabitants are being moved to a big farm in Ukraine.
After the ghetto uprising  what was your function within the AK army  the underground army?
And he -- it was very dangerous I remember  until I saw him again co ming from work  from out the ghetto  knowing that he is carrying something.
After two weeks concentration camp in Stutthof  again  they came  they counted 500 women at that time  just marched in front of the ghetto.
With that  th e resistance collapsed and whoever could  run out of the ghetto through the underground tunnels  the wa ter  the sewers and they disappeared.
I remember that he would be annoyed with pe ople who presumed -- like if he would discuss -- in the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they would just eat the horse meat and pe ople would say  horse  how could you eat horse  and he would say  lady  you havent been throug h a fire  you dont know.
Most people were working in cleaning up the remainder of the la rge ghetto.
In the ghetto  in most of the cases yes  except when this Gorajetski was -- was in.
They shall leave open the houses  the doors  the the shutters  everything  and finally uh there were several...uh and where there is a sick man  they should put in writing  they shoul d put in writing that there is a sick man that is immovable  that cannot be transporte d  and of course all those who were left and 51killed...they killed them and at six o'clock in the morning  there was thirty thousand went with in their hands  to...from various pa rts of the ghetto to this square and I it as the funeral of the victims themselves.
And -- and it was in ghetto  at -- you know  and we wanted to go out.
How hard was it to get from the ghetto outside the ghetto?
So  that was very helpful because those people those Jews were brought from large Lo dz or from Plotsk or from the other places  in the beginning to our ghetto  they had nobody to assist them.
Because subsequently - I dont mean right now at the outbreak of the war - but subsequently  not only would the Jews start working as a force  labor force  in the factory  while there was still a ghetto  but once the ghetto was liquidated  there was a labor camp set up just to supply workers to the factory and  since there were always typhus and there were shootings and killings and Jews were just disposed of here and there  there was forever a new shipment arriving of workers.
Do you remember what life was like  were not talking about a ghetto here but the neighborhood you moved to  was it guarded by the Nazis?
>> Bill Benson: What was the food conditions like for you?
In the fall of 1942 Marcel and his family were forced into the Drohobycz ghetto.
We went to the city of Lodz  moved in with my aunt.
I with the children left the children home in a certain time and sit in the middle of in the middle of November or late November because the tendency began to be that this there was the paper that all child...children home must be in the ghetto uh 24th December.
>> Nat Shaffir: One thing important to remember  the ghetto had a b ig black market area.
And there were other plans to kill actually mass killings of 70 000 Jews who were at that time in this ghetto conditions.
With a stick in his hand he used to walk  and at at will  at random he used to kill  shoot at the Jews who were in ghetto  in .
Then we wanted to know...certain family when they started to write  they wanted to know about their members...there we re certain families that part of them were in the Vilna ghetto and part of them were in the Kovno ghetto.
And they were coming to the ghetto and they were saying  ﬁThere is no camp.
Furniture you couldn't take out there  but the Jewish people used to live in the Ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: In 1943  when they liquidated the ghetto  you were sent to several concentration camps  Kaiswerwald  then to a place called Mitiom.
Every day he was going from the ghetto to the  to the mail box  and that time that day he forgot the way.
And there were rumors that this ghetto is not goi ng to exist any more because it was practically one of the last ghettos that the Germans kept.
Denawerdkee was a crazy government place ru n by the organization and they were building there and we work ed also very hard there  but in comparison to or comparison to ghetto  we were in paradise because first of all  we had hot water to wash  the food was much better and we had better condition... better...even we worked very hard...early in the morning we had to line up and they were again counting us and also there we used to unload those big chunks of coal  we us ed to haul in the potatoes  and we us ed to work very hard but it was much better for us there.
And some came from the wa -- survivors from Warsaw ghetto.
He -- If he tried to escape  he probably was caught by the Germans  by the Gestapo.
Well  as I said  particularly the view of the Warsaw ghetto and the br -- the role of that.
That reminds me  did you speak German when you were growing up?
And in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 55 ghetto he used to lay the tefillin  which they something yo u put on your head  and you wrap your arm  and he was extremely handsome.
Then the Police Department  the Sanitation Department  and you mention  and after the Operation Intellectuals  3 or 4 Germans came to the ghetto and we were ordered to deliver everything or value.
And they returned when the Germans were there  they returned li ttle by little back to their homes  because they couldn't go through  and then they we nt through the whole ghetto  and -- Let me -- did you ever hear Hitler on the radi o?
We couldnt really care what happened anywhere else  it was and at least Had you heard about  in 1943  the Warsaw ghetto uprising?
So  this picture was taken before the war  before the Ghetto.
I say we are resistance  and they say this by resistance we define the people in the forests of Vilna  or the people who  in the Warsaw uprising  and I certainly agree that they were resistance  and I would define it by saying they were resistance of desperation  because if you are in their situation in the Warsaw ghetto  if you are in their situation hiding in the forests and trying to to do damage to the enemy  y-yyou you ar this is a a desperation move.
Sound 9  sound only) I don't know what AT: This is explanations to the plan of the ghetto.
Could you describe [indecipherable] I mean  they came they came they they first they said that we have to go into the ghetto  which that was 1944  oh around February.
And why was there all of a sudden this emphasis on having the ghetto beautiful and representative?
His name was Kwint 19  and the minute they started coming into the ghetto  he asked them  ﬁWhere are you taking my Jews?ﬂ So  he wa s killed right there by the entrance.
And then again was Aktion in the ghetto  and ghetto was smaller and smaller.
And they know  they -- you know  they knew -- you know  Im Jew -- a Jew -- I probably know -- I was in the ghetto  probably if I know who was a policeman  who was this -- who was -- who was a collaborator.
Was the and so  what about We talk about  you know  the big deportations.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about that  you and your brother were possibly and probably the only Jews left in the town.
Okay  when you were deported to th e ghetto  okay  you said something about your brother being taken away for work.
May eighth May eighth  or maybe May six  my father through the sewers escaped from the ghetto.
So Sonder Commando in Ghetto  if we call them  this what they done.
Uh...That fall they moved us...they started to move us from the open ghetto to a ghetto that was being established out on the outskirts of Sosnowiec in Bdzin.
But you go with Mama first  and then Ill go  after.ﬂ Well -- And -- And the way we escaped is  my mother and I  we went to a -- a secluded area of the ghetto  and we climbed out from under the -- the barbed wires.
And if I survived  and if I wouldnt take -- I was the only survivor  and maybe if they are in heaven  I dont know  they would s -- or -- or before they were killed  they knew  because I always was the one who went down from the ghetto  brou ght food  and brought them candy.
But we were fortunate because on Gnieznnienska there was just a sidewalk and the wires [indecipherable] of the ghetto.
Then after a couple days came in a new decree all the Jews must to go in the ghetto  to Slobosk .
So  but was this in Warsaw  or was this outside of Warsaw ?
I was shocked  shocked twice  so maybe this agreement that maybe was done with the Elderstrat  with the authorities through the ghetto  didn't work  or maybe another thing  so that's a puncture.
One thing which was very unique in Ghetto  I just remembered  during Sundays  Ghetto was on the shore of the river and there was like a little beach.
We had some friends in Warsaw and on several occasions my mother took me and we walked along the walls where the cobblestone pavement of the street   sidewalk on outside street paved  and then the wall of the ghetto was almost on the edge of the street  or very narrow sidewalk.
Tell me about the first day of the -- when the Germans came in.
They were in the ghetto and my aunts husband  my uncle   was an accountant  a very able man  extremely able man.
There were Lithuanian fire br igades who came close to the close to the uh ghetto fence  but they came just to safeguard th at the fire shouldn't come over to the other side of the of the fence.
All the Jews living outside -- on outside the Juden ghetto  had to abandon their homes.
35 Yes  but so Dr. Elkes  his court was uh was established so there were the...my my patron whom I talk about  Professor Sigmund Belaski  he was nominated president of the court  of the Jewish court and other prominent lawyer s were members of the court  so there was a a very as far as you can talk about this  in the ghetto you see  that it was a very serious joint meeting of the Jewish committee and the members of the Jewish court and then Dr. Elkes told them  he...it was his prerogative to nominate and he was and he was order...there was regulat ions and based on Lithuanian was the and he said we are in the ghetto in the most terrible time fo r Jews  least of all Lithuanian Jews.
Interview with Hannah Kalman May 20  1999 17 Id like you to tell me about the ghetto.
We pass on the outskirts of the ghetto between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning.
They had it much worse than we  and we were able to throw them some bread because in the ghetto we still did not really starve.
There was just nobody I knew  nobody that I could talk to  but we knew one thing: we knew how to get into the ghetto.
We did have some elderly teachers in the ghetto  Jewish teachers.
Before that  they took out all the children  all the children of the ghetto.
So -- and that was the end and we did not see one of them  nobody was aliv e. They all perished in the Warsaw ghetto.
You can arrange for a place to sleep  because the ghetto was made small.
Janusz Korczak  The Warsaw Ghetto Memoirs of Janusz Korczak (Washington  DC: University Press of America  1978)  64.
And then after everybody was lined up  I forgot to say  one German SS man who was in charge of the Ghetto  or who was one of the ones in charge of the Ghetto  went through the line  which there were five people in one row and divided two people 25 here and three people.
We did know that the ghetto was going to be liquidated completely and I tried to run away  and going under the barbed wire the Ukraine were shooting at me.
And the ghetto was shrunk to fewer people and fewer space.
Now -- But -- but for a long time  in Pruzana  you said it was the -- the ghetto was there  but you lived beyond it and w -- and were ab le to come and go.
So the schools that you attended  were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?
I knew the people who was -- they were on the committee in the ghetto.
Two weeks later the entire family was sent to the ghetto.
And  uh  we were told that we have to make it out of the ghetto  and the ghettos were not as tightly watched as uh camps  uh  down the hill  because this particular ghetto was on the hill  over the fence  and then he would be waiting for us and we would follow him to the ra ilroad station  and there he would give us the tickets  and we would be on our own.
There was no ghetto there and they was living not so very well  but okay.
speaks foreign language here] I: The Polish underground was  internationa l underground was very well organized in ?
But we were wearing the Jewish star  the Morgan David star  and they should know that we are Jew.
When I have to leave -- not when I have  when I was allotted to leave the ghetto with all the ammunition and everything  at March 1944 at night through the gate of the ghetto  so at the gate of the ghetto were some people who were staying there all the time  all the -- even before and after  including they were some policemen  and they knew we were not going as it was reported by one of us that we are going outside like a team of work in the woods  but we are going to fight with partisans.
And we somehow scraped together enough to buy tickets on the train to go to Warsaw because Warsaw was a big town where nobody knew us and we were dreaming and hoping that maybe we could establish our existence as Aryans in the Warsaw outside of the ghetto.
Mr. Sheriss  before I remember -- before I forget  how did you know him in Vilnius  was he in the ghetto?
You know some period from fight after the I dont remember.
And as I said  it was th-the more elite part of the ghetto that we were brought to.
I came out of the hospital and sure enough a few days later the hospital population was taken out and put to death  but all the other ghetto inma tes had to stand for selection.

Life in the ghetto  I was going out in the street  they grabbed me to work.
The wagons came and trucks and they told us to take our belongings  and get into the wagons.
They put us on these cattle trains and we were traveling.
He couldn't go back to my mother because he really wanted to be with my mother  so that's how my father stayed with us  and that particular day my mother with most of the rest of the ghetto were taken out.
Since we were -- and the streetcar belonged to the population -- since we were not supposed to cross the street  it was cutting ghetto in half.
They came up this -- we were ten of us who were escaping from the ghetto -- they came up  the German guards and they shot everybody on sight.
We decided  we knew  that the Jews come out from the ghetto to work every day morning and they go back at night.
Live over there in the factory.ﬂ They always chased me to go out from the ghetto to be in the factory.
Ravensburg a transport from Šwe were on the same trains  a transport from Auschwitz and one girl recognize me who knew my parents and told me she went them at the liquidation of the ghetto to Auschwitz and she saw my father going to the ovens.
He came into the ghetto and he said to my father  ﬁRemember  you know I hear very bad news.
So the Jews who lived in the ghetto had to cross that street on bridges like this one.
I got in there  they put me in the -- what was called the hospital  it was the krankenbau  the building for the sick.
What I...The most important thi ng was when he went into the ghetto...not always he went through the ghetto you know.
They were writing -- thats what my mom told me in Yiddish  that they have to leave their apartments  and they going to give them another apartments  all Jews together  its -- it was a ghetto creating in Wa rsaw  but they didn't know any better what will 72 happen to them.
And once we were inside we could tell that along the walls  all around the ghetto in an octagon  were these barracks these huge stone buildings  two stories high and they were again closed up toward the street  you see.
By the time she decided  it was too la te to get papers and she was eventually put in the Riga ghetto in Latvia and then from Riga  she was then put into labor camp in Stutthof and through the Holocaust Museums library  we were able to get in touch with a place in Stutthof  a -- a museum that they erected on the camp  that Stutthof camp and they sent us copy of a page of a ledger which shows her name and her date of death in Stutthof  in a camp.
And then while we existed in this ghetto we were hearing rumors -- it was already 1943 -- that something is cooking there  that there might be an uprising.
Were you able to communicate with anybody else out of the ghetto?
Did you -- did you see brutality bef -- before the ghetto  did you see the Nazis on the street  or the Poles  taking Jews and beating them up  did you see that?
Meanwhile  my father  my mother  and my baby sister was born while they were in hiding.
Even on the territory of the ghetto  a board with some debris would be placed over the entrance  and this made blowing the sewer up impossible.
And so we marched and he was yelling at me  I knew he was just doing it  you know  for the other Germans around  the ones who would walk  and as we entered the ghetto  I went to my mothers place first and then she told me that my father was in the hospita l and I went to see my dad and he was so happy to see me because I always was daddys little girl and we talked for awhile and he had his leg in traction and he told me what happened  how he broke the leg  that he jumped out the window because they were rounding them up to send them to gas chambers.
It's coming from the Warsaw Ghetto said our generation is dying out now.
We believed it really that we ar e going to get out of the ghetto and life will come again as it was before the war or be tter.
This was our luck  and in the morning the ghetto was completely empty  the small ghetto  and we could hear in the night the machine guns and the shooting  because the Nitenfort was not really far away from the ghetto.
Were there any activities in the ghetto  did people at least privatel y  worship or sing or anything?
And how did you take care of that  when you were in the ghetto?
Uh...Uh...for instance  in the daytime so when a German us ed to come in the ghetto  Avraham used to send me messenger to tell Germans in the ghe tto.
It was -- in the ghetto it was very impor tant who you are.
Interesting that after the war  and I'm ahead of my story  I found out that almost each Ghetto was operated on a different wave length.

Y-Y-You were happy Sh-She just stayed in the house in the ghetto.
He lived with us and he sort of became like a protector of the family because he was involved in the  in the I don't really the administration of the ghetto.
And so I endangered my life by sneaking out from the ghetto.
When they liquidated the ghetto  you were able to go to Pionki  as you told us  but you lost most of your family at that time.
In addition to this you know  people were trying  like I said before  they were trying to hang on to the  to the way of life they had before they came to the ghetto and to a certain extent they succeeded in it.
So they brought you in the ghetto and they said ﬁFind a placeﬂ?
04:22:27 Sure  always sick  in the ghetto were sick people and the thing  you could  you couldn't  and  you know how it was.
So in the meantime I went for the Niederman to the ghetto and I picked up my...her clothes  and one day an SS   he said he knew me.
They survived the war because of me from the Lodz ghetto.
Because they be in good condition  so the Germans were staying by the ghetto.
Did--do you remember when the ghetto was se t up in the town?
We made a move from Lida to Lvov  so to move into the ghetto we were sort of condensed already.
So on that day  we left the protected houses and we moved into the Budapest ghetto which by that time was built up around the great synagogue of Budapest  beautiful big building  completely restored by now.
Before that cross -- Red Cross came I me ntioned the old people -- a lot of old -- thousands of old people were deported  and after that  it must have been under the influence of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto that the Germans did not want it to happen in other ghettos as well  so all able bodied people who were not necessary for the war industry  and like agriculture for where they produced for the Germans  and those who were necessary to maintain the functioning of the town  of the ghetto as such  the physical functioning  were all deported  and Schliesser was gone  and I was among -- the 91 kitchens were running  so I was no l-longer needed.

I worked in the transport  the night commando  and the  the  the people from the Lodz ghetto  from Lichmenstadt  used to come  and they liquidate the Lodz ghetto  this was already 1944.

Do you remember there being any kind of qualitative change when the Ghetto became a concentration camp?
The best the best minds were taken out of the ghetto.
And there were ways to slip out where the work group or work brigade as they were called that worked outside  outside of the ghetto and with the knowledge  it was usually best that with the knowledge of the group leader  one could slip away either to do some trading  bartering  get food.
And that was -- I could go back to the Warsaw ghetto because the jo -- JDC had a -- theyd always had a program in Warsaw and Bill -- Bill -- th e long time director of the JDC in -- in Warsaw.
Husband) Oh yeah  she was in the Warsaw ghetto too  she was in the family.

I they said to me  the Foltanskis  whenever you hear that they killing Jews in the ghetto  come running to us and well try to help you.
I guess the Germans were afraid it could happen also in other places  which actually at one time there was a resistance in our ghetto but they were caught.

Well  what was your understanding of what the Germans were doing with Jews?

And -- and we move a few times  we -- we move from one place to another  because the ghetto was getti ng smaller and smaller  and at a certain time  I think it was in -- in 42  m-ma ybe that i-i-it -- it came mu-muc h smaller and it became cal-callcalled Julak.
AT: When the ghetto was liquidated we were  were all left.
And uh  immediately after that uh--uh the um the community--the Jewish community started to form some--some bits of organization with a police force--a ghetto police uh and--and--and uh committees and--and--and uh what we called the uh--the uh--I suppose you might call the mayor of the ghetto.
I remember as it quieted down  these people were marched out  the outside of the city  but not too far away and there was a mass grave being dug by some of the militia people  and all our families  there was    the other people from that compound and other compounds in the ghetto  were shot into that mass grave.
Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends  did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?
Right  I d -- han -- yaha -- wa -- I -- you know  I liked to sleep when I could sleep  but when we ended up in the real ghetto we co uldnt sleep  because sometimes we had to move from place to place to place to place  and there was no time to sleep.

Because he was a Polish citizen  you might say  in Poland became a communist country so they allowed all the Polish citizen to go back to Poland.
Then after a month or two they decided to have a ghetto  and the ghetto was made in...they call a little place called Slabotki.
After that it was I do not know exactly how many people were left over but it was in December  I found a job to work outside of the ghetto.
It was very demoralizing to live in these conditions when we had to share one bathroom  and this building  this was one of the bigger buildings in the ghetto  there were about 100 people  and just to go to the bathroom was a horrendous experience.
When I left the ghetto -- when I left the ghetto  I was -- well  my way was -- oh  I going to say you to understand.
When we came into the ghetto  right away they establish they start again with all kind of tricks  playing with us.
Then I worked for the Jewish Community Center at home  because the Germans  when they made the Ghetto  made like the Judenaut which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the office over there for them  until I sent away to   to the slave labor camp.
And the ghetto  the first one was an area of 33 streets and we had friends there who lived there and they let us move in with them at that time.
Do you have any memories of the ghetto that you think would be important to try to talk about that we haven't talked about?
So  I knew how many Jews came into the ghetto and how many- How many?
Unfortunately  I didnt have th e money because when we came to the ghetto  we were ruined because ever ything was from and in order to be you had to have a gun and a gun at this time was like 2000   a lot of money  so I was approached if I woul d like to join the partisan.
And also we digged a way to go through the ghetto into the other side  to the Christian side.
At the same time  even in 19 the last week  we were in danger of being taken to the Danube  that was the  the most common way of getting rid of Jews who were discovered outsi de the ghetto  marched down and shot into the river.

End of Tape #1 9 Tape #2 I am going to go back and ask you some questions from the very beginning.
The first ghetto in the city was that very  very just Jewish area  so my father had a friend who had a house nearby that some eight families went to live with that family.
And every family  they packed  and they took us to the ghetto.
Anthony: Trying to go from the small ghetto to the big ghetto?
When the mark tries [to sneak out of] the ghetto  then a shot in the head.\
Anthony: Was the factory in the ghetto or outside the ghetto?
There were two rooms  a very rundown place  but however it was a little brick house and it was close to the gate where the ghetto was.
When we define ghettos  we must always define the ghetto where are we talking about.
Let me talk to you a little bit about the ghetto if that's OK.
And they segregated the Jews in the ghetto  former Je wish neighborhood  and  and the pogroms started  or raids  where they would just empty out all of the Jews.
Every person that worked in the ghetto would leave in the morning and come back late in the afternoon  in the evening.
And one of -- one of my classmates from grade school who now lives in Is rael was in that group  and it was a relative of hers who was in the Hungarian equivalent of the ghetto leadership  whatever it was called  arranged for that carload to be brought to Budapest  which at that time was still quite free.
The selection took place... There was a selection at the ghetto line...in the ghetto already.
And the whole existence of the ghetto depended on the airports.
There was no other people there and I said  well  obviously we cannot afford to be out of the ghetto.
And th-those from the 10  quite often used to come down in -- wa -- like I mention  in the ghetto and we used to have contact with them.
Did your parents have to work at that time  outside of the ghetto or inside?
There was probably a few weeks after the Warsaw ghetto or around that time.

His group continued to come every day to uh to the factory  and since I was  my job was to sweep the streets  I managed to sweep the street under the window in which he worked and so we could say hello to each other  and that continued for about four months and uh sometimes in late uh late '42  his group as well as the remnants of the ghetto that the Poles  all those people was the was their was the stamps on their ID cards and including some other groups that was still going to work from the from the ghetto  they were put on a train and shipped on to that farm on the in the east.
By being in ghetto  they bur ned down the hospital  with the ch ildren  with the doctors  with the nurse  across from the place where we used to live  and theres a site.

I was instrumental in br inging this and bringing that and one day Pnina went to work and she tried to trade in her...her evening gown for bread and she was caught by the police and she was taken to the Gestapo  to the Lithuanian criminal police and when they they made...the the workers of the brigade where Pnina worked uh came back to the ghetto so they came to me and told me Pnina is under arrest and I tried immediately what can I do.
The father had suddenly done something that the Nazis didnt like.
Anybody who did not have the star and was caught outside the ghetto was punished very severely.
