It is not true you know  most of the Jews in France were arrested by the French Police and this I think is the case of Rene Bousquet  because all these indictments made a lot of articles in the newspapers and in France newspapers have been very helpful to educate French Public Opinion and to show them what was the responsibilities of the Vichy Government and in the Bousquet case unfortunately a crazy man killed him and I certainly feel it would have been better to have the Bousquet case instead of the case of the crazy man of ???

Not from the Nazis  not from the  not from the Germans  we call them Nazis  not from the Germans  not from the Dutch government  except a  a little bit that allowed my parents to buy some furniture.

But I later had  and it was nearly hilarious  that our government was bringing itself in [indecipherable] to stay neutral.
And all th at propaganda of the French government  trying to -- not trying -- but -- I believe they believed that  themselves  you know.
Later on  it became official policy  anti-Semitism  but not in that time.
The point that I made was repeating something that a German mayor told me while I was in military government.
And they kept sending the children back  instead of taking them out  until the government finally closed down the school  and there was no but it was  you know  like the American school later became the place to send your child  the German school were for example  Octavio Paz   the the Mexican diplomat and author went to a ger to the German school  to the Alexander von Humboldt school  and so did a lot of intellectuals  along in the 1940s  a lot of intellectuals went to the German school.
But being as it was agricultural  any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it wa s sort of beneficial to the state or whatever  or the peasantry or whatever.
A. Well  there was daily comm unication by secret radios with the government in London.
39  I was  again  I had  I had my vacation paid by the government in a youth hostel in Verdun.
No  its... most of the time  the way I see things now  the people have nothing to do with it  its the head of the government.
How has it affected your  I dont kn ow  we talked about politics briefly  citizenship  your -- your feelings about government and the possibilities of what government can do and should do and should not do.
And they primarily did military  they did primarily military and economic and foreign policy research for the Air Force.
But we basically contained them and that was Trumans policy  co ntaining the Communists from spreading.
You had to buy from a licensed location  register it  because you had to pay a yearly fee to the government  so everybody had a radio  just like having a car  was registered  and then you were to come for it.
I wasnt eligible for a government fellowship  so I got an industrial fellowship.
Uh the medics were there in in great numbers and and again with the military government colonel also and uh I uh I drove into that factory and uh and I saw this courtyard and the and there were some what I I can only describe them as as living skeletons walking around  going about certain chores such as getting water uh in the courtyard and over in a doorway I I saw another young woman sort of leaning against the doorway and and she seemed to be in slightly better condition than than the rest that I had just seen and I walked over to her and addressed her in I think both in English and in German  and uh because I assumed of course that she spoke German uh and uh which she confirmed  and I uh I wanted to see  of course  where the rest of of her companions were  and I asked her about them and she just motioned me in and I ...uh we went inside and uh that was of course a scene of devastation that nobody who has ever seen it will will ever forget.
I mean this  at that time we were not married yet  and we  we  we had a room to live th ere  2  3 rooms  a kitchen and 2  and we stayed until the Austrian government wanted the Swedes to leave  to leave  go home.
And when the peasants used to make gatherings in our town  which the government was against it  and the thousands of thousands of peasants came to the marketplace to speak about the unjustice  what the government is doing against the Poles  against the peasants  all the meetings  everything was done in our house.
Did you follow a little bit the recent political developments in Austria  for instance with Jorg Heider  who is an ultra Conservative being now part of the government.
So she was a Volksdeutscher and they often had German visitors because of that.
Well  at that time we were enga ged in manufacturing for the government.
So I said to myself  wh o can extend it  it was made out by the German government  go to the German consulate.
And I knew from my work on foreign policy  that thats a very time consuming business  and you have to get some grant money to spend time in archives  but wasnt it about time that these things were utilized?
Now something new is working now with the Israeli government where they want to give reparation for people who are older and Israel is trying to work out something with Germany.
Menachem Begin led the opposition to the Ben Gurion government on all kinds of issues  and this became one of the major issues in his bat tle with Ben Gurion.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 55 October 14  2010 Did you meet any of the government leaders in Israel?
I am taking this Jew to military government  and I am having him arrested as a war criminal and the Allied Armies will try this war criminal as we are trying war criminals and you won't touch 20 him.\
As the uh  when we uh  in May  just a month or so after uh  the war was over and troops were put in as uh  as uh  well for military government and uh  I for instance was assigned a little town uh  by the name of Wimbleberg   uh  and I was in effect the military governor of that.
You know  a lot of German Jews got money from Germany.
It would say that the German command had issued a decree to the Dutch government  and the Dutch government said that Jews were no longer allowed to have businesses.
So was the government of Norway in some way sympathetic that they a llowed this  or they -- No  they didnt -- no -- No. --
So that was my great  great project of transla ting  of course  vol unteering  and what happened is and Im rambling  even thou gh I thought that I would be doing more legal work of some sort after I gra after I graduate after I retire from the government  I discovered that practice of law is so bureaucratically impeded by various bar associations and I need to join and I need to l be licensed that that I na just naturally evolved that I am a tran slator today.

So  the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27  2010 5German army.
The policy was to eh eh repatriate all the people who were at that time on German soil.
So we -- there was just a further factor  namely the Latvian government was trying to ke ep good relations with both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany  and this means that they purposely suppressed any kind of derogatory  unfavorable news about th-the Germans an-and th e Russians  so we didnt learn as much about some of the atrocities were going on in -- sa y in Poland  a-as we should have.
They know that the country is going Communist  they don't want to live under a Communist government.
I think by that time already  the Jews were not allowed to go to public schools.
And beside that  in Banska Bystrica was the first actually Czechoslovak socalled Czechoslovak government in exile  and many high ranking officials came from London   and then the Russian started to drop munition and weapons from the air  first from the air and then even many times they landed in Banska Bystrica   there touch outside from Banska Bystrica   or they brought a we-weapon the Russian  or [indecipherable] for the uprising.
They were broken  these relations were broken  and th e Russians ignored the free legal Polish government.
Ultimately  the Polish government -- this is not known -- punished very severely those people responsible for this.

What we didnt know  but he did  and many of the Nazis did  is that the Hungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and even with the Russians.
And basically our job was to -- to try to determine responsibility on both sides  on the guerilla side and on the government side for some of the terrible acts that happened  for example  the killing of the archbishop Romero  the killing of the Jesuits  the -- the rapes and killings of the church women.
Of course  being involved in such a situation  the Po lish government assigned  like here we have the veterans  what they get some kind of benefits  the Polish government give them also some kind of a benefit.
So when the word got through the British government  that the son of the president of Warsaw arrived in such a terrible shape  she invited me into her palatial estate in Cornwall .
And my mother  of course  those days she was a housewife when I was first born  but of course when my father uh was drafted in the forced labor camp  she had to take over my father's business and then after the war subsequently she had a jewelry store and uh after the communists took over she went to work for the government.
You know  I do believe that Germany has made an earnest effort to remove the  not the guilt  but to remove anti -Semitism and to be sure they have the policy that any act of anti -Semitism is punishable.
Uh  in this period of time in Romania  it was the Legionary government with Antonescu.
And I went and registered in Bratislava to medical school and that's where I met my husband several months later because I needed bones to study for the exam and I never could visualize things  it was anatomy of the extremities  and I had to do good on my examination because they had  the government  Pollack??

A. Of course  I mean  they  they were suppor ting  but they were helpless  I mean it was a government in exile.
And I am very happy the Polish gover -- government  afte r the fall of governments  are doing their best to seek re conciliation with their neighbors  not only with Germans  but also with pole -- with Lithuanians  for instance.
And the the influence of Germans  and the influence of the government  they started this that the Jews cannot have business  the Jews cannot go to universities  and so on and so forth.
Did your family at home  did your parents talk about the Nazi rise to power?
I mean Senator Eastland 15 and the Congress was not yet really committed to putting the full force of the government behind civil rights litigation.

They uh...the American government addressed a note to a country with which it was at war.

Anyway  when Mama returned to Lithuania  she started to work for our government.
My husband and I  we had to go back and the mayor of the there came a time (sigh) there came a time when the German government told each mayor to invite the Jewish people that had been thrown out of there.
There might have been questions that were raised about policy which than we would relate if we could get through on the phone to have some body in the wilderness  but we had to make the decisions ourselves and I think to so rt of prove of that a number of people we sent home were  I don't we sent one guy home -- MR.
Maybe now -- maybe now we sh -- Of course [indecipherable] fault -- fault our government.
There were many Czechs who occ upied high positions in the nazi government  but to what extent they influenced actually our departure of the transports  it was hard to ascertain.
Trying to be informed a nd to not be afraid to express an opinion in opposition to the Israeli government.
I was a little bit surprised and a little bit disappointed in the American government for letting them in.
And I was invited to the ceremonies  which were held in 1990  in May 1990 and I stayed with my friend there and it was just a wonderful  wonderful ceremony  they had dignitaries from Yahdvashem  from Eva Edmands 53 [Date not labeled] Page 53 Israel they had the Grand Rabbi of the region  they had priests and ministers and people from the French government and some 600 invited guests and I was able to again tell  talk  tell these people  in French this time  about the priest and what he had done for us and then since he had died  his medal was awarded to him posthumously and it was given to me and I asked that the medal be put in a glass case and put in his former church so that everybody would  would see it.
Three years ago  a group of Polish  Polish president and Polish military high officers and the government got into a plane to go to open a museum or a flag there  and that plane fell down and crashed.

The union of Polis h patriots  then in Moscow   which was the which was the original name of the communi st Polish government that wa s being there organized in Moscow.
Then his buddy Schuschnigg became the chancellor and Hitler asked  by that time Hitler was in government in Germany.
And then so and and then you also mention at one point that Frank   obviously before the general government  wo rked with Roland Freisler  and if theres any any legal person that Americans know about during this period  and thats not much  thats for sure  its Freisler   because of what happened 20 th of July  and all that.
And I had during that time been in contact with an attorney who took care of claims to the German government.
And Dr. Ruth Gruber  who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres  who was an -- high in the government  had been sent to Europe to select from different camps  a thousand refugees.
Only when we went to the trials in Germany  the German government paid for the tr -- the trip and living there  in Germany.
I went  and in the begin the first year  you know  this prayer book  the I dont know whats happened  because maybe the if something because yeah  all the furniture  all the clothing  everything what we when we left Czechoslovakia we had to leave there  and the government took it over.
And they had been in contact pretty much the -- forever  and he was a very close friend of Titos and he was very high up in the government.
And so there was a connection between her and -- and the government  and they were contact -- I know they didnt contact -- my parents didnt contact them  because when they got this information -- also  it was around Washi ngton Heights  everybody was -- knew about it  or people here and there were getting these invitations.
And our government was in England  so we felt that we had total freedom  and yet obey what they told us.
And the German government had to supply us with the best food  with the best in everything.
And eventually he went to Israel  Israel was created  and she followed him  and she spent two years in Israel with him  working as an English steno -- some position there.

8 It's not r elevant  but the Soviet government had a pact with the Polish government in exile  and they tried to form an Army to fight the Germans  but that's part of the history and I don't want to bore you with that.
But otherwise I dont know whether that changed  but in Biaystok  there was a street named by Koscza Kowskei was mi misa some someone in government.
it was just the government took my father to work in the ditches and my dad was coming home Interview with Margie Rosenthal 17 very  feeling not well.

So  the government has said that they will give him a dental equipment left by fleeing Germans.
I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it  edit this tape......so the episode at the train station...you can take it fr om the other tape and put it together  piece it together–The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were  at the train station they were loading train cars with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true  that they were going to work.
37 Well -- something with the government  I dont know exactly who is at fault doing that.
So  you had to go and learn English and about the government.
I guess my question here is  how long did it take after March 13th for things to settle down a little bit  and for the government  German or Austrian  to really take charge in a -- in a systematic way.
Because if they would let them out  we would be already by the Germans  they would kill us.
But anyway  I considered it simply a challenge to do something that I was prohibited from doing by the government.
The USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 7 Communists already took over the government of Czechoslovakia when my parents came to me with the question whether I would be willing to emigrate to Israel.
