Ukrainian guards started shooting right into this -- th-the moving bodies  the reflectors  you know  th ey started sending them.
Cause that day in the in the beet field  I saw them before they started shooting at me  but they wasnt a thing I could do  I was right in the middle of this beet field  no place to go.
So  all of a sudden the Germans  you know  there was a shot -- we had a shot.
I cried so much...I just couldn't eat  and uh so at night everything was quiet down  was no mare shooting.

Then when we came back home  it was the middle of the night and we couldn't go because they were shooting everybody on the streets  whoever they saw.
One thing that I have to do is I have to jump there and I have lie the whole night between two deads -- and I hear what the shooting  what the machine guns around and they was walking over my head.
That the people had to dig their own graves and were shot on the spot.

So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and somebody who has  who can speak Italian must lead us.
And walk to the field and pretend that you are shooting or whatever.
They had also people who were shooting into the ghetto   not just from the tops but everywhere a nd then   of course  bombing.
I used to go there almost every day on my bike   drove through those famous gates  and roam around and play on the backlot sets  and wander into different stages where they were shooting amazing films.

But during that time  it was the most terrible time from the viewpoint of the war because then the Soviets pu t on their artillery on the Pest and shooting direct fire up on us and destroying the whole Buda  the royal palace and all the other hous es.
So once they started to shoot clear and they got up  we immediately started to shoot against them.
But meanwhile Schrodt  the guy that was watching  he started shooting.
So  for the next three days we could see each other on the ship  and the interesting thing is that while we were going through the bay of Riga  the Russians were shooting at the ship  but missing us by a hundred or two hundred yards  and we just sailed through it  and the artillery shells would fall  go over the ship  fall on the other side maybe a couple of hundred yards from it  and we finally arrive d near Danzig.
And he was standing there and he was shooting right away.
Ther e's a lot of people  myself  who I didn't mention what I saw when we were running from the Germans  that the Messerschmitts up there were shooting at at civilians running away from Paris.
The thought of being in another war or  or hearing the shooting again.
We were a couple of days and but seeing that stuff  shooting  killing some people  a lot of people.

So he went and signaled another one of his compatriots  and they started the shooting.
Making a long story short  I found out that two Russian planes came in  seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the area.
So I waited until almost daylight and I didn't -- until the shooting subsided and were not shooting anymore.
I hate real war movies  like shooting and things like that.
So I guess in ghetto when he came to 11 take us out for shooting  he pushed me inside.
We did know that the ghetto was going to be liquidated completely and I tried to run away  and going under the barbed wire the Ukraine were shooting at me.

So when you start the motor  the boat was shooting already.
Because there was shooting  shooting  shooting  and I was run...going around in the ghetto from one end to the other.

They usually went into the forest about a hundred yards and started widely shooting into the forest hoping that they will hit someone and some occasions they hit someone  but once they heard a human voice they entered the forest and dragged the partisans out.
And they started  of course  shooting  but he kept going zigzag  so he was not hit  and we  we made it to Germany.
Meaning I was shooting guns at whoeve r was shooting guns at us.
So  this wa -- was about as far as I came to the -- to shootings  I mean  from war related shooting  so to speak.
And I heard them guys screaming up there where they where I was shooting at  so I I Im pretty sure I hit them  because that was them screaming.
