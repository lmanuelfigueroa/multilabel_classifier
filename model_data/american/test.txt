Now this is something uh perhaps at this moment where anti-Semitism is growing again in many places in the world and even in this country  but the generation the last thirty years  the American Jewish youngsters didn't suffer from anti-Semitism  and they don't...didn't understand that there was a very active anti-Semitic movement in this country in the '30's.
So  I cannot make statement  all American are nice  or all are bad  or Jews  or whatever.
As I was exposed to some anti-semitism in the American army and in the DP camp I reached the conclusion by myself that the persecution is going to start over again.
I worked first for a British company  and then when they sold the refineries to the Israelis  my Hebrew wasn't good enough  so I looked for another job and found one at the American embassy in Tel Aviv.

And I couldnt understand it  I asked them  I said -- to me they seemed exotic  because the first people -- black people I saw were American soldiers and I thought that was -- oh  this is so wonderful  to have these nice  black people.
A -- a woman at the American embassy was helpful for that.
When I was standing guard at night with the American soldier  I usua lly tried to get rid of his rifle or something.
And if you say  oh a black American did it -- I -- I mean A-African American did it  or a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- O-Oriental did it  or this one did it.

And -- What -- what -- how did you feel about be ing in -- being in Germany again after the war  and doing this work for the American army?
This is not about my fathers American experience and thats of course what Im most familiar with.
So to come back to the subject  there was anti Semitism on the part of some if not all of American Military officers and even more  there was little knowledge on their part and some cases they were doing a job that they didn't like doing  that they didn't want to do because it wasn't strictly speaking a military position  something that they had expected when they entered the army.
Well  the scope  of course we found out  Im sure  when we started getting American news  and stuff like you know  I worked for the military go vernment  so already I knew a lot of stuff.

And and so and while I was going to his mother  I didnt get there yet  I saw this big American tanks coming in.
We spoke with Rabbi Steven S. Wise  one of the most prominent American Rabbi's of the 1920's  the 1930's  the 1940's  as well as with other American and other Jewish leaders about what we had seen of the Jewish survivors.

Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 30 Well  a lot of people had some ideas  because there were the American soldiers already  that they used to write home and explain them whats was going on.
But slowly in April...in April  we noticed that German soldiers really are collapsing on the front  receiving here or there some information and then we have also heard that the American soldiers are approaching and so also Dachau.
How can I have brought them from as far out as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and Turkestan  moving them westward  all the time westward toward where the American Army was in Germany and in Austria.

But my kids Felix Horn 82 [Date not labeled] Page 82 always  and my personal friends  American friends  my colleague doctor in the hospital  they are full of admiration for me.
He was liberated  Americans came earlier than that  and he joined the American army.
I took the American military train which was an overnight train that ran between Paris and Frankfurt.
They blew about four or five American soldie rs right in the air.
And and it fon it proved that the young people were right  and when I meet now with American kids in high schools  I often am on their side  because when you are young  you are honest  you have you are not spoiled  you youve got certain inborn morals  and and you know better than the parents  who are more scared.
I  all ri ght  when we came to the border  to the American bor der  they examined all my luggage and I had Tosefa Torah  which I spoke to you before  with me.
Yah  we had to go register with the consular; the American consular  you know  in Vienna.
And I got a call from my landlady that the American embassy is looking for me.

They had no airplanes  the train was not going and it was only going with the help of the American ar my.
The -- the very plain  G.I. issued raincoats -- anything that was American was 71 fabulous.
