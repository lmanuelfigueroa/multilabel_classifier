KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 12 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: German who name was--who's name I'll never forget.
We really for a while were were able to stay together  and never has there ever been a question of my religion  or of being Jewish or not  for some reason.
The re st would be owned by the local  whatever religion.
Do you think the Holocaust had any effect on your thoughts about religion?
I -- I am a people pe -- person.ﬂ They asked me my religion  which I was amazed about.
But your  the children that were born here  did you bring them up Jewish?
So you didnt have any religion classes during the The school.
It was a public school  but it everybody had to take religion.
One last question  you sa id earlier that in your childhood  religion wasn't so important.
It's not just a religion  it's rea lly a way of life.
So the -- out of the girls be -- the mothers being the ones thats really educate the children  because theyre home  or because the Jewish religion  the Orthodox say so  thats fine with me.
I went to a Jewish high school where Hebrew was taught everyday.
About Judaism  I told them -- we were not exactly a religious  more traditional Jews.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 22 [indecipherable] you described a little bit a bout your father and your -- of playing the violin and the intellectual atmos -- but also about the -- the code of ethics and the -- and the -- and the religion.
I went to the Jewish religion  I mean  I went to one hour every day -- I mean every week.
There are some Jews who th -- know there was a Holocaust.
And did you discuss religion with your friends as you got a little bit older  or was that not a subject that people talked about?
How did you convey Jewish culture to your children  Jewish religion to your children?
My father was a Hasidic Jew  very religious  my mother...the whole family was very religious.
Was that true for non-Jewish kids  for the Gent ile kids as well as for the Jewish kids  there just was no school?
And especially through teachers whom I had there in the Jewish religious school.
They were also teaching us about our religion and Hebrew studies and it was only for the older girls  but I always sneaked in with Miriam and I'd fa ll asleep  but I remember because again I wanted to be special.
So your school was Jewish   where you went to school?
I find it that it was the best religion during the Christmas they have Christmas tree and they have Hanukkah candles and any other religion that you want to observe.
Was it a Jewish school  or No well  yes and no.
And a lot of -- a lot of Jews  German Jews  felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect.
If there was a  a religious -- hour of religion  Jewish boys or girls had to go out of the classroom.
And we also  like I said  we took Hebrew  because my -- my father wanted my brother to -- to learn Hebrew  so we were -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 8 a man was coming for a half an hour  whatever it is  and was teaching us Hebrew  and -- my -- my brother and myself.
You mentioned in your video in terview that you had a tough time with your religion when you -- in some of those early years after you came to this country.
You know  religion really didnt me an much to me  I mean its -- it -- it never has.
They are such anti-semitic goy  but they were very religion goys.
Through my entire school ye ar  elementary as well as high school  I had two hours a week religion -- relig ion classes  conducted by a rabbi.
My mother she tried to keep the religion  but eventually it...it fizzled.
We never had any problem about the religion  about other things.
It seems to me that a  a sense of humanity and ethics is what I would consider my religion.
I went to church; and we had religion outside with the Pastor and so on.
Anyway I was the more successful one  and and again with no understanding of the psychological uh after-affects he he was really damaged enormously I think by the war and that whole sense of self and he got a lot of support through his religion and I'm very happy that he got that.
H-H-How -- if it was not religion then  what do you think gave your mother and father the strength to keep going on  and to keep pushing the family overseas?
We had  in the school  as a -- as a routine there was religious instruction one hour a week.
So the schools that you attended  were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?
Instead of people being aware of how terrible it is when there are wars and animosit ies and singling out groups of people to decide that there shouldn't be here or they shouldn't be where they want to be or express what they want to express or practice religion they want to practice.
But other kids really didn't care about religion  the other girls.
You were just talking about your synagogue and... and I wondered when you started to be religious again  and when you joined a synagogue  and what synagogue you joined?
And I said  well  dont you dont have to worry about  because according to the Christian religion  I am a Christian  never mind ho how my person is.
Not just racial  not just inter marriage and et cetera  but also people that changed their religion from Jewish to whatever.
Before the war I got the comfortable life of my parents and my they teached us all the religion religion.
Nothing to do with religion  it has to do with my background  my cultural inclination  my feeling about the -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 59 the ethics of Judaism  due -- because our religion goes by the rela -- by the relation with man.
The other thing I wanted to ask you about your family background: Was your family very conscious of being Jewish?
Thats the kind of petty judgmental pronouncement that humans make but not a god  not a great spirit of love  so  Im  yes  Im sort of anti -organize d religion as far as Im concerned.
And so as I said earlier  I knew a lot more about the Chris tian religion than than the Jewish religion.
Then I didn't really have too much trouble with my other classmates in school  but when we started to go to different to learn religion  which was everybody had to take religion in school.
Interview with Ivan Becker 6 Within our own home we were not religious  although it was mandatory to have religion in school.
What -- what do you think may have -- what do you thinks been changed by your experiences during the war in terms of that -- in terms of the way you see religion or being Jewish?
Oh  you're not Jewish  so I-I assume you wouldn't know much about our religion  but anyway  h-hoopa and -- and -- and of course we went also to the  you know  legally we got married.
Oh  did you -- were you brought up -- y ou were brought up in the -- in the Jewish tradition?
What did your experience in the camp  how did that influence your feelings about religion in any way?
And... uh...in school we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages  arts  geography  history and math  everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a class where a Rabbi taught Jewish history  Hebrew  whatever.
But when it came to in the fifth grade  they wouldn't put me through because I wasn't -- the grade for religion was missing.
The most important thing then  the reli gion  the Judeo-Christian religion has left us  are the principle of caring  loving  and one of the thing that ins -- they insisted I would read  beside the Bible  also with some friends  we went to the Catholic church when there was a series of les parabala.
Not -- no  not through religion strict observance -- through religious observance  but rather on a -- on a -- on another level than the Hassidic  that the prevalent observance was -- was known for at that time.
We are Americans  were proud of it  we believe in it  we want to be Americans  and the religion aspect is a fact you live with  and you either practice it or you dont  but its totally secondary to your [Jew] nationality and citizenship. [
It was grade  I mean grade school and then high school we went to a private school and that was mostly   many Jewish colleagues  also some Christians.
Number one in the Jewish Religion  and number one in Germany.
First we are Christians and in our religion if we have chance help somebody  we do.
And so the kids kind of had to do a mess age about religion.
They  I guess were Jews by religion on ly  or th-they the Germans so nicely put it  Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or pe rsuasion.
