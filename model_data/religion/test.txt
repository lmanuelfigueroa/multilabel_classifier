The -- The -- The Jewish feast of a -- and I think this is one of the best sides of the Jewish religion.
Thats -- thats our religion  and we have to live it.
Cause first you got this idea to betraying your religion  betraying y our parents  your grandparents.
But mostly it was -- anybody who was religious probably was Jewish or something.
I had two friends at my school but during the religion lesson they went out.
Well  culture is something for the heart  too  but for you its -- also you -- you feel a little more strongly about re -- the religion?
But my grandpar -- my grandmother -- I think all of them were really liberal Jews rather than Orthodox Jews.
I just  probably anyone who feels that their  that religion and a belief in God is part of their personality or their person  would feel the same way about th at  I think.
So when I come in they took me out from the school the Christian school and they send me to the Jewish school  not the Jewish  but it was a public school but it was most Jews was there.
And that was the the mission with the Lubavitcha Rebbe gave when a when he left Russia: Not to leave the religion to go out.
And they had -- they had  I think  even religion in there  they had religion  and singing  you know  and it was -- and I made a lot of friends  girlfriends.
Theres no way anyone could have changed my religion  even though I was just a little over 10 years old when I 37 left my parents home.
My parents  my father  he was religious  but not to the extreme.
So yes  I did know I was different  I was Jewish.
Can you describe your early life; what it was like as an immigrant in Hungary   or your parents lives as immigrants; school  religion?
Well  my parents were not rel -- they were Jews  but not fanatical -- not religious.
Well  I believe -- n-now I believe that ou r religion makes sense  you know?
Did you -- and -- and did you feel very Jewish?
Do you ever think that it was your mother's re bellion  her desire to not follow the tradition of your favorite nona -- Well  she was not really -- she abandoned religion completely in Zagreb.
And helping where help is needed and living the exemplary life that our religion teaches us to live.
How -- yeah  now the -- they -- they were a Jewish family.
And  as I told you before  every religion is good as long they don't preach hateness -- Yes. --
There was another  one of my classmates who was  her mother was Jewish and she was of Jewish religion but her father wasnt Jewish.
I swear I am not  see  because I grow up with the Jewish people  I like Jewish people.
Why would anybody think that a sophisticate nation like the Germans would come up with something like this because of religion  or where you come from?
Because I know in our religion we even allow cousins to marry  first cousins and this is not good.
It was ve ry helpful that I knew Catholic religion very well and of course  all prayers.
Do you think in the world  is religion really that important?
And out of our 40  there were Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 21three children who had the option there wa s Catholic religion I think twice a week for an hour they could stay  or they could go out.
And it seems to me that only religion  when you believe we believe in the same God  only different  and of course  I I believe it is better than [indecipherable].
>> Bill Benson: That created a little bit of -- >> Marcel Hodak: Conflict  because at the time we still believed we were Jewish  and that we should marry within the religion.
Interview with Fred Gutter October 30  1999 60 How did you impart Jewish religion   Jewish culture to your children?
I went to Hebrew schools though  I learned Hebrew -- Oh  you did? --
I was extremely happy in sc hool  learning about Zionism  learning about -- about Jewish religion  and developing an extremel y fond love for the Jewish people.
Of course  I didn't understand what that was  but I presume  having read a lot about how the Jews of Germany lived during those years  anything to keep the outside world out was practiced.
They had all three congregations  the Jewish and the Jaxonites   and he would go downstairs to the little hole in the wall orthodox  and he would daven only in the -- and passover with Interview with Paul Halpern 6 him was a disaster because he would go through the entire Haggadah in Hebrew only -- never pausing for one word  and my mother would be say  Joe  the dinner's getting cold  but we weren't religion.
I have to first say that my father  like many oth er German Jews  considered themselves Germans  period.
What I do remember is that I  for the first time  I found about Jewish things  because my grandfather ate kosher  and so did my aunt.
And  you know  I know nothing about religion  about Jews  ye you know  there are there were no Jews around me.
I was a year in the -- in the -- In the Jewish school.
And the Catholic religion was being taught with a catechism and there was a little booklet with questions and answers.
But meanwhile though your parents had settled in a basically Jewish area?
And was it religion or whatever it was  its just -- and even now  whenever we go and see them  especially the daughter  there is something very beautiful about their presence.
I knew that  that first of all  religion was co mpletely different in the United States and Canada than it was in Europe or especially in my section  even th ough in Germany  many of them or most of them are not religious  you see.
Can you explain wh what that means  the expression Religion  the religion was not Jewish  only Mojsze szewego.
After I was able to just USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 199 register the cemetery in New York  with this other lady  who was -- she happened to have been my -- Polafunk is her name  she was my religion teacher in Poland  she happens to live in New York.
He did a lot of things that was for the Jewish community.
For my grandmother religion was not just a belief  it was a way of life whic h effected the way she behaved  the way she dressed  the way she taught us.
As far as religion  you know  I just knew I was Jewish  that's it.
He felt that religion separates people and that was his outlook on life.
What took place\  Interview with George Kadar 15 April 24  2000 Can you talk a little bit about the role faith and religion played at home?
Because they believed in their religion that the worst thing that could happen to them was to go to God in the nude.
And after I was through with the year of elementary school  I went to a Jewish secondary school.
I w-wanted to know what your feelings about being Jewish were.
The misery was so bad in there  there was no food  there was no nothing  but the religion was on top.
How religious was your family and how affiliated Jewishly were they?
Do you think that your -- your faith helped you through all of your experiences?
But that was my religion which wouldn't allow me to eat any unkosher food  even in Auschwitz.
Can you say something more about -- abou t the -- about your religion now  a -- your faith now?
You know  there are the charming parts of every religion  and then there are the dodo parts of re -- for example  you say youre Catholic.
And for religious reason  he didnt really  I dont think he had any feelings for or against any kind of religion.
Well  they say that you know  religion was saved by Russias grandmothers  you know?
She had no idea about his nationality or his religion or anything.
So I went to a Jewish school with a Jewish teacher.
>> Bill Benson: The question he's asking is how you were able to make meaning out of all you went through and how important has been your faith  your Jewish religion.
And my mother wasn't particularly religious  even though she came from a very traditional Jewish background  but  you know  they were sort of rebelling against that  my parents.
We were Jewish  and we have Jewish schools  and we have Jewish synagogues  and we have [indecipherable] in that time in Poland.
Catholics went to Catholic class and Protestants went to Protestant class and everybody mingled and got along very well and I was never aware of Jewish or not Jewish or anything else pertaining to religion until much later.
It -- perhaps that was the way German Jews  who had lived in Germany for such -- and I dont mean that in any demeaning way  had integrated so much that they did not view themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed themselves as Germans of a Jewish religion  i-if you understand  actually.
If you talk there too much -- And were they a -- were they a Jewish family?
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 30 And may I ask what was the religion  was it Lutheran or was it Catholic?
In a way its not so much the religion as being a nation  being a nation that its another thing that we should really respect ourselves  a people who suffered so much in their history and they survived.
Religion and Judaism became part of survival for me and I think that was part of what my father  my family brought me up.
Speaking of being in the Protestant section  was your family religiously Jewish?
Did the -- Did the religion -- Did that faith in church  was it a comfort to you  to be able to do -- worship in some way?
Religion was taught in separate classes to the Jews  the Catholics  the Moslems  the Orthodox  and so on.
I think I have a -- a deeper understanding of my religion  but I dont in fact know that thats why I have it  cause I dont know what I would have been otherwise.
Um  I did want to add one thing  because you aske d about God  and if you want me to  I can tell you that I did have a bit of a dintorah  which means like a 'case' with my God  and for a long time  I really didn't want to have anything to do w ith religion.
But there was no contact with the religion  at least on my -- on my part  and on my fathers part  I dont remember anything.
She -- She says to me  she says  ﬁYou know  when I was in first grade  the teacher asked everybody what religion they were  and when she got to me  I said  I dont know.ﬂ And I said  ﬁWhat do you mean you dont know?ﬂ I said  you know  ﬁJust because we didnt do a lot of those things ﬂ I said  ﬁsurely  you must have known that youﬂ -- she said  ﬁNo  I was really confused.
And they had many Jewish friends  so they they  they were  of course  interested in it.
Do you want to -- to talk about your experience with religion now?
Im not a person who really believes much in national identity  you know  I just... I feel that cause more problems  that and religion  than anything else  so Ive never been a patriot of basically any country  and there... I still am not.
The Masonic Lodge is open to everybody who has some kind of religion  but the Catholic church is unfriendly  lets say.
You can go to a priest and say Father  I would like to become a Catholic and the Father will take you  teach you  and make you a Catholic.
To some people being Jewish is a religion  obviously  Sammy Davis Jr .
Now you said that your religious life changed during this time.
To me  art was the  gave the contact of the soul and maybe replaced what other people taken their religion  religious experiences.
You know  the school I went to I was the only Jewish girl in my class.
I -- I dont think this was -- this was less beca use of religion or nationality.
What about the general idea of someone j udging someone else for their race or religion or you know  the -- did -- yo-you werent necessarily thinking about how -- that was what -- that was what the Nazis were doing with the Jews?
And you talked about how when you were working at Garfinkels you didnt  you didnt want to talk– I worried because I  see now I can talk to anybody and I dont care  you know  that I would be denying my religion.
And I wondered whether or not you felt more interested in Judaism as a result  where you may not have been.
In this country -- in Germany the rabbi didn't have to worry about getting pa id or anything like that because part of it came out of the tax money which was then give n back to each religion so it was a much stabler kind of job.
So there was a certain split in the in the religion.
They came  apparently  from Poland originally and they may have been Jewish.
Well  I knew that Im Jewish because I -- I -- I -- you know  as I said  that we had -- we -- we -- we were religious.
Yes  I was very religious by myself  because I was raised like that.
And the woman stayed at home  and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition  religion  heritage.
Although I do remember I had a very good friend who was Jewish  and she was brought up without any religion.
So my something is religion  and that's the answer for me.
I had many kids in different places and I didn't know their names and I didn't know their religion but they had to go to school.
Even when he scol ded me for something that  that had something to do with religion to go along with my moth er  I sensed in his voice that it was not serious  that he just did it for my mothers sake.
Th-This is -- has not been my problem  its just that I felt that the religion to -- to me had become -- should be less nationalistic  less tied to various rituals.
And the religion keep the peop le very close  very close together.
I dont have any knowledge about the Jewish religion  neither from any other religion.
See  because the Jewish religion  the most important thing -- thats where the Jewish religion -- thats what I was taught  okay?
Do you think your experiences during the Holocaust affected your thoughts about God?
You have to realize that I didnt know I was Jewish.
But its hard  its hard to be very religious when I know some people all together forgot about religion after the war  others went just to religion to get strength in life.
It doesn't make any difference if you're black  yellow  white  what religion  if you're Muslim   Hindu  Christian  Jewish  we all are God's children.
Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people.
Had your war experience an impact on your faith in any way?
The personnel officer asked me what religion I was  she said I didnt have to say.
In fact  I was quite religious  for a number of years.
So the -- otherwise  my parents were members of the Jewish community.
And nothing else  if I don't feel that strong about religion  I wanted them to have something.
It's 4 customary in the Jewish religion for a couple who becomes engaged for the parents of the bride to present their future son -in-law with a prayer shawl .
It was a concept that was not within the Jewish religion.
So  yes  we were very religious and interestingly enough  the religion was state supported.
Religion was already very deeply imbedded in my life  so that I knew I was different.
Then the school moved out of the neighborhood and I was in the school anyway  but there comes my religion.
For those who do not believe  an explanation is not possible.ﬂ And here is the whole thing about religion.
You know that here all the time  you have to give your religion; they ask you what religion.
I'm wondering  did you also start to s eek out how you felt about religion and Jewish organizations and did you start to search out social groups?
Did you and your husband  di d you raise your children Jewish?
I do  because if I hate  I  it doesn't make me better what the Germans are  and I want to say something here that probably a lot of people will not appreciate it  you will cut it out probably  this what bothers me about religion.
They didnt -- the German do not recognize the Jewish or the Catholic  they built for the Polish people  doesnt matter what religion  for the Polish people.
My  my father always talked to me and said go  you know  to the synagogue  your mother wants you to go and all this and that   but he never really did anything to force me to do whatever with religion.
Yes  we did have non-Jewish friends but not real good chums.
Then since there was a Catholic schools and there was so many other Jewish students in different schools.
I went to public school and also the religious school  too.
I ended up going to a Jewish school  a Orthodox school.
I had no spec ial feelings towards God or even religion  except knowing that I am Jewish.
Religion was totally not -- if you were religious  you just wouldn't even get a job.
Because one hour was for religion  and one was for general  other stuff.
I don't think it was Jewish  could be yeah  be cause of the camps  but the Christians went to the camps too  a few.
I -- I wanted to just say something about Eva and I being so inseparable and it ties in with the questions about religion that you asked before.
Inasmuch as I never was deeply involv ed in Jewish religion  it was quite pleasant  relaxing to learn about Lutheran religion.
We have famous  famous people to change their religion because they thought they going to assimilate  but its not true.
But my grandmother decided that a little religion wouldn't hurt us.
But my parents  of course were part of the Jewish community  but we were not Orthodox  we were not -- we were secular.
But it was really [indecipherable] Is -- is Christian Reformed a part of a -- the Protestant religion  or is it -- Yeah.
And  as a matter of fact  I have questions not about Judaism  but religion in general  and my faith   because of the concen ﬂ -- he knew I was in concentration camp.
But I know a lot probably more than most of the girls had Interview with Suzanne Foldes 70 known of religion.
Well when you were in the hospital and you talked to God that first time  was that... Yeah  he didn't have any religion.
They were not known as Jews  because only my father had a little bit of religion  my mother didnt.
She said  ﬁYou know Im going to miss you very mu ch but this is my country  this is my language  this is my religion  this is my pr iest.
I am German myself  of Jewish faith  and I dont have that problem.
Somehow she is there was some question about religion  and she assign me to the class  or to the time to have religious schooling  to the Catholic class  because of the Czech name.
I guess I am still struggling with where I belong but it seems like more and more I feel that I -- I feel a Jewish identity but not religion .I am less a nd less a believer.
And again being the outsider was so obvious because of religion.
And I  if I consider myself anything  I am Jewish  and Im not religious.
My parents were  I guess what was called then free thinkers and had absolutely no religious -- I mean  I don't think I ever heard them talk about God or any kind of religion.
Yes  before the war  when we were kids  the religion was so strong  they force you to do things  which you didnt even f eel like doing all those things.
And yourself  were you did you go were you s did you go to any religious classes outside of what was offered in the school  or required in in school system?
And it was Were you were you unhappy about being Jewish?
A lot of people are persecuted because of their race  religion and -- and beliefs  and -- Why did you go back to the first reunion  the Oswego reunion?
You feel like your -- your feelings about religion have changed?
But my grands on  which is the son of my daughter  and my daughter doesnt follow the religion.
They go to churches  theyre [indecipherable] Jews  or other references to Jew  although it has been removed now from the liturgy  I -- I hope that futu -- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of justice and everything  because they have one religion  or another religion.
Q. So even though yo u didn't come from a religious home  your religion sustained you?
Well  they explained antisemitism  which was a very strange concept to me  partly because I'd been brought up w ithout any religion and didn't really realize that I was Jewish until I was probably ten years old.
Jewish girls in one room with with the rabbi  and they teach us our religion  and move to another room with the priest with the other girls.
When the priest for religion lesson comes in  and by on occasion tells the Catholics they all will go to heaven  the Lutherans to purgatory  the Jews to hell.
They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the wrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy what he went over to the Catholic religion and not we.
He was much more educated in religion than the other side of the family.
Tell me the role of religion in your familys life before the anschluss.
We were the damned people  the condemned people  even though we were the -- the creators of their religion and supposedly  you know  ours was the-the-their chosen God  you know.
So sure enough he came in before a board  and they asked him what is your religion ?
I was glad that I have this Catholic religion  very good religion.
I would say that most of the people who had faith  who had religion  who tried to say certain prayers that they remembered or here and there smuggled in people a prayer book.
I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews  but not as bad as people reared in the religion  religious  in the Catholic religion and so forth.
I feel like a -- the -- only our religion has meaning  you know?
It was strictly boys  without girls  and it was strictly influenced by religion  so it was a boys' religion type of school; if you wish to call it parochial  would be in place.
In fact  my family used to say that is the highest form of religion  scie nce and achievement.
And religion to me wasnt something that I had a need for  and I still dont [indecipherable].
People ascribed so me very specific rationale  logical reasons for why the Germans were doing these things as opposed to just pure spite or hatred or some manifestation of a pagan religion that made it necessary to kill all the Jews.
Now  we dont want to make the Holocaust  you know  sort of a religion of life now because I think thats a ne thats very negative.
And if you go on to take off barriers one by one  officially as permissible  you take the balance off Jewish religion.
Ljudevit is in the pictur e. So even though they weren't married -- >> Bill Benson: And he was a different religion.
I know that I was Jewish because we had the -- my friend was Jew -- friend of my father was Jewish.
And the Soviets have replaced it with their own kind of religion  their ideology.
Do you have any sense whether some of these Jewish families could in any way practice their religion?
Actually  we had changed religion twice  just to get out  but we never -- to us it was just a piece of paper.
Well  I never denied that I was Jewish  my Jewish identity.
I didnt have much religion all during the war and after the war  oh God  I was bitter.
because I had a Jewish you know  I had the Hebrew school and at the school and thats it.
In Polish  I went to the Polish Joseph Elman 4 [date] Page 4 school  because of anti -semitism  I can recall  for instance  when there was a religion class  now we didnt have  you know  the Jews were out of the class because there werent  I would say  maybe 80 percent Christians to 85  another percentage.
We had a good talk  and religion at that time was so frowned upon.
There is a letter designat...on the top  designating your blood type; and on the bottom  there is a letter designating your religion.
When our son turned 13  and we lived in New York at that time  we did not what we did was  we sent him to be tutored by a Yiddish poet  who tutored kids  and dealt with everything Jewish  except for religion: history  music  culture  etcetera.
Did your parents teach you  you said they were very educated in Jewish history and things like that  did they teach that to you?
We talked about our dates  but we didnt talk about religion.
So  was religion main ly only recognized in your h ousehold on holidays  or . . .
Again  to put it in a nutshell  religion is part of our inheritance.
There are certain restrictions in the Jewish religions too and you have to obey certain  certain laws but its not as harsh as the  as the Catholic religion.
Interview with Eric Simon June 21  2014 27 Were the classes at the I mean  was it very visible and and obvious when you would go for those religion classes  or were they held at the same time as They were held at the same time and it was probably not that obvious  but I fel I wa self-conscious about it.
I dont know whether that has anything to do with the religion  I am Bat Mitzvah  or it was jealousy.
I dont need  go on So I enrolled at Marquette University which is a Jesuit school and there I was again back to my  wi th was my Catholic associates and then having visited all my prayers and through all of them my study on the historicities of the Gospels and went through all of the Gospel teachings which gave me some insight into the nature of that religion.
I will do anything for the Jewish people  for the Jewish religion.
Finally  we are free  and we're free to practice our religion.
I always say it wasn't mine  but it is a beautiful religion.
On the other hand  there were others who held on to religion saying  thinking  that religion presented the unity of all man  in the eyes of God we are all his children no matter what we believe.
So much for what we believe religion is and what is a true religion.
What about religion  was that outlawed or did people continue going to synagogue?
They imported a teacher from Warsaw  a young man w ho taught us boys and girls Modern Hebrew and religion with it.
I know that many people who held on to religion  religion represents the nobility  the goodness in us.
Now  how was the -- I was -- you know  I'm Jewish.
I ended up going to a Jewish school  a Orthodox school.
There was extermination of Poles and of Jews  but this was not a sort of a total extermination of race or religion of people who belonged to the race or to the religion.
And their religion was Jewish like somebody elses was Catholic or so on.
You then finished -- this was the Jewish Institute of Religion?
Every city had a city hall and when you were born your religion was put on your birth certificat e. And it was very easy fo r the Germans to look at the birth certificate and see  because that was there.
And there were quite a few Jewish family who were very  very Orthodox.
Did you ever practice any Jewish traditions or any of the Jewish religion as you were going through all of this?
And what about your Jewish religion as far as involvement in a synagogue or observance of holidays?
I went to Hebrew schools though  I learned Hebrew -- Oh  you did? --
Did you -- and -- and did you feel very Jewish?
And the teams were totally mixed  and nobody knew who was what religion.
Now  I -- I met them later in the schools  yes  but they have some difficulties  because they -- they were Jewish by religion.
I knew that who -- I cannot change my religion and I -- I was born Jewish  I have to be Jewish.
I listen about Hebrew but I -- my 39father wanted me to teach Hebrew.
And I have to admit  I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy Carter ran  one thing I didnt like about him is because of his religion  because he was a born again.
I told him one day  ﬁI think yo u are a Buddhist.ﬂ And he said  ﬁWhy?ﬂ I say  ﬁBecause Buddhist is not a religion  it is a way of life.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 7 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: my family spoke fluently German  they never asked us about our religion.
What about  do you think of Judaism as a– when you say its important to you to be Jewish  is it as a religion?
And I thought the most important thing was to save the children rather than save the religion.
But my parents lived within this Jewish -- German Jewish community.
And th ats the way I want to live  and maybe thats my religion.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
We were never discussing religion or the influence on -- we were just friends.
And all religion had -- we had the   who was like a bishop.
I -- I believe in -- in free will  you see  and -- and so when I bak -- was in America and I became old enough to appreciate the philosophical un-underpinnings of religion  I rather liked where I came from  you see  and I was happy with the way I was and Im happy the way I am.
Whereas I was never a child who had great notions of -- of God and -- and so forth  I had -- religion made me uncomfortab le  and I just wasnt very keen on it.
When people ask me what kind of religion I am  I say ﬁIm born Jewﬂ and there is no probl em.
Tell me about her family and background and religion and so on.
I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a set of ideas which I practice  and its -- I -- Im not that comfortable in praying because the prayers to me are -- have a great depth  but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to.
Throughout all of this pe riod of time  was religion important to you at all?
Other than this  I didn't care because I was going to their schools and they were learning about their religion and everything.
The first classification was: were you a working man  or were you a capitalist  or so-called ﬁbourgeois.ﬂ Second  they also  on your passport which they gave you  besides your social status  if you were a working man or not  they listed your religion.
We used to go to the grandparents  to -- to my mother side  because they were the one who -- who kept the -- the religion at home.
Of the family  of the ethical  moral upbringing of the behavior and of the sense of obligation to society and to myself and I always said that  if people ask me about religion I said I -- I am not very organized in religion  but if I obey the commandments  Im religious.
I was aware and I was brought up this way  and I felt Jewish and I -- I was not religious observant  but I knew I was Jewish.
I mean  he was sort of Jewish all his life  but he actually had the had two religion  or was religious.
My father was married only in the Jewish religion to my mother  so that the um Justice of the Peace never rec ognized the marriage.
Did you go to a  was the day school a Jewish school or were there Christians No  was a regular school.
I would come to them not a problem and not as far as religion was concerned or anything else  no  not at all.
My mother told me that once a woman came to her and said  I dont want my child to be in a religion class.
And I really never knew how much he knew as far as religion is concerned.
And its just shows how unstable -- and I like to s ay about religion  I like to misquote the priest Savonarola who was sort of a radical priest in Florence and who burned peo ple at the stake if they werent doing t he right thing.
Oh  no we helped everybody who was in need of help  and we didn't ask what religion they were  we just helped them.
That is when it really hit me that I was not just a German of the Jewish religion.
However  you know  I was six or seven years of age and religion in those days didn't mean anything at all to me.
So I remember we had a Hebrew teacher coming to the house  teaching us Hebrew and religion.
It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion.
The Jewish community at that time  of course they didn't have the same kind of privileges  officially uh under Austra-Hungary it was of course if somebody would change his religion  they could become in the military a general or something like that  but the religion was quite important.
It was the Fourth of July  which made it easy for him to preach  because Fourth of July is no religion.
In Poland  this was unusual  because in Poland  Poland at that particular time  strictly Jewish people were circumcised  that is a part of religion.
But this difference that  you know  my predecessors had the fear of religion  you know.
Your faith  your religion  your job  your whatever you were  your age.
I think my moth er wanted me to -- maybe I di dnt talk about it but I didnt have any religion to replace it.
If I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not?
We were just talking about how -- what your familys religion was before the war.
So they were somewhat familiar about the history of the Jews in that area  and they had studied about the they had sort of a course on comparative religion  so theyd study something about the Jewish religion as well.
I always felt very comfortably living side by side with people of all religion and all national origins.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Life had a big change because religion was kind of shunned.
It was just there to serve the people and to unite them under the umbrella of religion.
But we're not -- we had a Jew ish religion and not the Jewish -- we had the faith but not the -- I guess the ethnic grouping  which is fairly typical of the German and Hungarian Jews of the middle class.
how could he -- He came to -- to find out what is -- how -- how religion is teaching in our school -- is -- is taught in our school.
I want to say here that we never knew exactly how many Jews were in Belgium because people were not registered as to their race  religion  creed or anything else.
The whole time you were in the mountains  you probably didnt think of religion.
So in my heart Im totally Jewish  Im just religious wise  Im not.
The reason is  I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people.

This is what I go  its nothing to do -- as far as Im concerned its nothing to do with religion  because I sit down and I think of my family and what happened to them  and of course my grandparents were very religious  so I owe them that  you know.
We have to remember United State is based on the free willing of religion.

So your school was Jewish   where you went to school?
But in our religion everybody is responsible of their own actio ns.

I went to public school and also the religious school  too.
So my expectation  to have a world of such ideals  history proves that it never happened  and I dont care to what denomination they belong  or to what religion they adopted.

We have Italians with a different religion.ﬂ This what they approved the Jew  a different religion.
Yeah I am born Jewish and I respect that and I honor it  but I am not a traditional person  not religious.
But what's interesting is that they were religious  Orthodox Jews  and I knew absolutely nothing -- I knew I was Jewish.

So you were really on your own all of that time ; hence there was no structure for religion  there was no structure -- I mean  you just sort of had to raise yourself.
And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a week where we had religion.
But there wasnt very much interest and so  so I think those grandchildren really dont know anything about religion.

[end of side one  tape three] What we were  you know  I was just asking you about Israel a nd you... Let me ask you  I mean clearly your religion has always been important to you.
Speaking of religion  was reli gion a really important part of your life  up until that point?
Everything  whatever the rabbi said  things like this  had to be from the religion.
I -- how -- you know  its wa -- I -- I knew I was Jewish.

No  I felt very much that I was Jewish but it's strange  my fami ly was not a religious family at all.
No  I was very curious to learn this Catholic religion  it was very soothing to me  I like the miracles and as I told to you  I eliminated the thought of my parents from my mind and I did not remember if my parents were religious or not  I don't remember any of that.

I went to the French university for admission  speaking in European French and having to answer -- one of the first questions was what religion are you?
Well  I -- we were just talking a little bit off tape about your experience in coming to the -- to the U.S. and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about that again  about the religion question.

And we were brought up religious as I said earlier and I had some  not long  it was a very short period after the war that I thought maybe it be better to just throw up any sign of religion  just live as a human being  period.
So it was fun more than religion because I didn't know that I really should be.

So  unless it is a -- a global religion  one that recognizes the right of man  human beings  man [indecipherable].
I think that's -- and my father was very religious but he also had many doubts about religion and that's another way where I think he's very modern.

Throughout all of these horrible experiences that you went through  do you think that your religion helped give you the strength to keep going?
The Displaced Persons Act had fairly stringent restrictions on Nazi collaborators  those who assisted in persecution on the basis of race  religion and nati onal origin  from entering the United States.
When you -- When you were in this hous e  with these people that youd never met before and theyre not from your background  and theyre not from your religion or whatever  but they -- did you realize at the time how much of a risk they were taking to -- Oh  I knew that  yeah  hundred percent  yeah  I knew that if somebody was going to come  that th-the man would most likely be killed  and the son  who was 16 or so at that time  would have had a hard time  too  and maybe the whole fa mily.
So  my religion woul d be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being.
And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is  in  in Europe.

But it has nothing to do with color  or religion  or the shape of your eyes  or your skin color  or your hair color  or anything else.

And maybe not by choice  but I was made to feel Jewish.
We went to an all girl's school in Poland  wh ere we were a product of the Polish education  where patriotism and religion is ve ry closely related  where bravery and chivalry is a part of us  and were also a product of the parallel Jewish culture that celebrated the holidays.
Another question  when we've changed take place  is were you able to practice your religion at all during the ghetto?
We would do the same  but there was neve r any talk of any religion or anything.
Only  as I said  the religion had no part in it.
Not that I think about it every day  but its a very attractive religion  I think.
And especially through teachers whom I had there in the Jewish religious school.
I would not  never as a youngster  eat what I was not allowed to eat for the religious reason.
But he was such a sadist  and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told you before he spoke Polish.
But there were some units whose raison detre was involved in persecuting people in the basis of race  religion  national origin and political opinion.
I think the Holocaust must be remembered  of course  but not as a -- in the sense of a religion  but in the sense that we  first of all should remember alwa ys  just like we remember other events in our history  going back to Masada  to the destruction of the two temples and so on and also to learn from it.
Youve got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that theyre damned and theyre gonna go to hell and theyre  they suck the blood of Christian children.
I said  ﬁWe are so religious  and in our religion  we're not allowed to --ﬂ You know  because he said  ﬁWell  I give you a -- you ha - you have to use something.ﬂ I said  ﬁIn our religion ﬂ I said  ﬁwe can't use something.ﬂ He said  ﬁSo you want to kill yourself?ﬂ I said  ﬁIt's up to God.ﬂ I -- all of a sudden I became a God's person.
Maybe we can sort of -- Yes -- -- come back to that later  because I do want to ask you to -- they also asked you what your religion was?
So then you started this Jewish school with the other Jewish students?
My father taught religion  you know  whatever religion I have -- had.
It -- it -- it was -- it was forced on -- onto us by -- by -- by politics  to be closer to -- to your -- to your religion than you really were.
When you were at this school  the elementary school with Jewish students  Jewish and Christian students?
We discussed history with the chaplains and I began to find my religion -- not that I was ever religious  but I began to find out a little bit about Judaism at that time.
I havent heard of anybody else   but its certainly something permitted in the Jewish religion.
You had to register with the local police station and you had to give your religion on that thing.
One thing that she alwa ys tells me she appreciates in the Jewish religion is that it counts what you do not what you feel.
All of the festivals are obser ved  every -- I mean  yeah they -- they -- the Orthodox inmates were totally immersed in -- in their religion.
And he  when there was a nun  when he taught the Catholic religion  we were permitted to leave  you know  the classes.
But  you know  when this happen  that Herman told me he had to leave  and thats where my religion and Heins religion came out in the first place.
Yeah  mm-hm And before the war  could you say something about what your religion was for you and what about after the war Yeah  yeah.
We ar e brought up this way and I like the religion and I want to be  I want to remain this.
It was my teacher  you know  religion teacher  the officiant .
And I remember I had the sense of abandoning one's religion under duress and that that was not right at age 15.
I reme mber the first incident at school where I didnt even notice it  but my father immediately did  where we handed little forms indicating what religion we were  you know?
I mean  I personally stayed away from any arguments about religion or any of that -- or politics.
And of co urse  I feel very good about the Christian religion  because remember  Jesus sta -- was as a Jew.
And as I was thinking about them always  you know  I got back my religion.
I dont know what religion it [indecipherable] and I dont care.
So religion as such never played a big role but we cele- brated holidays in the traditional way.
They were and in a Jewish community and you know how it is.
From the little I know about the Jewish religion  Je wish people  when they die  its finished.
The first thing was to identify the Jews  although they ar -- physically identify  and physically and visibly identify  because they had at the police records they had all the Jews  because at the time you had to give your religion -- I dont know for whatever purpose  but to -- at the police station your registration was your religion known.
And I knew all the the whole religion  Polish religion  Polish Christmas songs.
Even though you -- you did not observe the religion  did you stay very connected in your identity  to Judaism?
I did have though one in the very early stages when I first started to go to school and they had these Catholic priests teach us the religion.
Now  on the other day there was a phone call there that anyone who is not into Jewish religion will be saved.
And I think much learned people still have the same question today when it comes to religion.
Then came the announcement that anyone who not having the Jewish religion can be saved.
You said that when they asked your religion  you said Mojsze.
I went...from the time on I went to school  I had religion in school.
I didn't have any knowledge about the Jewish religion but it didn't matter.
He always felt that priests and ministers and rabbis were all the same breed and organized religion was hell  and he didn't want to have anything to do with it.
Did the Jewish children in your class go with you to the same Jewish school.
Was it typical for most of Poland  or was this more in Lodz that -- that the schools were segregated by sex and religion?
When I got to Auschwitz I still had belief in religion  a belief in God  but I soon lost that.
Have you di-did you become more religious because of your experience during the war?
Let's just back up a little bit to the food  and also tell me how she respected your mother's religion.
To me it took a long time to come back  but to a lot of people that were very religious and they had religion going on.
Whereas in Poland  because living conditions in Poland said these are not [indecipherable] Jews  or whatever  theyre different.
For whatever its worth  the cantor of the day was not a recognized minister of religion  the rabbi was.
My father was not  you know  from what what she told me  he he was not religious.
We maintained a kosher home  and we -- the edu cation was such in Yugoslavia  that the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 6 primary subject in the public school was religion.
And were your parents active in Jewish community affairs that you knew of?
And the other time I was very uncomfortable is  they taught religion in school.
And that the state -- the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 38 state has to be separation of religion and th-the poli -- you know  I think the politics in itself.
I -- there were no questions for children about religion  as far as I know.
Theres no single group in the United States that is a majority  except by religion  maybe.
Were there -- So he was accepted in the society as one of those volunteer fighters for Lithuanian independence  without any attachme nt of religion.
Even though my father  when we lived in a place where there was a lot of Jewish people  he would teach them Hebrew.
So you see  the difference is  from where -- would I come from a very  very poor home  that we suffered  or from a home that we never believed in religion  I would embrace Communism  because this would be my dream.
My my mother kept a kosher ho me and as they have told me that during the Hitler years they became more involved with religion than th ey had been before because they were s ostracized by the German community and therefore drew closer to the Jewish community and there was sort of a a renaissance of religion during that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that.
You know  not entirely necessarily -- I -- you know  you can have your little foibles  but I guess -- I ge -- I mean  that bothers me  it doesnt bother me only about Judais m  it bothers me about every religion.
SL: Listen  the religion the -- hala -- its -- its not just the -- the only thing a Bar Mitzvah is  if you go before the Torah and they present you and you -- an-and you become a man.
On top of which  the Soviets di d their share of indoctrinating us 36 that religion is the opium of the people  if you have heard this expression.
T oday  theyre fighting over other things  religion  in other parts of the world.
Was this -- was your school a Jewish school  or both Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty?
I mean  it's not  it's not  it hasn't anything to do about religion.
All the Pols were Catholic  but -- there was no separation of state and religion like we have in the United States.
The other one here is more Jewish  and Im proud of them  but You see  religion has played a very small part in their lives  the kids lives.
But we never expressed -- we never talked about our experience.
So they came  everybody was gathering around  we ha -- an d they thought it was a miracle  you know  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 22how Jewish people always think of a miracl e. I mean  most probably other people  of other religion and so on will -- will kind of asso ciate something like that with a miracle.
And again that was a fairly typical attitude on the part of German Jews at that time.
How important through all of th is  has your religion been?
The first time I had experience in this respect was when I was enrolled into primary school and religion was compulsory.
Just like so many Jewish families be fore the war  religio n was not -- all our friends -- religion was not an important -- well  we -- young people would be -- yes -- respect it  but we would get gifts at Christmas.
Did you feel that you were able to really become Jewish or did you feel that that was just a side consequence of your marriage?
And there was a rabbi -- I remember vividly  there were teachers.
I old man  you know  80 years old  but th -- still I do not understand w hy is this dividing between this -- this -- you know  religion.
I want them to go back to a good Jewish family  that's fine  but I don't want them to go to a sterile  although Jewish  environment where they will not teach them religion  or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to practice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so.
And I think that sort of turned them more against religion than anyt hing else did.
We had many  many nationalities  and foreigners as far from Sweden   Scotland   Spain   tracking down  looking for freedom of location to live  education  religion  and and speech.
Under the Communist system nobody was paying much attention to religion of any kind.
So  th-this is the -- the greatest danger is when religion -- when somebody thinks that he repr esents the right religion and the others -- oth-others do not.
And it -- I dont know why  whether its because Im now the oldest  were a much closer relationship  although we never discussed religion  you see.
So  at this point  you dont have a -- a strong sense of -- of faith  or -- Religion? --
Was religion important to you at all during this period  psychologically?
He was really not very interested in  not only in the Jewish religion  but on any religion.
And I was Bar Mitzvah  but I wasnt brought up religious.
So I feel consciously very  very Jewish  but I have no problem in de aling with non-Jews.
But  the other people who were not in our church  we didn't ask them what they did or where they went or what  and you know  if they had no religion at all  so what  that was fine  you know.
And when the religion class was over  all the boys just walked up and say ﬁYou killed Jesus ﬂ and start to beat up on us.
That was my upbringing in Religion if you will  uh from the age of about uh 10/11 years old uh thereabouts 12 years old.
But it was a Jewish school with Jewish children and Jewish teachers?
Now  while you were in the commando  did you still  in your own personal and private way  was religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?
And the priest apparently was very smart  because he told me that -- that religion -- God is for all -- End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0028 15 This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg.
I call it nationality  not just a religion but -- because anybody ha -- can have a religion  but nationality  its one.
As I told you  that I dont believe any more in this traditional religion  because when I crawled between the legs to the synagogue why?
They wouldn't put me through because I di dn't have a grade for religion.
Actually in my classroom  I had many Jewish friends that especially Thursdays were the days when they were teaching us religion; history of the Catholic churches  or at that time the the Jewish minority was excused  they could take a walk into the park  play soccer  or whatever. [
He might have been Jewish but he  at this time he was Catholic.
But -- and his wife  my grandmother had the same attitude  but it doesn t mean that they were hiding the fact that they were Jews  they were not at all hiding  but they just didnt believe in organized religion.
How did you impart Jewish tradition  or Jewish culture to your children  when they were growing up?
He got married with a German girl  in Germany  not Jewish.
Yeah  that a Š my first clash  so to speak  with the reality of being slightly different from the other children in the public school which I attended when  in the second grade  2 we started having so called religion lessons  verouchenie1 in Bulgarian ﬁstudy of the faith ﬂ which I had to attend  or at least I thought that I had to attend.
And actually  you know  I was raised Catholic  but we discussed it in religion class.
I was also told that I was going to be taught religion and that my name would be changed to Susanne Ledon  and this was name that I would... that I can only answer by.
Im -- Im respectful of people who are true believers and who honestly observe religion  but I cannot bring myself to be a true believer  not after what I have experienced.
We had to move out for no other reason that your religion was not acceptable to the Christian people who lived in the building.
Mind you  my parents were not practicing religion even though they were raised as Jews and my father went to the school for the boys  etc.
A. You know something  people always ask me do you think Judaism is a religion or is it a race.
They were very  you know -- kept their religion very close  and they wouldn't eat what I brought  because it wasn't kosher.
So I was being at my very vulnerable stage  I was being exposed to the opposite side of religion.
If in your mind you have the question  How did they know you were Jewish?
And he said he asked me the question  so if you are Jewish  where is the what is the highest holiday in our religion?
I  maybe it did  maybe I did  but we never talked ab out religious  about religion.
But because we were not religious  and I never went to temple  I dont know if how I probab ly was able to relate that to religion  I dont know.
And so I wasnt so worried  because being from Poland and having heard that you should not marry out of your religion even if youre not religious  I figured he couldnt call me a dirty Jew anyway  because he was one  technically anyway.
Te ll me  i-if you can  were they all pretty similar in background  all pretty similar in religion?
Was it mostly pretending or -- Halina Pea body: It was pretending  but I must say I like Catholic religion and my mother realized that.
Those -- the Germans needed it  so they release I dont know how many people  three  400 people of different religion  Polish  an-and -- and Jewish  and whatever it is  it did not make any difference at that time  but only the ones that signed up for it.
Now  he was -- if Jesus wouldnt be made now  the religion was made 200 years later they started to write.
This goes on in the U. S. air force or Jewish religion everywhere else.
And I was Bar Mitzvah  but I wasnt brought up religious.
So I ended up by trying to work for every person to be free to practice their religion  or political belief  or ethnic pride  or what have you.
Unfortunately part of being the daughter of a rabbi is that you see too much of the congregation and I got really turned off by institutional religion.
And w-we have as a family  and as -- and my husband and I personally  have made big commitments to IRC  the International Rescue Committee  which seems in a major way to be helping refugees without any respect to what their country or their nationa -- their nationality or their religion is  but going to those places in the world where people are desperate  where people are suffering because of whats going on  whether its internal or external strife  and so on.
By the way this relationship with religion didn't last for long because my grandfather of course was very religious  he was also a small bearded fellow  my father didn't of course  he shaved and he was observant but not orthodox and the third generation intermarried 14 and in a few cases were not Jews or became non -observant.
We discu ssed religion  but we never argued it  and in my opinion uh here's the whole thing about religion.
And now I want to tell you  I believe that every religion is good as long it doesn't say about killing othe r ones  to preach for that killing other nations or killing the Jews and so far and so on  or hate him.
Because its  I think religion has been used to  to control and to perpetuate  perpetuate this control.
Did you know any Jewish people when you were growing up?
No  of course its modified  but I never broke with the religion.
I happen to be -- I ha -- happen to have Jewish parents  therefore I was Jewish.
It was a Catholic school  but at the school they was no difference between Jewish  (Greek) Orthodox  or any other religion  and we all grew up together.
I think people in the church appreciated  I mean were respectful of the Jewi sh community and that religion.
Almost at the end  I found out that he also was Jewish.
I went to a Jewish or Hebrew school to start with.
Religion manifested itself in terms of the behavior of the people as they related to the faith prior to their coming into the camp and uh  whatever the camp uh would uh allow them.
But they would have to pass religion to pass to the next grade.
But there was no church now  the religion was forbidden  officially.
And -- and -- and -- and we were going -- Jewish kids and non-Jewi sh kids and Protestant kids   we were all together  we couldnt care less about religion  o-or wherev er they were coming from.
As long as you were Jewish and your parents were Jewish  that's it  you know.
And the thing that annoyed me  I remember this very clearly is that you know school normally started at eight  but because we did not go to the Jewish religion classes but went to special classes for Christian  there were other Christian children there.
But that they just come right out and say  Im German  Jewish is my religion.
My grandfather  for example  served as a teacher of religion  as a translator and so on  even in the public school and in courts.
Did religion have a real role for you at that time?
I had a teacher come to my home teaching me religion  Torah  you know  Hum-ish   all the biblical stories and so on.
I felt badly later on  because she answered  in every nationality and every religion are different kind of people.
Everybody sh ould grow up with a religion  and have a 34 belief  believe in something.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
Well  I tell you  I grew up  of course  si nce since we seemed to be more on my fathers religion  I went to confirmation class  I was confirmed in the German Reform church.
And the whole family was very religious  so I was not brought up to be against religion  or to hate people who have money or make a living.
And on the other hand  when it comes to pure religion and observance  Im more observant than my mother.
They more associated the real Germans with the Lutherans  because their religion  the songs  the everything is Germ an  yeah.
So religion wasn't that important to you while you were hiding out?
Would there be any way in which you would observe Jewish holidays or any religious services at all?
I -- Im wondering what kind of affect the -- the war experience had on your faith  and on -- on your spiritual outlook.
Q. What about activities in the Ghetto  cultural activities  religion  your father's political -- A. All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out that you couldn't do  you couldn't do things  you know  you were lucky.
My birth and where I was born  and everything else except my name and my religion.
Well  my parents were not rel -- they were Jews  but not fanatical -- not religious.
It was a Greek  a Greek Orthodox religion was prevailing and he was a Greek Orthodox priest.
During this -- all of this time being in the ghetto  were -- was your family able to observe any Jewish traditions  any of the holidays in any way?
Because what was going on town and these pograms and attacks on Jewish  there was no reason to be religious because  you know  a religion is a wonderful thing when you're comfortable and everything goes the way  but if things don't go your way  and you're being murdered for no reason at all.
Tell me -- tell me a little bit about -- about your fe -- your family  in regard to the - the climate in the house  about the way things were done in the house  about the religion  about the ethics.
32 And that degenerate religion and -- and all of those things that -- that were so much a part of our Sunday school teaching  our church teaching.
There was a couple in their 30s from Germany who were married under German rule  but not under the Jewish religion .
I knew the Christian religion very well  so I came and she take me to an old age home.
I dont know  but I know they were well educated in Jewish.
Crimes Against Humanity  that humankind has a right to be protected from th is kind of slaughter and abuse simply because of your race or religion.
When they put you in a Jewish school  were you taught religion?
And I treasure people who are able to see human beings as human beings regardless of the color and religion and whatever.
No  I wont say that  its just that my father was not what you would call a religious person to discuss religion.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
But all of the accusations  one of the accusations was that not respecting the Christian religion.
There was a municipal doctor  which meant he had an enormous territory to travel so it wasn't wise to have  to revive old world animosities of religion  race  color or creed.
So I was Jew by religion  but it was not part of my personality.
In school ra -- we had religion as a mandatory subject  and Jewish children would step out and go to a separate classroom -- Yes. --
But th at was the only time  and I -- I knew if anybody made any comments about Jews or religion or anything of that sort  I fought back  because I was proud to be a Jew and -- and I didnt hide it either.
The state should have nothing to do with religion  therefore they had their own church  built their own church and had their own priest.
Co mment: bench to bless (Hebrew)]me  you know  ﬁMalke le  du kenst alles machen.ﬂ 17 For life  you can violate all the regulations  Jewish religion or no religion .
I could not talk before they know that I was Jewish.
As a Jew  I -- I feel Israel is my home  but this is my country  where I live  that I love.
My parents wrote to the nuns in Rochdale  and said to them that they should please not try to change my religion because my religion would be very important to me  and my parents begged them to honor my background.
She also was a I dont know  she was a very good Jew; the only one in that family.
I  like I say to a lot of Jew  Im Jewish by tradition.
So I went there with a flashlight looking for the newspaper and looking for a number and finally I called the number and they said  \  What religion do you have?\
>> Sylvia Rozines: When I was a little girl   I didn't know much about religion because the ghetto was almost six years.
And there were beliefs different of different peopl e. Some people who survived the concentration camp  who's family was very observant  very relig ion  a lot of those people turned away from God and they didn't want to know anything about religion.
SL: I believe if you are a good human bei ng  you have a good heart  you dont harm nobody  you help people when theyre in need  thats the most important religion.
But but we we believe that were Jewish  but were not fanatically Jewish.
But even in the school when we went the first time and I was in the public school  so it was always that the -- but in Poland the people were very religious and when its coming the time to religion -- we don't have to -- but I went out  out from the classroom  and so after ﬁJew  Jew  Jew ﬂ and if they couldn't  they beat us because look  we was just couple youngsters.
The religion was not used in that particular village to antagonize anyone.
I was lucky  because I was totally Jewish because -- well  almost totally Jewish  because I have a Jewish father.
I think that some of the abuses in the world have been committed in the name of religion.
Matter of fact  my father hated anything that smacked of religion.
Some of them turned out to have no religion at all.
I went to a private Jewish school  because my parents believed in  uh  a Jewish education--but secular  not religious.
And then I had a course in the temple for Hebrew.
I dont think it was too much  I hope it was more  but as far as I am concerned  He helps me  He exists  and [indecipherable] all the commandments I tried to follow  the si -- the rich words of our religion.
I don't have to be very  very religious but it's still better than any other religion that sided against it.
You have to stick to your ethics  to what you learned as a whether it was only in school  or it was only in religion  or also only from watching your parents  wa tching the people I I c onsider myself lucky that even in Africa in the high school  we had extremely good people  honorable people  Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 143who were thinking along the lines that I was thinking  not carpe diem type of thing Yeah.
How significant was or is your religion in all of this?
They told me how much they loved me  and I have all kinds of letters from th em  how much I meant to them  a nd they wanted to have a child of their own  but I would have to be of their religion and they fou -- noticed that they could never change my religion  I was probably too old and t oo strong for that already.
Many of them didnt practice any religion particularly  and when it came to intermarriage  all of us were independent enough to say if I want marry an Eskimo  I will.
But later  I remember shefor me was not kosher  nonkosher  but I soimmediately after the war I became skeptical about religion immediately.
His wife told him that if he really believes in Judaism and Jews and a Jewish religion and the fact he's wrestling with where I came from and what I went through  that she'll be happy to bring their kids up as Jewish and he's wrestling with it whether he should or should not.
I mean  up in the 20th century  people kill each other for religion in Ireland.
You had maybe a different religion  a different way of life.
As far as my religion is now  in the United States  it's much easier not to be Orthodox.
My family  my parents and I  I was the only child were consider ed Jewish even though we did not practice the religion  and know I had my grandparents and I am told  my great-grandparents.
And then  in this camp in Oswego  well  we had the opportunity to practice our religion.
I-I think even my grandparents  my paternal grandparents  who were Jewish  I dont think they practiced their religion either  which was not unusual for a lot of German Jews.
I mean  it doesnt matter where an ybody comes from  what religion  or what they like to call race.
And both your parents were -- were Jewish  and brought you up in -- practicing a sort of Orthodox Jewish faith.
We could pr actice religion  we were  we coul d  the temples were open.
She she brought us up in a Catholic religion  and yes  I attended mass every day  beca Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 28 Every day  even?
So there is some -- I think it is more -- my Jewishness is more connected to tradition  and to the Jewish people  rather than to religion.
No  we never talked about that   we never talked about religion  we never talked about praying.
I -- Im not -- I dont have -- Im a very -- like a very practical person  and I dont really have religion to fall back on.
Interviewer: Yeah and I would think that they would have known-- Emmi Lehner: I tell you frankly when my husband decided right away to leave because he had a Jewish father and he was brought up in the Jewish religion.
A couple of Jewish officers from Detr oit  but everybody kept their composure and even though they were Jewish religion.
Not confidence  but you know  I dying for a religion is one thing  okay  but young people  young men who oh  there were some [indecipherable] I mean  theres no question about that  but the very religious ones  under the pressure of their parents  they would never do it.
Some of our relatives  my s ister married an Orthodox man and her children are very  quite Orthodox.
They were raised with the fathers telling them about the inquisition of burning of their ancestors -- our ancestors never had a chance to enjoy their religion.
You know  there is I mean  German Jews considered themselves German.

I had one hour of religion  and one hour of general studies.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings w/AVRAHAM TORY page 31 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AT: The Germans said to the Jewish committee  you will not expect that we correspond with you in writing.
By and large  I think  I didn't know anything about Judaism at all.
But what's interesting is that they were religious  Orthodox Jews  and I knew absolutely nothing -- I knew I was Jewish.
So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith.
But my grandson studied the Jewish story  I mean the difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said  ﬁBut sometime they are racist between–ﬂ And I said  ﬁYes  I know.ﬂ I think if you put two men with no religion on an island  theres going to be racism  because man is stupid.
If they wa nt to find religion  if later in their lives they turn toward religion  as a lot of people do  so be it  yo u know  but I I have no no problem with that.
He and my sister got into religion  a nd I dont know why  but which is not where Interview with J udith Heimann November 21  2011 40I got.
I went to school  separate religious school to learn to read in Hebrew from the Bible.
My grandma  in the meantime  who was with us  my father's mother  she was very ill  and in the Jewish religion  and I think in Muslim also  it's customary to wear white.
And so it was not that we were outside of the religion  we were just not very active in the religion.
Did you learn what were some of the things that you were learning in Hebrew school?
But  I mean  I became agnostic because I -- I c -- I couldnt accept the reality of a -- a -- an organized religion that  you know  of a God.
But it - somehow it was that Jews were mostly socializing with Jews and it was also  you know  they did not care too much for education  where we are very education minded.
And my argument  it is the ol dest religion  look how many year s  5 000 plus years  da da da da  we gave the Bible  we got Moses and -- a nd her was again about Jesus and so on  and so on.
Every human life is sacred in my -- and I deeply believe in that  thats my -- thats my religion  as it were.
For keeping on  for wanting to practic e our religion  for wanting to live.
Interview with Eva Desrosiers 69 Well  through all of these moves  at whatever level of identification you were with your religion or culture?
Oh  as I said  my father was not a religious man  but he was a Jew.
And so I didn't know anything about the religion of my ancestors.
In my situation  my family took me out of there because of the religion.
It is a very tolerant religion  built on faith  and the light that shines on everyone.
And he is the author not only of great works and the reinterpretation of Kant  but also of religious philosophy  of work in religious philosophy  based on the sources of Judaism  \ die Religion der Vernunft.\
But we were not I we were not very religious  no.
And it was -- I mea n  I would have never changed my religion  or you know  never given it a thought  no.
I am not observant  but I also dont preach against religion.
So even that the Catholics have something from the older Jewish religions  it was not ant anti Jewish at all like its itself  it was a discussion of the relationship of the Jewish religion and the Catholic religion well  Christian religion  which really split off from from the Judaism  and why did they split off  and well  of course they then the the person of Jesus of Nazareth comes into that.
No  they were very religious people content with their religion and environment  very fanatic to speak of.
You su ffered so much  I understand  why don't you become a Cat holic and you won't have every to suffer from religion.
They were taught religion by a rabbi and I was taught religion by pastor.
It was the only the only wish  that once it will come that we can be together and practice our religion openly without any persecutions  without any difficulties.
DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 37 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Was religion a form of resistance?
Its not the religion that is so bad  its the people are so bad.
So by going to services  Jewish religion  the holidays  and religious school to some degree.
Fo r that matter I wouldnt know what their religion was.
Chr-Christian  the Christian religion  because they will dominate -- but I mean  the split -- the split  you know  theres Catholics and Protestant.
We formed a very close circle of friends  none of us were non-Jewish -- strictly by religion.
What made me very interested in USHMM Archives RG -50.030*370 4 religion  I was 11 or 12 and I had to go  let's say  into the school where you either go to university to stay in a trade school or you could get a girl's education.
Prevailing religion in Split  was of course  Roman Catholicism  and -- but they also had a few  I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox  or Eastern Orthodox  but prevailing Serbs.
He didnt believe  so he started again about Jewish religion  and -- and custom  and then he aske d me [inaudible] about the very sacred day in our Jewish life  Yom Kippur  the big atonement day that every Jew knows  and he asked me what we say on Yom Kippur.
And you know  I remember even such a joke  which shows you also where we had a -- it was obligatory to have a exa-examination religion.
He was the father of Rebecca Konigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion.
We try to help everyone with no interest but the other religion is just --.
And one day  they had a sort o f a little feast for us where there came a couple of ministers -- I forget of what religion.
I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists  because after all  we Jews are religion rather than a nationality  and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality.
You know they were Jewish but they understood the need for se cular government and not to have religion be the one that ran the government.
I -- What happened to my mother shouldnt have happened if religion was supposed to be what its wa -- thats the way I feel.
Its good to die a Jew  but what do you do in the meantime  th is is the problem.ﬂ From the beginning until the end  the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life  which many other religion or communities dont have.
I don't feel that religion has to be part of it.
I mean  I told them  I said  it is not the religion.
And we you learn to respect one another  because of that  and it doesnt matter what religion they are really  we are always good friends.
Yeah  I understood that it was basically based on my religion  basically thats the only thing that– you know.
You and I went to Hebrew schools where everything was taught in Hebrew.
Most people think that the Germans were so anti -Jewish because of religion.
You see  I -- since I did not come from a background where religion was the answer  I did not seek the answer in religion during the war  obviously  you know?
And I knew -- probably knew just as much about Catholicism when I lived in Austria as I kne w about my own religion.
But they're quite interesting statistics breaking them down into religion and all kinds of statistics which are quite interesting.
Power has always attracted me  and Judaism is a very powerful religion.
I just felt strange amongst it because I was brought up in a Jewish religion  so I let it go by what the priests say with a grain.
If you change  if you converting to another religion  then you're not counted.
During these war years  did you pay any attention to religion or to holidays  or to anything like that?
I mean  this was really horrible  and my experience at that school was terrible  just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and even though it was really a secular school  it was a public secular school  because in Belgium they have  as they have her e  a Catholic system that is parallel to the public system  I obviously  so the people who came to the secular schools were not Catholic  or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they chose the public school.
There were schools set up  and I went to the school where I learned Hebrew.
No  I did not  as a neither m none of my family were that Jewish and we well  I do consider myself Jewish  but I am not a religious person.
Was your uncle Because religion is Catholics  Protestants  they were sort of Catholics were not very happy that there were still some Protestants left.
But the Italians would not give the information about religion  never did.
The priest would come in and teach them catholic  you know  the religion.
It was a secular school where there was religion given according to what you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you didn't have to attend -- because there was a cat holic school system just as there is one here an official catholic school system.
I only have the capacity to be compassionate for somebody else  whether it's a person like me or somebody else  a different color  a different race  different religion -- I don't care.
Th-The only thing I think my religion is dont hurt other people.
And here  my -- the hair is already a little clamped up  but you know  I would never throw it away  because in Jewish religion  youre not supposed to throw away anything that was on a body -- n-not a foreign thing  but something that belonged to the body  it was growing on the body.
And I married a German woman who's not Jewi sh  and my children grew up Jewish in remembrance of my parents.
And I don't think I could tell him  I really couldn't  the only fights that we openly had was about religion.
I was not prepar ed in religion when I was 14 so I was seven years in a convent.
So then you started this Jewish school with the other Jewish students?
I went to a Jewish school  to a to a religious school where as I would have here.
But  the-these tr -- the trappings of religion do exist in our culture.
Do you think religion was important for you at this stage  this transition as a -- as a youngster?
But he said  ﬁNo  you have a wonderful religion  you have to keep with it.
And the truth is  I got so much of religion that as soon as I gr aduated -- rather  had my bar mitzvah -- I quit the synagogue.
When you were raised  we re you raised as a Catholic or Protestant?
It doesnt matter what religion you are  but you just have to be a good human being.
You see there is the Catholic religion and the Protestant  but Vienna  Austria  was about 95 percent Catholic.
This man  March 15 th  arrive in the synagogue  which was the -- everybody went to this  according to his religion  to synagogue  or church  or Temple  because it was th -- t -- th the day of the Hungarian revolution  1848.
>> Nat Shaffir: All the religion was not allowed but we did practice religion  kind of underground.
You know  even today when I do the translations for the Red Cross and it says of nationality Polish  and religion  I always say Mosaic  because I I had to and they always would put tho-those who correct those things said Jewish  and I said no  so I wrote j the Polish Red Cross and I said  now what is it?
We don't have to be the same religion but we can respect each other.
At that time we were all in hiding   my sister and I. I didn't know anything about what religion we were doing  but I was baptized according to my records.
If you -- if you carry the weight of your religion  or your -- you know  or your background  your roots  your parents  your grandparents  I mean how can you?
Q. How were you raised -- in which religion were you raise A. I was catholic.
Realized much more but she did not know that she was a Jew either.
Not -- Not only was there a class of -- a money class  but definitely religion.
I mean  that was the third religion  it was Church of England  and the principal said if we -- spoke to my parents and said if I didn't want to attend the services  it was okay.
Right  well  having been away from really  th e Jewish religion for all these war years  we were taught by this American serviceman  w ho was very Orthodox  and he probably knew as much as a rabbi  and he made sure that we lear ned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar Mitzvah.
But then since that time I keep looking  you know  whether I cause there was this stupid idea that I recognize Jesus in one of them  but I mean anyhow  thats how my attitude I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my school friends  okay  and school friends dont ta lk about religion.
I remember only that the last effort of my father to keep to religion was enough.
And he said  \ Well  that's really not a religion  but I have to talk to your father  and he's going to have to convert first.\
It only came after the Holocaust when finally  the people who cherished a religion became understanding that you must learn the art of weaponry.
As I told you  I was asked to fill in my religion when I registered and I was asked whether I would room with a black girl  with a Negro girl.
It was I didnt mind the hours  I didnt mind the drill  I didnt mind the marches  but it was all part of belonging to an organization with which you lived  where you belong  and where nobody judged you what kind of religion do you have.
I have no -- no faith of religion not -- never had one  answer truthfully.
The reason for that is that in Poland  only Jewish men were circumcised.
You know  that religion  and their religion contributed lots  lots  lots.
There you are in the back of the classroom with these other Jewish girls.
I went to a Jewish school  you know  I -- it wasnt a cheder or a Orthodox school  it was a Jewish school  but we learned Hebrew much more so than -- we didn't learn the Bible or things 3 like that.
And she was never -- hed never -- shed never changed her religion  but she wanted to be on the Jewish cemetery.
And I think that's probably why I didn't feel Jewish because I didn't want to be Jewish.
And so they had  in the system  public school  they had that life had -- a lesson religion.
Is it possible for with your experiences to live with no acknowledgement of religion?
Did you go to Hebrew school or did you have special religious training?
I had to deny my own religion for something I hated to do that but life goes on and things have passed.
So let s talk a little bit more about religion  a little bit.
But then again on the other hand  I'm very proud to be Jewish.
My – my grand – my father was strict – strict ly man in the religion Š completely.
It was grade  I mean grade school and then high school we went to a private school and that was mostly   many Jewish colleagues  also some Christians.
But I did have Jewish friends in class  and I must say  I found -- I found my friends among Jewish kids.
Did your parents teach you  you said they were very educated in Jewish history and things like that  did they teach that to you?
Did your attitude towards religion change as a result of the war?
If this is religion  I don't know if there is anybody...if there is a God in Heaven.
In all of this  did you think at all about religion  did you rese nt it  the fact that you were Jewish?
Ive seen people who were not religious  and their children married very religious  and the other way aroun d. It -- I dont know how religious you are  whether you are an organized religion that make s you do certain things certain days.
Interview with Blanche Hall October 15  2010 19 So so  when you went to school  you it was strict  you had separate religion classes?
I ended up going to a Jewish school  a Orthodox school.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 34 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ny all along  because Poland and Lithuania and all those other countries did not exist for 200 years  they were al occupied by the Russians.
That much that they changed their name and became non-Jews or nothing  no religion or no nothing.
And he didnt want to have anything to do with religion  period  because he said he can t believe that any God would allow what happened  you know.
When I was non Jewish that was no good  so when they asked me I ju st said I believe that I do things other human beings and that is the greatest religion what you can do  serve the fellow man.
I do anything that is proper there to any citizen  I dont care whether theyre -- or what color USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 42 or what religion I-Im not this way.
I mean in -- in one sense  I have felt that the things that have been done in the name of religion are so reprehensible throughout history  with no religion left outside of that blanket 117 indictment  that I think it has not done good  it ha s done bad.
So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith.
You couldn't change your apartment without the permission from the police  and with the...uh...you had to give them...uh...everybody who is living there  their full name  their Jewish name or whatever it was  and...uh...the n they had...uh...also the religion.
And so the -- the probl -- the -- the s -- religion is handled differently.
And I remember going on the high holy days with a girlfriend  and we went from one synagogue to the other  but as far as religi on  religion for me to keep  thats not what directed me  I did what everybody else did.
MG: Uh  religion was you know  if you were religious--you were religious.
But then again  how could you put th e two together  when you have so many people of any background  of any religion  who were willing to risk their lives  just to sha to save one child?
And thats what happened  thats what a busin -- religion became  its a business.
So  we ha ve not lost faith  we have not lost faith in people  and we have not lost in faith in our religion.
They dont understand that we -- we are people  we are good and bad in every religion  every race  I find they have good and bad people.
And as a matter of fact  when my sisters were born after the war  and then in the Jewish religion  you are not allowed to name after the living  so my parents named -- they gave them both Biblical names because they weren't absolutely sure who had survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay.
So we had to -- it was a religion class  we had to come out  you know  be free  left the class.
If the Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody  I think he should have been the first saint.
Did you feel yourself German  more German than Jewish  or equally German as Jewish?
Yes  there was a synagogue in every camp and there was a rabbi in every camp  and he took care of second marriages which were very frequent  people who married during those three and a half years in the camps  but you're not talking about a devout  you're talking about skeptics as far as religion is concerned.
Some say you can't b e a Jew if you don't believe in Judaism  in religion  in the past.
In the Jewish religion when you don't uh die of natural causes  you are not buried in the cemetery.
But anyhow  I went to school and I was the only Jewish child there.
What did you think of the Jewish -- or the German people at that time?
That i -- I knew it was forbidden in our religion.
And if the story for the sake of my suffering and my losses  if I can bring up a better world for one human being - never mind for a whole generation - it's worthwhile to teach  because on our skin we learned so make a better world for any other people  regardless of color  creed  religion - every human being.
We dont pay for the nationality -- pay for the -- for the religion  we not care  we not interesting because to th is organization belong Jewish people and Polish people and the re -- Christian  we dont care about -- we have our friends  Dr. Oris  which is very famous doctor working in the VA hospital  he is a Jewish  but we dont [indecipherable] Jewish  hes [indecipherable] my friend  you know.
So religion was actually the main subject; and if you didn't pass religion  you didn't pass that whole year.
So I never changed my religion for nothing in the world.
And its from him and he was very close to   prof Professor was a a a te te-teaching in Kaunas   and there was some religious institute  a Protestant religion institute  and he was quite  you know  prominent in his field in Lithuania .
Dont forget one thing  in Vienna you have its a subject  religion  you can flunk if you dont do well.
He still -- he still understands everything I do and -- and he -- he himself is still very religious  but I -- my religion has shifted from point A to point B and he understands that.
And my father was actually a teacher  then became a teacher in the Jewish school system  in the Jewish school.
My ethnic or I was German and I was Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7  2013 46 Jewish because  by religion.
As far as religion is concerned  well  I wasnt brought up on a religious home.
And my daughter leans very much towards the Jewish religion  rather than anything else.
So  I but my father decided to baptize us in Protestant church  and and told us that when we were 21  we should choose the religion  will we want to be Jewish  Christian  Catholic  or Protestant.
And I was Bar Mitzvah  but I wasnt brought up religious.
And I think in the perhaps in the context ofof religion  it has it has a place.
Yes  I have a few Jewish friend  but like I al ways said  they are American Jew and they dont know exactly what it is to be a European Jew  so we have a lot of difference.
And I think everybody should  in their own religion  should be observant.
No  I did not  as a neither m none of my family were that Jewish and we well  I do consider myself Jewish  but I am not a religious person.
The identity cards that were issued never  never mentioned race  religion or anything like that.
Did you find an alternative way to practice your religion after the war or was that not important?
But thats what I knew  and I didnt have any idea after the war what Jewish was  but of course  after the war  it didnt matter because nobody followed any religion after the war.
I really didn't encounter any incident  except in sometimes perhaps a remark  uh  by a teacher who would meet us Jewish children going to our religion class  to another classroom.
>> Estelle Laughlin: You know  God and religion is a very personal thing.
And after all  I personally feel that we a ll equal and deserve the same treatment regardless of color or religion or whatever.
Now  these people were not Jewish but they  of course -- but this was family for them.
My father was Orthodox  my mother came also 3 from a religious family  but not as Orthodox.
But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel.
The idea would be  if there was one religion  one world religion  where they recognize one force  call it God  call it whatever you want to  a non-sectarian.
Of course  under the communist system all religion was taboo  basically.
But lis ten  later on they -- had the three kids  you know  and then they had to go to -- to parochial school  because see  she wanted to teach them wi -- where the Jewish -- the Jewish religion  and they want to go to Yeshiva.
An interesting school in as much as there were a Jewish school  and there were very little room for people who were Jewish related  not Jewish by religion  and who didnt have no -- nowhere to go to  really.
Not only that  he also taught history and religion  and wrote the history of Germany  which became a very important bo ok and its still read in the universities in schools in Germany.
Never left the religion  Ive never denied that I was a Jew.
So -- and -- So  there was some ritual in your house  in terms of religion  with your mother doing the ShShabbas?
He never  never said that the reason they didn't marry was of the different religion.
But you went to this sp ecial school  did th-the then No  there were no more Jew there were no more Jewish girls.
And my mother wasn't particularly religious  even though she came from a very traditional Jewish background  but  you know  they were sort of rebelling against that  my parents.
And I do not really -- I would not -- I do not really believe in any religion -- in religion per se  I should say.
And also one day the German took all the people what went over to another religion  like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over to the Catholic religion  and they picked up all the people what went over to the  the Jews what went over to the Catholic religion.
Under the communism  it was no Jew  we couldnt say  no religion.
I'm attracted to this Buddhism or I don' t really know the religion but I notice the acceptance of everybody  I mean in this retreat that the guru was conducting  it's believing in yourself more  not in any god that I always had hard time to imagine where is her  where was he with all that suffering was happening?
And the leader of the group brings up the question of -- around the table -- whats your religion  how do you feel about it?
In New York at that time  the law was that you they the children could only be placed in homes of the religion of their mother.
Okay  cause she was not raised in a Jewish -- she comes from Jewish parents  but they were not active  religious Jews.
I dont remember them being very religious -- I mean  I remember -- I remember the neighbors after the war  I remember that the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next door were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me  they probably werent  and -- and they were very religious  and they asked if I would like to go to Catholic mass with them the following whatever  whatever  and -- and I was a child who really kept away from religion.
So the rabbi has to say that they passed the religion for the  say second grade  before they will go to the third.
Ha -- I -- I -- I know that we were liberated in end of July  and in September  the school was supposed to start  first of September is school year start and my mother went to m -- to the school and to register me and the -- the secretary ask my mother  you know the name  th-th-the family name  the first name  the age when -- all th-th-th ose details  and she ask what religion.
Have you di-did you become more religious because of your experience during the war?
Because they didn't want to to the religion  it wasn't a Shabbas.
Im going in the morning for services  maybe not every day but I turned back to -- towards religion.
I did all these things   but I never pushed religion down their throat  and I felt that I had -- you know  in my environment  religion was governing every minute of life.
But the problem was th -- the -- that they did not let them go  and the problem was tr ue because they did not o -- they di-did not honor your right to exercise your roots  you religion.
If you don't live the right way  you have obligations to deliver what -- what your religion tells you  and you go against  you lose those opportunities.
Being the fact that I was in a Soviet underground  for me to think religiously could have been a bad way about it because religion was a no-no in the Soviet system.
So you have -- now I have -- I have families who need to th -- this religion  and I got -- I ca -- my wi -- grandchildren are terrific.
To  yeah  to get a grade in Hebrew -- in religion to put me through.
The Gestapo people came to the private homes where we had our weekly or monthly sessions  and watc hed us kids discuss Jewish history and religion and took assiduously notes to the terror of the parents.
No matter  after my experience traveling all over the world  I find out is no religion better than ours  the religion  the Jews because I used to live in Italy with the Italians.
Uh we were registered  and when it came to name and and address and where it was and how  religion  the typewriter went over the left hand margin an d they put down Jewish  so at this point we knew for sure that we had been registered.
And one of the other things that I always heard was that all Jews in Germany were -- they were not Jewish any more.
And being Jewish was you know I was Jewish religiously but I had no real feeling deep or my parents did not inculcate in me a major feeling of being ethnically   and as I said we were religious but that was it.
Not -- Not because the -- ma -- Islam -- the nation of Islam  the Muslim religion.
Knowing that these are that kind of people  and who -- why doesnt somebody that belongs here  really  and is -- is a true American  a -- no matter what religion  whatever it is  do th ings like that to -- to a -- you know  not demonstrate  but to -- to -- to just announce that they are here  that we are here  we are -- and we are Americans  although we are from there  and from where  whatever it is.
And certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of ideas  you know.
My parents turned 360 degrees away from religion  both of them.
But this evolution of your Judaism and your relationship to the religion may have taken the course it t ook anyway  but can you identify or can you discuss at all how some of the experi ences you had during the war might have affected this?
I wasnt told very much about the religion  I dont think.
They told my parents  \ Well  if she can't practice her religion  she should have something.
They used to send once a week a Jewish teacher to teach all of the Jewish girls  the Jewish religion.
My father was a little bit -- he was very religious  but he liked a little bit more modern.
She could have used that sex to get him out of it  because she should have known that even according to he r own religion  which she so -- you know  so devoutly believed in  he was going to hell.
Sa me thing also with religion you see  to love your neighbor like yourself in your mind  yes  but in your action  not.
I was never religious so I never experienced luck of -- of the possibility to -- to practice religion.
As the son of a rabbi  were you trying to keep any of your Jewish sort of traditions or observances alive?
When did you tell your children about your war/Holocaust experiences and about their Jewish identities?
Whether it's Jewish or it's another religion or whatev er it is  if we're not going to teach the children and bring them to a point to understand  don't think a Jew have (indecipherable) or don't think a black is dirt y and filthy or whatever.
We went most morning and on any holiday mentioned in our religion  it was an event.
It's a reform school  and even we...the Jewish children  we had special religion class everyday in the morning  the Jewish students...the few of them.
At that time the army put your religion on your dog tags and they did it only so that if you need last ri tes or what have you  they know what you are and what you aren't  and they only had three cat egories.
And  you know  probably  if you were reared in some other religion  unless you happened to come from a particular kind of home  or something  you probably would never have gotten this educated.ﬂ Im not sure to what extent thats true  but in just doing a little reading  and in the years that followed that  I guess I sort of became convinced that the likelihood of my getting a Ph.D.  as -- especi ally as a woman  was probably increased because there was this tradition of things passed down through the ages.
As a matter of fact they were almost anti -Jewish because they had formally left the Jewish religion  you know  you can do that and it was just because they were  you know  my father considered Eva Edmands 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 himself to be an intellectual a nd they just did not believe in anything.
And then  later  when my older daughter became  oh  I guess conscious of her religion and all that  she got her mother to convert the kitchen into  you know  kosher home and a ll that.
I wouldn't say that they had lots of social contact with them of course  because still their religion and the synagogue was  so to say  the axis of their life.
There was priest there who taught us religion after the war.
I mean they -- they -- they learned  the Jewish -- th-they -- the Jewish history so much  they knew more than I do  probably.
Have you di-did you become more religious because of your experience during the war?
The burning  the -- and then there were discussion over -- on religion  for ex ample  because at that time  Voltaire was a prohibited author by the church.
But you were y ou  nevertheless  would ha take religion classes in school  and did you go through the various stages of  you know  having a First Communion and a Confirmation  and things like that?
One of the major elements of the Jewish faith is the bar mitzvah.
Because in they raise us with like usually you should go to co to communion  to everything what is in ou r religion.
Was no -- no -- nobody care what religion they are.
1936  Leon Blume was prime minister and had became murder ed because he was the first Jew who was a prime minister  and he was very social  very  a bi g socialist  and uh  he was even  there was even a joke running in France at that time with the  with the a Jewish Prime Minister  you have Saturday out  with the Catholic one you have Sunday out  with the Monday one you have Moslem out  and in the mean  uh  all you need is ha ve 3 or 4 different religion  and have a 4 day  4 day week.
And then it -- he turns around and start to tell the story that they ran away from Lithuania because the Communists didnt let them practice their religion  right?
He said that we were -- as if nothing had happened  open your book to page number 25  and he said  after two and a half years of being shit  you know  after being in hiding  after -- after denying our -- our - our -- our -- our -- our names  and our religion  and -- it was like -- I mean  the way he says it  a beautiful speech.
And... uh...in school we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages  arts  geography  history and math  everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a class where a Rabbi taught Jewish history  Hebrew  whatever.

In your studies and in your growi ng up  did you know any Jews  or did you know anything about the Jewish religion?
Apparently  we didn't -- in France  they don't tell you what religion you are when they meet you or -- it's very -- it's not like in America where you immediately you ask what  how much you make  and how much this and how much.
