And there was a parish house here  and then next to it  exactly next to it  the same wall  there was a big hotel before the war  which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German services in that town.
And then the war started Okay  lets talk a little bit more about your home.
My question to you is: Over the years after the war  how did your feelings towards Germany and Germans develop  especially in the sense of forgive ness after a few decades  and so on?
And late r  after the war  I heard what he had been doing.

After the war I found out that they took Kormus and they they tortured him for two days because th ey knew that this  our place  was not the only one.
56 And now that theres sort of new world events for all of us to ponder and process  do you think back to World War and that time period  now   what you see today?
We somehow -- I mean  I was actually the smallest eater before the war.
But...uh...that's about all I remember until....until the outbreak of the war.
That we think survived the war  now  we just found out.

After the war  I found a poem where she writes about it  that they thank for their life to me.
And I guess the other moment was when my wife Janet took a picture of me at the post office  when I was sending to Chicago   in a huge crate  two copies of the World War II book manuscript.
The Lithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years.
And -- but the -- there  every d-day  war is coming to an end.

But the younger men were kept until the end of the war if they survived.

And we waited there for the war to be over and to go home again.
I did not go into the political part of it  to tell you of Poland before the war.
I originally was supposed to go to Braunschweig and not that I had any knowledge of whether Braunschweig is better or not  but the people that I knew from before the war and some of the people I knew for a long time were going there and I just wanted to stay with people on whom one could count as a little bit of support.
They were not only shot  I mean  they died of starvation after the war came to an end.

Our entire uh spying service had been so unbelievably bad  that we were  we didn't even know that during the Spanish war  we had a minister of aviation in 1936 who had sent absolu tely our entire aviation to Spain.

So the pilgrimage of war where [indecipherable] were marching along the Leszno Street  looking at that thing to to see what was Did you see that too?
I didn't see them in 1939  because when the war started my father was called into th e army and like the result of all that propaganda and all this they mobilized a million people  but they were not ready for it.
But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life  and lot of war stories were coming around the table.
Uh  very early in the war while we were still at home  as a matter of fact  we were still living in  in our own quarters.
I dont know why  whether it was due to the war effort  or whether they were sent out to the front  or due to the fact it kind of was tied in with the munition factories  and depending on the job that they had to do  you know  that they were also in charge of the camp.
But the three other boots  I gave to a Spanish shoemaker who lived in the town  he was from the Civil War  he was very good sa sh shoemaker.
You cant only say that World War is the only time that war crimes or crimes against humanity have been committed.
Dudek was not a good businessman  so he he didn t do very well  but my father was  and and he started to deal with the same people he dealt with du before the war.
And I knew about the first World War  and here was the Spanish Civil War  and it came to me that war is one of the things tha-that -- thats -- thats always there in the world.
In fact  it became a problem to the United States Army before the war ended  because when the camps that were overrun  eventually all of them  knew that they would get better treatment from the United States Army  and  as we progressed  I would see hundreds  literally hundreds  thousands even  Russians walking  displaced persons walking along the street  along the 9 highway that we were driving on to get from one town to another.
>> Bill Benson: As you said  the war is over  free to go.
Let's talk about the start of the war and some of the things that you remember from that time.
By the time my visa came up  there was war already.
My Aunt Julia's brother had come to the United States long before the war  as a very  very young man  had gone into business and married.
The war is finished.ﬂ And then I understood that I felt out for a -- a good couple of days.
I found my youngest uncle in Israel who went there before the war as a khalutz 10 and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in Russia survived  and then they found little Jace k  and they came to Israel as a family.
When you mentioned that newspapers  and you mentioned this  that the Spanish Civil War was something talked about  that leads me to another question.
And he was in my unit  he was a captain in my unit  and then later he went to Palestine  and he was -- he fought there in the war.
I'm sure that my pare nts may have hidden some  maybe my mother hid some of her rings or something because the 1st y ear of the war  once things started being a little more normal  there was some food that my parents were able to get  probably on the black market.
He came back after the war and he survived  but he was dispossessed of his company.
And it through all those years I did lots of growing you know  between the war and between my work  you know  I became extremely much more tolerant and and a much better person than I ever would be  even not all those things.
A former good friend of mine from the wars  from the days before the war.
We never got any r eparation  we were never got a penny for what happened to us during the war.
Do you remember before the war  in 39  that theres any discussion about weve got to get out of here  theyre going to do something?
Here I have this paper saying that I was born in Dresden or Breslau.ﬂ German cities were favored  because during the four  five years of the war  Germans were prohibited from emigrating to the United States  or after  as ex-enemy nationals.
But the civil Russian popula-- government in every community  including Kovno and Vilijampolis  disintegrated within a half a day of the first outbreak of the war  which was the night of June 21st  1941.
I think that in 1941  uh the year that uh war was declared in the United States  in December of that year  there was far more anti-Semitism in the United States than there is in 1995.
And she figured if when the war is over  and she didnt n obody knew when it would be over  and a four months old  after a year you dont recognize your own child  she would ask for Interview with Jose Coltof November 9  2008 13the things  at least she would be able to identify her own child.
Carol: Yes he lived  after the war he settled in Holon   H-O-L-O-N. And we visited them .
So it actually had not changed much -- No -- Since the war  or it has?
Well I say th e peo ple who were born after the war they are not responsible for it.
So the question is was he an active Zionist before the war.
He was taken to a prisoners camp in an officers prisoner of war camp.
He was asked to do this by the American rabbi  Steven S. Wise  who was in London the first days of August for a Zionist conference  the first to take place since before World War II.
Nevertheless  after the war  that's when Europe was occupied by British and American troops and Eastern Europe by the Soviets but that did not diminish the fact that they were the one who kicked out the Nazis and brought freedom to us Jews.
The beginning of the war there was a Czech air force.
He wanted first first he wanted lorries  trucks to continue the war  but the Americans of course didn't do that.
Did you have any knowledge about what was going on with the war and the camps and all that?
Frank Liebermann: They had a non -Jewish bookkeeper who kept the records and contacted my parents after World War II that they might be interested in it.
But that is what I  after the war  told the Germans  ﬁYou are bastards.
And then they said  uh  he should be left alone and sent back  because he had enough from the First World War.
You know  say where the restrictions -- I cannot remember  but real restrictions  the yellow star and all that  really started after the war started with the Russi ans.
So she looked at her and said  I think that after the war yo u will be working for her.
I I got the Bronze Star uh from General Hodges towards the end of the war.
So I came to be the chaplain and I announced immediately after I got there when when we had won the war  I felt that we should celebrate the winning of the war  and we took a very big building - I think I have a picture of it - and we got the various groups together and I sent buses to pick up my men and a lot of non-Jews wanted to come.
It was the most -- the war that had to be won.
This was a shoot And you you you you were shooting guns af ter seeing being much younger in a war where you sa w other people being shot?
That means that we were no longer at war  supposedly  but we were occupied.
And of course  I always remind people who talk about the size  I tell them it was a big war  and thats not my fault.
It looked like a new war is shaping up and we decided enough is enough and somehow we were registered and at once we were called by the American consulate that if we want to it's our tur n. So  we decided to go.
He left before the war  and the wife didnt get a chance to go out.
So anyway  during that dinner  of course  the conversation was about what we went through  you know  what happened wi to us during the war and so on.
And when the war broke out -- and I was born in 41  in October  it was very difficult to hide with me as a child  and my father approached him.
Had you dreams as a young boy  before the war  of another career?
And having worked during the war  she wasn't going to despite the fact that we tried to disabuse her of this  it never worked.

In the war  people what they maked the nice living  but in the wartime we got mixed up  we didnt know what to do  so she sent with her husband back to Tomaszow Mazowiecki with -- with the merchandise  with -- with the clothes  with everything.
But so the whole war time part was kind of in a different mode from the  from Dachau.
The fact that they perished we only found out after the war.
It's like as soon as we see in war movies  literally  as you said  two million people fleeing  on foot  on bikes in carts  in the truck that you had rented.
No  she had been in hiding  also  and they came to the United States earlier  and her father had been killed  also -- had been killed  you know  in the war.
And I was on my way back to Lisbon when we entered the war.
Did you have any contact with her during the war period?
And that was a-again  a very fascinating experience  because pa the war on poverty was a a thing that if you were involved in it  you were enthused to the point of of personal dedication.
Ill never forget afte r the war  the first few days we ate grass.
What happened to the other fellow who was on trial  the other man who -- The other one  you know  he was -- first of all  he became prominent after the war  he wa -- became prominent  he was a mayor of -- of a city.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  for our audience  important to note that we were not in the war yet.
She rejoined her husband after the war in the States and they had these two children.
I came after the war there and there was nothing left at all.
What it was today people look for other people they disappeared during the war  during the war.

A document after the war  orders when they came for the Jews  Pastor Niemoller didn't speak up because he wasn't a Jew.
The shirts we were -- during the war you didnt change it for a fe w years  so can you imagine?
>> Bill Benson: Did you know what was happening elsewhere in Europe  both in terms of the war  but what was happening to Jews?
We heard already news that the Nazis  the German military is going to war with the Soviet Union.
He went to Belgium  and in Belgium he entered into -- did something from +  this was a Jewish school to teach -- he learned in like an engineer plan  things like this  for two years  and then was from Dunkirk that the English took all the people out while the Germans started the war.
>> Dora Klayman: Somehow we muddled until the end of the war.
Be-Because of the very difficult experiences you had during the war  was there ever a time when you resisted remembering what you experienced?
Well  the first thing I remember is that they had a prisoner of war camp in that city and the Canadians  in their wisdom  wanted to put us refugees in with the prisoners of war.
Q. How long did you stay in Germany after the war?
But also if you look at the Gulf War  its really difficult for a nation to attack its neighbor  and annex it any more  without provoking some sort of international reaction.
Yes  well we were in our home  I mean all of us at home  the war started and everybody was frightened to death.
And they went to some man that Joe knew him before war.
But that did not in any way preclude the terrific devotion that my sister had shown me  because I know for a fact there were instances during the war that I was a goner  and had it not been for them  I would never ever have survived.
After the war they were in Siberia and duri ng the war before Germany attacked Russia they used to send cards to Rozia from Siberia.
Before we turn to the events of the war and the Holocaust  tell us a little about your family and your community in the years leading up to the Holoc aust.
And I did talk in these reports not only about conditions in the and how the prisoner of war were Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 65organized and how they had been able to kill some of the guards  but I also talked about the fact that there were special problems with Jews who didnt want to be with Poles  and certainly didnt want to be with Germans.
And after the war  he became the Commissioner of Traffic Transportation in Vienna.
For a time then I coul dn't tolerate the one brings up the war stories  and the other brings up the other war stories.
How much of thos e things were influenced by the war experience?
So this combination of the two prompted her to use the paper she got from the Hungarian Ministry of Defense that my father disappeared during the war activities and she claimed that she was a war widow.
Also  the after the Jews  after the war had almost ﬁXﬂ amount of thousands of Jews in GermanyŠafter ‚47  after the program in came 100 000 Jews from Poland  came over to the American occupied zoning of the army  100 000. (
And I understand he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp  and he stayed in Czechoslovakia  Romania  every time theres a war  and every time they divide the country  it becomes another country.
So when Eichmann came to Theresienstadt  to   shortly before the end of the war  ten days or twelve days befo re the Russians entered  he all of a sudden find uh found Leo Beck there  and he was absolutely flabbergaste d and in the words of Leo Beck he said  Leo Beck.
Do you know if when you were born in the year the war began and Naziism and Hitler in power  if your parents  do you know if they felt worried about the future at that time  bringing you into their lives?
I myself am a citizen from Germany and I had a lot of education about the Holocaust  the war crimes  throughout my school time.
The Jewish establishment was against it because they wanted to get good  on good terms with the British and they figured that they need the British after the war  the war was coming  there was no doubt about that.
Poland  of course  refused to buckle under this trap  and that's how the war started.
The German cou -- you know  aktiones  like in other cities  they requested  lets see  right away  1000 inslawnie 2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain  you know  ravines and certain places right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war  and they killed.
I believe  and I dont know how many times since -- sin ce the war  but have things changed?
Just actually  my father  even though he was an American citizen  he served in the German army during World War I. And again  that was another reason that he f-felt  like many Jews that was in the German army during World War World War I  figured that they would not ever be arrested.
He said  we are once again engaged in a great war  because we have not learned from the past.
We felt that after the war is over  whatever  we will give them a proper burial.

So the fact that we dealt with them  and we knew them -- so they gave us s-some of the m -- some of the manufactured goods at hard cost prices from before the war.

January 17 of 1943  our friends found places for us with a family who kept us from -- till the end of the war.

Looking back on your experiences and thinking of your career in the theater and acting.. It was not much of a career If you had to select the most dramatic moment of your life at least during the time of the war what would you..

How did you decide to return home af ter the war?
Attitude had changed toward Zionism because of the experience of the war although when we finally left  I  having been a fervent Zionist at that point really felt it was a betrayal to come to America rather than to go to Palestine.

During the war years  how closely did you follow the news of what was happening in Europe?
Yeah  they -- that -- so -- and after the war  I really think that we have made very  very big prog resses.
That wa -- that was one of the three scariest moments I -- I had dur ing the war.
Right after the war of the independence  when the war of independence ended.
My father is a Korean war era veteran  having been too young to have served during World War   cause he was born in December of 1928.
So  then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my friend Alena who went to school with me  her mother was a pediatrician before the war.
I dont know  but I suspect that because -- and I suspect this because of the fact that I learned when Interview with Al fred Lakritz April 3  2008 52I visited Saint-Pardoux again -- and Ive done that several times after the war  I learned then that there were several Jewish families in -- that lived around or in the hamlet  around the hamlet.
I think this accounts for some of my having a nervous breakdown after the war  being fricasseed.
Also  my father taught me to read before the war  before I went to school.
And then with this Mr. Stanick in Bernau  for whose father I worked during the war  when I couldnt work for my old boss  who was Jewish.
We  we heard the...the speeches from Polish officials  and we know that any day we're going to be in the war.

And uh in the good old days before World War II  they were bringing in feed from abroad  mostly from the United States  and by that time it was cut off  so then the question was how to survive during World War II because most of the Danes were not very enthusiastic about about switching exports from England which was now impossible  to feed 7 the Germans.
When you look back to those years dur ing the war  are there any episodes  or any memories  that stand out in your mind?
One of us a doctor in Switzerland  and one is a He was in France  but during the war  the brother he was in Switzerland  and he was there during the war and he survived.
Probably  but again  you know  Im never quite sure -- and weve had this discussion with the Hidden Children  how much of -- of ones being can be blamed on the war.
Instead of that  they put him in a prisoners of war came camp.
We stayed in that convent until the war was almost over with and then this organization took us back and we went back to one of the homes.
See  I only had one doll in my life and that was the doll that my bro -- my father bought for me before the war.
Whereas most of the survivors that you talk to Im sure are in their seventies because they were teenagers or in their early twenties during the war.

And then  when the civil war happened [indecipherable] many of them were accused of being traitors.
Spend just a few moments telling us about that life before the war.
And so we did not -- but we penetrated news in this -- in this respect  that the war started.
So the news started on the 13 th can you imagine the coincidence 13th of April of 1943  when Germany was withdrawing from Russia  the Germans were talking about finding people and giving the names because they had the papers of these people  and they inquired asked for the international Red Cross  from the people  where some American prisoners of war were being taken and shown it.
I guess my father  when the war broke out  he was only 37 years old  and my mother must have been 34 years old when the war broke out.

There weren't that welcome because nobody had a lot of -- the wealthy people didn't have a lot of money but they came to the United States so they would have the protection in the next war.
My brother Joseph was sent who was older th an I  was sent on the last kinder train to England   which was a refugee train to save children in Germany  and he spent the rest of the war in England without his parents.
We discover our good friend who's  her parents  my parents were friends when they were single yet  came from Sweden  she survived the war in Russia.
When the War was over  he said  when the Americans liberated us  he said he was Jewish.
Did you see a lot -- any evidence of trauma   of people who were really scarred after the war emotionally or physically?
What we didn't know in 1945 that the war was really coming to the end and one day was announcement that we should...if want to the ...the warehouse where they kept the clothes and food and so on  if you want to get...all we want to take all the bread we can carry  all the clothes we can put on...they open up the warehouses and then they line us up on the march.

Town in eastern Poland   and so he went there in about April  and then we moved to to be with him in July  and of course in September first  the war broke out  and so we were left behind  completely away from our family.
I remember something with electric wires  but I just remember Š because always after the war  you know me  I'm so crazy  I can't stand to touch an electric wire.
So this was -- this was actually already after th e war  or is this while the war is still going on?
So I must have written the composition towards the end of the war  1945.
What happened one day  fall 1941 -- 44  we were detached to build fou ndations for a new Berlin after the war.
And the little daughter  the Lithuanian family who she knows  took her as a daughter  and the family survived the war.
There was also a detachment from the Israeli army there  as prisoner of war  who served as the English army.
He was drafted into the US Army during the Korean War.

during this period  did th ey ask you much about what happened to you during the war  did you talk about it much?
My fathers parents perished in the first World War  his mother and his older sister.

And he didnt work that way through the entire war  I gather  because at a certain point  when the Germans take over Yes.
We all enjoyed being ther e. >> Bill Benson: You remember it being postwar France  conditions remained very difficult for folks for several years after the war  in terms of scarcity  food products  clothing.
When the war started and Russians started to evacuate  it was a publically.
I didn't know what happened to him  but after the war all the Nazis were picked up and punished.
And that unit  I learned later  broadcast gossip that we pick ed up from prisoners of war  because we were instructed  when interviewing prisoners of war to find out about their home life  what was going on in the cities where they lived  you know  the soldiers who were being taken prisoners were wondering wer will they be tortured.

He happens to come to Poland right after -- maybe the next day when the war started.
So Mimi took care of me since I was four years old  til right after the war.
Thats how I find my sister afte-after I came from the war.
And they would come and borrow a furniture for the duration of the war.
Already I am sp eaking about my father being my father  but actually maybe I should tell you that he volunteered in World War One to the garrison in Metz  which is Alsace-Lorraine in order to learn French.
So somehow my activities with the Fr ench prisoners of war became known  not to the point where they prosecuted me immediately or looked for me  but it became known.
And the war may end in a month  in three months  and the longer you can keep your family together  the better your chances for staying together as a family for surviving.

The one married in the war and had a daughter in the war.
You know  the war  I think  ended on the 8th of May or 7th of May. So for us  the war was over.
You -- you were starting to say that you wanted to -- to be part of the war effort  you couldnt go as a soldier  so I think you heard about the American Field Service?
And the Star of David  which was used during the war as a star to deg -- as a sign to degrade people  suddenly here was on the money  and it was -- so I -- when I looked at it  I say  ﬁOh  Ill finished -- in a few more years Ill graduate  and Ill get away  get out from -- from -- from this country  from 35 Germany.ﬂ And each time I kept it with me  with -- the money.
The man was in a transition camp from the war  from Berlin  he was the head of the transition camp.

Where were you and your family when the war broke out?
Q. But was your original plan to try to wait out the war underground?
Before we turn to the war and the Holocaust and the earliest years of the Hitler regime  tell us about your family and you in the years before 1933.
The idea of seeing them lose the war and having maybe one hour of freedom or eating one orange or seeing a tree.
And my father was working in a defense plant in Brooklyn  so the main occupation  the main thought as I had as a child was that of World War II  and that was a common experience with all of us.
Whethe r he could accept him or could not  because  as I said  before the war was strict  51 boys  56 girls.
And your mother  tell me a little bit about your mother before the war.
I mean  did they require what people would require after the war  or was it that you had served in the military a nd that was enough?
I got in touch with her again after the war  that was my -- She was not Jewish?
My father never had a very good relationship with her before or after the war  but thats a different story.

Af ter the war we went back and everything was on strike.
The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned  the wa r started  in September of 39  so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of 39  its the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didnt touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy  at least -- I have to use a French word  insouciance  that we we re not bothered.

Before we turn to the horrors of the war and the Holocaust  tell us  first  about your parents and their lives and their community in the pre -war years  a little bit a bout them.
It was -- we were very in -- limited in our ra tions  but everybody had a tremendous spirit and everything -- everybody worked and it -- and look -- was excited about the end of the war  of course  naturally.
And so I really put down all the horrors of war to the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys.
So but what happened when in the last few days before the war ended was they also didn't give us any food any more and there were food riots because we were actually starving.
So my mother  before the war she taught  she was a teacher.
5 >> Bill Benson: During that period until 1944  of course war is going on elsewhere in Europe and Slovakia is allied with the Germans.
So  uh  uh  uh  uh  uh with the November events  uh  there was a complete change  and also  we then realized  especially when we worked  those of us who to save the children  that uh war might be imminent.
So that was really my life after -- after the war.
I was working with one priest in Germany after war  so he was uh in our camp.
So  when the war came closer and closer  the Germans left  because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently.
Then I started taking hist ories which included the history  until then  he was born in Chop-kov and Pola nd and he went through the war  he was in a camp  he was in a war camp.
He had -- he brought home from the war  his saber  which he was allowed to  because of his rank  and he had the Iron Cross.
A nd even if they were my age  then they were children during the war  so then I started telling myself that you cant you know  you cant hold think a bout that all the time  you just cannot.
So that's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out  and that's what had stopped afterwards.
Bruno Lewy and Alma Shunam i. She married a man who became quite well known after World War II  Alex Shunami   because he was sent by the Yeshuv to Europe.
I tell you  then I had a friend that was a Baker  Jewish Baker during the war.
It was now a... it was a great deal of Europeans... Americans fr om the 10th Mountain Divi sion that exist... that trained there during World War II  and many of its members came back and established Aspen.
After the war  the Germans accused the Russians  and the Russians  in turn  accused the Germans who killed the 10 000 Polish officers.
Uh in in in November '39  by the way  uh my wife and I had our child...a boy was was born and uh since we had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell that certainly at the beginning of the war  Jews were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or have radio  so I was not...was not was not able to communicate with them  so uh so uh uh that means very often  especially afte r an air raid and if it was a heavy air raid  I didn't know what happened to my family and my family didn't know what happened to me  and uh then in the summer of '41  there started what we called the fi nal solution.
Again  there were shacks where before the war people kept wood.
The Allens did not encourage me to have any c ontact with my aunt or my brother  and by then the war had started.
And  you will not -----------survive the war  you will be protected and this  they were us--they were using a tac-tactic to keep the people quiet.
I went for a few months to...uh...in Poland after the war to school.
In the end  out of 5 000 Jews in Dresden  60 were still alive at the end of the war.
In many case there was  I know of many many of my contemporaries who came to the United States and that was most prevalent in the first two years of the war who were either hospitalized with sever psychotic problems or who Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
She liked to work in the garden when -- even before war  she always had a vegetable garden  she like gardening.
The re were thousands of people who committed these war crimes.
Well  he told me that my older brother as a matter of fact  years a little while later  my older brother  like I said in the beginning  that he and his girlfriend he Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2  2010 35had a girlfriend in Budapest he found her after the war because they were liberated in December  I think  44.
I -- I was very interested in history  always and I was so -- now I was eager to find out -- you know  I was in the war and I was -- as I always keep saying  in the eye of the storm  which is how it was.
I don't know if you remember  when my father...in the beginning of the war  somebody squealed  and the Germans came and took away all the merchandise.
And we knew it was a war for democracy to survive.
We bo -- I born in Warsaw  a nd I study in Warsaw and finish high school in Warsaw and up to 1939  where war starts  you know  thats start literally upside-down.
And administration which would come later on was this Dr. Elkous   and then there was this other person who was  prior we knew from before the war  friends of our family.
Can you tell us  please  what happened to you after the war briefly?
>> Bill Benson: You would remain in Kenya until you were 14 years of age  until after the war.
Interview with Marianne Roberts 10 April 11  2012 I think  and your father fought in World War I?
By then they was looking for Jews  to kill them because they wanted  they knew that a lot of Jews survived after the war from the Nazis  but they don't want should be Jews by the Polish.
So we start to meet after the war a couple of times  and start to use his information  his situation to give information regarding the situation at the front  regarding the situation in town.
And now like will have his and after the war we want to take his body out but the town didn't allowed us.
And when I came back yeah  and what they said but she said to me  you living outside  and you gonna let live through  and get mar you will live through the war  and go to America and get married and have children.
>> Bill Benson: War would continue in Europe until May of 1945  so a lot longer.
Fortunately  blessedly for her  she died the year before the war broke out.
In 1938 when the Germans occupied all parts from Czecho slo vakia then Prague  so Poland went to war  because they claimed Szczakowa belonged to Poland.
But what I remember from the second apartment that we lived is the war started  there was no school for Jewish children  none whatsoever.
They were all uh  uh  war criminals  uh  people who had been guards in the camp and various other types of things  of uh  positions that they had held and they were in there for reasons.
Im very happy to come and tell you what could happened during the second war.
They said the war will soon be over and everybody will go home.
I was interested in how Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 39 the Europeans got themselves into the horrors of the first World War  not so much the final crisis  but the 1860s  70s  80s  90s  how they got organized in a way that led them to disaster.
Uh the the change not in the feeling of security but the change in the family life came in - it must have been mid or the fall perhaps of 1944 when my dad uh joined the uh Danish uh Brigade as it was called  the the uh the Danish military police force that was built up in Sweden towards the end of the 2nd World War.
This is a set of buildings crea built in the first World War  for the making of mines and torpedoes that could be loaded directly onto ships on the Potomac River.
Because 8 they took it over before  in Warsaw the war was s till going on.
I never saw her in the house before the end of the war  in our house.
On that particular morning  she returned immediately and she kind of walk ed over where we were like nine people sleeping in my section  in an upper berth  and I was like close to the end  and she pulled me and she says  ﬁTake your two sisters a nd follow me and dont say a word.ﬂ So  I mean  she was a Polish girl  and when we came to Auschwitz  she asked us where we are from  and I told her  and we had  knew some people she had some friends who came to live in our town before the war  and they lived in the neighborhood.
And then he then he wa actually  I met him when he was discharged  because  you know  a lot of G.I.s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract with what was then called the war department.
I found my aunt's name on the list  after the war.
But all of a sudden  who  during the war  really has the best?
a Russian prisoner of war  he was in this camp too  he escaped.
BZ: They were investigating our mobilization for war  direct ed by Senator Harley Kilgore6 of West Virginia.
And th ey managed to postpone it long enou gh so that by the time they would give him the papers  Hungary had declared war against the United States.
But then Boston  which is  you know  the scientific capital of  you know  state  all of a sudden there was no one with the -- war ended  the Korean war ended.
And they all had children there not married  they were still all young before the war.
I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war government in Germany right after the war.
Then  it looks like the Germans find out in the camp that he was an officer in their Army in World War I. They sent him to .
The burned down the whole prisoner of war camp--I told you Russian prisoners in there.
I think that basically they couldnt possibly -- they couldnt que stion my fathers credentials since he was a reserve non-commissioned officer   volunteer in a war against Russia.
So  I learned the trade and it was very useful  because when I went to Luxembourg they gave me a job by a furrier and I was working there  and then the war broke out in Israel and my brother from Belgium decided to go as a volunteer.
But  no  they knew ve ry well what they did  and after the war  I asked them why did you do th is?
I mea n  its very difficult to think of another country where you could have anti-war demonstration the mi ddle of a war for survival.
You can go ahead whenever you're ready– Ok  why don't  why don't we pick up about where what  what happened to you once -- When the war broke out?
So what happened And of course  all the all the all the drama that developed the next few days  you know  the declaration of war by England   and France  and everybody was looking at the plane  where are the French planes coming  where are the English planes?
So for all intents and purposes  your father was survived the war  but he was out of the picture Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21  2015 15 Right.
I mean  by the end of the war the Germans were running out of food  and of c ourse they didn't give any food to the camps  so that many of them were really very badly starved.
The population of Lvov actually more than doubled with the refugees because of the war.
I want to ask you in a minute about the war crimes  but just one other thing.
My second brother  Felix  had come to the United States before the beginning of the war .
During the war  during the latter parts of the war  did your family know anything about the camps  or did that come out only later for them?
And  in '38  there was no war yet  but it was almost going to happen.
The thing that --as soon as the war was over  of course  my parents once again wanted to come to America.
What do you remember hearing about th e progress of the war when you were a prisoner?
We thought that we had to stop going to school because of the war and thats how it was.
After the -- the war when we came back to Waszkowitz  there was [indecipherable] whom she -- my aunts had worked in real estate for him  but when the Russians came he became a banker.
And saw them last   he they took my father to work for the war effort  in a factory.
I obviously ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 was not aware of the war or anything.
And in December  war started - Pearl Harbor - in December of 41 and quite a few of the doctors left  went in the service  and so the hospital was very short handed.
And I believe that the German people are a -- are very -- very  ve-very good nation  like anybody else  but they were misled by a -- by a government  by getting promises  and also because they suffered of the -- of the defeat during the first World War  which was interpreted to them as a -- as a reason to avenge it.
So  I wasnt invited  but I do know there is going to be a war.
Interview with Inge Katzenstein October 17  2001 22 My parents had ideas  possibly were ab le to read through the lines what was going on  but actually no  we did not know until after the war  what was going on.
So they couldnt produce any more  they were ruined for the rest of the war  and then it was not -- very few batteries coming from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines  because at the coastline in Norway  during the war you could hide every nations fleet  submarines and everything  in Norwegian fjords.
We found the camp of the British prisoners of war  and for some reason -- they were bombing London  but for some reason they were treating the British POWs very we ll.
Just in the wartime in 1939 I was age  you know  to live there  but I couldn't come every day or once  twice a week to eat no supper  the meals with the friends all together until 1939  until the war.
Yeah [inaudible] See  if -- if you have no job -- after the war  my husband got an assignment in Indonesia.
No food  dirty water  no hygienic anything which we could be 34 clean nothing but sickness  people dying on the street  they weakened us and they made us like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a lot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first World War or they lived with them in Poland and they couldn't understand  they would not believe that they could do it to us.
Why is it that your neighbors turned against you when 12 the war started?
As you know  we were refused admission in 1939  and at the end of the war it was very easy  the sympathy for -- for the victims of the -- now known as Holocaust was -- was very much -- was very acute.
Okay  what happened to them in the war was that they had friends who USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 50 helped them go underground and who also took a ll their things and hid -- with them and kept it for them.
We had an apartment house in Warsaw from my grandparents but my cousin's wife after the was war was sent to Sweden so he came back and he sold it.
04:07:45 A. We were li-- we were -- we kne w what is going on  what is the status of the war.
I did do an audio oral history for the Army War College at Carlisle  which took me through  of course  my experiences in World War II and my early experience and subsequent  but there was no concentration on this type of atrocity thing  although it was mentioned but not as much as we have done today.
But then they had not and you cannot even blam e the people what they did because from the first day on  the very first publications after World War 2  produced in Poland  by famous researchers like Dr. for example  he pu blished the very first book on Auschwitz and it's a good one  I ha ve that in both languages  in Ge rman and in  in  in Polish  which he forwarded to me because I  that's always activ e and tried to keep in touch with the post-war 66 Auschwitz family of inmates  I me an  it's not the families  but we go t a small family of people who tried to stay in touch with.
that you never spoke about what had happened during th e war.
01:08:38 Like they had done so many times before -- before the World War II  before World War I  and...and so on.
And in I had to be accepted either in a defense job or well  war was over  but in a Interview with Eric Simon June 21  2014 107 Right.
Okay  but lets start with the day the war begins  you know?
Her father wa s a veterinarian and we made very good friends  and that was still before they recognized me that I'm Jewish  because that happened in 1944  almost the war was over.
He was also very good to his worker s. Not like Schindler by no means  and when the end of the war and the Russians started to approach  and the Germans wanted to uh liquidate the camps and retreat  Schindler  they were very good friends  Schindler and Madrich  and Schindler approached Madrich to do the same thing to join forces and locate  uh relocate all the workers to the two factories in Sudetenland  but Madrich refused.
Then we had some English soldiers taking care of a bunch of German prisoners of war who were in a nearby camp.
But that was quite a dramatic moment wh en Churchill announced that we were at war  September the third  1939  11 oclock in the mo rning.
>> Bill Benson: When you were liberated  when your father came home in the fall of 1944  of course  the war continued until May of 1945 so it went on for a good while longer.
And the Cold War is still going on  so what allowed Holzmans amendment to actually be passed when people still had a very -- I dont know  shall we call it a rigid view  or at least a Cold War view of eastern European countries under the Soviet Union?
Did you talk to your wife about what had -- what your experiences had been during the war  and what had become of your family?
When the war was over the Russian told us if we want to go back to Poland   we can go.
But the money went through the American Historical Association  and this independent committee became the committee on war documents of the AHA.
And we spent there until the war was over actually  and then I guess there was a lot of discussion whether we should go back or not.
I rememb er  you know  when I came back from  when I escaped from captivity and we were living in the apartment block  during the war people became 4 very close to each other.
Well  thats because during -- during the war  Croatia and Serbia were not in the same country.
And he felt the war will end an d on the [indecipherable] but Im guessing  just.
The Jew -- did the partisans disband or did the war end first?
>> Regina Spiegel: From there  one was Baumlitz  where they used to make -- most of the places that I was was always something to do with the war  you know  either stuff to shoot  and actually from Baumlitz we used to work on -- they told us we have to clean very clean  working on Panzerfaust  because if you leave anything it can fire back.
114 Well  bec -- because they are taking an i ndividual Serb  who is responsible for 12 women being raped  and theyre saying he committed th e war crime.
And I had to stop when the war started in 1940.
>> Al Munzer: This was really at the very end of the war.
And he came back after the war  he was paralyzed  and he died   hes died [indecipherable] he got his punishment.
But I h ear -- it was after the war that I saw all the papers and the names.
And so I usually -- and even now I -- I tend to say to people when they ask me  where were -- you know  what were you doing during the war  I would say  well  I was hidden  but not like Anne Frank.
We know later after Warsaw uprising  after I finish the war  the caret aker -- caretaker told us during the Warsaw collapse -- uprising collapse  the fellow must go f-from all over  and German troop  all the people  between these people to the Melamid [indecipherable] not Melamid  Mr. Landaus son  Mrs. Landau  and the third guy.
They sent her to Auschwitz  but my sisters wound up to be -- I heard after the war they were sent to Gdansk [or] Gdingen  where they worked in a factory where they were manufacturing uniforms for the German Army.
So  on September first  1939  when the war broke out and bombs start fa lling  this must have been  even though you expected it  still a shock because the experience was -- It was still a shock  yes.
I think the war just came  then the summer came around and then summers we went -- you know w ith were here and we were there  we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 24 went to Babcha.
Because at the same time  like for there were  you know  all those millions of Russian war prisoners  and forced laborers  and immediately the Soviets had  you know  made a deal with the Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 225 Americans and British  that they should all go back.
And its just theres no theres just no answer  theres theres no answer  and and what makes it so painful for for us is that there was a possibility they could have been s they could have survived  they could have it was late enough in the war.
We were involved in exercise  war -- war exercise  or whatever.
And I remember when I came back into my town and it was the end of the war  when it was a big celebration.
No  had no idea because a t that age already  I knew there was a war going on in Austria and in Germany against people.
First of all  they [indecipherable] have the Americans and the Jews in the World War II.
But what happened was as soon as the Hungarians came in  my father was old enough -- he actually served in World War I under the Austria Hungarian empire.
So  about three days before we came before Krakow  and also Krakow was not ok -- was not taken -- like usually in a war  you go from the -- and this time we went from the east to the west  like the army didnt go from east to the west.
And af ter the war  we prepared 12 bedrooms  full bedrooms  and nobody came back.
And at one point when the war broke out in Se ptember of '39  he took in all the children from the children transport and he put them in those huts in the back and in every one of the rooms after the people left.
Another story that may interest you is...uh...when in 1948 Israel was declared a state and the war broke out with the Arabs  there was a Legation in New York.
Its a heartbreaking thing  but I Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 40realize that from the time that war broke out  that all correspondence  it did stop and that any that came through must have come by through Switzerland .
Then one day -- then  of course  World War II started in September of 1939 .
And then  while we had this feeling  all of us  he starts telling me  \ You know  when the war will come  what will be our destiny?\
They knew nothing until they were about 10 and 13 years old  and I said to Mom  givi ng them another opportunity to open up  actually  and it was pretty much the same way  a very a snippet you know  well  we took care of your mommy  shes our daughter  during the war her parents didnt come back from concentration camp.
At the end of the war he ultimately ended up in the United States and at the end of the war you tried to reconnect with him.
This was after the war when we were in Poland  when we were in Warsaw  just before we went to Berlin.
I never thought when I was young that I will go through such a war.
When it came that I had to leave  I was deva stated that I couldnt study any more  that -- that was  for me end of the world I wanted - but then burns  my father said  ﬁThis will -- war will be over soon [indecipherable].ﬂ You know  all this -- Right  thats what everybody thought -- six months and youll be home.
After the war  you can take a look at our house  there were holes everywhere in the living area.
All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the home office  with the war office  this that and the other thing.
One week after the war  on a Saturday  they came to our house to see Laura.
Then finally they came to the point  that is my knowledge of German  and with my experience in this work  I can build up myself a great career for afte r the war  and work with them  and do it -- help them [indecipherable] and so on.
When Jerrys mother  my husbands mother came to America after the war a nd I met her  she didn't speak English  she would speak German.
And that -- and that there wa -- and that you -- he was being paid based on how wealthy he was before the war  or -- what did you think of that?
But the Polish money  this silver 10 dollars 10 zlotys before the war  which were still good in German occupation.
Whether or not they came home before th-th-the war  because the Belgian Jews were killed just as badly as the Polish Jews.
The only thing I could -- the only c onclusion I kept on coming to was that I still believed that war was not the answer.
And was that -- did you have any sense of -- how did you know that -- that there was a -- that you didnt want that  that you wanted to be [indecipherable] Well  we knew what the Russians stood for  from before the war.
In the first camp we heard that the English or the Americans -- I don't think America was yet in the war when we were there.
At the Rand Corporation  I got involved -- a very favory game  is -- it was -- its called Krikspiel  which is the German for war game  Krikspiel.
But those who were hiding  and were perhaps with a Christian family  they could still listen to BBC so that was the  the entire existence was the war and the topics were just that.
That is something  that is some of the worst  she should have been done away with  preferably hanged immediately after the war.
Well so yo u were telling me that so close after the war ended  this horrible war  they had already concerts  theater  opera and dances and everything else.
And since there were a lot of Frenchmen in exile at that point  they had speakers relating to the to the war.
Let me go back a little bit and ask you a que stion about  by the time you are ten years old  its a few years after World War I. The situati on in Austria must be somewhat difficult.
Did your life at home Im going back now to Sanok   before the war  when things started to go badly  did you f eel that at home where was the money tighter?
Did you ever think that its going to end  or did you think the Germans might win the war?
>> Bill Benson: This is happening while Germany is losing the war.
All the others died  except one aunt  a sister of my father  who emigrated to Chile  and she obviously -- she survived the war there.
But it was very important to preserve the evidence to move in quickly  and this is a problem which I'm sure war crimes investigators are having today.
They gon -- they declared war [indecipherable] Germany there  because they were involved with the previous agreement of fr iends -- friendship or something -- Mm-hm. --
The camp in Spain was mainly as a result of the Civil War that they had in Spain.
And then later  my uncle placed us with the janitor of a villa which was owned by Jewish antique dealer  who had been a contact of my unc les before the war.
We were told that an officers duty is to prevent war cr iminal act from happening  right  and an officer will eventually get married and become a noble re presentative of a new Germany  no more Nazi Germany  right?
He was the biggest spy and he was in a Swedish jail and we suggested to give him back to the Russians for Raoul and they said it's not worth it to get into war with the Russians for one man and international law wouldn't allow us.
When did the war actually come closer to Padua   come close to Italy ?
And also  they called those rockets  the rockets  you know  where they to shoot up  and wit that was the Vietnam war  I think it was that.
And pulled this  which was obviously World War vintage field kitchen  which sometimes work ed and most of the time didnt work  so sometimes we had ersatz coffee or some -- so mething resembling soup.
And  you know  there was just always nerve wracking -- the circumstances were just that way  they w -- a nd they were serious people  but the war just made it that way  I think.
And I said  ﬁI dont know what you are 96 talking about.ﬂ And he said  ﬁWhat kind of contac t do you have with people in Jordan?ﬂ So the agent was in my office  and he again ask me   and I said  ﬁCan you write it down?ﬂ When he wrote it down  I saw Barron  that is th -- and I said  ﬁOh yes  I know him.ﬂ And of course I have to say  well I knew him during the war  when I wa s a child in convent and hes priest  and he -- you shouldnt worry  hes not a spy  hes not the Arabic agent.
We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out.
You can never find names  for example  of right after the war  when Poland lost the war  all the Jewish synagogues were burned  and po Jewish popula tions registers was kept by by the synagogues  the birth and the ma rriage records and all that.
But th -- Roosevelt could of course not go and -- and join in the war.
Eventually he got put back into Miranda and stayed there until the end of the war.
And your mother di did she go outside the house to work once the war started  or she stayed at home  still?
Beca -- Its hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts  and youre a 13 year old girl  and the war ends  and youre an adu lt on your own  and theres no one to turn to for advice  what to do  how -- what to do with your life  or how to -- to associate with people  or whatever.
I think its -- its one experience that I wouldnt have had if the war had not happened.
They did a lot of things that people could not imagine  that after the war was over people would still do certain things.
Talking about the United Europe  in terms of post World War II  I mean  thats was not thinkable.
Im getting the smallest one they get  I know that I started out too late  I should have gotten a hell of a [inaudible] Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 94 How do you feel today about the war in did the war influence you in any way?
Uh  well  then I also remember  I remember that about perhaps 10 days after the war broke out  that the Germans and that was a treatment that was apparently meant for the Jewish people.
And -- and -- but then later  naturally  when I told her about the -- about the war  so maybe I told her too ea rlier  and she was like pushed away because she le -- realized it when she was four or five  six years.
So  in a certain way  it sounds like most of the activities that you would have had before the war  you still had in the Ghetto?
Because from when the war started  wh-when the German came to Poland  we were sent -- they send us to a ghetto  to Shilladula.
When we were on the train there even we heard some sniper shots  rifle shots coming over  and we can still Okay  so the war wasn't over then?
And after the war I met a fellow who was in the police at that time  and he was telling me things that was going on that showed the police was -- a lot of times was in -- in a sense against the Germans.
You know  when the war broke  we all -- it was on a Sunday morning.
Mr. Ziferman  Mrs. Ziferman came also later and after the war  they liberated...were liberated  came to the United States and they only su rvivor they brought died alread y  but the surviving is the son 22 Novak...Adam Novak.
Take me up to the point where youre already an adult I mean   if there is more t-to add to  teenage years or other events that you want to remember  or something significant about your parents and and and what happened during the war years  fine No  I just I think I I kind of talk ed about that  because they wound up being friends and they s you know  played cards together and and well  we just had a very simple life  nothing exciting  it was just surviving life.
And that was well-known before the war  during the war  after the war.
We called the -- Lodz was called before the war  the Polish Manchester.
We did want to go back to our home town but it was quite far and of course the war was just happening  the war between the Germans and the Russians and there was no co mmunications like trains or buses.
In my case  they didn't take anything because I was a War Department lawyer even though I wasn't really.

But  when  when my husband came back from escaping from prisoner of war camp  we stayed in this town called St. Etienne  and uh he  he took over this uh  this uh store because he wanted to try to  to equip the underground that was in the mountain not far from there  and gave them every possible item that was in that store  socks and blankets and everything that was needed up in the mountains.

And the reason I I I bring this up is that just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic studies at Brandeis  gave a presentation where he said  until World War 2  many Jews believed that about Poland.
No guarantee that I wouldn't have come here ultimately uh because the other two kids at Charbon  the other two from the original four  didn't have relatives in the U.S.  and they also survived the war  one of who is in the U.S.  the other one in Canada  so I can't say that if I had not made that tr ansport to the U.S. in 1941  once again with OSE taking an important...playing an important role in that  uh I can't say that I wouldn't have survived the war  but chances are fifty-fifty  but this way my my problems were soon to be over.
This one had a tradition way back  it was for generations -- during the war  the first World War  it was occupied by the Germans and they evacuated us.
He wanted to make in the Ritz Hotel an office for the for the...to send the people in after the war in uh in Palestine.

And one reason why  during the interview where I discover where everybody discovered that the boat had actually had me on board  what actually happened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp  because hed been injured during the war  where his fellow Mr. Kerr was almost killed  when he was introduced to me  and remember the last name  which is somewhat unusual  there the the reason why he remembered that was that my father had  as a gift  made given him a silver cigarette he was a smoker and had engraved in it  a thank you note from him  last name being Korzen .
He says  oh  this is a souvenir from World War I  I got my little finger shot off  its nothing.

This is my grandfather -- this is my gr andmothers husband  who was killed in beginning of the war  which I told in my story.
He was an officer in the first World War  so he was wounded  and had a paralysis on the right hand  and the right arm was completely stiff.

Earlier in the war you and your family lived under Russian occupation.
half a year before the war starts  half a year before Yeah.
And what -- what Id like now is just if you can say very briefly what happened to you in the couple years after the -- the -- the war.

He wrote his memoirs  not only about the war  but about his whole life.
You told me a story about your uncle who after the war was recognized.

He suffered the concentration camp of Dachau and I wanted to know whether he had come back from the war and whether there is anything I could do for him.
I would not swear  take under oath that this is exact date of my birth because in the time of the 1st World War  my little town was in fire and a ll the documents were burned  so I had to go to court after I was already graduated law in order to get a decision of court that I was really born on the 10th of December  nineteen hundred and nine.
Did you feel a lot of anger after the war ended  at the Germans?
But as I told you  when in the war  I got older 10 years in overnight  in my mind.
And it -- it -- it left no escape hatch for my father  unf ortunately  but th-the hope was that perhaps we could send -- he could go off to a farm  work for a farmer in so m-some lonely place  and then sort of wait until the war was over.
I rea lly loved to be there and I have been there many times even after the war.
And he said  ﬁYes  please.ﬂ He said  ﬁAnd can you do my sister  too  Rosa  sh e is so scared.ﬂ And I said  ﬁWhat about your parents?ﬂ Because I knew -- he said no  my parents say -- and this is really ironic  ﬁGermany is an -- an civilized country  and it wont be so bad  we probably have to work hard  and how long will the war will last ﬂ -- we all thought it would be short -- and then come back.
How did you feel about that war and about Victor being in it?
After the war  a lot people got married yes  because you know  life was  people were lonesome.
So my job was to travel all along the front wi -- as we were advancing toward the end of the war  and talk to interrogation officers who thought they had a prisoner who -- Who would fit this. --
Because I think that with the war  my childhood went  okay?
She was a -- She was a nurse during USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 3 World War One  treating German soldiers  and when she came to the United States  she became a baby nurse  took care of several important families  including Senator Javitz children  she -- she was the baby nurse for them  and died here.
Were sent to to the United States after the war  I imagine to go to Japan eventually.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  the war is still going on.
In 1940  it was the feeling that the war would not finish so quickly.
I wouldn't eat  my weight dropped Eva Edmands 37 [Date not labeled] Page 37 and finally had to be hospitalized for depression and you know  I'd often thought  why was it  it's so easy  would be very easy to say well the war did it.
Do you think -- during th e war years -- do you think that m-made an impression on your Jewishness?
No  not in July of 45  Im sorry  no  no  Im wrong  Im wrong  cause the war ended in May of 1944.
They went to Italy to fight the war  they were fighting the Americans and the British in there.
And she came  like  three weeks -- she came three days before the war broke out  the last minute.
Also  they organized  they established a concentration camp on the system that it was in Germany in this time because in Germany even before the war  they had a few concentration camp  which starting with Dachau  Buchenwald.
I was in a situation once like that almost at the end of the war.
It was at an old fort alongside the Versailles  across from Versailles  which I got to after the war.
And after the war  the father came   the first one back   and stayed with us.
When my mom got to the jail  she immediately started protesting that they arrested her against the law  that she was protected because she was a war widow.
There was a lot of movement in kids in England during the war.
We begin with this portrait of Alfred Munzer dressed in a Jewish National Fund costume for the Purim holiday  taken after the war  probably 1948.
And he got the medal of voluntary firer of the resi stance as well as the commemorative medal war with clasp of liberation.
So then he takes out from his drawer my thesis  and he hands it over and I see there was written excellent and I (laughing) remember the thesis was and in the Roman and Russian War. (
At the time the war started  he was forced out of that and became a school at a school for boys and he taught mainly Hebrew Jewish religion.
We moved to an apartment which  at the time  well  there were other feelings  there were feelings of jealousy for people  my friends  Leon and Regine and their parents  who had  we had been together for part of the war  but they had made it to Switzerland.
Yeah I guess they were prisoners of war  or just French prisoners.
And my aunt told me -- my aunts  after the war  that they constantly sent packages.
In a -- my uncles -- where my uncle lived  they had a barn and they had cows before the war  they used to sell milk or something.
That was the time of the GI Bill of Rights  after World War Two and there was such an influx of students that they needed to do something to - to house them.
Well  theres one question I want to ask you that -- which was -- we started to get to about before the war.
Nothing is going to happen to me  he said  I was in the war.
I went to chur after the war  we started you know  when you could worship freely again  I went to church with them.
We got there on May 5th  three days before the war was over.
The war clouds became darker  and Germany invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland  and the onslaught continued  but fortunately by then we had gotten the rest of my family either to this country or to England and finally from England to America.
Joe Schwartz landed in Italy  joined Troper  who was going to Eastern Europe  who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agen cies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off.
I remember these officer s in white uniforms boarding the ship  and satisfying themselves that this was a refugee sh ip  and you know  not a transport ship helping the German war effort.
And your your father was trying to escape being drafted  was that during the run up to the first world war  or when was that?
Ultimately what followed was Pearl Harbor and the entry of America into the war.
They did  and that lieutenant was be side himself because he figured like I was necessary for the war.
What I could not quite understand  is at the onset of the war  wh ich was still the the end of the Great Depression here in this country  and people again in this country  who really did not quite fathom the depravity that had occurred in in Europe   and how bad how badly things had gotten  and the reason I really mention this  because there were still people here in America that were striking for benefits.
So basically  was he with you in the hotel when the war broke out?
I remember that  pretty much to the end of the war too.
Got his license; and when the war started  he volunteered as a pilot in the army.
So afterwards  when I got out of the internment...uh...there was an episode and he re I am not absolutely certain about the...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events  but I know that my sister was evacuated to Spalding and I managed to be ther e. I managed to be for a few months there  working the land  because I was then at th e time on the war essential work order.
A lot of those claims were by the American relatives or...uh...survivors of th e Jewish population of Poland...uh...who were claiming properties that were confiscated or destroyed during the war or after the war.
By the time the war ended  you had even been in the partisans  lets say helping in the underground a little bit.
So I know the schul before the war used to be 5 or 8 thousand people used to take in  so we were maybe 500 people all in all what survived after the war.
We didn't know what it was  after the war we found out that it was some kind of a atomic research center that they tried to camouflage.
So I painted landscape mostly  and portraits; and  of course  by working in that  uh  office  I was  uh  assigned to a map that was hanging--huge  uh  war map--hanging in the commandant's office.
After the war  when I started walking  I was so weak that I couldnt not -- almost not walk.
Theyre very because I was so young during the war years  some of them are vague  some of them may be mixed in with things that I was told later  or once I came here  things that I had read read about  or heard about.
But in the meantime  we were making Gentile papers for ourselves to live through the war if we decided to run away before it's too late.
Families together  unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work both ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of the town -- functioning of the town  they eith er kept the one and send the rest  or they kept the whole family back.
But even that passes  and if they dont inform themselves and dont reach back and read the history and in get involved a little bit more closely into what perhaps into peoples lives  or into there have been some wonderful books written about World War II.
As a matter of fact  when the war over  we heard it over the radio  you know.
Oh  it was very sad because as you know  most children didnt survive the war.

>> Bill Benson: And through the duration of the war your mother had those.
Most of that film came from there that they had all of the newsreel film that had been shot all  all through the war  from the early days. (
you know) To me  the war was over  there would have been a peace treaty  and there would have been this.
Interview with William Hunley February 21  2014 37 Had you ever been to Europe before the war?
So  I went through it was a problem in Ghetto a big foundry  a big factory run by Germans and some Jews who before the war were foremen.
I probably was in excellent condition before I went  because when I when war was over I was very light  but the UGA when checked  they found out everything okay  was exceptional.
And during the war you know  World War II was partially par -partially financed by the American people .
It was his business and he is helping the government  the war effort.
And once was the war start  like everybody else  we we have to move into the ghetto.
T here was an Alan Wood Company and a Lukens Steel Company and about four generations ago  they kind of merged and a Lukens married a Wood and their first son Alan Wood was an officer in the Civil War.
And this is the photograph of my grandmother and my unc le  and they both survived the war.
You see  the following day the war was over too  and how I found out about it when we went to the...they was making a hospital out of a school house and uh I remember the incredible things.
>> Bill Benson: You told me \ Your life was beautiful\  in the early years before war broke out in Poland in 1939.
Of all the war  and -- and -- and -- and what they did to us.
And he came back after the war and I met him at a -- at a Jewish charity dance  and we became engaged and married.
Well  the family life...until...before the war  everything was  you know  normal.
You could go after the war and pick up the gold.\
Of course  now  because I have translated a lot of works on the Holocaust  I discovered - I have been discovering constantly new phases of the war that I was totally unaware of  because I didnt even want to dwell on it So  now  all these years later  50 years later  I am first finding out about   okay  I knew about the Lodz ghetto  I wrote - I translated a book on this.
I think that is a picture already after the war  when she was in Africa .
And  you know  one question I had  which you didnt talk about specifically in these interviews  is the final days of the war  the co nditions in the camp were just deplorable.
Someone opened the door of the car (these were closed cattle cars  not open ones) and we were treated to a most grotesque spectacle on the platform  where many prisoners were jumping and shouting  ﬁthe war is overﬂ  and in their excitement embraced some guards.
I found that they  they made friends but they made no close friends  after I mean their closest friends were people they had known before the war.
If we can go to th e back to the beginning of the war  can you tell me what you remember when the Germans -- what happened when the Germans invaded?
How about before the war when you were growing up  when you were a little girl  were there any relatives that had gone?
And the people in this community didn' t know Nazis  I mean  basically  after the war?
But that gradually faded [DL] And was that because of the air raids that actually happened... [AG] Yeah [DL] In terms of what you witnessed  er with the Jews and how the SS treated the Jews  did that haunt you after the war? [
They signed a separate Armistice and they formed a new government  which was a collaborationist government headed by Petain who was a hero  the hero called  from the First World War.
And -- And you probably heard or maybe I didnt mention to you  that when we came back  you know  after the war  after liberation  we came back home an-and remember I told you there was a Gentile man that  when I was alone and I was starved and I needed food  I -- I went to him and I told him I was hungry  so he offered me a glass of milk  a piece of black bread and a piece of pork.
They could build up their economies  like Japan did after World War two  and othe rs  with the help of the Israelis  but they -- their leaders are fighting  not even knowing what their -- they want  and every [indecipherable] they make  they dont live up to  you know  its -- its a constant problem.
And after the war I find out he become police chief in that area  because people were turning you in  you cou -- you didnt know who to trust.
Of course  no boat in his right mind was going to Cuba in those days  but it helped  because Germany was not at war with Cuba and Cuba was not at war with Germany .
Sixty-four yes  a Latvian Jewish girl who lived in Sweden during the war.
One part that we skipped in this was from the time you were captured  to your transport to the prisoner of war camp  and what your experience was there.
After the war  a year later I was just shooting in my studio  and a detective came with somebody.
Did they ask you about your e xperiences during the war at some point  or did you tell... did they know anything about your history?
Did you have any family in Europe at that time  at that time during the war?
>> Bill Benson: During that time  during those war years that you were in Kenya  do you know if your family members  parents and other family members  adults  did they have any contact with the family that were still in Germany?
I: It's April 1950 and this is where Rene and I saw each other for the first time since the war.
It's a miracle I tell you what happened  that the Germans lost the war.
But at war  nobody need -- needs lit -- literature [indecipherable] understand.
We wo rk over there until... ya I receive a package from Poland when the German were together with the Russian were friends  you know  until 1941 they started the war.
20 Then you stayed in Siberi a until the end of the war?
He was  during World War I  in the Austrian army as a physician and therefore then  wh-when the war started  the family went to Vienna from Chernowitz.
I knew  bec we tend to forget how much the first World War dominated thinking in the 1930s  still.
The Russian  the area that you had come from  was that still part of Poland at the end of the war?
I was very attached to my family  so when the war broke out  I worried so much about everybody  that Austria was not interesting to me.
What sort of long te rm impact do you think that all of these experiences during the war still have on you today?
And then the other thing that was wonderful  we had the Israeli soldiers  who were in the British brigade  came also to Holland  and they represented healthy young men who had fought in the second Worl d War  and were not persecuted  and so they were like symbols of health  and -- and -- and was wonderful.
Then  after war and that  then I think from Poland that the communistic government was so was sending delegation to take us back to Poland.
The obvious reason I asked that was clearl y during the war years you appeared to be a little bit resentful of it and so rt of embraced the security of the catholic church and all these other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about their Judaism  some felt irrelevant.
Because there is -- when we were visiting Czechoslovakia a few years later after the war  we went to this woods  where we used to go as children to pick wild strawberries and snowdrops  and there's a monument to people who had to dig their own graves.
I thought pretty much once Paris was liberated  for us the war was over.
They used to say  they used to talk to us saying that the war is near  near to the end  and this was the end really.
During the war you wrap all the food in old newspapers  and I would understand some German.
The war has started  my father has been se nt to the Isle of Man  my Uncle Paul has been sent to the Isle of Man  beca use here there were enemy -- enemy -- 163 Aliens. --
Because you know  the Chinese came  the Chinese then came  it was in the war  they were volunteers from China  the Chinese that came  and thats how I wound up in Korea  because the first pilots over there were all Russian  in Korea.
That is to say  the demographic revolution was what the globe what the war was about.
My mother had two brothers in America who had left Germany before the war.
My father was called on the f -- on the -- at the army  on the [indecipherable] from the -- when war began -- began.
Did anybody ask  since they knew you were French  or you told them you were French  what you had done during the war  were they curious or was it just not talked about?
And Churchill who was in opposition said you have to choose between dishonor and war.
Uh of course the the war doesn't look very good in '42  so uh the whole notion of going into any sort of resistance is totally utopian except under very extreme conditions.
Corre -- we -- we -- when the war -- the minute war was over -- Okay. --
Yes  I was working for a family then and then of course the war broke out  and I was in London and we  at one stage  went and sl ept in the underground stations to protect ourselves because of the bombing.
And the guards were not... They knew that it [NB: the end of the war] is more than nearer.
No  from a no  this was after after war  sh-sh I think she came in 19 fif 60 60? ‚
Jewish people  and a lot of POW  who were let out of the camps  the camps were open  the prisoner of war were open  and so these young people  these prisoner  young and middle aged  disbanded all 57 over they could go  seeking -- hiding in the farm   and every place  because the German began immediately trying to recapture them  and force th e Italian military -- of military age  who had been in the services  immediately recruited th em for deportation to Germany  allegedly for -- they were rebuilding th ings.
Now  while you were in the commando  did you still  in your own personal and private way  was religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?
The beginning of the war  theyd come and stay there  then go up to the fr to the front lines.
Fortunately we went shortly after Eisenhower had made his historic visit to Korea and the war was the fighting had stopped.
And the others were in the same -- same boat  and they -- they still -- I mean  they would eat on a Satu rday or Sunday morning  they would eat all the things that they would have eaten in Germany  and -- but -- but one didnt very much discuss the war at all.
When -- When -- During the war  when I lost my brother  who was my very  very best friend  and was a tragic thing  I -- I -- I cant even start to tell you.
It sounds like there were points during the war at which your faith was very deeply shaken  that maybe -- Yes  yes. --
There was one cousin who survived who went to Russia and who was not during the war in Chelm.
Tell us what it was like with the end of the war to go back to Paris and resume -- try to resume a life after all that you had been through.
However  and soon after the war broke out and I join ed the army and .
Your mother worked at the German headquarters for the balance of th e war.
You know  I was fifteen when the war ended  and I regret this very much  but outside my family  my family is the only one   and there are only two members living in my family and they are the only ones.
You dont lose sight or track of it in your mind  of what went on over there  during the whole war.
So the French lady was a wonderful  wonderful lady and she didnt like the Germans because they killed her son during the war  whatever.
Its still before the US declares war on Japan  if you Yeah  right.
Well  this war between uh the Partisans and the German soldiers lasted for eighteen days .

The one whose almost as We were playing together always  and then we  after the war was already  when he went someplace  he bought always something for me  not from the sisters.
But they figured  there is going to be a war  which eventually ends  an d sooner or later well be out of here  you know?
But basically  in my young age and until the war started  .. that I was somewhat re moved from death  because we didnt I didnt have a large family.
It doesn t do anything to fight the Germans– er– to help the Germans to fight the war.
By 1939 in September  I was supposed to come for the visa  but September 1  the war broke out.
Well  uh  when the war broke out in Poland  I was a Polish soldier.
And another distinction my family had  my father was a veteran in the first World War.
He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel  he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife  Zeporah  spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives  also her own relatives from her own family.
My father was in the Austrian Army of World War I; he was wounded.
Yet for him it was very important to give as many things as we could in order to make us feel that yes we live a normal life  and we are human beings  and we are just like all the other girls after the war.
During a 10 month period of celebrating the end of the war and the liberation of Luxembourg  I was at that cemetery 69 times in 10 months  officially  not c ounting times when I would take a visit or two  to visit.
Okay  and how howd you did you learn this after the war had ended?
I know of course that things dont always work on that kind of simplistic  linear  logical order  but do you think that the experience of your -- that your awareness of your mothers past and of the Holocaust and so on  and second World War had kind of sensitized you in a different way  or is that no -- is -- is that not -- set apart from it?
Carol: But as a matter of fact  an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the war when we were married at the end of the 50s  we didnt know whether to buy German products or not.
Okay  this was taken a bit later  I was at that time  possibly 10 year old  10 or 11  shortly before the war  and again its -- its -- brings back memories  of course  of my ch ildhood.
After the war when we met he ...found it) Where did you get the paper TL: (Russian--Our friends Rushuski wanted to leave the ghetto  got passports.
If I survived the war  and I didnt go to Palestine  this makes me somebody -- I dont want to say a traitor  but some -- this is my biggest regret.
He had and showed you plans for the rehabilitation of Budapest or the he lping of people after the war; is that right?

They didnt get along with  with the other Jewish athletes so they  they called them the RFJ was people who fought in the first world war  they  they were the veterans they started this club for athletics and they were able in some towns to rent or even buy I dont know stadiums where Jews could  could practice on but the facilities were pretty poor  pretty terrible but as I said we tried to do as much as we could to entertain ourselves and there was no  no coach capable of  you know anybody who was a little bit more of advanced like I was to tell me what  how to do it and what to do and it was just a very  very bad time.
These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany needed laborers  and they joined us.

13 The horses were wounded from the war  but also not enough.

The rest of them were prewar students whose studies were either interrupted by war in the POW camps or what have you and some were 26 a nd 30 years old.

And in fact  I had had relatives in Bittum who -- who had lived  before the war  in Bittum  were very wealthy people  owned a factory there  but none of them survived  all the descendants.
See  they se t up when the war started  the Barbarossa Operation started  there was a big empty square right by Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 109the central railroad station  so the Germans built a big screen to show their victorious march  drang nach osten   push to the east.

or not -- thats irreleva nt  but I knew there was a war  and I knew things were now suddenly being changed.
We had saved gasoline coupons and whatever to to make it  because gasoline was severely rationed during the war.
Interesting that after the war  and I'm ahead of my story  I found out that almost each Ghetto was operated on a different wave length.
And we ge -- and we went  came down to Geneva  and there was a -- a house there  not far from the airport  and I dont remember the name  but there was ot her refugees  but these -- these were not survivors  these are people who during the war they ran away and this and that.
They interned them  the families  all of them  all of us   for t he duration of the war.
In in August of I don I forget exactly what Well  the end of the war in Europe was in May Yeah.
And whole tragedy who was wars -- in Warsaw uprising  where we lose over 200 000 people  more Warsaw lose during 80 -- 63 days   more people like American army during the World War second lose.
There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 minutes before the war ended  and -- not 10 minutes  two days.
How these are successful in breaking the resistance of Ge rmans and prisoners of war.
Yeah  I liked it  but I mean  well  then the war started  it was all over.
So this was just right before the actual beginning of the war years.
And so this -- then -- then we saw the first time after war  and we were in the ghetto  where she was working for the department  and this the way it was  this is the first encounter after the war.
She went -- my father helped her come to Palestine after the war.
My mothers brothers were finally booked in 1940 on an Italian ship to Shanghai   which left  I think on the day of the breakthrough of the Maginot Line  which caused Italy to declare war on Britain and France  and the ship had to turn back because it didnt get through the Suez Canal.
Being...again we lived like on the 5th Avenue  my parents secured immediately an apartment in the future ghetto  and the always optimist Jew that we hoped war will end before we'll have to move.
And -- but she probably remembers qu ite a bit of -- from the war years.
But still  we were thinking  so much blood for this system  which was  you know  so much so much war  and so much revolution and everything for the Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 93 system   and finally  just fell.
I read   and other people have read   accounts on the Russian assault on Berlin and what life was like as they came into Berlin and what life was like in that devastated city in the months after the war.
Even during the war in the first part  there was still certain po ssibilities to come to America via Portugal or later after the campaign in Poland  vi a Siberia  by train through   but in September '41 this this was over and uh what I'm also sorry I forgot to say that we tried very hard but the German...the Americ an Consulate uh with which I was registered uh asked us very late to uh to uh to uh get our papers  our affidavits  but that was not easy to get in America and also the the Consul ate stopped very early to process applications.
Oh  he was -- it was kind of accident  he s -- he -- he glue to me after war  really.
He was not Jewish  but he couldn't get into med sc hool so he studied in Pola nd because of the war and all what was going on  he was coming back.
So we took USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 13 that -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it worked  because -- well  it didnt work with me  but it worked  because I later on found out that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the United States  I found it out and  you know  and -- but  by and large  a lot of people died after the war  from being fed by the English army  more food and fat food th an they should have had.
Well in the end of the war  that was another story.
Some were able to  when the war broke out  to go east  to the Russian side  eventually  they came back and few people.
In this time  and we were all classified since...since the war as...uh....neutral aliens and  of course  the English were...were not classified.
When the war was over we just said  I told the pastor I think we are liberated.
And they were stored there all during the war  and when I was in England already  and my mother was too  she paid for storage  all during the war she kept up th e payment through through an aunt we had in in Zurich   in Switzerland.
It it was just same like before the war  in Kielce  the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.
And the British told us: You have to go there  looking out only for the Jewish prisoners  war prisoners  we were liberated.
And he invites his friends over  and theyre talking about the Spanish Civil War  and theyre talking about social democracy of a certain kind  and in the end  they sing ﬁ The Internationale  ﬂ in Lithuanian.
indecipherable] Canada [indecipherable] Jews and so did the United States  but finally there was a -- Truman introduced a law into Congr ess and they -- to let in all refugees of the second war.
But I went through the whole story and I told him that -- that they had survived Bergen-Belsen and they are in Switzerland since the end of the war  and that my parents had been killed  and that -- that Im living with them for a year.
But after the war my parents stayed in close contact with her and in the early fifties she came and spent part of a summer vacat ion with us.
Only the Italy felt the war the war the the day it started.
Because I heard in the radio that your -- your f -- brother is alive  and is a prisoner of war.
This is -- this is my father during the war  during the second war.
And after the 14 war his best life was for him when he was in Israel.
He changed her nam e from Tola Weinstock  Jewish child  to Antonina Nowicka  Catholic child  6 months old  blondish hair  blue eyes  and paid three months in advance and thought  well  at least one of us will survive the war.
They had the letter from this man in England that he was taking me  so I got a permission to leave Germany in June 1939  which is three months before the war broke out.
And -- And thats also indirect  you know  a result of the war.
Did you talk to people about your experiences during the war?
You mentioned that you didnt cry during the war  did you cry afterwards?
And my mothers sister and family were already in the uni United States  so theyd send it you know  United States wasnt in a-at war with germ In the war yet.
And said that your aunt is in Shanghai and I want you to go there after the war because if we are not around  you have to be the  you have to be in charge.
So uh at beginning of the war  the Jewish people were around and concentrate in some big cities or small cities  but  in order to be easy to be controlled.
It was -- I want to say 29 April '44 -- was it '45 I think the war ended?
As I said  people that he knew Rum-cof-ski and people that supported his orphanage before the war  when they came to the ghetto he was very ge nerous to these people.
This is not meeting someone in war  it's not even the SS man killing an unarmed American sold ier or an American sold ier in Melai.
We get also after the war  we did a lot of people came over to the hotel  and they were smuggled out  and slept in the attic.
What about your hopes and dreams for yourself after the war and you got over your depression and you made the decision that you were going to go on living your life?
The waiting period from May 24 to the war started June 5.
When we were in Germany after the war  I mean after I got married  my husband was stationed in Germany in Munich  and we went up several times to Dachau and I looked and asked  but there is no way to verify whether or not my father was murdered in Dachau.
We were hoping that we can stay til we  til the war is finished  but it didn't turn out that way.
How aware were you  and how interested were you in -- in political situations that were going on in -- in those years  or in broader social and cultural issues  or were you more focused on just trying to build your own life  and your family   or were you kind of aware of some of the -- some of the things like the -- were yo u following the Korean war  and those issues  or -- or the -- the Civil Rights movement as it started up?
But the war was already known that it's lost from the Germans.
When you were working in this office at the start of the war  was there a lot of activity of Jewish people wanting to register out of the Netherlands when the Germans came?
And so some guardia civil  33 you know  the Napoleon guy with an old musket that must have been from the 1870 war  he says ﬁAlto!ﬂ and then he put us in a little  local jail and there they kept us for another day without feeding because everybody wanted us to sell  to give our watches  etcetera  against food.
>> Alex Shilo: I think my father just went on working   went on working his own job u ntil the very  very end of the war  after 1945  after the Armistice.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 5 Well  after the war -- you know  I was a dancer in Amsterdam.
And then during the war  he had to leave the business in Offenbach and move  to move the business into Frankfurt.
Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board  but we have left out one  in my opinion  very important aspect  and that is the preservation of the camp inmates at the end of the war.
I think that the first time I really felt Jewish was after the Six Day War.
So not until the end of the war did he know?
And then the school started September fi rst  and the war started  of course  and that was news  and everybody was liste ning to the radio  and everybody was following whats going on  and quite soon it was clear  you know  o-of the German superiority  which we thought even before.
And he managed to actually get that out of the ghetto and it survived the war.
This kind of left me very bad memories because after the war I had -- for 10 years I had that dream.
And when we came out  there were extras  on World War wa -- World War II broke out.
But the situation was still so  after the war  people were not recovering yet.
But with the advent of the Pearl Harbor and America entering the war  those documents expired  fell by the wayside.
My sister was a  my sister who during the war was living in Michigan  because her husband was in service and he had a job up in Michigan  she was now living in Newark where I was originally landed.
And  and later on  after the war I ask  I said  \ Oka y  I was not the only one to hear that report on 10 the BBC  so everybody was knowing it  was  was aw are what was going on \  and so forth.
So we set up a Montessori program in  in the -- in a chateau near Paris  which  by coincidence  happens to be the one where I had taught in a private school before the war.
After the Germans invaded  what kind of persecutions did you see in the kind of war you ended up being ------------?
And its Soviet Army telling us: The Germans are losing the war; we are chasing them; we are going to run after them ;a few days later some medics will come and help you.
Now  you were not terribly religious  although you observed certain holidays  prior to the war?
I -- during the war  because of my being locked up always in -- in rooms  I had tremendous energy  which first had to be satisfied.
Yeah  but I didnt know there was a war then  I just saw these people Okay.
They was born in wrong time  you know  I was born af ter the war  you know  Im lucky.
During World War II  we needed a great deal of shipping cap-capacity to ship the soldiers  both first to -- to Europe and then to Atlantic.
When the war started  he had to fight with the Polish army  the Germans.
We knew one thing  that Hitler will not give up Czechoslovakia unless there is a war  we wanted that war.
Mothers sister  younger sister had married after the war  remarried after the war because her husband was killed during the war.
A very unusual policeman  and I said to him  Dr. Tuma  I uh I was born and raised in eastern Europe also and most of my family perished in the war and in the Holocaust  and this man that we're talking about here  uh is responsible for the death of at least 400 000 people.
We are talking about -- I dont remember what she said  1914  19 -- way  way before the war or before the -- the revolution was.
And  right after the war ended  they formed  when I say \ they \  I guess it was the Joint Distribution Committee from the United States  UNRRA 4 at that point  and some other committees  formed displaced persons' camps  we called them DP camps.
I just meant to make the connection that Starachowice  the factory was -- before the war  the factory was in Starachowice proper.
We need guys like you cause you never know about the Cold War.
Yes  until the war started between Russia and Germany when they cut off the schools and everything.
>> Bill Benson: Back to a little bit about the early -- before the war began in your family  in the early years.
Th ey laid down their arms a nd went over to the Germans as prisoners of war.
And after that  I was transferred to England   but it was already after the war.
I think that they thought that they -- well  the war was winding down  and I think they thought they were not going to have to bl ow open any more bank vaults.
And if he lived through the war  he wou ld come and get us after the war was over.
And I remember something  because one of these people was engineer  he was waking -- working before the war was second in the -- in this sir -- sir -- sewer institution  you know  on -- in Warsaw  and he thought -- I know they cant answer very good  and he help us to go to this canal.
And I went  when the war ended  you know  I was excited.
I didnt find back my friends  my old friends from before the war  except one.
So when the Ru...Russo-German war broke out  first we had for a month the Hungarians.
Just a short time  it -- then when the war came  we knew who he was  and just -- Youre talking about in September 39?
And -- and so we spent all the rest of our nights in the -- in the -- in the last parts -- years of the war  there.
My grandfather   he owned a concrete factory before the first war yet.
She never thought of going to Warsaw until 1939 when there was talk about the war.
September 3  you first get the declaration of war of the English.
He married in 42  43– But during the war  he married?
But my mother  throughout the war years while Hitler was making his big noises and big moves and was dancing all over our graves all over Europe  even before the wa r broke out in the 30s wh en I was old enough to remember  my mother used to say (all the time I heard this) Hitler will lose the war (there was no war yet) - Hitler will lose the war but he will win it against the Jews.
These were Germans and Austrians  who during the war [NB: the First World War] got an uh...uh the Iron Cross  or any of the very high medals.
I -- I had no recollection of the Holocaust except after the war as a teenager by -- you know  I was 10 when the war ended  11 maybe  and b-by then of an age when all of this made sense to me  but -- and then Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 40of course my sister -- excuse me  my fathers sister  my aunt  who survived  Helene -- Helena  s-survived the -- the war in a Nazi work camp  what did they -- La-Labor -- Labor -- Labor camp.
So we were -- and then the war started  and the Germ ans first were -- and ther e were refugees in the station all along the stat ion.
So think that the war was over for them  they were losing.
He was sure that if the Germans lost the war  I am going to stay with you until five minutes after twelve.
We get into my cousins little blue Honda  and we go around the corner  and I ring the door of an apartment house  and this huge woman comes out  and throws her arms around me  and says  ﬁEddie  I didnt think you would make it.ﬂ I said  ﬁWho are you?ﬂ She said  ﬁDont you remember me?ﬂ I said  ﬁNo.ﬂ She says  ﬁMy name was Perk.ﬂ Her secret name was Perk during the war  ﬁBut ﬂ she says  ﬁI kept it.
So my father whose story is also of interest  at least to me  he had been during the First World War he was about the age of 14  15 and had worked in the store of an uncle of his who kind of exploited him so at one point he decided to go on his own.
And after the when when the war started  the Polish government left  and the president of the city was ste Ste   who fought against the russi Germans for a whole month  and he  in fact  became the head of the Polish state  and the Germans arrested him immediately after they conquered Warsaw   and shot him a month later  killed him.
And sh if he is in charge of the Palestine police then i-is there is something very close to total war between us.
Its still in June  its three weeks after the war starts Three  two weeks  I I I Okay  but its before the women and children are killed in the cemetery?
And so the -- but you know how peop le are -- let me give you my parents  my stepfather and my mother  when they heard that the Germans marched into Poland  they also heard on -- and read in the newspapers or heard from friends that the British and the French told the Germans if they don't get out of Poland in 24 hours  we're going to be in a state of war between Germany and Britain and France.
So  did he talk much about his underground activities during World War I?
For three  four months and there were a lot of German girls who spoke Italian and after the war I remember the UNRRA came and we could get some food packages from the UNRRA and all the interpreters I met there were Jews who had worked for the Germans just like we  Mimi and I and several others.
My father  by the way  was the youngest of six or seven  I for -- forget  two of whom survived the war  besides my father  but did not escape  they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in Germany  two sisters.
He was in Czechoslovaki a until the end of the war even after the war  fighting Germans and somehow he survived and he wound up in  in a camp  displaced persons camp  where he was in sort of citizens police  in camp police  as a policeman.
I dont mind going to the synagogue  but I dont like preaching and I dont like rituals  so its a bit of a tug of war within me.
When I stood alive after this  after the war  I went to see her.
war with Italy  where I was the doctor with six other reserve doctors  of a regiment of artillery in the of Albania.
And that eventually we had to ge t -- we had to get rid of war as a means of settling things.
We claim  we   the JSRO in the United States  claim that there should be about three million dollars on our best estimate  and that was an estimate made on the very  very crude business of taking a look at name s and lists and things like that  in the assets which had been vest ed by the Alien Property Custodian and which were being turned over to the War Claims Co mmission here in the United States to pay United States war claims.
Your family -- you only saw one brother after the war?
And the minute you talk international war cr imes tribunal to a great majority of the young people  theyre immediatel y talking about oh yeah  that -- thats in Bosnia  theyre getting those Serbs for raping somebody  and thats what the in ternational war crimes tribunal is about.
Laughter] Of course  when you were back in Paris in November of 1944  the war was continuing elsewhere until May of ‚45.
And my mother said  I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War.
I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge  I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish ex cept in an official capacity.
Uh the war as you know started in September  September 1st  1939.
And they -- they look at me like I [indecipherable] messenger that -- that the war is finished  you see  because they ent -- in they room  they enter not a German.
Once more  I remember of the tramway in GleiwitzGlivitz   and I was very interested by this tramway  and the whole atmosphere  because i -- the ga -- the war was before Formatted: Font: Bold Interview with George Kadar 64 April 24  2000 GleiwitzGlivitz   and the people -- people wanted to go away.
The interesting thing is you know when I was in Nuremberg and after the war in the course of the Russian advance against Germany and my aunt and two of my little cousins  two little children managed to escape to the dp camp in Berlin  and they can tell you and testify as to details of how things proceeded.
Uh  I don't remember much from the first few years of the war.
There was one whod been heavily wounded in World War I who survived.
Uh they had a special camp  a special prisoner of war camp and they were guarded by German...by German soldiers  by by by by by army soldiers  but they put them to work in that factory and when I heard this I said I have to come...I have to meet them.
And my mother was telling the nurse who was also a very religious man  Christian  she was telling him about the war experiences and about how we wer e saved  miraculously saved and his words were  ﬁWell  God must have had very special plans for you.ﬂ And I just exploded.
And thank you Mr. Brugioni for agreeing to speak with us today  to share your experiences  and your professional exper tise  as well as your personal experiences during World War II.
I was born in Poland  in the city of Lodz  the second largest city of Poland  and I lived there all the time  until the beginning of the war.
Before we get into the war years  Id like to talk to s at some length about what life was like before the war.
I dont think it was terribly damaged during the war  but its sort of touristy.
>> Bill Benson: When the war finally ends in May of 1945  your father is still in Budapest  but he's been able to establish contact with you.
Is -- after the war  we change -- we m-move to Krakow from Lvov and we change our names that it -- to Chyrowski  Kristina Chyrowski  because my parents thought that Chyrowski sound much more Polish than Heger  and f -- only f-fo r the safety reason  they change the name for Chyrowski.
Once the war started against the Russians  they Jews in our place were considered like spies.
This is is after Kristallnacht...uh tell us about you very briefly so that we can move into the war experience for you.
Well  when we arrived in Haifa  of course  that was a very emotional scene and then even tually  the war  basically  was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we  our movement went to a kibbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then.
And -- till one day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from Minsk.
My question is  when the war brokes out -- broke out  were you alone  away from your family  studying -- I was alone -- Mm-hm. --
That was an action that was actually originated by Albert Speer who was a German armaments minister and also in charge of construction in Berlin and he always tried after the war to sort of pretend that he was just a professi onal and did his thing for the armaments  but had nothing to do whatsoever with persecution of Jews or other minorities.
So if he was able to gather intelligence  and pass it on  being an himself an intelligence officer from the Soviet war  he knew how to do it  and he was able to maneuver it  and fortunately  a-as as I said  Leist was the one who saved many lives  including my fathers and my own.
Uh  war a [gundsgert ] [Yiddish: \ He was a \ ]...he was a good murder[er]  but he still was not the worst murder[er].
And that I have to say during the whole war  when people talked about relatives they had to leave behind  my grandmother always looked at them and said  \ Not me.
>> Lynn Williams: So the end of war wasn't always the end of horrific things happening for you.
He was in the Polish police before the war and according to the American Red Cross  I just got the news last year that he was liquidated 25 let's say  the camp was liquidated by the KGB in Russia   the name of the camp.
He fell in the war of independence and the other son died suddenly of a com... The eldest has some issue  yes  there are some.
And and thats all within the first week of the war?
The European council was made up or theoretically made up of the leadership of the various committees and the various countries in which we operated but that never came to be because of the war with germany which came on too soon after one had the inspiration of establishing the European council.
Was it influenced by the fact that the war had started?
Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19  2013 18 He was in the war  he was in the navy during the war.
Now youre working and you stayed there until the end of the war.
Without a certain atmosphere in post-war germ -- post World War Germany  it would have been quite different.
Did you think youd be going back to Europe when the war was over?
I dont think that we had thought that through  and even if we did fumble towards an understanding that their inner world was not being addressed  such was the -- the kind of culture of the day  that the idea that -- you see  Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by war  where the message to everyone was to -- to ju st put the past to rest and lets move forward.
And so far  Hitler was taken from out of that criticism  while certainly all the soldiers would say  after the war  then we will change the regime.
Interview with Robert Max July 14  2015 19 Oh  that would have been well  surely after war was de -declared  so the early It after 41.
In the first year of war  we had to now livings and there was a tremendous shortage of food so everybody was smuggling food from the countryside  from peasants.
I dont know how he felt about the Korean war  except for the fact that he was drafted and he had to go and he -- he was sort of brought up in a well-to-do family and he never experienced anything like the six weeks of basic training.
So they were able to get people out throughout the whole war?
I finished public school  I went to business school  and I never finished because the war came.
No  but we were well to do  but not until ju st before the war.
And the third time was when Hitler started his war against Russia.
In the beginning maybe some  but I wasnt there  but during the -- the -- the height of the war it wasnt.
And we started to go  yes  and this was the hour  no  or the saya  no  its not the saya  this is -- was a -- hard to say  this was big tragedy because hide -- at the moment I saw everything possible that war is giving us.
Did you tell each other about your experiences during the war?
And one of the letters I still received from my parents  or were given to me after the war  said that now  also  the birds have been taken away from them.
They had houses from before the Civil War  and whatever it is.
And they  you know  during the war my ears were very long.
Not and the Third Reich  in which he propounds the idea that had Germany won that war  Paris would have become the capital of his new Europe because that was the main gem in the cr own of his uh conquests.
Did he ever go back to his home- town after the war.
There was a the settlement was consisted of the soldiers th at were given land  which was taken over by the Polish governm ent after the first World War  and it was given to the soldiers that fought for the pr freedom of the Poland. [
Day before  at evening  in a tavern  crim inals  Polish for murder  I dont know for what he was in jail  but when war break out  and the and Polish army withdrew from the town  they opened the jail because they didnt want to leave people locked in in jail  you know.
Now  I understand from Radu that later on they recognized those schools  you see  after the war  you see  in the they went back my brot her went back to the regular state school.
For instance in the Hajda case  we could talk because we had  through a three tier ed level of documentation  contemporaneous documentation of individuals who were in the Traw niki system  and who served at the Treblinka 60 labor camp  individuals who afte r the war testified in western countries  where there was -- where you didnt have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like  that they had indeed been there  and done this  that and the other thing  and then of course  the Soviet protocols  in so far as the information contained therein was consiste nt with the original documentation  and the testimony in the western protocols.
So they were very impressed  I would say and -- and also I felt that -- that I had something tell my fellow officers  that I was a good influence to my friends and colleagues  and they saw it from a different viewpoint  they thought it was something  having been there  not hating the Germans  but that I could add something to it  which was actually true  because I was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 107 involved once in writing up a plan in Korea  for prisoners of war  not to mistreat them  because we didnt do that  we went by the Geneva Convention  and because of my experiences  I was very sensitive to when a guy becomes a prisoner  not like I became one because I was a Jew  but to become the prisoner in the field  in -- in war time  that they are not to be mistreated  or to interrogation -- what do you call that -- tortured.
Can you tell me a little bit about life in Koretz before the war  what you remember?
Didn't she have an interesting experience in Germany after the war?
When we went somewhere I remember because after the war I went to take a look down there.
Occasionally when I -- I do go and give talks to schools -- high schools  colleges and places -- groups of people  Ill talk about the Holocaust -- about the war time  and so on.
And she was apparently able to persuade the Germans to let her do humanitarian things  taking you know  reuniting children after the war who were in Holland and Belgium with the parents who were in southern France   etcetera.
So my cousin was shifted from one place to another during the war.
He had a cousin  he was an invalid too after the war  who got hit in the head.
So  we fought till the 25th  seventh  whatever the two weeks  three weeks; and I ended up  I became a prisoner of war.

And  so in order to do that  I couldn't stay in that  see that school was  as I said  in shambles  it was the remnants of a pre -war  very  very fine Jewish school  but because  so the system in Belgium was that if you went to public school  you could get into univers ity after graduation  you didn't need to take a special test.

He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in No vember of 1918  he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks and went into Russia and never came back from the war until February 1919.
He emigrated later on after the war in 1946 to New York and switched to psychiatry because of the drugs.
And all of a sudden th ey come and they say the war  a war broke out.
And the Poland that I kne w from before the war was no more.
This was right in the middle of the last winter of -- of the war.
I was that time 25 years old already  and my wife  because we were married three years before the war  in 1936.
And that was the extent of travel I did before the war.
What attempts were made by your parents to find relatives or friends after the war was over?
Yeah  or you know  was it during the war  or Gee  I dont remember whether there was still war.
And you know  that became a a new f lifestyle  that totally took me into a new world  and therefore  the war had sort of vanished completely from our lives from my life.
Uh our parents saw to it that we had a good education and though uh we we longed...belonged to a called...would ca ll it here to the middle families  uh and things were tough in economical terms uh after the war  during the inflation and later the Depression  but uh as I say our parents saw to it that we had a solid education  a solid uh general education and also a solid Jewish education  so we all...my sister a nd I  we went to a to a to a upper elementary schools to high schools.
We were just talking about the people who came before the war  how did they -- how they cant comprehend these -- the -- the experiences of a survivor.
Was it hard to live up to that ideal after the war ended?
And I Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10  2001 73star I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the assassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war.

From what I understand  Poland had the fifth largest army during the second World War.

And there is corollary to that  that if the war is not over by this Christmas  then it surely will be over next Christmas.
The family name was Wi eisz and after the war  in 1948  they changed the family name to Varga  because of the situation in Hungary at the time.

In fact  after the war  I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to hi m because later on  he was in jail  I mean  yeah  in jail for many years after the war.
It was in the paper  this was in the paper that the the German  because the Poland started th-the war  so the the German made attack  and they are continuing to occupy Poland .
Do you want us to make a war with Russi a to defend Poland?
Uh as I say  this question came up more after the war when I asked the people what...we we...on the other hand  peculiar as it may sound  we were so glad to see them because we were...when the att ack came  for instance    the only protec tion we had was outside in trenches where you could see these hundreds 11 and hundreds of fortresses  of flying fortresses  coming and and and and ther e was hardly any anticraft fire from from the Germans.
You see  because we didnt fight with -- for Gods sake  we didnt fight 74 with the Soviet Union  we fought with German  but all the time  in history of the second World War  sorry  Soviet army was our enemy from the 17 of September  1939.
A friend who was in Lodz after the war was telling me that he attended the Beebow s trial  and Beebow all the time said that they should ask Erici Yakobovitch  Eric Yakobovitch  like what Eric RG-50.030*0580 61Yakobovitch will say  would would would have much importance after the war.

Now  the DPs who came  also didnt have the education  because Germany inv ited -- invaded  you know  much earlier  and they looked at me  and I guess they thought we were stupid  and they just put us in the same pot of the people who ga -- dont fo rget  during World War Two  there was no immigration  and they pu t me to put piecework.
Anthony: Were you surprised  or was your father surp rised  that the war ended so quickly and so disastrously  or was it expected?
But somehow  we knew each other  evidently he thought more of it than I did  because he took  you know  all the pain to find me after the war  you know.
And I said to the Jews  \ Was being a kapo a war crime?\  \
As I said  I take a chance if the war [indecipherable] with the army only to stay [indecipherable].

By this point was he talking more about what his experiences had been and his views had been during the time th you know  i-in Lithuania when the war started  or not so much?
There was also an aktion in the war  and -- >> Bill Benson: An aktion?
I basically rescued my mother more than on ce during World War II and I said no more piano and I never sat down to play the piano.

We all had a very bad time before the end of the war.
But now after so many years  the people in that town  they talked about things which happened during the war which happened to me and that is why 16 people  they are poor people  they came all the way to my 27 reception to the south  and they had to drive several hours  maybe three hours to get there.
Then when the war broke out in 1939  when the Germans came in the first thing what they did  they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and put into the synagogue and they had to take out all the  you know  and everything the...and everything and put on the sidewalk and burn themﬂ. Only Jewish people have to do this.
So we kn ew about the Magino line  we knew about the problems of the bombings of England and so on and until America entered the war  for us it was happening in another place.
I got a Purple Heart  which I didn't pick up until at the end of the war.
So there are lots of things that and as I said  after the war nobody ever thought about that we were in shock  that we need somewhere help or anything.
What was school life like  from your earliest memories now  going back before the war.
So they -- anyway  they took out the baby  with my wife  and they too -- put them in a room  where before the war they used to wash the bodies  prepare for regular  you know  burials  you know  normal funerals  and they were waiting for me over there.

He was there with my father  and after the war I found out that they both died there.
There was one in particular who had lost everything also in the war.
In Germany nobody owned a gun  my father didnt own one  although my uncle owned a saber  which he brought back fro m World War two  but -- so I was very particular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education  in the same time serving your country  and seeing to it that we remain a democracy.
So uh we philosophized that the war would  would be over and we would never have to leave our homes.
>> Bill Benson: As you mentioned  of course the war is going on.

O.K. When the Kristallnacht happened in Ge rmany  my father decided at that time that his son has to get out of Germany if he cannot get out of Germany and my father was one of those Germans who believed because he se rved the German Army in World War I  that they would not touch him since he was d ecorated and in the beginning they did make exceptions but later on it was all the same.
I had been asked -- when I first came back I had been asked  I had to report at Keenan's request amongst other things to report to the Attorney General and the War Department.
How how do you think that that those experiences in the war and then in the camps  how did they shape you as a person?
The horses at that time were simply roaming the fields  some of them being injured from the war.
And who go have the -- we go expect a war with the Lithuanians and Poles.
And of course my you know  not knowing how long the war would last  I guess my parents already began to have some concerns about this happening their son perhaps drafted at Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18   1997 31some time into the war  although that didnt occur at that time  although later I was drafted during the Korean War.
I finished four classes  and I supposed to go to fifth  but you know  the war came.

But the  by the time we got near  the people knew the war was over because airplanes and radios  they had  somebody had a radio--they had one radio in the camp--and they knew the war was almost over.
We never went because the war was over there too  was winding down  was over there shortly after that.

Read something about the Pacific war  if theyre interested  read something about the war in Europe .
I'm trying to place your family  your family  to get a sense of it  how any of the rest of   your father didn't respect the Nazis  and yet they sort of lived during the war  your father got some good jobs.

They made gl ass and it was  in that time it wa s a war  so they put pieces of metal in it.
I know exactly where youre speaking They took after the war  they put up a lot of the displaced persons up there  and the place was covered like a forest  because the Germans had secret installations there  were testing  I believe there  buzz bombs that they were shooting over into England.
Now  the war itself  when I did you first become a-aware?

Oh  it is a a building that was built for during the second World War.
This was the after the war  we tried to to make a dress and we tried to to buy shoes  but the the United States send us the Joint send us shoes  clothes.
When the war ended  I walked to liberation with two different shoes.
In the Pacific war  I have  for many years been intrigued by the total neglect and the discussion of the Japanese plans of which we knew  to kill all allied prisoners of war.
Well  we tried to bring them up for them to know what went on in the war  and to be open about it  and to be strong.
If a war breaks out tomorrow and they need me  I go.
I think after the war from the 600 that were supposed to be liberated maybe 30 survived.
I don't think they would give me up or what  they wanted to adopt me after the war because they had a sick girl  retarded  they wanted to adop t me and my uncle didn't want me to become Catholic.

A ll of a sudden one day we were  I was plowing I remember  and I had to have al ways a guard on my tractor wi th a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so cl ose to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp  an Is raeli POW camp  guarding Arabs during the War of Independence  so he le arned some Arabic from them.

What Id like to do is talk a great deal about the world  and the life that you had before any of these events  before the war started.
So it was not that the Germans were strafing the fields as much as they did at the beginning of the war.
And a lot of people even if they didnt have that yet  they got themselves a number  and a lot of them did have the affidavits  but the war broke out So they were caught.
The idea that there was a actual war going on was...was ludicrous in our eyes.
We didn't know even that was the end of the war  but you hear rumors..people used to say things but this wa s already the beginning of 45.

Like for quite some time we never talked about the details that happened during the war.
In this time when it become the war prisoners  Russian war prisoners  run away from the...from them...from the Germans.
He survived the whole war in a Polish forest with a group of partisans  or by -- and by himself.
There were some  I understand  some French prisoners of war were there  and maybe a few Czechs  and so and so.
Now  unfortunately  the Polish government  the army  they didnt have not only enough uniforms to -- for recruiting young people with military age  but they also didnt have even -- they didnt have any arms  and few days after the war started  in the beginning of September  the Polish government  including th e president  escaped to Romania  was neighboring -- neighboring with Polan-Poland.
One was killed in the first World War  in the German army  fighting for Austria.

So youre -- After the war  you know  you -- you sort of welcome this  you know Zionism  and -- and identified in that way with -- did it feel like giving up a -- a dream  or was it the [indecipherable] Wait a minute  I didnt get that.
So to that extent maybe I have a certain amount of paranoia that I can trace back to the war.
The war years in -- in a way  well its a Interview with Arlette de Long 17 paradox  but when I was 10 and I moved to live in the suburbs of Paris  this was to me a much more painful event than any of the war years.

And maybe that was one less gun that was used in the war  who knows.
First  in...in...especially when the war was going on  you could have walked around in every home and do anything you wanted.
So after the war I had my examinations there  I studied medicine there.
By the way  when I went to Holland  after the war  I went to high school.
The way I found this out was after the war  I went to Germany as a translator for the US War Department  and when I was in Germany  I used to go to th e Joint Distribution Committee in Munich every week to see if I could find their names.
I was working with my father because up to the 42  I was working for -- because in my school  high school  you mu -- before the war  you must know the other language.

Well  were as a matter of fact  we we re pretty sure that  although they were not taking parcels to him  that he was still there  because there was my sisters friend  my gir her girlfriend  when she wasnt a she wasnt deported  so she was there  and she  after the war  she told us that she saw my father about a month month or so after we were deported  he was being led to the railroad by with a group of other prisoners  and she knew my father well.
In fact we once went to Germany  since  since we immigrated here  but that was only one day  but I don't know what the German mind is now  but I remember one thing  that after the war  our neighbor  non-Je wish neighbors  wrote to my father a lot a nd they and I still have the letters  in German  that they were good friends and they are sorry for what happened in Germany and so forth and of course they wr ote  also said  they suffered a lo t  but that's not comparable to what the Jews suffered  because an yone else  even I tell most of th e young people  too  anyone else who suffered  if he would accept the Nazi policy  would not be persecuted any more  Jews were persecuted whether they did or not and it was a purpose  so therefore I'd like to know  what the German attitude is now.
Yes  I was  you see  a -- during the war  as -- I was the -- say  I did the first degree in my technical education.
When the war broke out  we figured we were going to run to Russia  but the Germany army was moving so fastŠ It caught up to you.
And he -- he wouldnt throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over  and we heard a mortar come  and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasnt going to do this  so I dodged the way Id learned to dodge it  and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured  he was 60 out of the war.

You came home and whatever you had in your cupboards - and I imagine my mother mu st have stocked up on things because the talk of war was so prevalent.

USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 13 How much were you aware of what was going on in the country  or with the war  or -- or in terms of what and where  with interest to Jews?
Urban families who so -- survived the war  or came pre-war  so it was not coming into middle America.
I dont know how they got all this furnitu re back after the war  or I dont know anything about that.
So they had a selfish interest in cleaning up the  the Jewish inside the country rather than the war effort.
It was in the mountain  and you no see the war in this place.
And our job for the time after the war  where there was nothing available and everything that we had was -- for us was appreciated and grateful  because we were in the camp  we had only one shir t on for months and m onths and months and we were full with -- with the lice and all that  so i-it was hundred percent improvement.
You know  and we know little bit more because we have Polish people who live in Berlin before the war -- Mm-hm. --

I had very wonderful friends from before the war that didnt survive the war.
Well  whenever they had something they le t us do something for the war effort  but I don't remember right now what it would have been.
If that quota number had come through and had not been a war declared  eventually my parents would have gone to America  14 and we would have joined them.
And they got caught during the war in ‚41  I dont know  over in Prujena .
So you  when you were growing up before the war  you only went to first grade?
And oh  we were so happy  not because the Pearl Harbor was bombed  but because the Americans were -- entered the war and if they entered the war they will win and we will survive and well live.
And then we pi cked out one -- a native Krakowian  who survived the war in -- in th -- in the Russia  and later he joined the Polish army  and he came back with the Polish army  and so he -- wi -- and because he was a native Krakowian  and so he was very important  and then we -- they invi -- they picked out the other men with us  so three of us  we got th e order to go in to see how we can find out where the people who -- who built those things are  maybe we can prevent from the destruction.
When you are in war  you don't have to tell a man to clean his gun.
Well  it  I  the rest of that first day when I met the young woman uh is a ---------- somewhat nebulous in my mind  and I had to go back to my  to my unit because the next day  May 8th happened to be the official end of the war  and uh  there were masses of surrendering German troops  and I had to help uh process  and uh  so I was kept quite busy for a number of days before I could go back to ---------  but uh  I did manage to go back there a few days later  and uh  I  of course  I uh would never have forgotten the  the impression this girl had made on me  and I I found her soon among the many others to whom I talked in the hospital  and I uh  at that point I learned that she  she had collapsed on being admitted to the hospital and was listed in critical condition  but um  I talked to her  and  and she seemed quite lu cid  and we had a lengthy chat  and...I  I  so I made it my business to come back to the hospital as often as I could do it  all  not only to check on the progress of  of all the others  but  but in particular this  this girl  and the more I talked to her  the more I realized uh what a sensitive human being she was and that she had had something very special about her  uh  call it an aura or whatever that that certainly interested me  and uh  so from that point on uh a relationship uh um developed uh that uh later became even closer.

How involved were your parents at Whittingehame when the war was over?
Anthony: The war was still on during all of this time?
It looks very dilapidated and it must ha ve been taken after the war ended  I dont know.
A Peretz was a famous scholar [writer] or I think that was probably related with the history of Palestine before the war  so there was such a home like an organization where they met.
He -- after the war  he moved to Frankfurt in Germany just as my mother moved to Berlin with her sister Krysia.
Which is something I di dn't know until after the war.
He was a good Nazi  he believed that they were going to win the war  and he would theyd go on vacation  and theyd take  of all places in the world  New York City .

Estonia had that  Latvia had that  war was goi ng on  you know  the situation was unclear  how the war will develop was not clear.
It was a Jewish progressive school run under rabbinical supervision until the beginning of the war.
What about when you came to America and youre here in the 1950s and youre in the midst of the American response to Co mmunism during the -- the Cold War?
And so I went to  so there w as a Jewish school which had been flourishing before the war  but at that point it was just sort of in shambles and the teachers were themselves survivors and nothing that relates to modern pedagogical methods had reached the shores  even among the non -Jew ish teachers  I mean they were still pretty much versed in ancient methods of discipline and  and as I said  the class was made up for  of all kind so of people  all kinds of ages and some spoke just and some spoke Polish and some spoke Hungaria n and some  you know  it was just really the Tower of Babel and  but I knew French and that was a big advantage and... How many languages did you know then?
Is that -- she said before the war  can you talk about that?
About this war I would like to say that the Jewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great.
He -- after the war  th -- we had a problem.

And on the Sabbath  in this one room  when during the day we would not light -- there was no light  the most beautiful time was when later in the afternoon -- we went to synagogue in the morning  but later in the afternoon we would crawl in bed with Mother and Father  and my father would tell these stories about he served four year s in the war -- in -- on the side of Germany  incidentally.

Before the war started I got two years in Polish school  and two years in the Russian.
They came  and he was renting a lower room for one night in somebody else's apar tment and he heard them coming and he was on the way out  and they came to his apartmen t and they were in the room before his  and he watched them through a crack in the door  didn't know how to get out and suddenly they we re preoccupied with finding a World War 1 bayonet in somebody's dresser dr awer and the man to whom it belonged was anxiously explaining what this was and so on  they were all clustered around him  so Dad marched out of the room  snapped a Heil Hitler salute and they didn't turn aroun d  they said Heil Hitler  he walked past them or out.
But still I -- I told about my attitude in the war  and I told them about the two sisters  Eva and Leah  of Alfred and told them about Alfred and they always feel very uncomfortable th -- when you talk about it.
We -- And the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 49 situation between the nations in Europe is much better than it was before  and so we have learned by the war  f-for Denmark to go into NATO  thats okay.
I want you to tell me about the ending of the war and so now you are in Nostach .
Well  I mean  we can get into the psychological and psyche -- psychiatric aspects of this  but I-I -- who -- I played at war  and war was play  and it was not fearful.
>> Bill Benson: The question is when did you find out really what your parents went through  and did they after the war talk about what they went through?
Butand then my father joined the American Army when the war broke out here  and disruption again.
So a lot was happening during this time  and Im wondering what did you know about the war  and what was going on.
We were in on Lake Garda when the war was over.
Was what wer what are these topics  is it about the Holocaust  about what happened to the Jews  or the overall war experience?
He was one of the biggest murderers in World War I what was killing Jews  pogroms.
I was very disappointed after the war to find that had been bombed  and it co there was nothing left of their house or their factory  whatever youd want to call it  and ever ything had completely changed.
I learned it this was my upbringing from home  that I had the strength to act this way  and le t's face it  I do it after the war too.
I feel  I have a deep feeling the fact that the post war German government starting with Adenauer an d subsequently have done a terrific job of redemocratizing their society.
We went to Israel in ‚67  right after the six day war  and we stopped in Rome.
And he was a director of it before  and after the war the Americans put him back in a director.
And  uh  we were together-- the whole family was together 'til the war broke out in 1914.
Because he wrote a book about Dutch Jews and the war.
You operated with your hands the same as your feet and would you believe that this is something I never expected and we had definite knowledge that Germany is losing the war because for the first time they allowed us to have some kind of entertainment.
They are much closer to the last war we fought in  the desert or in perhaps Vietnam if theyre a little older and went through that era.
So finally we were ready to go leave the camp  the war was over and they say we cannot go to Poland now  cause why?
From the town...yes... How many Jews were left after the war was over?
When the German army came close  we were afraid  I remember still at that time that we thought  oh  we will not survive the war  this -- because we cannot fight tanks  and -- and -- and cannons will come back  a organized army.
>> Bill Benson: The important thing  among many  to think about here is this is just months befo re the war is going to be over.
What about -- Im still staying with the thread of things that have made your life meaningful since the war  and it s -- this  the largest portion of your life  the -- the past 50 years.
And was the war  she had already one child  a little girl.
At best -- There was an article in the paper  thanks to the courage of our President Clinton  and to NATO  that a change in this attitude finally came about  when we declared war on Milose vitch  who was oppressing his own people  and abusing the other minorities within Yugoslavia .
And then I left and then I -- I decided with the Nazi time  and I say it in these words  something wonderful had broken with the end of the war.
Im referring to the war against the Soviet Union in 1920.
However  what happened  bec ause it was war -- he was in the meat business.
And around us is a big coshmak  you know  dreadful -- not dreadful reality of the war  occupation.
The Cold War  with your early interest in Zionism and Marxism?
And  uh  when after he talked about blood  sweat and tears  and they're going to fight them on the beaches  they got so depressed because it meant the war was still going to be longer than we thought.
And I think it just grabbed my attention perhaps because of my experiences during the war as it was Nazi power  with the Nazi Germany as a great power  that perhaps  Anita Frank 75 [Date not labeled] Page 75 perhaps I felt that understanding the Soviet Union better might help me do something worthwhile or some  something like that.
And for instance  we knew absolutely nothing about the suffering the Jewish people were -- underwent  but the war broke out in my n - country  actually in May -- on May 10th  1940.
Before the war  can you tell me about the J on passports  and how the underground removed yours  and then -----------------------.
Whatever it was group he was talking to as a speaker  a good one  and he was a I think he was a lawyer for the war too.
My father after the war used to say where was he when we needed him the most  and I said he couldn't take care of all of us.
Irving Hass: Flossenburg was bombed during the minutes what you call the – during the end of the war w hen we already in the forest Š they bombed it.
Noth ing more  nothing le ss  but the Jews... After the war?
I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw.
And of course the girls and the only time that I saw her during the war was on the street.
She had two brothers  one brother and at the time before the war and after the war she had some more sib lings  her parents had some more children and it was quite remarkable because her father was sent to a separate place  separate USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 4 concentration camp from Nomi and her mother and miraculously that family survived and was reunited after the war.
I would have never considered– What about after the war when you were in Budapest  were you thinking a lot about Sandy?
From Poland   but not -- no  I met him after the war.
But because of that bad food  we had all gotten phlegmones  I dont know if you know what that -- people in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it.
And I guess that made them feel good and it made them and some of them were too young to even reme mber the war and they learned something and they actually met somebody  you know  who had lived among them and it was just a great experience for them and for me.
He survived the war  but she never forgot what I done for her son.
Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 82 Telling her  I am treating here all the wounded German soldiers  and they are all very much afraid if Germany is losing the war.
She was a Polish woman  and came during the war asking my parents to move.
Had to be in the spring  because it was just too cold And th and and the war ended May n May ninth  I believe it was  so Right  yeah.
And we heard the orders that everybody has to go to war against the...the Russians.
And I can understand those feelings  b ecause actually I was born in -- in what was Prussia then  because Prussia didnt become a non -country until after the war  I think 47 or 48  when they decided to eliminate the country as a c ountry.
I stayed in camp a while   until the Germans were losing the war with Russia.
The end of 38  starti ng about 39 right before the war. {
After the war we found out that this transport was taken to Auschwitz concentration camp.
They were so protective of even the the men  I dont know what they were doing during the war  but they protected na us against the Russian RG-50.030*0584 67soldiers  because the Russian soldiers were drinking a lot  and ready to rape if they even a skeleton  they were ready to rape.
These were war years  and they were difficult years  but not terrible years.
Because the Interview with Guenter Lewy 21 March 18  2013 No  but I meant before the end of the war.
Before we talk about the war years and the Holocaust and what it meant for you  let's begin with you telling us a bit about your family and your community before the war began.
I had to work full-time and I had to give up  but I know that I studied a lot  and I even took some...a lot of Hebrew during the war.
He worked  as I said  for CBS  for their foreign department  during the war.
Now we lived there  the apartment has been divided and was given right after the war by the Sovi ets  was given to their two Generals so  one of the Generals still lived there  he didnt want to let me in and the other part belongs to a widow of the General.
I finished my fourth grade just in 1939  and we also finished some of the Hebrew school  not everything  because the war started.
Before the Russian occupation  you mentioned in the first interview that you had been attending school and that you had dreams of becoming a professional and -- tell me a little bit more about your -- your educational experi ence and your hopes before the war began.
And so I became an instant expert  as a lot of us did in those days in the War Production Board  and in the Government  generally.
You know  like when we were coming back from the woods  when the war broke out  I saw dead horses on the road.
So the Germans permitted all the farmers who do need help  if they see a prisoner of war  because that's how they were able to get hold of the prisoners that were in hiding  that all they have to do is register them.
Yes  we had heard that the war was not goin g well for the Germans and that the Russians were coming close.
These were just airplanes or whatever because the war was on already  1943.
So the American war department was kind of desperate so they took me.
There was when a group wa s accused of sabotaging the German war effort and some people were  in this  this was a common  not very common  but occassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough  to sabotage the German war effort.
I was born during the first World War and we were evacuated into the hinterland -- German   by Austro-Hungarians  which operated this sector of the front.
So the fact that he was a war vetera n and a physician didnt make any difference?
He just graduated gymnasium  and befo re the war the talk was after he would graduate gymnasium  of course  you couldn t send him to Germany to study at the university.
This was -- this was from the first day -- no  from the first day of the war  to the day what was Warsaw  you know  capital  you know  surrendered.
You know  after D -- don't forget  after D -Day the war was not over  even in the south of France.
And the British said  in that case  Great Britain will declare war against Lithuania .
We should have in 1945 at the end of the War  found 960 000 Jewish children in Poland.
Did you and your mother talk about the day -- about the war  and your experience together in Bergen-Belsen very much?
No other country iin occupied Europe every organized this type of a evacuation formation of large number of troops  which ended up about over 200 000 at the end of the war  of Polish troops in that navy  paratroopers and 15 squadrons of the air force  all all branches  from bombers to fighters.
And I'm going to mention her name  because she's so well known: Andree Salomon is known by everybody for her incredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war.
And it seems like not some kind of a military or or or economical anal ysis  but because the Nazi ideology  that generation knew Germans from the first occupation during the first World War.
When you were in Bergen-Belse n in the middle of 1944   did you hear any news of the war?
Let's beg in  before we turn to the actual Holocaust and the war  with you telling us a little about your family and their lives prior to the rise of nazism and its impact on your family and your community.
Thank God there is not  an-and I hope that theyll never be war  I dont want them to go through anything like that again.
Were you in Warsaw then  or in It finished the war  maybe a week after finishing the war.
As a matter of fact I think the hearings were calle d ﬁMobilization for War.ﬂ They were also invest igating the extent to which American industry helped  contributed to Hitler's war machine  before and during the war.
Okay  I didnt care too muc h. The war broke out already.
He was during the First World War he was a legionnaire an d of course he was in touch with the United S tates and England and so on.
And these black market operations were not of course only Jewish -- everybody was participating in them because Germany was vulnerable  its economic system was vulnerable  because of the war  to that kind of activity.
And then when the war was coming to a close  the Germans decided to evacuate the camp.
As a matter of fact  we were very well aware what he was doing  and as a matter of fact  lot of people were predicting da what would happen in the future  that there has to be a the wa second World War with the Germany being the aggressor.
The only thing that I dont eat  which really was sent to us after the war by my grandfather when they would send us care packages  is Spam.
Uh the going to war was not popular in this country.
But now they named it back to what it was before the war.
and I was very puzzled by that question  and he told me he had been a student at the Yale Law School in the First World War.
As an-and then  I remember that during the war we also said that if we separate  then then those people will be our contact.
Uh uh I had...I think this we covered already...I had the good fortune to begin...to become their friends  so they shared the news with me which they got illegally with their receiver  so we knew that certainly the war for Germa ny was lost and especially after the second front ha d been established in Fr ance  that it was only a matter of time  and the question only was  would we be ab le to hold out that long and certainly we knew that the Germans 3 uh were were loosing at the east ern front and every day was anothe r step uh uh uh and one day hopefully the eastern front would wo uld reach us  because we were in the eastern part of...located in the eastern part of Europe.
And there was a wonderfu l Jewish life there before the war  literary things  my father was quite active in the community and so was my mother and they  but there was no one left when I came there  except the mayor says yeah  there's somebody came back that was hidden and was a man by the name of Mayer and his children were all  all killed  so was hi s wife  he surv ived and was hidden in some farmhou se.
And I felt that  as a nurse  you could use it for later  if the war was finished  for whatever purpose.
So  this was what was going on  and at that time  I got the feel how probable war can be  not suffering  but general war  seeing all the frozen dead people was just unbelievable.
But it was a German officer that declared that we were not political prisoners  that we were prisoners of war and belonged in a POW camp.
And also another incident  there was a group of musicians in the camp  musicians in the camp during the war  Germans had prisoners  musicians.
But they came in...People start the killing for Russia because about half a million Jews escaped to Russia when the war started.
At that time a Russia entered already the war  already  after the revolutions  it was communist Right.
ﬁGone With The Wind ﬂ came only after the war  and I maybe saw it 10 times.
And that day when they killed the whole families including the Einisemanns  the Wolfowiczs  togeth er with the kids that survived the war  being small kids like seven or nine or eight  you know.
This was during the Korean War  but this was a police action rather than a war so some of the provisions for citizenship didn't apply and I had to be in the United States for two years  for five years so in March of '53 I was discharged from the army and became a citizen.
I found out after the war that the Belgian Nazis in Antwerp had gathered one night and had been shown a film  \ De Avaga Juda[ph123]\  which is the \ Eternal Jew\  which is a horrible film where human beings are tr ansposed into rats and back and forth.
We were waiting for that because we knew that Hitler is dead and the war will finish very soon.
But since I was so good again in school the teachers were saying I should go to medical school because this is n eeded in after war Poland  they had no doctors  Poland was  as you know  nonexistent practically  all destroyed  damaged  bombed.
And so they were getting tryi ng to get as many people into the Ural mountain areas  you know  to to work on in war factories.
>> Manny Mandel: As I remember these things as a young child  the war was a much larger issue to us than the Holocaust.
Henry Kahn: The officer who was in charge of the soldiers got court -martialed after the war.
And I started seeing people who were not good and women who were not good in the war.
We had wonderful parents who cared for their children  protected us  did everything to educate us  and until the war ca...until the war came  we we had a very close-knit family.
When  after the war I went th ere  because I knew -- I used to go with my mother  I knew the number  and I knew the safe.
He was hidden perhaps in the war; he was not home.
When you were with the academ ies in Europe after the war -- I mean  you were concertmaster or whatever -- Yeah.
But  after the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other levels  I would say that there was very civilized and under the worse circumstances- civilized and cultured approach to things  to human beings  to fellow human beings  et cetera.
And even though hed been four years in the first World War  I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and experienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to what we read about  what took place in World War   where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios  but he was on th -- we never discussed that  he -- he -- he could not -- he could not -- Talk about it.
EL: When the war started the  the Lithuanians started to kill Jews in the provinces  in the  in the small  in the small towns.
And I think I showed you earlier  in the chronology of what happened during the war  that the Joint Distribution Committee and they were a tremendous during the war  a tremendous help.
At this time I guess there was a new policy with the war on.
He make a questions  how come during the war the Polish people  they had to save more Jewish people?
And the reason I wrote that book is because I felt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived  people were writing books and telling stories that were horrible  and in recounting their their stories  and I felt that someone ought to st ress the fact that not everybody went like sheep to the slaughter  but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to fight back.
During the war years  when you were here with your parents  did they have any communication with family back in Europe?
My mother said look  my husband was fighting the war at that time  hes a soldier and I just want the pictures that I have in the attic.
The war the draft in America started one day before Pearl Harbor .
Richmond  World War Two  World War One  they got all the names all over  and I might be able to show you what I do  after the session.
I did a little bit in college  because peopl e would ask  where were you during the war -- the Jewish people.
For us the war was not terminated when the 2nd World War ended and my own grandson who was seventeen was among the first victims of the war of liberation.
What about when the war ende d and you started trying to just go about your life?
The Embassies are whether there's a war or not  they close at three o'clock.
He did indeed call Secretary of War Patterson  who told them over the phone yes you want to keep this man with you 30 days  absolutely  in uniform on detached service to you  I'll write the orders.
You know  first  th e letters came to the old address  then to another address  and after the war  when the Red Cross started helping people find relatives  we found out that she died eith er on the way to Theresienstadt or in Theresienstadt.
So this is my experience after th e war as a -- as a man [indecipherable] Did your -- your father work for ELAS  the -- My -- my father -- in the village as I show -- I told you  everything was very well organized  it was -- it wa -- all the branches of the resistance were represented.
Well  tell me a little bit about your life after the war.
His public persona is that of a leading World War II scholar  who has written  edited or who edited no less than 10 books  and over a hundred articles and chapters  and who is well-known inside academia for his spot-on book Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 4 reviews.
We were very gradually uh you know  the Germans did it gradually like uh in my city  they took aw ay uh  uh  uh you know uh  our right walking on the streets  then uh  the children could not go to school  the doctors could not practice  and so on  slowly  and we hoped  everybody said the war will be over in 2-3 months  you know.
Had not the war broken  I think that probably my brother  maybe me  we would --he would emigrate to Palestine that time.
He is currently writing about his experience 70 years ago attending the Nuremburg war crimes trials accompanying his brother -in-law who was a journalist covering the trials.
I had a brother who was five and a half years older than me and in the beginning of the war  he got sick and due to bad conditions  he could not be properly diagnosed.
And uh the n  of course  in 19...we  we somehow...the  the war was still on.
And I think she -- in that time that she had left the group  until the end of the war  she suffered more psychological damages than any of us did.
The war is still on  and I can't take care of you.
They had left Poland around when the war broke out  1914 -- no before that -- 1913  they went to Elsass-Lothringen  which is part of France now and was at that time also.
And they knew the war was going to be over in a week  so they would go there and they would just stick it out there.
And you know that that particular kapo  I swear that I saw after the war  and I followed her for days  and I lost her  but I heard she was alive and she was being prosecuted.
Of those in the photo  only three s urvived World War II: Harry's mother  her youngest sibling  Bolek  and her sister Leonia who is third from the left in the back row.
But they were there before the war  before the war started  yes.
How did your parents feel when the war began  what did they f No  even when the war w-war began  I have a a different yeah  my mother was making Shabbas before before even t supposed to be  but he was ready.
This is Life Magazine from November 1947 and it is an article about me and another little boy who came from Europe to help raise funds for the European war orphans and we're pictured sitting on a step of some sort and behind us are all these clothes that have been bought for us.
I think that the media showed the European war pretty much of how it was.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: So  he's asking -- you were saying that you were in this very integrated community before the war.
I know that his feet  you know why because his original trade after the war became a shoemaker and when I was a child I used to sit next to him and he used to fix the shoes in the house  we used to talk and I used to ask him questions and he used to tell me and I asked him how come you lik e your shoes white and he said because I like it white and with warm lining becau se during the war  he said my foot was frozen and if I get a little flu or something  my foot swells up and red constantly and then he got some kind of rash  which goes on  you know.
So that  to sum it all up  I was lucky enough to be young enough to survive the war as a youngster  and to still be able - even though at the beginning  I did feel a little imbalanced  you know  my head was a little bi t further away - higher - not higher - more progressive - my head progressed a little better than my other emotional  but eventually  it evened out  you see?
We -- we [indeciphe rable] reconnected after the war  we left Yugoslavia together  were in France together  came to the States together.
So  after the war started  what ha what had happened to your family?
They had a lot of war experience in the second World War.
And it wasnt  until we got involved in the war  and began to make personal contact with prisoners of war  and with German government officials  that we began to become aware of what Nazism is all about.
Now I told you be fore that we worked in Ausc hwitz for the factory was building there  but that we never got a penny from them paid at whatever...that we just uh uh worked in order to keep...to stay alive  but that paid a certa in amount of money  small money 50 to the SS which considered us as and and and had a profit out of our work  so when I saw that statement in in papers sa ying that...and after the war when you had a West Germany and an East Germany  the of uh uh wher e the records had had been lost somehow and they wanted to register the stockholders and cl aims which certain people had against   so they published that statement and there all of a sudden I had a brain-st orm  and I said if they ask for claims to be registered  I think that we also...I also have a cl aim.
Pretty soon the [indecipherable] be such a help that pretty soon the -- the situation will change  since France and England got the -- stepped into the war.
I graduated in 67 but then I was up there at the Lebanon war.
That was in the summer of 1941  just a few weeks before the war started.
But the Hungarian regime  because they joined Hitler's war plans  I suppose they decided to follow Hitler's rules in regard to that.
During the time that I was gone  nothing especia lly happened to my family  they were growing up and I was there until the war started.. Were you thinking of getting married?
So she got the wife and daughter of of this man Mousekopf to be her assistants  and all all three survived the war.
The Internationa l Red Cross was not exactly heroic during World War II  but they would go to Theresie nstadt and make inspection...inspections and then send out a report saying the concentration camp was fine.
We had people who had valuables were - and who came back after the war  tried to get their valuables back from friends  or from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 26 a-acquaintances  and people just didnt want to give it back  they sa id  ﬁOh no  that was mine.ﬂ And they were so used to having those things that they didnt want to give it back.
You know  you didnt pay attention to anything because we always figured its only during the war and after the war it will all go back to normal.
I didn't mention that my sister was born two months before the war.
And when the war ended  somehow we were -- this camp was close to the Austrian border  and a lot of people were brought in  including some who had been in Maut hausen as prisoners of -- as prisoners in the German camp.
My husband is American born  was a Marine on Wake Island during the war.
And people really picked up interest after the 67 war in Israel.
And these pictures I got after the war from my brother  Arthur.
And there was this snobbery but I imagine that preexisted the war.
Your two sisters and your brother  where were they  in your first years  during these war years?
The war broke out 1 East Prussia 2 in 1939 and Poland was divided between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany  and my town  of course  was directly on the German borde r. And immediately the Germans came and occupied the town.
Of course  I never went to school in Romania because of the war.
And did you know what was going on in the war on the outside?
And being...having been in business before the war  it was a little difficult to get a job.
But you didn't feel singled out at school after the war was all over?
I wouldn't go back to Germany  when I went to Europe of number of times since the war  because of what they had been done to the Jews.
There was especially after the Six Day War and so so uh that that...and so uh now this chapter is is closed be cause it took years to liquidate all this.
Negotiations for their transport to Palestine broke down and in December of 1944  about six months before the end of the war  Manny and his mother were released from Bergen -Belsen and transported to safety in neutral Switzerland.
So  he promised jobs  and he promi he didnt say how  but what he did  you have t again  Im talking about history  after World War I  the French and German were not always friends.
But this was a very special time  yes  that -- that his profession was very good  in the peaceful  when he was working in [indecipherable] army  where you have the [indecipherable] in -- i -- i -- i -- during the war.
The guy was idiotic to say that they were going to win the war  when the best that they could do was a better part of the country.
It was all too fresh after the war to come to certain conclusions or to certain  what would be the English word  to certain understandings.
So during this time while you were prisoner of war  you did keep contact with your family?
So she -- she -- she lived the war too  you know   she knows about the war.
So did you now feel if the war ended -- Yes. --
And in 1939 she came back and the war broke out.
After the war  there were very few teachers and they insisted me to teach  English.
Was this the day after you the day after the war started  or a few days Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 138 Oh no  no  no  Panevžys were not that fast  yeah.
Before the war  of course  we but  during the war there was no time.
It looks like most of these are documents after the war  from they are from the international tracing service.
We -- we -- we used to get Red Cross parcels that were sent during the war for the American prisoners of wa r. And there were mountains of those.
If I were -- if there was no war and all these conditions I lived through  I would probably be  as you call in Russian language  Mami kin sinook.
And indeed there was an announcement telling that Poland is in war with Germany.
I hope and pray that none of you will ever experience war and hunger.
Well  that's an interesting question because inat the outbreak of war  we werethe children that is to sayall of the school were all evacuated to Chichest er  a small  very old town in the south of Engla nd.
You know  supposedly it was just the only son and they was saying  you know  send your only son to the war  but the mayor  whatever  he didn't like my father for some reasons and they they sent my brother to the war.
Anthony: Were there any Germans living in Bedzin before the war?
As a matter of fact  before the war I was a shy  quiet  timid man and  of course  I met Gladys when I was 15 and I had a lovely life  no problems  but since then I used to lose my temper quick.
We used to have -- actually my father after the war got a manuscript from one of the members of the group of seve n who were handling it  his name was Engineer Biss or Bliss .
He didn't get paid very much  and mywhen awhen my mother and I lived with my maternal grandmother  she had lost everyt hing during the course of World War I. I see.
And then I was very much involved with interrogating prisoners of war.
The other boy  uh Norman De was his name or is his name  made his way to Switzerland  over the border  you know  on the quiet  successfully crossed into Switzerland  eventually after the war came to the U.S. Also him I found hi s whereabouts in 1974 quite by accident.
All we knew is we were going to camps for the duration of the war period.

Because  you know  af ter the first week of the war  Colonel Umiastowski gave an order for armed  for men  armed able  of men who are able to carry arms to leave Warsaw and to go to the eas t because the east was still some...we couldn't go west  you know.
Not during the war  but immediately afte r the war I had a cousin who survived a concentration camp and I went to visit her in Paris.
Interview with Charles Stein June 8  1999 34Fortunately  it didnt happen  but it was a bad time in history  I think  that whole period of the Cold War  because it had an influence on on everything  on on the lives of all the people in the world  on the economy and so that it was it was a bad thing.
And when the war was over you know  wed wed as children at that age  we dreamt about going into the army and fighting.
At the time of the war with my friend of mine  a Christian  who worked in the Polish underground  provided me with a document under the name of Henrik Romanowski.
And so they said  I'll tell you what  they were nice  it was right after the war like  you know things were crazy  this was 1946 by that time  you know time went by.
Yeah  because you were in the car -- I -- I would say that the -- the -- at that time  you know  there were  a little bit later -- because the war was still going on.
The Korean war was on in full blast  and I wanted to serve my country  my adopted country  and I joined the Marine Corps  United States Marine Corps.

He never told me  but they must have bribed the Hungarian especially because the war was probably almost over in ‚44  and they wanted to be in good foot with the Americans.
Jewish families  Christian families  so that the house was really full during the war.
Do you remember  do you remember people coming into your parents house  adults  before  right before the war  where there was people talking about what might be happening?
So no country really w anted the Jews whether it was during the war or even after the war.
>> [Laughter] >> Michel Margosis: War was raging in Europe when I was able to escape and eventually get to the United States alone as a refugee 73 years ago.

We got letters a nd then we didnt go because the war broke out.
He was injured during the war  and he wanted to become a a how do you call?
After that  they asked me very nicely to go back home  because we were also -- a fellow like me coming from the resistance and we were not trained with the discipline that a regular soldier is when somebody was looking at us and saying something  you know sometime we were ve ry rough with him  what were you doing in the war.
In one day we were happy and then the war began.
At the end of the war  especially  I tried to become a United States citizen.
After the war  I was attached to a CIC unit in Nuremb erg  in the town that you mentioned before  stationed in Nuremberg.
In 1939 we heard that the war broke out in Poland and the Germans went into Poland and the Russians came into Lithuania took over the Baltic states.
It was very soon after the war was over  because she met Mima and -- and she -- yeah  she was there already  and -- De-Describe what her first appearance at your house was like.
I didn't believe that it's possi ble to do it  but I always said to the landlady  \ You will see  we will live through we have to live through that war  and I will tell you  you have to live.
And I went to the kitchen  I remember before the war  in 1939 -- before the war  my mother bought a credenza for the kitchen.
Now  I know personally  I mean  I met a lot of people after the war in Ulm and in -- we went -- we took the children too to see where we were born.
Well  the general situation in Latvia before the 2nd World War - Latvia was an independent country from 1918 to 1940.
We were three sisters and I. We had had to work very hard because we got just a couple workers to help us on the farm and finally they said there is some...some...after the war in Poland  they were saying that it is a possibility that you get a worker from Poland  and my father put in the application to get some worker from Poland and we did.
And -- and I remember I locked myself up in one little bedroom  very -- the f -- last bedroom  and I was reading ﬁ Gone With the Wind.ﬂ And since I was reading about Rhett Butler and Scarlett OHara   I for -- all -- forgot all about the war.
I asked my colleague in New York  Morris Bernzweig  who was the head of the International Affairs Department in New York -- who was British  but during the war he went to New York -- and asked him  \ How did you react to this?
Stories from before the war  stories from the war  from cruelties  from -- so I have this  and I have the title  so we worked this.
There was su -such turmoil after the war  I dont know  but suddenly he was home again.
He had served in World War I. He had an Iron Cross  actually an Iron Cross th at was bestowed belatedly by Hitler.
He traveled from Lithuania -- the Nazis caught him as a war prisoner.
I wondered whether that Interview with Ruth Harvey 15 He had been in World War I. He had gotten the Iron Cross  second class and he had been a patriotic German and he was 40 when I was born.
But eventually  of course  the the war came closer  and I think that they that somebody must ha ve discovered that there may be Jews in there.
>> Josie Traum: My father's parents died actually just before the war.
Thank you very much Mr. Hieminga for agreeing to speak with us today  and to share some of your experiences during World War II.
There were lots of people that were dying laying around and some people started leaving and me and five friends    the one that I mentioned before   and another was a man I knew from my town who was an older brother of that young man back in the ghetto who had a certificate on his on his identification paper that he had some physical ailment and should be excused...we decided based on the stories we heard from the...from our parents on what happened in the first war when the Russians and the Austrians keep moving back and forth  so the Americans left and the Germans may be coming back.
I understand that according to German plans they were supposed to -- to occupy my hometown the second day of the war because it was only 70 kilometers away from the German border.
Yeah  so my mother quickly found a farmer who w ould t-take my father as an unpaid f-farmhand and so he went out in the countryside  and we just av -- sort of waited for -- for the war to end.
Nobody came  nobody looked into it  until it came the time they shipped us out from there and the main reason they sh ipped us out is because the war was closing in.
I I have two granddaughters and I hope they will never know what it means to go through a war.
Well they went a different wa y  they went to Flossenburg  fou nd out after the war  Flossenburg and the one who survived en ded up in Da chau.
The war finished and immediately when th e university opened in Krakov  I wanted to go to Medical School in Krakov  I was not admitted.
Th is is '47 and '48  two years after the war.
Now I want you to tell me about Warsaw after the war broke out and where you and your family lived and about what you remember of the forming of the ghetto.
Initially  I -- after -- I was there already during the war  I stayed on til December.
The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty earlier this year at Rome  the Rome treaty  is a big step in the right direction  but look what year it is.
It had had long-standing alliances with I. G. Farben  which went back to World War One  and th ey not only had these cartel a rrangements but they had joint ownership of about 10 compan ies in this country other than General Analine and Film  which I mentioned.
At tha t time -- well  before the war -- the war starts September.
What was it like for you when the war broke out  and then eventually  really  the war was felt profoundly in England?
But really i-it wasnt that bad before the war with those people  we got along pretty good.
>> Bill Benson: So the war  as you just explained to us  the war begins in September 1939 but really very litt le happened in France until invaded by Germany in May of 1940.
Did you know -- did you know where your moth er was at the very end of the war?
Except when we went to Palestine in 1935  he said  ﬁWell  a big war will swallow you when you're in the Mediterranean.
Well  the war comes in 1939  and youre in -- Colmar. --
Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about the town that you were in  in Orsk; what it was like at that time during the war?
But during your growing up years  before the war -- 21 Never  never.
I had quite a big family which I don't till this day were they killed and burned inside the ghetto or were they brought out and killed in these holes in the center of the town  which they were led from the bombings when the war had started.
I mean  that was the only recreation we had during the war  you know  the only time that you dressed a little bit  whatever you had and it was a social occasion  so it was very hard to -- you know  not to do it.
Were you -- you were fini shing up school at about the time of the war?
When did you  so in the time after the war when you were in France and you were attending school again  did you have the– how long did it take before you had the idea that you wanted to become a doctor and do you re member how that happened?
So  I said to my father  ﬁYou see peopl e are praying for us.ﬂ But  after the war  I remembered that.
It was only after the war that they changed it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 34 and the war board finally acknowledged that -- that we could come over.
And there are some survivors  not that many  who were hidden by Germans and others from the Nazis during the whole time of the war.
And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in Washington who approached me and said  you know  UNRRA is looking for people to work in their program.
I went to school until the age of  let's see  1939 the war broke out  five years.
They had a doctor there  which was a prisoner of war to take care of this.
Did you before World War II  did you visit with your doctor uncle much?
They helped him in Fuft  they called his family  they gave him money for the train  and it wasn't  this was not toward the very end of the war  and his wife  my aunt  was allowed to send him a package once a month  of maybe 3 lbs of food and uh  she woul d come to our house to make a package  it was so painful for her to do that  and uh  I have asked his three daughters to record what he did and what uh  what they actually found uh  what they found  they came to my grandmother's and they were uh  she was under arrest  she was then in her 80s and they said  um  she said  \ Why have you arrested my son?
They know more in Slobodka  but after the war they move the chief rabbi  moved him to Israel.
You couldnt have two potatoes if you wanted to   because there was a ration  so [indecipherable] And how long did that  the coupons  the rationing last after the war?
So they had a list of 20 Jews  the most prominent Jews from before the war to be shot.
But none of these things applied to me  so they were going to draft me for two years  send me over somewhere and -- to fight in a war.
87 And -- and my sister  who was trying to run around and -- and take care of the bureaucracy stuff while I was in the hospital  and getting pass ports  and papers signed  and so forth  broke out into the -- first of all  she had terrible  terrible stomach problems right afte r the war  and Im sure that they had to do with -- well  Im not sure  bu t I think they had to do with all this suppressed anxiety and fear  and trying to walk this delicate line between things.
I wrote to them and I researched it  I Googled it  I did everything I could  re nobody they said that from during the war years it was just totally cut off and the company now is a different comp with the same name  but its a totally different company.
And then my next rec -- my only recollection -- I dont have recollection of Tepledseshanof  I do have recollection of Prague  as where we spent our time before the war.
And we were then ther e in June of I remember in June of 1941 when the war broke out with the Russians.
I I I think I only had one or two encounters with him before and there he was  again a a person who in the months between the invasion and uh and uh the end of the war had been toughened by combat  and there he was standing with a a with an emaciated - well  they were all emaciated - with a man who who had who was ready to eat ravenously and and he put his arm around him  and the  he was in a spit-and-polish uniform and the prisoner was dirty as they were all  and he put his arm around him and he he said to him  I heard him...he said  take a little now.
America was much more 50 aware of what was available because of the kinds of refugees they had taken in at the beginning or before the war  and so America got all kinds  but Canada took a long time to wake up.
Anybody who knew any languages  they they got there  and they trained them in such things as prisoner of war interrogation  just military intelligence analysis  order of battle.
I reunited with her after the war  when we were liberated.
3 What was your father doing be -- this is befo re the war.
And so when does it become a place where they send Jews  after the war?
Interview with George Pick November 13  1997 26 Well  I have seen a lot of propaganda leaflets  and they have  all over the city they had these these big propaganda photographs and about the war effort and how the these people look in SS uniform  how did the Hungarian uniform look and how did this Hungarian Nazi uniform l ook.
Well  when the war ended  exactly  I think we were in in India .
I only had very good examples  because you know  when the war broke out  the Germans took everything to Germany  but my father had a bi g supply of drapes  and whatever  he had a big supply.
So that was familiar things   but not when it came back after the war I had handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort.
She wa -- they were transferred back to Berlin and she says even though she was -- quality was there  if you know what I mean  and she was very warm and she was like you  born after the war  had no -- no -- nothing to do with anybody  you know  but she 80 refused me.
But I know during the war  she was very helpful in many ways to people who had no clothes  because she gave  of course  what we ha-have left over -- be -- so  she -- she was very h-heartly in -- in her way of living.
Interview with Eric J. Hamberg 50 When the war ended  I was at the Brenner Pass  at the top of Italy  going into Austria  no  Switzerland  Switzerland.
>> Bill Benson: So when the war was no longer the Phoney War  it was the real war for you  your parents and family fled Paris.
Any final reflections on what the war years were like in Cuba  anything has anything come to your mind since we started th e interview that you would like to add?
>> Bill Benson: Nat  you were not yet 3 years old when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 starting World War II.
Do you remember your friends from your multi-ethnic neighborhood ever talking about events in Europe before the war?
And towards the end of the war -- and I lo se -- Id -- nobody -- I mean  I still didnt know the calendar date  whether was mar -- Februa ry  March  to me it was the winter  who knows  but I dont associate with particular months or dates.
But I was late  and maybe three hours  because on the  on that -- well  you don't know but during the war was nothing in time.
>> Bill Benson: Were they able to stay in Tunisia throughout the war?
So  while that went on  the war finally came to an end and I came back to Washington with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law for the labor board.
The Turks owned the -- Greece  and my -- my grandf ather didnt want his son to get mix in that war  and he send him there.
So the boat went with -- only  as I said  with the pri -- Dutch prisoners of war and Dutch people.
At that time  were you aware of what it m eant  that the war was over?
But I recall  having nailed up the sign \ Headquarters Third U.S. Army  War Crimes Dachau \  we decided we were going to have the trials in Dachau.
And what we did in building up the -- the Marshall plan to begin with  in rebuilding Germany  to the po int where Ive asked myself  who won the war?
I wanted to hear the story when you retu rned to Germany after the war with two other people.
It was 2 mont hs after the war  2 and a half months  and I still didn't know whether my husband is aliv e or not.
Well come back to that  we would a little before the war  a-and you had two sisters?
I wanted to join the war  not...I didn't come over here to be in a kibbutz  you know.
Hetty  the oldest  who just turned 80 as a matter  no  is turning 80 in August 16 th  she  she married and  and  she married in 1940  I think just before the war broke out.
They two of them  at least  were taken prisoner of war.
After– so  after the war  when you were in Munich  did you try to find out what had happened to your mother?
And she said  ﬁI am going to start using this after the war  when we are all together and we live in peace.ﬂ And so  a nd she kept it and she had it with her all the time.
It had barbed wire  or it had a wooden fence  whatever - it was surrounded by a fence  and it had guards  guard towers  you see  because that was very  this was so near to the factory that this was really probably war production area anyway  but they had guards  and they had Ukrainians in them.
You see  we were worry about Schindler in a  during the last month of war that when the Russian will come in  we will be liberate by Russian  they di dn't ask question.
Q. It is fair to say that this was the -- of all of the pieces of informa tion that you received during the war  this was the one that made the greatest impact on you?
And are there any  until the end of the war  any blatantly antiSemitic incidents that you remember?
I-I -- I would say I-I cant recollect if sh e was talking with me about the war  and these other things.
I was a soldier in World War 1  and I know how these things are.
Did you ever talk to people about your war experiences during that time.
One is  could you tell me about Poland after the war?
I was more afraid  but I sis -- 101 and took my papers and went to the register o ffice and he looked at my papers and said  ﬁYou havent any papers from your mother.ﬂ And beca u -- I said  ﬁYes  my mother was from white Russia and I could not get any papers from Russi a now  in -- during the war.
But then  th-the next few days  they started this bombardment  and and it and it the war ended soon after that [indecipherable] .
No  there was nobody -- yes  th ere were some out of -- we found out  we we re told that out of 34 000 Leucoline Jews  who had lived in the Leucoline ghetto we re all murdered except for 4 000 young men who had occupations that were important to the war effo rt.
Q. Tell me a little bit about your family before the war?
Tell me what you remember of your impressions when the war began.
So he wrote -- this is after the war  he wrot e to you and said this?
Now  if you c ould just talk about the time  this  be tween this time period and the actual beginning of  of the war  September '39.
We were still in the country  the family was just able  my father was just able to send the fami ly away to the country so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the city and I can actually rememb er the  the war starting.
We  because I remember  this was afte r the war  I remember reading and learning about the roads being bloc ked by refugees  and I learned then that we were part of that group of refugees.
He was a member of the medical corps  and when he came back in 1919 or so  after the end of the war  my mother always told me that uh I had difficulties to to to greet him as a son because he had become a stranger to me because he had been away for so many years  and I grew up duri ng the time of uh the Weimar Republic.
We heard these talks somewhere along that we will be treated well and work for the war effort and families will be together.
Now the first thing he did was to go in the South of France  and first of all  the first thing he did was to get into the business that he had before the war.
We know what happened to you during the war period but is there anything from your perspective that you would like to tell me?
32 So he survived and then he was kept in Russia after the war?
He survived the war and when he came to Amer ica he couldnt get any employment.
>> Gideon Frieder: He was tried as a war criminal and hanged  and rightfully so.
Anyway  my fa ther was very depressed  and his and I call them handlers  its sort of the easier way to describe them came to my war father and said  listen  Leonard  or Theos father is really in bad shape.
Th ey were not deeply involved in anything spiritual  I mean  they were 400 years under the Austrians  under the Hapsburgs before World War I  then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated  and they had to live -- make a living.
You know  well  we -- we got into combat 54 days before the end of the war; okay?
>> Bill Benson: In addition to fellow internees  others that were in the same boat as you  so to speak  there were also prisoners of war.
When the Germans came in  when the invasion was  when the war was  so he was still the boss  and his word was the last word.
It was only after the war when I came across a monograph about the uprising  and recognized Anielewicz from the picture on the front page  that I found out about his role.
End of Tape Two  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 56 Beginning Tape Three  Side A This is tape number three  side A. You mentioned in your vide otape interview  you -- you said at one point that -- that you -- th at during the war  you became numb to the violence after awhile.
That was ki -- we didnt know until after the war. --
You said something earlier about how when the war ended  you became again  the person who you had been before.
What was your feeling when the Russian soldier came and told you the war was over?
We used to eat  our group  always together lunch -- eat lunch together  and I used to sit -- mostly there were two girls  with the girls  because there we -- the men were always talking about the war  certain aspect of the war.
He had been a war hero during World War I. And so anyway they had this problem because they had...didn't have enough people and they even had at one point 300 people who had been protected and who were taken away and they did not know anything about their whereabouts.
And so  from that moment on  the Jewish community grew  and by the time we get to World War II  there were  in Danish culture  a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights  and so on.
If my father would have survived the war  he would change his political views too.
These world affairs and the war trials and the war crimes  the London Conference  the Cairo Conference  and so forth.
I cannot see the Holocaust in any other way or form as the war against the Jews because at any time  the preparation legally he got them through Nuremberg to make everything legal what he did afterwards.
He was an American war correspondent following the Allied troops into Germany in 1945.
What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war?
There was no  that was different  Im sorry  thats thats start of the war.
My very fi rst interview after World War 2  performed by an American civilian in occupied German territory in Bavaria  was conducted by Professor Border.
And why don't we now -- why don't you help us to make an agreement with the allies that we could stop the war with them and we all join force against the Soviet?
It was getting on to -- closer to the end of the war  the United States send us over the Air Force  the United States Air Force came and bombed IG factory  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 the rail leading into IG.
And then as -- as the war broke out  and particular it started first with the anschluss of Austria in March of 1938  the Deutsche bank moved in and took over the largest Austrian bank.
And all -- all through the war we -- we took care of her  and well  she turned out okay.
So that when you talk about those people who were put into the concentration camps  especially before the war  there -- and Im just wondering  is there a connection betw -- because the United States is not letting in people who said they were homosexuals at a certain 46 point  and that -- so it didnt matter that there were homosexuals who were being persecuted in the concentration camps.
Before the war was a regular jail.. So they took them back to the jail  to the yard by the jail.
Let me ask you so -- clearly  youre -- youve had a great deal of success with -- with your undertakings in -- in life  and -- and I think thats not a -- many Holocaust survivors have been very successful after the war.
>> Bill Benson: When you were with the Harrisons  did you hear anything about the war that was going on?
They  after the war  I had problems conceiving and my brother told me that the  the obstetrician that checked me out  a friend  said that I need a miracle that I will never make it  they exper -- because of the experimentation.
And your father was in the German army in World War I?
Bill Benson: And it still took until 1947  two years after the war ended.
I also remember that when the war broke out  she was pregnant  and she did have a baby  and after that because of whatever happened during that period of time  she vanished  and I never heard what happened to her.
They were used for the German war effort in most cases.
And at that particular time  I used to talk to my family  why don't they try to go ahead  go move further east  but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one  that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run away from.
I remember going to wakes  you know  because the kids used to have on a grenade  they would si go on the grenade at af ter the war  even  and blown up and then I used to have like nightmares  you know?
So when the war ended in Yugoslavia logically he should have come back.
But after the war  a friend of mine who I told exactly where the money should be  went back to 33 Poland  finally to dig -- dig the money out  didn t find anything.
I -- I would like to say that thanks to him  not only I live  bu t a lot of people  tens of thousands of people in Israel and all over the world because the families got bigger and the families had children  the children had children  and he is counted as a war -- the biggest [indecipherable] in the history.
Na -- and if there are any German workers in that factory near Munich   they -- they werent around during World War II  so -- Are there any sounds or sights that remi nd you  that bring back any memories of -- well  lets say the -- the -- the bombing  that very early sensation that you had  or your travels in Europe?
At some point in time  they closed the kitc hen because there were more and more bombings around the camps  because it was get ting to the end of the war.
Its very confusing as to where I was liv ing at what time beca use we did move around  but only within those three houses sort of  and my grandfather  I think  I spent the least time there  and of course  I was the youngest so that I remember that the least  and I remember the Vrancic house the best  because Vika eventually died during the war  and she died I think while my uncle was in c oncentration camp  and I remember seeing her dead  that was more scary than some of th e battles because I ran into the house and nobody told me she was dead and there she wa s. But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on  and thats  you know  I remember  thats we were set then in that house from then on.
So  the thoughts that you had are that this is war  nothing else terribly bad  it would be deprivation– Yeah  its not the first war that the parents were talking about  and people who were still around that have lived through the first war.
And then  that from his brothers wife  she came end of the war she came there  and she says  I would hide him  he could run away.
indecipherable] not before the war was over  really  that you had the -- the truth of it.
This was taken also during the war  about the same time when they took my father's picture in order to have pictures in the event they wanted to get a passport.
It was made for the King Christian X who was one of the biggest heroes  I would say  during the war.
And he said to my mother  \ I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a hospital and you cannot be moved out of your apartment 3 Funny war (French); The Phony War.
We kept on thinking that nobody knows in the 24 whole world what was happening to us because you know first we said \ oh  we will wear the yellow star  a star  two three days  a week  a month  the war will end\  but here I am talking already 1944  three years already.
i ndecipherable] after the war  but -- okay  now this -- this piece of paper is very interesting and important historica lly because it d -- it authenticates my name of Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn.
Sure enough  within the nec -- by the next day  I immediately am taken to th e jail  and in the jail  all the questions and answers that they gave me  was that I wanted to go to Klagenford  and my aim was to go further away in Italy  and I -- whichever I mentioned the name  they says  ﬁWell  you dont have to worry about it  well send you there.ﬂ But being -- working for the KGB  and knowing them from the time that I know before the war  when we were -- were in their zone  I knew that when the Soviets tell you you gonna go to one place  you may wind up in Siberia until you get there.
Well  you talked about how  during the war  your mother would  you know  lengthen your dresses  and things -- Yeah  I think -- I dont think it was looking good  I think its a question of -- if a buttons missing  theres no reason not to sew it on.
Well  tell me a little bit about some of the others that were killed in the war.
And so a lot of Poles  depending on the historian  but their calculation at least one million Poles worked on the farms in Germany during the war and were obviously all forced.
Interview with Jacqueline Hieminga August 9  2016 70 Is there anything else you would like to add to what weve talked about today  that you think people should know about  about your experiences during the war?
We forget today that in Europe   until World War  and into World War II  governments drafted not just people  but also horses.
Ah  I wou I was gon And th before the the first war.
Most of these SS people had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the war.
Is there anything about the actual war that we didnt touch on  that you think you should say?
And as a matter of fact  when my sisters were born after the war  and then in the Jewish religion  you are not allowed to name after the living  so my parents named -- they gave them both Biblical names because they weren't absolutely sure who had survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay.
I then subsequently provided to the Holocaust Museum  a collection of docum ents which I assembled  my sister actually helped with it  which showed methodically how th e various laws were used in Slovakia to gradually strip an innkeeper  who was a veteran from World War I  and who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away  and this was taken away and the fur coats was taken  and radio was taken  and so on  until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him.

So this was Interview with Jan Hieminga August 9  2016 28 So I was never in the war.
All the people we had contact with after the war were people who were -- either had survived the concentration camps or people who had been in hiding  so that was normal conversation.
So -- and we were never -- I -- this is -- this shows you the blessing  the -- during the whole war  was never hungry a single day.
And in Warsaw was this a rule by the Germans to say that you couldnt buy in a Jewish store  or were you just -- No  no  thats -- thats was a -- before the war.

So I came there  the Ge rman consulate  at that time  Am erica was not at war yet  so the Germans still had the consulate here.
I have some idea because after the war  I was asked to m ake a deposition about Cunsa  and I said what he did for us and it's my understanding that he was executed because he signed execution orders for some partisans and maybe for some of these deserters as well.

During the war  what do you remember of your parents demeanor?
Did he did you talk to him at all about what he had done during the war  or not?
There was a great number of Poles who spent the war times in  in the Soviet Union.

When I returned to Warsaw   well after the war  and went to the apartment that I grew up in -- well  I di -- I lived in til I was four  I was able to recall the apartment vividly.
What do you attribute th-the difference in their response in the war? [

He was a  just kind of a very outstanding figure  a tall  very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during th e War  World War II and somehow worked for a shoe factory  which was a very famous shoe factor y all over the world  Ba ta  got married there and came once to visit us and I stil l remember his visit.

for the...uh... Zieg means...uh...When they win a war...when they win a way  the wheels are turning for to win the war.
I was asking you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006 57before the -- the tape -- the last tape e nded about what -- what -- what has helped you to -- to cope  to -- with the memories  with the -- the grief  with the -- has your faith been helpful or -- or was that something that you struggled with when the war was over?
Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms of providing shelter for refugees  which is something we ought to have learned from the last 113 world war.
And then th yeah  I saw one thing of my father  but when when it before the war  when mine daughter when my sister came Interview with Sylvia Rosen November 20  2012 14home from school  she was crying.
There was hope that he would be seen again or returned  almost up to the end of the war.
There was not an organized effort to take us on a bus or take us on any kind of transportation whatsoever  and people came from way far away  like hundred miles  2 hundred miles  and we just  they just tell us to get home  war broke out.
And because of my Zionist background  I wanted to go to Palestine after the war met  especially one American officer who was doing a lot for me  who was arranging a visa for me to come to the United States  which he did arrange.
The war broke out in 39  if Hitler was putting all the Jews in  why didnt they all go in wa -- in one fell swoop?
Actually [indecipherable] there there there was a there were the we had in Michalovce the big synagogue  because we have many of them like I mentioned before  and this were the biggest synagogue  and this were destroyed actually damaged during the wa r  and then nobody want to take it Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14  1997 94over  so they turned it down after the war.
>> Josie Traum: My dad couldn't come back -- war ended in 1945.
And I hammered that si gn up saying United States Army  3rd Army  15 War Crimes Unit  Dachau  and that's where we be gan as an act of poetic justice.
And this is Cheadle Hulme  the school I went to when the war started in in England.
And the guy who owns the place  there was a Polish immigrant from World War One  I dont know  he came from New York  and sat in a chair and he tripped me.
And then I found out about other priests and their heroic deeds and all the wonderful things they had done  so I came back with a whole collection of stories of just  you know  sheer heroism and what I was pointing out is  the h eroes during World War 2 were not the generals  you know  and who won the war  like MacArthur and so on  because that was their job.
And I remember  the Robinsons  whose original name was Robinowitz  said at the big outbreak of the war  if the Nazis -- if the Germans set foot in England  we're going to turn on the gas.
One of the things that were buried was my fathers so rt of tools of the trade  his sewing kit  his threads  because threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the economy  everything was geared toward th e war so civilians couldnt come by thread -- you know spools of thread Im ta lking about --` so my father took like a box of thread  different colors  needles and what have you and buried it under the chicken coop.
between 33 and 39  before the war -- 18 Yeah. --
I wonder if you had any continuing fears that are kind of left over scars or wounds from the war.
Bielitz before the war was Austria and later on it was also one of the first things that became uh it was they called it   you know    uh where so we were unfortunately not too far from from Auschwitz  which was   and that became the perfect which was allegedly self-ruled.
That they violated the laws a nd usages of war in that pursuant to a common design to operate these camps to kill  to beat  to starve  these were the offenses that they were charged with.
They took the position that a-and a correct position Hitler was again and again reminding Germans that there wouldnt be a war  except for the Jews.
And he   right you know  when when war you know  was over  the Russian s came in  because Im talking about eastern Right.
Th ere was Korea but it was far away and it wasnt our war.
Yet in...in 1918  we..we are very unhappy because of the war.

You mentioned that during the time that Israel was at war you had nightmares.
The German Nazis who wanted to destroy me  they are the ones that treated me in the camp because they were prisoners of war.
In -- after Stalingrad  Goebbels gave a famous speech in Berlin  s -- asking th e audience  carefully handpicked audience  do you want total war and they all shouted yes?
Was there any was there any chance  or any talk about returning to Poland after the war was over?
Unfortunately  just towards the end of World War   the whole property was bombed  and theres none of that left  and when I went over there for the first time  I thought I would feel terrible about seeing my parents home  but its no longer there.

And from Italy  just before the outbreak of the war  illegally went to France  where he was first arrested  put i-into jail for six weeks and then lived a precarious life until he was caught in 1940 in Nice -- until he was caught by accident in a raid and was deported to Auschwitz.
I had a watch that my uncle gave me  that Brenda has today  that my uncle gave me for my  I guess 11 th or 12th birthday  I dont remember which one  but it was during the war.
And I said to him  the war may be over for you  the war isn't over for me.
And I wa s told that I would maybe be -- I might be drafted  because the draft didnt stop right after World War two  so they were still drafting people  and s-sign papers to become an American citizen  theres -- they had a good chance  that I was healthy  and so on.
The War Refugee Board had a representative in Lisbon   they had one in London .
But  on the other hand  you knew that you never  your parents are never going to come out because the war had started and it was -- and it was just completely -- well  completely hopeless.
But then it started again  actually the main involvement of the Slovak army was in 1941 in June when they started the war  the German against th-the Russian.
What happened was I remember well  the Korean war broke out very shortly after we got married.
SWB: JOE KAHOE: Well  af  eh  probably a year after the war was over  I was stationed in Germany which was not too far from Nuremberg  between Nuremberg and .
Did you -- in 44  given what you were hearing on the radio  did you think the war would be over soon?
Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 11 Is there anything else that stands out in your mind about your life before the war?
And Joseph was called Joop  J-O-O-P. Jacob died before the war.
So it must have been -- Hitler was at war with England and America was in 1941  so it must have been in 1940 before the United States.
The war broke out September the 1st  so I was just in the middle of the war.
>> Bill Benson: As you said to us  of course the war is still going on and these Jewish resistance groups were making plans that they might have to fight the Germans if Ramullah was to come into Palestine.
Yes  yes  I will -- When you come ba -- I will see what they do over there at [indecipherable] End of Tape #3 36 Tape #4 Just wanted to pick up a little bit with how these experiences during the war impacted you after the war.
My father came to the United States about 1943  he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war  prior to Pearl Harbor.
Once the Cold War ended  cases started to come   and also I should tell you from what Ive heard that the atmosphere on the court is very different than it was at the height of the Cold War.
The the first first half year of the war  we were sent to different classes  mixed together.
Well uh  there are there are pictures that remain with you like uh you see in flashbacks in movies som etimes and uh for me it's in real life several uh pictures that are alive to this day  and that would be like the first telephone uh that was installed in just before the war broke out and the reason that I would remember it is that uh I would watch people walking to uh talking to the wall and uh that uh was such a wonder to me that uh I couldn't explain it and it's remained with me to this day.
I don't know how tall I was at that time  how much I grew during the war  when uh  I am five four and a half now.
It became monstrous  I think  be fore breakout of the second World War.
The parents were there with their small radio  like 10 -by-10 radio listening to the war.
An d my parents got out of got out of Germany  I would say  just weeks before the before the war started.
Maybe they were too busy with with their own war  but they should at least say something.
I looked for her after the war all over the world  all over the world wrote Red Cross and all thi ngs because my mother died in the gas chamber in Auschwitz  in Birkenau.
At one point by now its early September  I think  or Or the war has started.
This guy was three months -- was -- was kept three months  a-a-and he was late  he was arrested late  because he -- i-i-in the meanti me  the war was over  he -- he came back.
But even when the first bomb was dropped on Warsaw  the true brutality of war seemed still unreal until that night.
He had been in the Pacific in the war  but never in Europe.
I already mentioned that one of my father's brothers came over to Holland  and that was my Uncle Charlie and my father's  my father and his brother had world wide optical business before the war and we had an office in Amsterdam and so he came over both to take  look after my mother and Freddy and me and also I think  to see what was left from a business point of view.
Then we ran into trouble cause our war department wasnt interested in having that information about S oviet Union  cause that was our -- they were our allies.
And I came and there was anothe r relative who knew my mother because they were cousins and she left shortly befo re the war.
And that was the advantage that in the beginning in the big city you could go on the street and nobody called you names of the Jew because in the big city opposite in this war  everyone in the city....this small city had only about 10 000 population.
I was going to say did you talk about the war?
That maybe by some chance they wound up in a camp somewhere and maybe after the war you w ill be reunited.
As the as the war was going to the inevitable end  it was expected that they wont won t leave the Jews alone.
So we did not know much about what our school mates' parents did during the war or before the war.
So  I was -- ever since those days when he started remaking my identity as it were  for years and years after the war as I s ee it now  I have been groomed to play a role  and that lasted for years and years after the war  until not too long ago  maybe ten or fifteen years ago when I began to search for what is my own self.
The father died  the mother sent him to Amer ica to be out of the war  to be with th -- he had the same -- he did the same thing.
It was now a... it was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th Mountain Division that exist... that trained there during World War II  and many of its members came back and established Aspen.
ﬁThe war is over  you are free to goﬂ. Of course  it was a false alarm.
Among them was Baron Moore who was his friend before the war.
This Mr. Madritsch I'll never forget because this Mr. Madritsch after the war  wrote a book  how he saved 500 Jews in Tarnow by creating a factory.
He survived the war about Bensky and I met with him after the war.
>> Bill Benson: Before we return to after the war began  you've told me that your family was very assimilated.
The war was to start a demographic revolution on the globe  of which killing all Jews was to be a central part.
He had received in 1935 a cros s which was given only to all front line fighters  meaning people who for four years of the 1st Worl d War spent it on the front line  and how could the same men now deny him an ex istence or a livelihood and would throw him out.
She had her  you see she left Poland not so long after the war and she always remembered this as the anti-Semitic country where she has the memory of tragic childhood.
At that point  did that experien ce change the way that you felt about the war  and your role in it?
And then  in that when it was the first World War  then it came Poland again.
I think the other family stayed in Cuba throughout the war and eventually went to Mexico.
We were trying to wrap up all this work at the end of the war crime.
He was called up to go to the eastern front and  and he go into labor battalions  in 41  Im talking about 41 because thats when Germany declared war  Germany attacked the Soviet Union.
Of course my..my father came here later and my mother died after the war so they took us there.
>> Bill Benson: They called it the funny or phony war because nothing was really happening.
He gave that that the Polish people knew what happened to these prisoners of war.
And I got to know about that  because as I was speaking around  so many of the people came to me and said  oh now I understand what my parents didnt want to 130 tell me  or now I understand why its so difficu lt to talk about the second World War  or whatever  whatever  whatever.
By 1944  the war had turned  and it was quite obvious to the Hungarian government and everyone that Germany would be losing the war.
And my understanding of that situation was that the most virulent collaborators and traitors of World War II  who had been sentenced to death or long jail period or even li fe sentence  through amnesty and so forth  all of a sudden were back in the streets.
Because we had naively assumed that the war would be over within a matter of months  since it was only a matter of playing for time.
And what's going to happen to us \  and so forth  so she said in the first war  what did my mother know?
My father had been in World War I and lost a leg.
And that was shortly -- that was just a few years after the Civil War.
And were wa how was he part of your life before the war?

And one of these girls I met after the war in Italy  and she was a friend of my sister  who was there.
And then he was given a choice wh ether he could fight with the pa rtisans  he could work for the partisans  or they would allow hi m to go into an area that was al ready liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over  they said.
I can -- wards were never full  whether they shipped them back out faster -- like I said  the war was waning down and they could get them moved out further -- they wanted to get them to general hospitals as soon as they coul d. And then back home.

Were you able to keep up correspondence until the United States got into the war?

Oh yeah  I saw him  yeah  before their I remember they took him to the war crimes trials  thats where I saw him  but I never went to the war cri I didnt really care about what was happening at the at the war crimes trials.
The first thing  before the war  when we knew already whats going on in Germany  we wrote letters  we begged him  send us an affidavit.
Well  we only found out after the war that there were quite a few Jews there who had Christian papers  and that's how they survived.
And the young peopl e were trying to hitchhike and go east after learning that the Soviet Union have entered the war  and occupying east of Poland.

It happened to me the same thing in the war  he said  the 1st World War.
I couldnt tell you that by heart  but it is available  and the East Germans did that already after the war  and published that.
As an adult in Poland  I don't mean in America after the war  that's something else.
The first time we took somebody in our confidence was as the war wore on  and the Germans were beginning to realize it -- that their lot was going to likely be up  and they made their last ditch efforts.

>> Bill Benson: Prior to the call to bring you to London  what do you know from Bertl and your sisters about what happened to make it possible for you to all  two years after the war ended  to then move to the United States in 1947?
But they just say we haven't talked about enough things  even what happened in the war  you know.
When do you talk about  in the first days of the war?
I wasn't twenty years when the war ended  but a month later  in June  I was twenty years old  and the Poles start bothering me to go to the army.
Well  so you're telling me that so close after the war ended  this horrible war  they had already concert  theater  opera  dances -- Yes. --
So during this period before the war  between -- before the war comes to the Netherlands  between 35 and 40  what is your memory of that household?
We did not know about each other during the war  the blockage  because no letters there  only bombs.
As a matter of fact  they kept certain things for us  like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned our valuables after the war because I also ha d - we also had friends  they were also teachers  that we left some clothes and st uff like this  and when we came back  they wouldnt give us anything.
So we worked -- and there and then -- and then when the war got closer  then it became to that extent that they took us in the front where we carried the ammunition from the train to a place  and then from the place we used to hand them over to shoot.
Before the war she I dont know how it ha ppened  but but she became part of a Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 15womens movement of some sort.

Its still -- the war was still -- 1944  still the war was going on and all that.
My grandfather  not grandparent s because grandma left for United States on the last ship before the outbreak of the war.
So  there was something going on that the detail -- you know  nothing was talked about and I left shortly -- a year after the war  when it was still war torn and people were coming ba ck  so I never got details.

You were telling me they were poor  and... Yeah  yeah  yes  we were uh  they were very poor  and they did the best that they could really  and we want  perhaps  we felt so sorry for ourselves laying there  and  uh  on the end  I remember  uh  there  there was a little boy that was running after the birds  and it was already  we heard already the Germans coming up a  uh  we hear already n earer coming the  uh  war coming  the front.

and suffered by the Nazi regime  and they signed an accord  an agreement  an authorization  that a trial should be established  and these people should be indicted for crimes against the 116 peace  war crimes  crimes against humanity.

I grew very expert at explaining all of the problems faced by Jews after the war  what they had experienced during the war.

And I met his son later  after the war  I made it for the chief rabbi in Antwerp.

And uh in in my case that was all the more understandable  because  you know  it was a very personal crusade  the war  and a very personal uh involvement with my parents and my brother and my sister over there  and uh I didn't know their fate at that time but I could surmise and but this  for generations we had talked about our uh heritage and the like  at one time this Sergeant Hadley and I  and he was for generations in in Ohio and uh his family and but and he was not personally involved but he just uh uh broke down completely and I I was told by other members of uh who came to Buchenwald at various times that the same thing had happened to uh General Eisenhower when he came there.

Uh  idiotically speaking  I was saved really by a German on the end because um  well that's  that's  that's a different th ing that's already libera tion  and uh how we  we  we stayed there  but towards the end of the war every German soldier or that particular unit that I know of wore civilian clothing under the uh army clothing.

But suppose I would say to you  most of the guilty never get tried  for-forgetting maybe in most crimes  but in this particular kind of cr ime  in war crimes  they dont get tried.

We will be at your at anytime  and so though or head of th e committee here  and you will with God's help...the rabbi of course don't repeat it so much...with God's help  you will lead us to the end of the war  and you will lead...take us out from the ghetto which is a inside   and you will bring us to the fatherland and soil  and there you will be the head of a community and so and so.
Like  like  like I say  I was hungry before the war.
And now I'm just going to ask yo u some questions about your life as a child before the war.

So  to answer  as I just stated  we did know something tragic as war will come  but we did not know when.

They used to come and visit us and so we knew that the war is coming to an end.

The war is not finally over  however  when France is liberated  when Paris is liberated.
America was the last thing on my mind because I didnt think of going to America in the first few couple of years after th e war  only America had the strict quota.

I dont know how he got his name  but I think it was from some prominent figure in the newspapers at the time when  actually  he was born during the first World War.
And with the other fellow who didnt who survived the war  but we split it after the war because he married a German young girl.
And it wasnt -- a-again  you know  coming from an environment so surrounded by death  it -- it -- it -- it was one more and the -- the war didnt end in 1945  it continued.

Did you get any medical care  either dur ing the war or immediately after the war for your back?
Have to go to Syria and to look around  get films and documents on American Television on the Brunner case  but you know there is an end for us because we are unable to act in a country where there is a dictator  Assad is a dictator  an Arab dictator  he has a sympathy for Alois Brunner  because he knows quite well where he is  and also we had no support from western politicians  mainly as Syria belongs to the group of Allies in the Gulf war  there was no more hope  and even though Chirac was the President a nd was the last one who approached Assad asking about Brunner  there is no answer  sure you can obtain something if you make a political or diplomatic boycott of Syria  perhaps you could but no other countries even America would take the risk to embarrass Assad because of Alois Brunner.

Thats where she lived and thats where my sister went to visit before the war started.
And ch -- not changing the story  but -- but getting finished with this  after the war I found this man  he lived in Israel.

My father who was a a reserve officer in the Polish army expected to be mobilized but before anything 2 happened uh the Germans came to our town and to the best of my recollection it was on the 8th of September  about a week or eight days after the war started  and uh things have changed from then on.

>> Ge orge Pick: The Germans no longer trusted the Hungarians  they knew the Hungarians had various connections  back -door connections with both the English and Soviets  and they were trying to get out of the war somehow  and the German intelligence penetrated the Hungarian intelligence  so they knew Hitler was worried about a couple of million German soldiers who were east of Hungary.

Not of course with the persecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared and he always – I remember one of the th ings that he always used to say was  ﬁWell  this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about the Jews  particularly the Jews that had served Germany in the war and so on and so forth  or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesnt believe in all that nonsense and if it do esnt work out  we will leave on the ﬁlast trainﬂ.ﬂ Whatever that ﬁlast trainﬂ meant  we never caught it.
SB: Lets go back and talk about when the war actually started  what you saw  what you heard.
And we started marching  and we marched for days  and  and uh  I have no idea how many days we marched  and also uh  a couple times we went into wagon cars again  and then  we had to get off of them  and start walking again  and it seemed that to each camp we arrived  they were already overfilled with people because they condensed the camps as the Russian were coming closer  and there was no room  and uh  we were just exhausted on the road because um  we had ve ry little food  and we were just exhausted from walking  and a lot of people  while we were walking through Poland  we uh  tried to escape  thinking that they could speak the language  the Polish language  and they would run away  but we used to hear shots all through the marching as we were walking  we heard shots and we heard people being shot  and we saw how the people were falling in the ravines  ravines  in the ditches  behind trees  behind shrubs  on hills  it  it  it was like a war zone  with wounded people  and  and  and dead people all over on both sides of the roads  there were dead people who were trying to escape  and also for people who couldn't keep up w ith the march  because as we walked and we got exhausted  and our feet were killing us  and people were falling behind  and the Germans were shooting everybody who couldn't keep up with the d eath march  and this is the reason why they called that the Death March  because that so many pe ople died on that road before they arrived into a concentration camp  and this is how I arrived in Bergen-Belsen from that death march.
So  as soon as possible  I had an opportunity once in who was originally his parents were living in the Parish  but he was a soldier during the war in 1940  and he was in the south.

But it creates a tru -- an -- you know  Ive often wondered -- you know  people have asked me  in this country  what USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 16 made you do what you did during the war?
Did the did you and the other workers in the camp have any sense that the war was coming to an end?
I was transferred to war crimes and there was first used in a capa city of which I didn't speak so far.
Did...as the war approached  did you have Jewish friends as well?
I think the qu estion has something to do with when one person is taken and other people who have also done ma ny things came back  does that enlarge the reputation of Raoul Wallenberg  because he was the one who obviously suffered after the war in a way that the rest of you didn't.
So -- Did the teachers ask you about what happened to you during the war?
From my -- no  the housekeeper that worked fo r my aunt  she saved Zula during the war.
and Italy  and up to that with regard to the state of the war and however  the obvi ously  the extent that horrendous happenings which were not far from us  we did not really realize  except that in the 1940s and 1941  1942  obviously  first of all  our mere population had gone for paramilitary duties  including  obviously  my father and all the fa mily.
The -- the Americ ans  up til the time that Germany declared war against the United States  they had embassies and consulates all over the place.

I know that we have almost no chance to survive  but I am willing to give my life with the knowledge that my thr ee girls will survive the war.ﬂ And  you know  since what we had in 1945  right after the war  and I feel that all the difficult situations that we went through  in moments where we really felt that its the end  we reached a point of no return  that it was really my mother who was wa tching over us.
Let's start first with you telling us what your life was like  what your community was like in those years leading up to the beginning of World War II with the invasion of Poland in September 1939.
Briefly tell us why they occupied  just very briefly  why they occupied Hungary that late in the war and then what that meant for you and your family.
I thought at that time  and I alwa ys reacted very poorly to ether  and I remember throwing off the mask in those days  but before the war my tonsils were removed also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga  and I threw off the mask  which I did again  but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right.
Before the war -- although  you know  my first interesting  and -- experience in the contemporary history  was arige Crystal Night.
No  she well  World War II came  and we we bought a house  and we rented rooms.
She told  oh its terrible  but I think it cant be that it would be a war  a Great War  she told such.
Whatever I remember from before the war or even during the war the love  the affection I got from my pare nts  its all gone.
The nur -- the internati onal military tribunal was established to deal with a nati on that planned and conceived and waged an aggressive war -- Right. --
And thats why they decide to move  1920  after  you know  first war.
You know people tell me that...uh...I was resp onsible  as you know  during the war  after the war here in the United States for 27 years...of creating a commemorations of probably the largest in the world beside award.
Our schooling time  and then Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 41changes in the economy that were improving little by little; because you know  country was actually devastated during the first World War  and the oppressors  the occupiers  they they were taking their share.

What was the name first of all of your friend the one that you were -- Ruth  Ruth Berlinska but she got married after the war.

Instead of leaving you in Hungary  figured the war is over  let them go home or you go home  the Hungarians brought them into Gunskirchen.
I did not see those things all the war years  not until I came to America.
And then when they broke out the war  everything is gone.
This is tape number one  side A. Lets start just with sort of a brief overview of your experi ences during the war  before we move on to -- to after the war.
They were confined to their home  specially to the Jewish young people  specially  and uh sent in uh the labor camp and mandatory factory to dig trenches for the war.
The first such town that we occupied that we conquered  was Aschaffenburg  where an aunt of mine had left prior to the war and had married my favorite uncle  and I was to their wedding in 1924.
It would have been so easy of you to -- for you to take out a pistol and shoot this guy  and pilt -- ge -- get rid of him  and get rid of the war  and all that sort of thing.
We think of some  partic ularly when we see the movies with the Nazi arm bands and you th ink of the arrogance and the arr ogance of the Gestapo and so on  this was not the kind of man he wa s and he may not have even been that during the war  but I don't know.
I said ye s  and I told him that I lived in Berlin all through the war.
During the war there were many people in the ghetto who held on to their faith.
It was in 1935 and I met him fo r the first time after the war in 1968.
A few of them had converted before the war  but most of them stayed Jewish  but were were completely secular  I would say.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 61 Prob -- probably they did  you know  but I dont know exactly the -- the -- how much  you know  but they know that was a bad war  and there was a ba -- bad conditions for s -- a lot of people suffered  and its hard to explain.
Follow the war- Yeah  I was in contract with them. .
At this point there are four of you  at -- do you -- are you looking for your mother  or have you -- do you real -- know shes -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 22 Well  I -- I bil -- never -- I been looking for my mother ever since  and -- but I know that -- I -- I know from Auschwitz  because I know that there was a -- some person in the -- what they called the Sonderkommando -- that means a special detail and he worked in the crematorium and he was from that particul ar town in Poland where we lived before the war.
I had  before the war  working at Funkin  I had contact -- they were in Poland  were at a lot of companies owned by people who came years ago from Germany  manufacture  so on.
My father who was caught by the end of the war but not recognized was in a jail together with another Jew who didn't recognize him either.
He was able to comment to me about that  and he 28 said it was really like being in a barracks in th e military  and I think he was trying to compare it to World War .
But I would never believe that hes going to risk his life to come to see us  to give us news  that the war is -- you know  it was in fo -- in 1945  I dont know which month it was.
There are different -- I me -- is seet -- not a single group  but together this is the group -- summ er camp shortly before the war.
You know  to these extreme events belong -- belongs the reign of ignorance  and it happened after the war  just to illustrate it  after the war  a couple of years after the war in Hungary   the -- the Soviet regime has been introduced by Hungarians  and it has been declared a -- th-the -- the workers class should take over the main -- the -- the most interesting  the most important places.
Later after the war  I heard  she was taken into prison by the Dutch with the Mexican Consul because she cheated and got money.
Its it and I mean  it wasnt my fault  it was a matter of life and death  it was war  but the results were something that ververy deeply first it was that boy  and now the 20 women and children.
So just shows you what Poland was like before the war.
And he also gave me a letter from the Minist er of Interior which said that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me th eir citizenship because I had fought in the civil war and also  the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter said that they were not able to locate me a nd that they now found me and I had to assume citizenship  Spanish citizenship.
At the time of war you've got to get these people off the battlefield as fast as you can because infection sets in almost immediate when they hit the ground.
What was very nice you know  Frankfurt was occupied in nine in March of 1945  a couple of months before the end of the war.
I didn't want to have children because I was afraid that another war would come one day  and that my children shouldn't have to live through the same thing I did  and then I said  \ No  I have to show the terrible people who wanted to kill us all  that they cannot kill a race  and I have to build a new family because they took my family away.
And I worked over there as a courier until the end of the war.
Well the war broke out  so I thought I gonna join some relatives and spend the time with them. '
We went on that plane as all Greeks from the war.

And after the war while you kept your Polish name  but people knew you were Jewish?
We were in touch with him until America went into the war.
So  as the war in the second part of the war  youre actually actively involved in the war effort.
And that German police officer because he was by sheer coincidence a former comrade in arms from World War 1 saved my father from prison.
I lived with them long enough for him to get -- you know  we do know that the war has started in the meantime  right?
My father was a soldier in the Imperial Russian Army in World War I. It was a terrible war.
I didnt have much religion all during the wa r  and after the war  oh God  I was bitter.
He lived his life very hard and he was very troubled by it all and unfortunately we didnt have the advantage of having some kind of therapy or having the right kind of attention that we do now and I always feel bad that Andy died prematurely and that the war reached out and took him.
When did when did Italy fee l that theres a war on?
And this girl  her name was -- now she [i ndecipherable] after the -- after the war she get married.
So  yes; the family began to know before September 1 that world  not knowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to break out any time  any moment.
Because I dont think that at that point we wanted to go to anywhere where life would be a conflict again or war again  or hostility again.
Before the war I didnt know whether or not  were your parents Zionists ?
So when the first World War started  and you know that Lithuania was under the Tsarist regime  so he was a rush - a r -- a citizen of Russia.
We had  during the war  when we kne w that they are going to take our apartment away  that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto  we had neighbors.

As you very well know  we are the closest family that there is  that there ever was  and that wasnt even because we went through the war together  that we were bound by common horrible experience.
O-Oh yes  and the reason we this is an interesting point  the reason we went  they fou apparently the Nazis in the especially the the head of the Nazis in Nuremberg   planned to have a museum of a-a-after the war  of the s the sou those people  lost tribe th of Jews.
And so...uh... uh...I stayed in that school...uh...til the end of the war.
A war with Germany  a war with Germany  and we didn't really know what it means.
I meant aft were going through the ex periments  but at some point the war does start to turn against the Germans.
And my mother said yes  and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War I already  and so we had a little party  and he brought this boy.
And I know that the one on -- the last one on the right  she is the one who survived the war  and who went to Palestine at that time.
Yeah  he came back in the war; he came back to Zwolle.
And do you think it was a help after the war in taking your mind off what was going on all around you?
This picture was taken right after the war and we are here a group of people on the place where the bunker on Mila 18 was located.
The family on my father's side  they mostly conver ted before the war an d nobody  or almost nobody went to ghetto.
And I wanted to put that in  it was also a part of my development after the war  as a -- an aware Jew  let me put it that way.
And his pupils grew wider and wider  he said  \ If American Intelligence has all this information how can we win the war?\
During these war years  did you pay any attention to religion or to holidays  or to anything like that?
5 You were doing -- before the war started  were you doing secretarial work  or this was during the war?
Did you tell him after the war  that you had left  knowing that he was coming?
In Dece mber  1944  the war was over in France and she still died there.
Having seen what you saw in the camps  in Buchenwald   did it alter your view of th of the war  and your role in it?
From your sadness  from your uh --- Before the war  before the Hungarians came  did you all like to do things  in the outdoors  did you play a lot or did you go fishing or --- Well  we played like kids play.
And and our family just lived in that envi ronment and starting in '44  everybody starts saying OK  now now uh when the war comes in  how do we survive  because everybody knows that uh when the front comes over uh the German s are going to come in and then all the bets are off.
And uh when it come to the time when the war got worse and worse during the end  a lot of time I was...I I almost didn't hope that he...Julian is still alive.
We also believed that the children should get better education that their parents had and we -- we were sent to school  we -- wh-when the war started  Jews were not allowed to go to school  and I think I mentioned that the professors  of course  couldnt teach  so what we did  we created a Jewish school.

What kind of neighborhood did you and your family live in after the war?
Was there anything that you studied during the war that you might not have studied if there hadnt been a war?
So they were very cooperative in working with us  and if you did come to a point where you were discussing war crimes  or tried to weave them into the atrocity aspect  their answer was always  hey  I was just a soldier.

This is tape number two  side A  and lets just talk a little bit about the end of the war before we continue on with your story.
And and  you know  so then after the war  when not it wasnt really after the war  it was just a time when our town was liberated.

He couldn't go back to where he came from  to Austria  because of the war.
Everything that -- that used to be n-nor mal ju -- before the war  and during the vi -- first year  maybe  of the war  was gone.
You mentioned you remember when United States enters the war after Pearl Harbor  and you write in your diary on the ninth of December  1941 that weve entered the war.
And unfortunately for him  after the war ende d  he went to the eastern zone of Berlin  maybe he was sympathetic with the new move ment.
The olde r ones  the ones that stayed in  not the draftee World War two  he was out already  but people who were professionals  either officer  or enlisted men  didnt make any di fference  there were many -- oh  there was even one that I remember who came from a family  he was very poor  Italian family  and he said  ﬁI -- I -- I like what youre doing lieutenant  cause I -- I grew up hungry.ﬂ So that was the extent of the conversation  but -- Did you  when you got here to the United States  did you search out for other people who were survivors?
There were hardly any families that did not feel the...the tragedy of war. (
before the war and you did say some thi ngs about it in the first interview  but we didnt get your -- we didnt get the names of your family  your parents and your sister.
So  a family outside of our city  a uh  actually a duke and duchess  have accepted her as another one of their daughters  and my sister had spent the uh war with them.
She got out on a vessel 48 which sailed from the Baltic during the war.
So it shows  you could give him any rank  Erling Fjeld  he was a -- he was a fake name  so -- but its incredible  its all original soldiers [indecipherable] for duration of war.

Are you well  we talked about whether youre more comfortable around those who survived the war  than those who didnt have to.
He was in the Russian Army and was taken prisoner of war by the Italians and we didn't know about it.
His excuses for that of course  if you've heard the tapes are you know  this was a war effort  he had nothing to do with the day to day things in the factories  he had to provide people so they could 24 provide for the war effort.
I have to sketch out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don't have to do that here.
The fact that he came from the French  he was a prisoner of war.
Also  in the beginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody wants to go to America and if they have family  we can register and we would be able to go to America.
They were really wonderful friends with with with with uh with a sense of solidarity and as I told you  when I came to that BBC show  this man  was his name  they said this is your life and they brought me over as one of the of the witnesses to to give evidence what...what he had done and how he done it and and uh uh to repeat this again  I hope that this story of the British prisoners of war in Auschwitz will be told one day  because it deserves to be told.
And then we moved to Bari to a transient camp which was internment camp during the war for German  Austrian and and Yugoslavian Jews under Mussolini  and there we stayed for about two years.

And I when the war broke out  I saw the the mobilization  the the Belgians were trying to defend the country and they were mobilizing the people on the street  and were mobilizing the horses  everything.
The company that I was with produced medical supplies  which were being used in the war.
My father's elder brother left before World War I. Went to Strasburg in Germany.

End of Tape Three  Side B USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 90 Beginning Tape Four  Side A This is the continuation of an interview with Ed -- with Ed Lessing  and this is tape four  side A. And we were just going to talk in general  sort of  thinking about how youre a different person than you might have been without the experiences you went through during the war.
Matter of fact  before the war  he was a engineer there  from the bridge there -- they was build up the bridge.
Does he remember if there were any Soviet prisoners of war there?
We being prepared for a war somewhat  in Boy Scouts on all the camps to which we went in 1939  we were trying to make them on the Polish/German border.
When the war ended  you and your brother  with your uncle  what then happened?
But he gave him some paintings in order to -- in order to preserve them and give it -- give them back to us after the war.
Before we do that  you have to tell us  during that time eventually the war was over.
Shortly after the war  of course  when they brought all these lists and.... But my father came back from Theresienstadt  and my second sister came back.
>> Betsy Anthony: The war break out in Kenya is also significant because at the time Kenya was a British colony.
And we moved to Riverside Drive from Thayer Street   and -- Now  were talking about September 39  is that when the war -- Yes.
And the thing is  in World War II  naturally  we had American and Australian  and we had a lot of military people base in Haifa  in the area  in the camps  in the airport base.
After the war  you had  but you -- I didnt know anybody who did it during the war  I mean not among our friends.
I was trying to tell them in French that I was involved with the criminals--the war criminals.
I wa s Russian after World War Two  now its Ukraine.
Nobody never heard of -- I mean  never heard because we didnt bother  but we never heard of many -- during the war you didnt hear of people anyway  because foreign countries  you know  they were occupied countries.
And only when I came back after the war  I realized how much they loved and admired my parents.
In my case -- and I always call myself a refugee  but technically Im not a refugee  Im -- Im an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 62 immigrant  because I left after the war.
So you're outside of Munich when the war ends  and how does your work change?
In the beginning we was terrible  and then it was even worse  because the war already started  there was a lot of wounded people  which they bring into deeper Russia   you know  the other side  because they are wounded.
And when he started looking for us  the war ends  and my father  since he knew German well  he there were displaced persons camps  so he was made the the Romanian nationalities  he wa he he was the le-leader or director of the Polish gr oup.
As we moved  as the war came  other recollections come up in other countries.
3 Well  the Seventh port was  I believe  an ar my base before the war.
The other another area  I guess where although its only been explicit once  I see it differently from many  not all  is on the German military leadership of the second World War  which I would suggest that the top and strategy was generally incompetent  when others Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 74 think was competent.
It was after the war that we started realizing that so many people had died in the ovens that we were just astounded.
One of the cousins went through the war with her mo ther  and she got cancer.
The Hungarians got a little better than we got  not in the camp  before the war.
So you said you chose to go into jour nalism  and you thought maybe it related to your experience as a child following the war news?
I once read where someone was telling an account of  it might not have been his war stories  it was something and what stuck in my mind was  he said ﬁMy memory has a lot of holes in it.ﬂ So Im going to paraphrase what he said  or copy what he said  and tell you that my memory  after 50 years of not going back to all this  until I was given an opportunity to give this oral history  my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it.
Im just afraid whoever wins this war  will do the same to the other guy  always.
But with his friends from Lukow who had survived the war  and some of them had as partisans and so on  these friends who were in America  their na tural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern.
Some of them went to England  some of them went to France and were later caught in France during the war.
We saw more or less the victorious aspect of Germany  that means coming up with something new in the industry and designing a new airplane and being number one in this and so on  and eventually of course came the war.
Maybe -- he may be a Scots Canadian  one of his -- whose relatives may have died at the hand of a Nazi during the war  I dont know  I didnt inquire.

There had been a strict State Department rule that foreign service officers should not serve longer than two years at that time because of the Cold War situation.
There must have been many other events that occurred during the war years  in your life.
But after the war  it was something interesting in my life  living in Hui with a friend of mine.
And she was released   and she stayed in London for until after the war  and eventually came to the U.S. But we would go and visit her too  but this was  you know  not while the blitz was going on.
Just before the war  before th its a picture of 1939  March of 1939  the whole class  which is not the only class  but the school  the whole Hebrew school.
And loved all my theoretical courses  I hated a ll my applied courses  but I did okay  and Interview with Eric Simon June 21  2014 82it was a bit of a a pain  because because of the draft and the situation with the war  we had to go on whats called the rapid program; all summer Oh  the wis no vacations.
03:18:05 They need some people that would work  ye s. They got rid of  you know  the natives here  so they needed  until  in 1944 they figure out  it's final  they're going to liquidate the ghetto  and the war changed their whole picture.
One of my big images about that he -- from the war is an image that I retrieved from a book written by one of Titos pprimary assistants [indecipherable] Angelis.
But imagine  if the war will be over a nd the Germans are losing  so they won't...they won't remember the SS.
I think where we left off  unfortunately  there's so much more to tell us with liberation and in early 1945 the war would continue  a time of chaos and yet Estelle  her sister and mother went through unbelievable things after that o nly to finally  two years later  more than two years later  make it to the United States in 1947.
This that they write in the book who helped me in the war very much.
As it happens  my father has a ve ry close associate  a fr -- an old -- an old friend who was from -- from Warsaw  Jewish doctor  a woman who survived the war  whose parents did not.
And that may be very good to relieve the tension but it's not very good for coll ecting war crimes evidence.
And naturally Perlasca went because he didn't know what he was not speaking Hungarian  so later  several days...this is the whole period this was quite short  short...I haven't heard so much about Perlasca  but when after during the war  my husband wanted from me to write down in his memory  then he he was always very over-joyed with this person in the right time that that was this Italian that he was able to use like a Spanish  like a a Spaniard  like a charge d'affaires.
And I s -- and I always said I am not -- I dont want you to feel sorry for me  thats -- its not beca use  you know  some understanding  not exactly to feel  you know  they see the war  thats [inaudible] to me.

He was operated once in Germany and after the war the second time.
And he was not in the hotel  and he was not in the war time too connected with us at all.
And lets just hop before we go into the war  a little bit more about life before.
In the case of a friend of mine that went to the same cheder  a religi ous school that I went to before the war  rumor was that he tried to escape.
And  the war to an extent  its only in retrospect that radicalized me.
He gave me and I still have it  and a long  long conversation started with a man whose daughter  hers elf  had been given over to Christians and when he survived the war his daughter who by then was eight or nine was saying oh those goddamn Jews  was inbued with anti-semitism by the very people to whom Turkoff entrusted his own daughter.
When did you--just tell us  briefly--after th e war about when you and Bela married and when you moved to Israel and then to... Yeah.
Going back to your younger years in Newport News   many people from Europe   refugees  would say that when they came over  before the war  and they Interview with Henry Stern June 8  2016 57 ended up in the south  they were taken aback by what they saw as racial discrimination  when they would arrive and see that there are different facilities for white Americans and African Americans.

And th-they were wo rried about our being -- gogoing to war.
>> Bill Benson: And what we don't even begin to touch upon is what happened after the war  not only immediately after the war  the circumstances that Anna began to describe for us  getting married  and then spending the next 19 years living under Communist rule before Anna and her two sons and family were able to leave and come to the United States .
This is a war  there were all kinds of rumors going on  because at -- at some point  we were -- we were bombed by the Ca rtushas from -- from the other side of the river.
Give you an ex ample liberate--how many Jewish people you find what they kill Germans after the war?
Then I have a brother Maurice  wh o survived the war wi -- with me.
The one thing that comes to mind for instance was the -- was the Armenian -- the persecution of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915  the World War I. I havent rese arched that for myself well enough to know whether there was  first of all on the part of the Armenians outside of Turkey  some organized effort to attempt to confront the Turkish governme nt with it.
And and actually  the first mo memory of her is for what I thought that it was the beginning of beginning of the war.
Do you think that you would have been a different person today  if you hadn't gone through the war  that Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 84 Yeah.

There was only a plank  uh  keeping us away from everybody else  and  uh  but we came through and on the 4th of May  when the war was over  and they said  \ You can come out now.
I think that probably I had it in my jeans because I said I had depression on  on  on my mother's side  some relatives  but I think it probably needed a trigger and it probably  that the war  you know  acted as a trigger and brought it all ou t.

And so we found out that there was a prisoner of war camp where they had a lot of prisoners who were capable of doing special things.
So for the first years of the war  from 1938  '39 through the early '40s  our difficulties come not so much from the Nazis but from the war itself.
I see the same thing going on right today in in Kosovo   where we were talking about fighting a war  were fighting something.

One of the difficult things that also happened at Fort McClellan   is that it was a a it was a cu a prisoner of war camp for German soldiers.
But I'd also like to say that due to World War II that was not the primary focus of the United States government  which was essentially to defeat Germany.
In the war in 1948 we lose Mount Scopus  don't we?

I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is  is hard to say  because at this point in the 1990s after living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish  I think  is so rusty that he didnt use it.

He was in World War I. I had a picture taken with me with my uniform and him.

I was the first cultural and press attache in Moscow since World War II.
And -- all right  so then the next thing that you remember is when the war began.
So it it put this this vice around me  basically  and when I compare that to the little girl who snubbed her father you know I I am aware of what a dramatic impact that war had  uh and at and it was really the most the most poignant memory I have was oh in 1943 I think it was  uh we were riding on what's a [bock... ] - it's a bicycle with a big sort of uh box in front of it and that's how they would transport vegetables and stuff like that - and somebody was riding it and my brother and I were sitting in it  on the edge and I was holding on and then I noticed my brother was not holding on and I of course being you know wanting to be just as brave as he  I decided not to hold on just at the worse possible time as he was going around the corner  and I fell off the [bock... ]  hit my head on the on the asphalt  on the pavement.
These soldiers that were on the other side of the camp had been the prisoners of war  and they were now being repatriated to Italy.

But most children of surv ivors  even born after the war  went into education.
And this mostly cut in in my period from after the war in Germany.
The war is just lost  this had been such a powerful enemy  a Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 155 thorough enemy  and a ruthless enemy.
Did any of your friends from before the war re turn afterwards?
Well  when our our our thought would be maybe its only mine  but our thought would be that the fact that this plane shortened the war so much that that a lot of the Holocaust survivors benefited from the fact that and were still alive today because of the even Eisenhower said that.
Well  my mother -- until the war  my mother kept fairly kosher.
4 Were you involved in any political organizations while you were in Kovno before the war?
After the war  we had contact with our relatives and my wife had contact with her relatives.
They had not been Zionists because if their parents had been Zionists  they would have left Poland before the war and gone to Palestine.
It was -- and the war came very suddenly  when the borders were closed  if you know what Im saying.
The only ones that we were able to During the war.

But after the war  when we lived in an apartment  I was always scared at night they are going to come.
But I heard all this going on and somebody explained to me and I was speaking a little English  that the United States was at war.
END OF TAPE 2 48 TAPE 3 So after the war you were in Germany a while and you went to Israel and what I was asking you was  was it easy getting to Israel.
I was 13 years old when the war broke out but I belonged to a couple of organizations  just to get together to meet people.
Tell me  did your father was your father a solder in World War I?
This was after 20 years  because we went to Auschwitz in '44  and this  no  it was 23 years  and this happened  when he told me this  it was in 1967  after the six day war when I went to Haifa.
As a matter of fact  my son  when he was in Kent -- I didnt mention it  when he went to Kent  they had the Yom Kippur war  and he raised money fo r i -- for i -- for Israel.
But its typical of the atmosphere of the school that the free places  or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War  yeah.
In 1943 when the Germans were loosing on the Stalingrad and so on  they took us  took more revenge on 18 the Jews than ever before  what I read after the war.
So  I started school  and until the end of the war I was in school.
I crossed that ocean four times during the war  and when we were lucky  we a we always the Germans always didnt have a their submarines in the right place  because we d go across  you know  like a a whole whole mess of ships would go at one tim e  and oh man  itd be stuf stre stretched out for miles.
My father said  \ If you go into this war  and you get injured  you come home I beat you up like you never have been. \  (
I think I purposely did not seek out people from Yu goslavia because there was always an issue of  and where were you du ring the war and who are you?
That was a terribly an atrociou s moment when this came down and exploded  not far from us uh so we saw already that the war came came closer.
In the meantime  he comes back there  the war ended  we're in 34 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD Switzerland  he's able to go to the offices of this lawyer  Kostner  who is still in Hungary.
And of course  you know  there were hints  and of course in the British -- in the Jewish press in England  they were giving out all the details that they could find  but you didnt know how serious it was until later in the war.
Ma-Made made inquiries and went through the army  you know  that was in but that was actually the after the war  you know.
Because  I I guess what Im leading up to is that  if it was the Ukraine  then you were passing through some of the wors t ravaged areas  where where the war was  you know  had been particularly brutal.
And I came to Matrosov [indecipherable] but he was a Russian  he came in the first war took  and he he married a White Russia n shi goya and we went to I went over there and I told him  Mr. Matrosov  we got to find out  your neighbors who some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to destroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him.
Not in uniform  but when the war broke out  we could not run to Russia because it would have been considered desertion.
By the time war came the father had already passed away but the mother  their mother  was living in Zagreb.
And I decided not to talk about the war  and not to I se I I was thinking that they can read about it  they can learn about it.
His father got killed in the beginning of the War in Odessa.
Then they passed a law in 194- -- late 19 -- after the war  you know the p -- the law was passed that all those citizens  Polish citizens from before the war  Proushinna  I was -- was Polish citizens  because mostly partisans  lot of them -- lot of survivors from the Auschwitz  you know  they came back to Proushinna.
Had she left for Russia In 1939 in August  just before the war.

And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War  which was -- they sent me to Germany  which was a good place to be during the Korean War.

Interview with Esfir Brodskaya 7 August 11  2014 Before the war.
Sigh) I think that about eight or ten came back alive after the war.
DL] But being so close to what was happening  what psychological effect did that have on you after the war when you realized what was happening? [
She was also very helpful in convincing the community that its about time that the population of 40 000  which was right before the war  should have a school of higher education  not to have to send the children away from home.
I mean  when the war started in 1939 over there  the -- the other two  their parents had come to England  one in London  the other one in Glasgow in Scotland  and so they went to live with their parents.
13 -- issues  political issues  tyranism  anti-S emitism  a lot of discussion the situation in Romania  the situation in Russia  whether Jews are doing better in Russia -- this was before the war -- [indecipherable] -- and during the war what -- you know  a lot of discussion.
And...uh...but the...uh... word that the war has taken a turn and the Allied Forces are making advances started to take hold by seeing that the Germans are starting to liber ate...not liberate  to...uh...dispose of these camps and sending the...uh... prisoners out to different camps located further into Germany.
04:10:22 Maybe they were treated better than we were   because prisoners of war  that is  but the Germans didn't care very much about the Geneva convention  that they should be treated like human beings.
And from there on -- we had tiny  little room  and -- Did Gabe go with you on this -- No  no  he couldnt  becau -- no  he tried to get back to United States  he had a hard time  because he was -- he went illegally to fight during this -- the war of liberation and with Israel  you know and so -- So  you were with him for tw o days  and [indecipherable] -- I always say I -- I knew him four days be fore we -- we got married  all told -- saw each other.
For his birthday in April  he was born in April  he give us and after the war  while he ran away - he couldn't  he told us  he got us together and he told us - I have to go away.
You -- this was something in Poland for the war  an orange was something.
I was wondering if you could start by describing the town that you lived in  pre -war life.
Some I knew from before the war and when I say before the war  I mean before 1939.
No  I never had the sense that -- she let me do  eat what I wanted and at that point in the beginning it wasn't always easy to get food after the war but we always had relatively good food.
And just to back up  do you remember wh ere you were when the war actually ended?
I guess this is a very important aspect when when we talk about what happened uh during the 2nd World War in Denmark.
Well  what we have in New Jersey  near that Chatham place -- as a matter of fact  it was built exactly where the nightclub used to be  which burned down during World War II.
This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother or from my cousin Mutti who wouldn't have know because my cousin Mutti could only give me information about the pre -war period because he left in 1 938.
So  he didnt want to talk about the war at all  but my Uncle Harry filled me in on the months and months and months that he lived in in a in hovels  and Interview with Al Jaffee May 21  2016 20 Was this when you were older that he filled you in on this?
He was a high officer under Eisenhower  because he had jumped while stil l the war was going on over Gottingen in German uniform.
Throughout the war  my father went back to Hungary during the war.
Uh  I uh  I faced the first encounter with the soldiers  you know  when uh  I was stop on the street  and eh  I had the impression that he wants to ask me a question  and instead he kicked me   you know  without reason  you know  and this is where I realize that the Poland is in war  that we have been occupied  that that things are not normal anymore.
And he -- he remained there through the liberation  survived the liberation by the Americans  and -- but was much too weak  contracted -- well  what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in Ebensee and still without having been able to establish contact with us  two months after the war  on July 25th  1945.
So those people were saved because they left before the war.
But when the war passed my village where I was  the war continued.
I believed the news breaking about a Hasidic person holding a gun  that change came in Israel and it only came after World War II.
That was about -- on -- not far from the Russian border where the Germans caught them  the prisoners of war  so they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to Sobibor.
I'm wondering if you visited Germany after the Second World War and if you did what were your feelings towards the Germans that you met and the present day Germans.
And thats by mentioning the book that your daughter wrote  your daughter Rita Gabis wrote a book that was published two  three months ago  called ﬁGuest at the Shooters Banquet .ﬂ And in it she describes her journey to find out more about what your fathers role had been during World War II.
And it was also perhaps rather easy for the Germans to force th em to get into the war on their side because this all goes back to the first world war  you know.
Do you have any memories of how that was how you felt that  when you were before the war  as a child?
Some of them were sent to inner Russia and some of them survived and came back after the war.
Not in the beginning  only as war winds drew closer  that they became more aggressive.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 >> Esther Starobin: They used to come to visit  after the war  because they couldn't really travel so easily if you were an alien from Germany  during the war.
And I was still 13 months in Kovno because the war was still going on  the war was over  being an engineer I got a good position with the Russians.
Yeah  there was a school there  and vi vi after the war I we go we gonna come back  I visit the school over there.
Every community has to pay taxes from 1914 til today  if some Jew owes taxes.ﬂ Now there were Jews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their fatherland.
And  uh  it was wonderful  and then  in the days  what we took there  we went out to swim  and I met a lot of Germany also  and one of them was  uh  a young man  who exchanged cards  and my name was Mandel  and then years go by and there is the war  and the Nazis are in Budapest  and suddenly the ------------- in my house  and I look out and I see a uniformed man  and my parents were  I mean  shaking.
After the war ended in Europe  I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945  that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about 2 Jewish Daily Forward 3 Algemeyner Yidish Arbeter Bund in Lita  Poylen  Rusland [Universal Jewish Workers Union in Lithuania  Poland and Russia] (Yiddish); Jewish socialist organization.
Were there any other cases  like war crime trials that you worked on?
Q. Now  before the war  did -- A. This was before the war.
But at that moment when when this happened  the partition happened in 1948  at that time I was in the United States and my my father was in Canada and he did not have too much he did not make too much of an effort at that time to go to Palestine  even though we had family in Palestine at that time  and I received Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25  1998 17[indecipherable] from Palestine  but at that time it was not settled yet [indecipherable] After the birth of the state  there was the the war  and there have been subsequent wars.
And at this period of time  just as the war was ending  were you able to communicate correspond at all to your brot hers who were in the Jewish brigade?
So Holland wasn't a country that was used to battles and war.
But then unfortunately we got the news from New York that my father was dying of lung cancer  because he had been a smoker all his life  from the time he was 15 and the only time he couldn't smoke was during the war  but he started right after and he got lung cancer a nd he was hopeless and then we got word he was dying.
Oh  war is yeah  I was in uniform at that time  and we celebrated with the a with the Americans  and there was a huge American base close to us  or we were close to Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 148 them.
And the same guy came here after the war to see us in Richmond.
They felt the war is over and they don't have to work any more and there is no reason why  everybody's free and why they shouldn't be free.
And this was...for this I was really commended later on after the war when the command was in order to get a very high medal for this  but I didn't wait to get the medal.
And I was with the War Production Board into its demise early in 1947; and that was a great experience.
Finally  the War Department sent a coded telegram to Wise in New York  from Silverman -- and it is only when this arrived in New York  was fully informed.
I became a crack shot  and that and then  whenever we finished  when we had the Germans down and and they gave up altogether  and the war was over in Europe   why then I volunteered to be a sniper.
Fritz Sauckel  who was the procurement officer for bri nging in slave labor to work in Albert Speers factories and mines and munitions industries and to build up the war machine and maintain it during the war.
When I look at you and I try to think in the standards of war time.
And that's what was called in English the phony war  phony  funny  and in French if anybody speaks French  [Speaking French]   the funny war.
How was it -- that was the first time you had -- were caring then  for -- For actual casualties that were coming in from the war front  yes.
And I had got a job just before the war with a place on Fleet Street.
This was originally a prisoner of war camp  and they had some permanent buildings which were hospital buildings  and they moved first the camp and then they moved the hospital.
And of course the Red Cross made all sorts of inquiries so you know nobody turned up after the war  so one knew that they had gone.
I mean  if you ask him a question about the war  he gets ve ry upset  doesnt talk about it.
Nobody knows whats tomorrow and we have to make the best of every day and of course the hope Israel will be strong and safe and the same for the United States cause I love the United States and you know to raise their children in a  in a more Jewish way and to know what war can do to them.
I did a few times risk my life by trying to find out how far the war was.
We didnt know about it  we found that out after the war  of course  about the boat.
Did you have any dreams before the war of what you were going to be?
Can I ask you a few questions about back during the war now?
But I mean in -- dur -- during the war  like  ho-ho-how would you even hear that you were supposed to do something?
Yes  of course  and as as I as I grew older  I can remember  well  when the war started  1939  and my parents [indecipherable] of course  at that time  and their concerns with the people that they had left in Europe   their family.
And that we would have our new names  we would live with these people  and that the story that they made up was - it's still a peculiar story that we had  we were Dutch but we had lived in a small town called Emden  which is near...it's a German town near the Dutch border  northwestern Germany  and that when the war br oke out we decided we wanted to be in Holland - we didn't want to be  so we basically were refugees from Germany and my grandfather who's who's German  that he was Swiss - uh and uh and because we were refugees we couldn't live with our parents because my parents  our parents were looking for jobs someplace else.
So there was the \ Funny War\  in France  because France was at war with Germany but there was no fighting.
But thats what I knew  and I didnt have any idea after the war what Jewish was  but of course  after the war  it didnt matter because nobody followed any religion after the war.
On the very top were Americans prisoners of war  on the very top.
My question: did life change even more when there was an actual war?
So its  again  the people who had we were sorting out who was a real security risk  who was on the war crimes wanted list that was put down put out by all the countries  sorting things out  and these were primarily the guys  the Ritchie boys.
She was a plain ordinary housewife taking care of her children and times were not good  economic times were pretty bad before the war and she did not get involved in politics.
But the ultimate reason was that by 1944  a year before the war actually ended  the Hungarians realized that they were on the losing side of this war and they wanted to get out.
Yeah  then there was -- you were still able  before the war  yeah.
Well  basically at that point in time  it wa s too late because here we are at the end of the war now.
There's not too many educated people  not too many intelligent who understand it's a war a nd we're all going to suffer.
I we nt to see him after the war in Switzerland so somehow I knew or found out where he was.
But you know  I coul dnt hold it until after the war  so at one point my pride went out of the window  and I had to go on the tippultum  and thats what it was called.
They were like big numbers  the Spanish people from the Civil War.
You know what Bund is  its socialism  that time it was very high  and the war started.
>> Edna Friedberg: Before the war were your parents  grandparents  religious?
Before we turn to your life during the Holocaust and during the war years   let's start  first  with you telling us what you can about your family  your parents and you in that time before war began in 1939.
No  it was mostly after the war  because during the war he actually was the mayor of this town in southern France  the middle of France  and he printed  you know  identification paper -- i-identity papers and so on  and -- and saved  actually saved them.
And I do that after the war in Germany  for people who are escaping from Poland  who could not get admitted to the displaced person camp.
As I told you before  we didn't even have an inkling before World War II.
Well  they prepared for 6 years to make war to slaughter pe ople.
And she kept ri -- writing us letters and send us 10 poun -- 10 dollars and said -- Now this was before the war  or -- No  after the war. --
They were not  in Holland they were not as as obvious I mean you know that  during the war during the war itself because they they felt the Dutch were also Aryans so the Dutch except for the Jews were just fine and they really believed that the Dutch would eventually cooperate with them.
Yes  I -- when I first came to Greenville  Max invited me to come for New Years Eve  1941  right after the war broke out.
So  the 13 life in -- in Italy was a happy one  until really the war started -- the -- 38 was the beginning of difficulties.
And it and it was not there were not too ma ny people during the war  of course  the number of students at the yeshiva increased and after the war it went down.
I'll keep on fighting it as much as I can  and for a young person it's a horrible feeling to have like a death sentence  not knowing what's going to be and especially we did not have no inkling that how how the war was going.
After the war was over  it was a matter now of how to get out of where you were.
We considered Germans as a big threat to us and that's from my young age  because Germans did want to take back the territories which they lo st to Poland after the war and they were always considered the greatest threat to us.
But then  the war with Arab nations took place  so I came to Israel just shortly after the cease fire with the Arab nations was signed.
Well  let me mention something like  when the war ca me  the food became pretty scarce.
They had had not dental care all through the years of the war and their teeth needed immediate uh inspection and treatment.
After the war  especially later when I was a tailor then I tried to find the doc uments so I wrote to Red Cross  everywhere.
You described for me the time for you and your family in Czechoslovakia before World War II  before the Holocaust  as a time of hard work but also a good life  one in which there was a sense of safety  as you put it.
Women were not really  there were a lot of men that ca me back from the war and applied.

There -- there was a witness that we met  after the war  told us that he was -- he didnt -- he -- he didnt actually see it  but he was in the same town  hiding  and he -- he was told that the child had just walked away  or what ever.
So it was kind of unnecessary and so the war went on.
My cousin was about three years older than I am and he went to the University ju st before the war and was beat up by the university students who were very  very anti-Semitic.
Now this is the dog you had when you... In Hannover  in Germany afte r the war.
And the crematorium there was Ive been there a few times after the war  after I been out of there  and they still have the hooks on the wall where they used to hang the prisoners  and they would cut them  their legs and bodies  and bleed let the blood drain out of them into the drain  because then they would burn them in the crematorium upstairs  and they had these little trollies that theyd lay them on and wheel them up there  and then wheel them into these chambers up Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 42there  had about  I dont know  eight or 10 of these cremation chambers up there  wheel them in there and cremate them.

But they never got to the prisoner of war camp and we were back in 20 minutes.
And a group of scholars operating privately and independently in New York   got together and set up a committee for the study of war documents.
During the 1930s and the early 1940s th ere were a lot of political changes in Europe and then there was the war.
And I said to myself  if this is going to be the war  that he has a rifle to put the Germans  this not a good thing.
So  later  many people in Vienna had known his career during the war  so we finally  we never became involved why Wiesenthal never gave the documents  he had known certainly at the time  it was that he did not have the documents or wanted to protect Waldheim I cannot be sure  but when Waldheim was running for President in Austria and the Jewish Congress started to do research in the archives in Washington and it was revealed that he was a newsman and knew what had happened to the partisans who gave information  so it was like in the Kiesinger case  that it was that the ????
What had happened upstairs was that these people  who had lived there all the time  since 19 -- I dont know what -- just after the war  I guess.
So there was a lot of people that died after the war  on account of the liberation and eating things that th-their stomach was not equipped to handle.

In the war there was a pr ocess of them s -- at the end of the war.
RJ] Well  the Germans didnt bother us but the British had a bit of a err a centre  like a medical centre  they took all of our clothes and of course by then there was a blue diamond on the back of your coat an d your trousers to say that you was a prisoner of war.
He was a small slight man  older than the rest of us  he was in our mid to late 30's  a nd we didn't see him until the war was over  and heard that he had lost tw o fingers and part of the palm of his hand.
I dont know  but anyhow it was still in the old house and I dont remember exactly when we move d. I know that we moved right before the war.
Before the war she would have never  never  never considered him as her mate.

I sat down  listened to it and it took me maybe ten minutes before I went down to the office to tell him that the war was over.
But before the war  yo u had a pretty nice life?
It was always this aspect that -- and -- and although this got formalized rea lly  after the war in France  with existentialism  and when it was finally given a kind of official thing  that namely life is nothing but a -- a set of choi ces  and even not doing something is itself a choice.
Before we move to that period  once it really hit home to you in 1944  tell us what life was like once the war began in Europe for you and your family living in Budapest.
I just pr esumed that when the war was 31 over  Id find them somewhere.
The -- Couple of months before that  we suffered immensely under real war conditions.
Now  it should -- I have to emphasize that I was permitted to stay in school and not change to a Jewish school  because my father was a front line war veteran.
But our area was clear  but it doesnt mean the war stopped  we still experienced air -- air raids  for example  constantly the Germans would come over and bomb  and I remember those.
18 During first of all the war  my -- independentl y  my father and my mothers family went to Vienna to leave the city because it was dangerous to stay in the c ity  and Vienna was in Austria  so -- so they were used to the notion that -- I see. --
After the war my uncle  Michael Fass  who went in our place when we couldnt go in 1935 to Oakland to emigrate  then my great-uncle sponsored my -- her brother  my mothers brother  my Uncle Fass  and they  the whole family emigrated  went to Oakland in our place.
It looks like the war is already coming to an end.
She had two children  my mother and Uncle Ludz and Ludz was the younger of the two and he was smuggled out of Germany by his non-Jewish gi rlfriend and made it to the States in 39  the war had already started  and made it to Chicago  and signed up almost immediately for the army.
We said we could survive a war like that and we saw small children being killed or heard about it  there is no God.
Even about that  war came  we didnt hear nothing that somethings going happen.
SL: No  but he beca -- He became a -- He became a coward after the war.
This kid told me that before the war  he and his mother and sister and  I think  and father  lived in Warsaw [or] in Lodz; either of the two.
So -- so -- Where were you at the end of the war?
They couldn't get to Paris in four years in World War I  just to give you some idea.
She is in that book too  ﬁFighting Auschwitz.ﬂ One of that woman was arrested after the war by the Po lish Communists  and sent enced to death because of her anti-government feeling.
I was at that time  when the war broke out  I was just under 17.
Throughout the war Alex and his sister were able to attend school and summer camp and lived a relatively normal live in Villefranche until September 1943 when the German crackdown on Jews there intensified.
And the tragedy of my fathers life was that they were killed  very close to the end of the war.
And what happened  this man named Marcel Coulier  was a young man during the war and he was hiding from  he didn't want  all young Fre nchmen have to do forced labor in Germany and those who didn't want to do that went underground.
But her son  Muttel  who was my fathers friend in Europe and had su rvived the war also  and was my fathers friend in Germany  he lived with his mother  Mrs. Fe ldman.
With our camp  was  after the uprising it was in  in October 1943  that was still in the war  so when that happened  and this  and they liquidated all of the Jews  so they just  they just  uh  erased the whole thing.
Because one war brings upon another war   like it wa s in  in Germany.
And on -- on the next station that we stopped at  they said that probably the war would end.
They didnt look back to World War II and what happened then.
We spoke about the war  we spoke about what happened  how we did live.
Because he was in camp from the beginning of the war to the end of the war.
He visited his brother in 1938  and the -- the war started and he couldnt come back.
We go to Israel  or we going to American because this was already occupied  the was war is over  and Poland is occupied.
They knew war would eventually come and as a matter of fact it came uh three weeks later was uh September 1st 1939 when the Germans uh annexed the Polish corridor in which is not quite to Dansk .
And I found a report of Antony Eden on his conversation with Karski in the docum ents of the British war cabinet.
I am not a pacifist  you know  the paci fists they dont like the war  but the war is -- sometime you have to -- you have to defend yourself  yo u have to defend USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 62yourself.
But that night we went to sleep and my father cut his finger while he was he was a lumberjack during the war  in th in the forest  thats what he said.
And I was then taken through the ch ateau  as I had been as a child  we used to play there all the time after the war.
And this was already close towards the end of the war.
And it was -- the -- the war -- when -- is -- was over in March 23  and I thought  I wonder if he come -- come here  or the -- it -- if he survived  and things  you know  and I ke ep thinking about it  you know  if he made it  you know  over there in concentration camp.
And they run to Russia during the war  but the mother died in Russia and my Uncle Yukel died in Poland coming back from Russia.
And they were  but  as far as such people as Eden is concerned or member s of the cabinet  they were very well informed because after  discovered it after the war  that for instance  a very high level Nazi official  whose name is known  was passing to a Polish intelligence officer in Berne  in Switzerland  information about the plans of final solution well before it was they started to implement it.
Jackson relied on him a great deal in terms of aggressive war counts  to go over the materials that had been found  to stimulate the attorneys to find more materials  and then to make the final briefs and then for Alderman to make almost all those presentations with several exceptions.
They survived the war because of me from the Lodz ghetto.
So Did you go back to Palestine or you stayed in Italy  when the war was over?
But my parents thought that after a while  uh  and that was their memory of the first world war  that uh life will become a little more normal.
Did your children ask much about war  about what was going on?
I  myself  before th e war  my looks are not  t ypical sort of Jewish.
I never know what happened  if he vanished  if he survived the war or not.
So the first step  my firs t step was to convince him that he had lost th e war.
I read something about Civil War last night  I guess its still on my mind.
Well  first off  as I said  when I came to London  I was living with a wonderful family  with the Jacobs  who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs  hed been an officer in a Jewish brigade in World War One  and of course  knowing a lot about Zionist history  all this makes a little sense to me.
So  my dad had s put money away during the war so he could get to it.
Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 28 What other things did you tell people here about the war  besides the the rounding up of the people?
They had one in Toulouse  so we didn't see them 'til afte r the war.
A German plane could seen here we're having a good time laying in the sun  and here we got to still fight a war.
You said in the first interview  that your knowledge of the war until then was very personal  because obviously you were sort of in the eye of the storm.
Were you at home when you heard about the end of the war  or were you at school?
There was a prisoner of war camp not far from Soly and obviously the Jews were all eventually  they say eliminated and Soly was sent off to Pona ri near Vilna and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated  but none of them surviv ed.
They were a very small part of the labor force except in munitions factories and things like that  but in Europe women hadnt been part of the labor force before the war  and were talking of people who hadnt worked since the war.
Some non -Jewish young people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans.
Everybody started pushing forward with their papers in hand and the Germans  the...additional German officials came out and was shooting in the air and beating and pushing people back  and it it happened that the man in charge of that office was a a man of German origin who lived in our town before the war and was a teacher  a high school teacher  my brother's high school teacher.
The other thing what Smuda  as I said  sin ce he was such an excellent welder  he had developed a technique since he didn't want to  to uh help the Germans to win the war  to uh  develop a certain technique of um  um  um sabotage.
We have  of course  now down at the Balkan  but we have not have this war between England  France and Germany.
The first time I was in jail for 3 weeks  by the way I was together with somebody H. Brownstein who had been expelled from the United States  had been married after the war to an American soldier  left for the US  was living in Brooklyn and she was aware of a guard of the Maidenek Camp and was in the samw prison (Osendorf)  she was an elderly woman looking very friendly  she was knitting for a service in the prison  you would never thought of her as a guard in Maidene k  she was sentenced for life in a trial in Germany to push another case  but in order to attract public opinion  the fact she was in jail at the same time I was in jail.
In the Soviet Union  schools were opened a week after the war ended  with textbooks and everything already printed.
I never saw her after the war  but I know she survived.
I started at I was 15 and I ended when I was 17  when the war came  I was almost 17 when the war came.
When -- wh en you discovered after the war  the extent of the brutality and the murder in Europe  was th at -- that must have been shocking to you.
But in the war  no  she was in Ecuador  she wa sn't in Belgium.
Yeah  after the war  it was -- Wroclaw was a very beautiful German city.
I'd be the last one to sit in a group -- and they'd be talking about different things -- to say anything about the war.
Te ll me about when the war first started and how life changed and what people thought was happening.
When the war broke out  when they start to bomb  we were in the basement.
We liberated because was a human be -- you know  always organiz -- and now  after the -- 60 years after the war  you see different viewpoints in many people there.
And Colonel Karnavolov was the guy who signed it and it was a special Krokov  some kind of Karnavolov punt  th is is where they used to collect all the war prisoners  look in the records  check if they were traitors or not  anything like this.
There was worki ng prisoners of war in that factory doing dirty jobs.
Moise Weiner: Yeah  the first bombing was on the 24 th of June  on the second day of the war; on the third day of the war.
But you know  that brought the war back very  very clearly.
Any other fearful times that you had during the war that you recall?
And for you that -- you think that comes from th e war  not from before?
Oh no  I knew that soon after the war  like everybody knew  everybody searched for [indecipherable]  I had -- but there was no need for me personally to be in Germany to find that out.
Was it something from before the war that you thi nk was just in your nature or is this something that... ?
Was a very sensible gi rl and -- and she realized the war was lost  and she said  I would fully understand if we were treated the way we have treated the Jews.
Before you tell us about your journey out of Europe and to the United States for safety  please tell us first a bit about your family  your community  and yourself in the years before the war began.
A few days before the war they already had black outs in Poland  because at that time  I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement.
From Holland after the war  she had wrote that to her sisters  describing what had happened to some extent during the war and the deprivations and how that was her ambition.
I think that this is what my mother taught me by doing what she did during the war  by Interview with Halina Peabody June 3  2002 42putting herself out and letting anything happe n just as long as she could save her kids  transferred it to me.
Their trying to go home was the same way was by the Germans  the Pollacks -- the Pollacks kill people right after the war.
It's difficult when you're forty to change jobs and in a bad situation as it was in Italy at the time  the War of the Mosques and so fort h. It's hard to adapt and I once again went to start afresh and to find work.
She said  you know she reme mbered the Germans from the first world war  so she said  in Yiddish of course.
He expressed his  I guess hi s views to the higher ups  and he wasnt the only one  because he said  this is a kind of war that we cannot win  because we are trained to conduct a -- a re -- what do you call it  a -- a regular war  and these people are not terrorists  but they are guerillas and they were fighting the war in Vietnam from the underground.
Also...while I'm talking I'm reminding myself...when the bombs start to come in  we went into a neighborhood not far from that farm where we used to live before the war.
A non-Jewish wife of a brother of my grandfathers who survived the war in Berlin  and we -- since Amos went to gi -- talk there  I wanted to see her because she really was a favorite of the family.
I should have been able to march with the others and  anyway  this is after war stuff.
So if the Russians said no  we are not in war just to protect the Jewish people  we veto that.
So anyway  um  that is our  till the Russian came  and they freed us  and then he brought us to Helm  which was in Niederstow  and we thought that the only survivors in from the war  but there came there more survivors from different places  and we  Esthe r Raab we met there  you know Esther Raab  and uh  and some other people  and then we moved up to  to Lublin  and uh  because Lid  uh Selma was Dutch  so there was already  there was a lot of Dutch prisoners of war happened to be  they wanted to send them back  and all the Dutch people.
He was recognized and the prisoners beat the devil out of him  and there was a Jeep w ith an American war correspondent.
But Grandfather died before the war  and I think he was fortunate enough  the only one to die a natural death from the immediate family.
Therefore my Grandmother in 1920 or ‚21 -- my mother always told the stories at -- during World War I  there were no political discussion in her house because my grandmother  not withstanding the fact that her future son-in-law was a German soldier and her husband was a German -- was always a French patriot.
One day -- one evening  I turned around to him -- I was very clos e to him before the war.
>> Bill Benson: As you told us earlier in December of 1944  for you  the war was effectively over when you made it to Switzerland to a neutral country.
Really for two years  cause I was still living there after the war  so -- 92 Right  right.
The only thing  af ter the war  we my father had a sister who married a doctor  and he su rvived.
And you want one more  the one you have at the end of the war.
And then I was sent to Intelligence Training Schools and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of war.
So now the war is ending  a nd then what -- what happened?
It was a sort of a continuation of the free Polish radio which did exist before the war.
You know after the war we came and when we–were t elling the story they told some reactions were from people  Oh  they feel like they are in a movie  watching a movie.
I sa -- I said to him  ﬁCome a -- Take it easy Sol  dont give him advice like that.ﬂ SL: To make war.
What had become of most of your Jewish friends from before the war?
All during the war the Germans went from west to east  conquering Poland  Hungary  Russia.
People -- because there was no food  very little food  and it was during war  so people would put their kids in a convent  like an orphanage  and hope they would pick them up when things got easier for them.
There was a very sad and those terms are 65 all from this world  and I am referring to the other world  after the war long after the war  the past four years  my husband Hank and I traveled to the eastern European countries and I did go to Wilno and I did go to Pornaty and I did go to and I did go to and all those famous places  and what I saw was a quiet peaceful world with all those lives disappearing to the ground and burned and out of memory and nothing  just nothing.
And when uh...well  when the [First] World War wa s over  he came back to Bacu  his native city.
Which probably  or was that a difficult job after the war given the  the economy of the country?
Lets first start in terms of religion  cause you had mentioned during -- during the war that you had made that promise to continue -- you made a promise to God to continue with religion  I wonder if youd talk about that  aand how that didnt work out.
That's the best answer I can give when it comes to the religious during the war and especially after the war.
But that has nothing to do with the war  I probably would have found it very confin ing if I had you know  if I had gotten from the kind of background I was from  into this kind of milieu  I may have found it very confining anyway.
>> Jacques Fein: The main thing  again  during that time  the end of the war I was almost 7 years old  I had zero control of my life.
My mother was a farmer's daughter  they had land  and he married her and I'm all my life I was till 26 years  the war start I was with my mother's family.
The little place Ozerkoff where I was born and I lived until the war came and until we were transported to the Lodz Ghetto.
And you have to cover the full time for during the war.
Uh there were twelve brothers and sisters of which only one survived the war  they having escaped in 1933 to uh what was then Palestine  and from my father's side uh wher e there were eight brother and and sisters  uh none of them survived.
He ended up after the war in Ea st Germany and had a whole history of his own on whats happened in East Germany to him.
After the war  I remember now I kept in touch with a woman who worked together with my mother in the last camp  and she told me what happened to my mother.
>> Sam Ponczak: Well  the war started by aerial bombarding of Warsaw.
I thi nk the  this decision to bring war criminals before the international tribunal was done more or less at that time.
I know how people who never lived through the war have no idea what's important and how they don't handle the real emergencies well and I must say I feel very proud of myself how well I handle emergencies.
Well I followed the war very care fully  of the campaigns in North Africa and all the different campaigns and was watching it very carefully.
Because during the war  and li stening to what was happening to France  and -- and Poland  and things like this  there wa s definitely a feeling that we -- we began to get bombarded by the Germans.
And the war began at the first Sept ember with bombing.
Well  did you find did the end of the war were you still in Palestine?
The Nazis  incidentally  had instituted a special labor offi ce for Jews shortly afte r the outbreak of the war  whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them  give Jews jobs mainly in the defense industry or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant work  like for example  the city garbage de partment  garbage pickup and similar things  and also they ride the railroads  certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the railroads on tracks and so on.
I was supposed be dead so many times in the war  I came out of it.
Cause she left at the end of the war  to go to Sweden .
However  the coup was suppressed by an SS division  and so came to a quick end  the only open insubordination of the German military in the Second World War.
But  was the same in in in in a prisoner of war camp later.
So  we met only after the war with those people again.
During the war  the kinds of things we did in Britain  you never thought of yourself as being anything special.
Were any other -- did you stay in touc h with any other members of the underground that you associated with during the war?
Is there anything specific from the war of independence youd like to include?
But I remember one instance   I think it was the the war the Six Day War in 1967  I think.
He also had like myself had the affinity for languages  uh nat...nat...natural ability I should say  and he  before the war  before the 1st World War  he used to teach uh the Polish children of Polish nobility who lived in the Ukraine  were the the owners of the large estates  the Poles  and he used to teach their children Polish.
Okay  had your brother completed school   had he finished the public school before the war started  or before 1939 when the Hungarians came in?
>> Bill Benson: Marty  you would continue there until almost the end of the war when I think then you were sent to yet another camp  Gunskirchen.
We  we sabotaged uh plans where they were working  I mean they taken  the  they had supposedly when they were   when they were picking up people  they were sending them to Germany to  to work in the factories  and in the plants that the Germans had to had to leave in or der to go to war  so our people who were deported were supposed to be deported to factories and to slave labor  not to be killed  it was absolutely no knowledge that there was such a thing as being killed.
And I just simply did not have any fear at all because I felt that what I went through during the years of war and concentration camp  and especially prison  and after escaping  then I had nothing to be afraid of.
Well  there are a lot of people who have told me  that after the war was over  they just didnt talk about what they had gone through.
End of Tape #2 54 Tape #3 Miles  wer -- were gonna -- were gonna go to the war  June 1941 in a moment  but I wanted to just go back to your name for a moment  because I realized that this -- and theres some noise -- at the start of the interview  I didnt ask you the name with which you were born  which was Shmoil.
Maybe they could do something  but they couldnt stop the war.
And I was hoping to come to America  and -- but what was very nice is that when the war ended  you know  Anders said  since Poland has lo st so many members of its intellectuals  professionals  that he wanted the young military to be educated  and we were offered an opportunity to attend Italian universities.
These are cousins that escaped in Larisa and they joined the partisans and this is where they spent the war years.
And actually it's different from the photographs you see of him be fore the end of the war because he looks very relaxed  often when he's with Hitl er  if he's walking around showing some piece of architecture.
We're going to be talking with you  Roger  thank you -- about World War II -- your experiences there -- what you saw  and much much more -- what comes from that.
I don't know -- at that point -- during the war  every Jewish girl became -- had Sara h for a middle name and every Jewish boy had -- was it Abraham?
They had a child before the war which is the child I said she gave to my mother and she died about 12 years ago.
You have already done a video interview with the museum in Washington about your early experiences and your experiences during the war  and really the purpose of this interview  is sort of to pick up that story from where you left off and take it up to the present.
When the war was over she worked as a social worker with one of the Jewish agencies in Paris.
Hav-Have you -- did you ever talk to him after the -- after the war?
A lot of them ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war.
When war came  he felt that he had a price on his head  and especially being Jewish  and he read the \ Mein Kampf  \  the book by Hitler.
But apparently  my father survived up to that point because he was a soldier in the 26 war.
The school started within a month or two because I remember even before the war was officially declared over on May 9  1945  our gymnasium was already functioning and we were going back and enrolling in classes and...and...uh...around that time  April or...or May  us youngsters who only lived this heroic  teenage involvement in..in...in patriotism and fight against the Nazis started resurrecting our pre-War...uh..boy scout units in...in gymnasium and I was one of the...uh...leaders of the...the troop I guess you would call it in English that was organized  being re...reorganized in gymnasium.
They were used to adventures during the war  and then life was so quiet and calm and so that is why when I came to Chile I was also a little bit restless.
indecipherable] So you spent the rest of the war years doing this same work with this family?
>> Bill Benson: After you were liberated -- I want to make sure I get the question righ t. After you were liberated how did the non -Jewish people who persecuted you  how did they treat you after the war?
To go there  if we wou at the beginning were getting some letters or packages from Lvov  because the rush the Germany did not start yet the war.
So when the family first left Wanska  it -- it -- it wasnt so much that the family -- that your father felt that you and your mother would be in da nger  it was just because of the war  per se -- Yes. --
Then I remember very well  when the war with Poland started  how Polish refugees came to Vilnius -- to Kaunas and I know that my parents helped them.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: Can you tell us about what you remember about war breaking out in your hometown?
We were sent to east -- to the eastern part of Germany  fairly close to the Polish border  to help harvest potatoes  sugar beets  red beets -- because of other people were drafted right away when the war broke out.
And then  after the war  I didnt got you know  after the war I didnt I I didnt got in there.
Between the end of the war and 58  do you know what you were doing before you went over?
It was a learning lesson in politics  for when -- I made up my mind that I would ha ve never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I would have to do something with protecting huma n right  and freedom of expression.
>> Bill Benson: Of course the war ended in Europe in May 1945.
This is me and I was -- its about seven y ear old  just after the war in Dnepropetrovsk.
Your father in America  did he get worried about a possible war?
And he kne w a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a number of non-Jews from before the war.
I flew the Yom Kippur War  and we flew -- this is when our own country was told by our allies if we had trouble -- we Interview with Paul Halpern 66 flew out of the Azores  nonstop with a double crew carrying equipment to Tel Aviv  to Lod.
You know  when he knew I am living in an imagin ary world  which is not the world of [indecipherable] during the war.
I became -- my husband beca me a lieutenant I don't know  and my girlfriend some kind of ranking German official  and we deci ded to go as prisoners of war to the American Army.
Precocious 22 maturity  I talked to her about how we're going to be separated by a border and this is war time and one never knows what's going to happen and so on.
He was brought over here by relatives from Pittsburgh  but -- and he was born in Germany  but he came here before the war actually started.
If we help them win the war  th eyre going to exterminate all the Jews.
It was then it had become Czechoslovakia during World War One  but he had fa mily and he was deeply concerned  as were most of the people we knew  deeply concerned about Hitl er.
5 Do you have any sort of fond  clear memories of life at -- at home  or in the city  in Koretz before the war started?
And this is already 1945  so this is just just before the end of the war  and we were in lager lager one  lager two.
Edna Friedberg: What happened to your parents for the duration of the war?
So by the time this whole war had started and my brother was already there  1942 came  and everyb ody was getting arrested and deported in Ludbreg.
I also remember that when you that Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 130I felt that when you only surv ive when your goal is to survive  you have more of a direction than after the war  when you when its no long er just to survive  but where to go  how to survive  what to do with your life.
The concept was also  if there is a war  men would be involved ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 and women and children would be left alone.
And they were all bombed  and there were about 8 000 people who were killed in during those last few  few hours of  of the war  because that was May three.
It was a scheme from the Germans  it was called Hotel Polski that was was an old fanc y hotel in Warsaw  and what the Germans did  they spread rumors that they're going to send people to Switzerland and that these Jews were going to be exchanged for German prisoners of war with Russia  and they were looking for Jews to come to this hotel an d they will transport these Jews to Switzerland.
So he was very religious  and that we had all the time kosher househ old  even during the war wh en it was very hard  and he wasnt more alive any more  but my family  my parents were used to keep the kosher household  si we were holding til the last moment.
Because of my experience politically and because of what I saw in Czechoslovakia and feeling that it was all so inevitable that the politicians could have done other things  I started the war as a consciousness objector and I was in the Red Cross on the continent to start with.
My grandmother from my father's side died once the war began  and it was not war -related.
My parents arrived by the first commercial crossing after the war had ended.
the sa -- the Soviet -- After -- -- the German Soviet war.
Now was it that because he was known to beco me -- been an anti-co mmunist all his life and by 1947 the Cold War had broken out?
02:47:09 She used to -- this was my second world war  another war I had with her.
One of the terrible things [for] which I will never forgive myself -- was the last days before the war broke out  there was a Zionist Congress in Geneva.
A. The Cratons most of all  they come to the Yugoslavians after World War I. They betrayed Austria  they betrayed Yugoslavia too.
I -- we had a one -- yeah  brother-in-law who survived the war.
So like after the war  whatever I wanted  it came to me  it fell into my lap  very easy.
Never  never after the war  I never went to a church  a a Catholic church I dont even know from inside  I never because we were Protestant where we lived  yeah.
What about your sense of--once yo u were reunited and af ter the war  was there any more sense of Jewishness in the family?
And then every few years we went back  because -- I especially went back to the ci -- be side the cemetery  I have this friend over there in Budapest  they moved to Budapest with a big family and they always waited for us  you know  with so much love  and -- and just like the war time  I remember she was always so nice to me.
They were in the war for so many years that anywhere they found a girl  you know  they raped her and threw or if she fight them back  they threw her down from the train.
Whereas my fathers parents  who had died by the time my mother married  ow -- h-he was -- came from Pressbourg  one of those places that was Hungarian in language  but became Czech by the time the first World War was over.
Tw o weeks before my Bar Mitzvah  the war USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 138 started  in 1940  and I was not Bar Mitzvahe d  so -- but I knew how to read Hebrew  and I knew the prayers  but I didnt understand it.
I was schooled in Polish and Yiddish and acquired a reasonable knowledge of German during the war.
He brought a form from Internal Revenue Servic e. Did any -- did your parents or any of your relatives spend time in a war zone?
My father has said if it weren't for my mother and her courage we would never have survived the war  because she again and again and again  she would be the one who who said to my father  you know  it's going to work out and she would she would take on the police who came to the house and questioned them and interrogated them  cause see from their perspective they were interrogated many times about who they were and what they were doing.
And happily the South African Jewish War Appeal reported that the campaign was very successful.
>> Bill Benson: You described to me that that time after Ljudevit came back and it's the three of you  until the end of the war in May 1945  that that was a period of just constant fighting between Ustasa and the Partisans .
What was your feeling when you heard the war was over?
Not only those special  but in general  I had  after the war when I was working with the American War Crimes  I had occasions to take revenge on the SS  on the Germans (background noise)  but uh  when I intended to hurt somebody  all of the sudden  my arm refused even to ------  and in this moment  came into my mind   \ My God  why should I hit him?
When the war ended for Belgium -- the war was still going on elsewhere in Europe -- your Aunt Theresa was abl e to find you and she brought you to her home.
>> Bill Benson : The question is  how prevalent was anti -Semitism in France prior to the war?
During the time that things had already gotten really bad for the Jews and where you thought the war might pass you by and yet it di dn't  during that time  did you witness any beatings or executions of Jews at the hands of either the (?
And they -- my father had this lett er  which he was hiding in his af -- artificial leg  where he were -- his deeds were acknowledged by the organization of the League of German War Widows  Orphans and sa -- Injured People from World War One.
ŠŠ that we hadn't talked about your experiences during the war?
That it was 1941 41 when the Russian  when the Russians went to war with Germany so -- Then he had to be in the ghetto as well.
It was the first time  actually  when I -- and later on when we already left the -- during the war  went to Pinsk  and Russians came to Pinsk  that was a first -- you know  this region of Poland was occupied by Russian.
But thats what I tell – Whats also in the war we had a lot of Germans came to our hotel  German Jews  and stayed in the hotel overnight and when smuggled someplace else; in the beginning  yeah.
I didn't tell the people what I saw; but I mentioned that later on  after the war  to the Polish alderman in Chicago  Mr. Roman [Pochinsky ] .
Well  right after the war I remember seei ng a list of survivors which was published by the American Red Cross  and my fathers name appear ed there as being killed in Dachau  and it also appeared that my brother survived.
He was caught at the end of the war and he perished himself  not being a Jew  but being treated as a Jew because he helped the Jews.
Do you remember the media coverage of the war during the war  or in the immediate post-war period?
At the end of the day  they took those people away from us  and we didn't know where they took them till after the war.
I really think that for the first time in history  theres not being a war in 50 years between central European states.
So -- And my father and my brothers  they survived the war and ja -- the only one that was killed is -- was my mother  because my father used to watch over us.
And the other one was uh...was a doctor; and after the war was over  he divorced his wife in Vienna  he came over here.
And I was sent away a lot  even after the war  I was.
Soon after the war  when Jews were coming back to Poland  and my father and brother went to see our house  and they knocked on the door  and so me Polish people were living there  and they slammed the door in his face  saying  you were supposed to be dead.
You didnt notice much of the war in your -- in The Hague   but were -- again  were you aware  or were you interested as a youngster of what was happening in other countries?
It would be some months later  however  the war came to Romania  when the Soviets occupied your hometown of Vascauti.
After th e war I became engaged to a man -- to a young man from Edinburgh  one who -- because we knew all of the families in Edinburgh   I had grown up with  I had seen him at the Jewish holidays and at the synagogue and I had been very friendly w ith -- with his sister  who went to the same school I did  and he went he joined the -- the British army during the war  he was a captain in the Royal Engineers and was stationed out in India.
Oh yes  before the war we had a radio  because Mama  as I said  my mother was running that little cafeteria for the radio producer.
And we were made to be seated  hands over our head and the war  I cannot exactly tell you the amount  but there were a few thousand of us.
And there we cleaned the street and  and -- till the one day came that all the Jewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to Pole.
And I attended 50 -- Latv ian 56 school that before the war was a Jewish school where my fathers first cousin Shaina  she was a teacher there.
I have all those things but uh there is not too much interest in there because he wrote only about what he would wish for the country  Holland  he felt very close to Holland  and um  the whole world and the hu  hu  hu the human  the humans  what they would do when the war was  the war when the war would be over  and he was sure already for years that uh Germany would lose  and even when it looked on certain times that it was impo- impossible because uh they were um practically in all of Germany  in all of Europe  every country bes  besides two or three  were not under the Germans  but he said the Germans will lose  and from this view out  he had articles about uh economics  about religions  about anything you can think of  philosophy  former philosophy  and help was that th e people who were helping us to get to the place  that every two weeks  one came  and here the whole list of books he wanted for his writing  and they all came  every two weeks when we also got our food um slips  how much the food was for any person in Holland  how much they coul d have  and all the people who were underground were supported and were helped with those coupons  because every month the uh  the places where they were uh  where the people could pick it up themselves  they go in and they took out what they needed  and it was every month another place  and th ey never found who did this for more than two years--was really remarkable  and the woman who had us there  she  she needed  otherwise she couldn't have fed us at all because everything whic h was edible  everything needed a piece of paper and a coupon.
What happened was the radio w as broadcasting all the names of the French prisoner s of war who were liberated and coming home.
Had did you ever think  after the war was over and you decided to leave  that you would go to Israel instead of th e United States ?

It -- because  to them  they always compared it to the war  and it was so trivial to the war that how could you even be bothered  you know  by acne  or how could you be bothered with the fact that youre heavy  until later on  finally I went on a diet  because I wanted to.
And when I lived in Czechoslovakia for a short time after the war  there was no o-organized synagogue or anything that I recall a-at the time  and the government or the -- basically the whole population in general in Czechoslovakia was not exactly a religious type of country like in some countries.
He said well  we were attacked by the Fascists and this is war.
They said to me you are going to c hurch so you must wear a cross and I did not take that cross off until six months after the war.
The reason we wanted to come to the United States was because my mother's sister was here and she's the only one that was able to get away before  just before the war broke ou t. And so I remembered he r address and wrote to her that a few of us survived and that we would like to co me to the United States and could they make the arrangem ents?
At the time of liberation  af ter the war then  was there any effort on your behalf or on someone else's behalf for you to leave that village or that family and identify yourself as a Jew again  different ?
And so we lived in tremendous f ear  especially after the Americans got into war in December '41 and then by July '42  then really we felt  we knew about camps and I think the rumor had started that Jews are going to be shipped to sort of work camps and some of them may have been extermina tion camps.

Jill  you told me that Kristallnacht  or the Night of Broken Glass  was the catalyst for the decisions and directions that your family's life took for the balance of the Holocaust and the war.

And my mother heard that there is going to be a World War Three  and so she became panicky and she said  ﬁWe must leave Europe immediately.ﬂ So  she had a sister in Cuba.
I went and I looked out the window because I wanted to see what is a war.
She survived the war and the boy went to pales -- to Israel  and she went with him to Israel.
But  you know  Ive seen photograp hs  Ive read about it  I knew about the camps already  you know  right after the e nd of war.
And how did you feel -- How wa -- how did I feel -- N-No  I was going to ask you how you felt being back in Germany  and after the war.

Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 24 Because English wasnt very popular  before the war  in Poland Yeah.
They did not -- they looked at these people  but did not see that he was a prisoner of war.
During this time when you were here in New York  did you talk about your war experience?
About the war  we learn very quickly  about two  three three  four days.
And I don't know whether you know during the last war  lost 6 million people.
And he came to our house even  after that  and once after the war  at work  and once even they asked  ﬁOh  if there is something wrong  if youre see -- know something is wrong in the ghetto  come to us  stay in our place.ﬂ And the officer pretended he did not hear it  I remember  what he said.
But of course  then the war broke out and she got stuck like everybody else.
And that meant that th e killing of large numbers of people without a war would not be a Crime Against Humanity  w ould not be within the jurisdiction of the Court.
And they were sons of farmers  who basically didnt feel the war in the same fashion like people who were living in the cities.
Well  they were...uh...they were preparing us to leave Auschwitz at the time where it was bad already  that they saw the war was being lost.
Before the war  while his mother was alive  even though he and my aunt were in love they never married.
And we always thought  during the war  that nothing would happen to my parents because we 52 thought our friends  our neighbors would take care of them.
Its its more important than learning about war Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25  1998 27[indecipherable] education  because if you have nt educated you dont know how to what kind of decision to make and wh ere to go.
At that moment I told you this  that the authorities of the army in the west  under the command Eisenhower  they didnt send for two -- almost six weeks  the message to the Germans that they have the three soldier of the Warsaw uprising as a prisoner of the war according to the Geneva convention.
I I remember the gra ndchildren of Rabbi who who were taken to England so uh uh but I never met them after the war anymore  but it so happened that not too long ago  uh I addressed a group of children  kinder they call themselves  in Los 22 Angles and a man with grey hair came to me and said  you must have been my uh leader of the transport in February 1939.
In Poland  you know  before the wa r  to see something like that  running water  where in 1939  when the war broke out  we still had to ment -- to bring our water in in a bucket  from going to -- you know  to a well  or whatever it is outside.
How this historic fact relates to my survival is probably a bit farfetched  but it isnt  for the reason that the factory di -- me -- the factory in our town  which prior to the war  smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all kinds of locomotives and -- and meat gri nders  from the big to the smallest  was converted to a munitions factory as soon as the war broke out.
You could not own a car anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in Leipzig who had permission to have an autom obile because (a) he had lost his leg in World War I. He was a decorated veteran.
We knew that the prisoners of war were killed  but where they were buried  we didnt know.
Yes  that he was a  a war criminal and but at that point not really interested in politics.
Jews who may have  who were mostly in the Soviet Union during the war.
I knew what I wanted to be when I was 13  war or no war.
And they had the an-antique store in Warsaw -- I mean  before the war  and she lived there and another couple  a Polish couple live.
Interview with Jacques Ribons 83 That ship was a troop ship during the war.
And I said  \ Well  I felt I owed an obligation to my country and my family and my God and that's the reason I was in there.ﬂ They said  \ Yeah  but if you hadn't been in the reserve  you would have never been in combat and war two.ﬂ I said  \ Well  that's beside the point.ﬂ I joined the Reserve  no prior military experience and I did it all by correspondence  if you will  and association with the Ohio National Guard.
So one day there was a man staying with them who had been on the black list because he was in the war in Spain.
Well  you see  having been orphaned during the war  I had one idea in mind.
But before we turn to the war  tell us a little about your family  yourself  and your community before the war began.
I taught here in America  a guy  he was just here in Florida 54 recently  to read the Torah because he was nine years old when the war broke out.
My parent were -- not because I am their s -- their son  but th-the most wonderful people  but my mother was not very well in the last years before the war  didnt feel good in general  had high blood pressure  you know.
And the war caught him as an enemy  as a national in enemy territory.
And at that time Americans wanted to pay the pa y the dues for for fighting  for independence of Poland from the Bolsheviks ; this is the first World War.
And we had to be careful  ca use if we went off our general area of operations  there was unexploded ordinance around  and people were getting still getting killed from World War I armaments.
Now I remind myself when the war broke out  he was 45 years old  forty years was old.
So th-th-this whole business  and of course now  after the 92 war there  issues are changed the -- you know  that - Yeah.
And he did a degree in glass technology which is an unusual subject  but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought his parents over to England becaus e they had  in fact  they lived in Krakoff and as the Germans marched in they marched out towards the Russian si de and eventually the Russians sent them right deep into Russia and although they had an awful war  there were no worse off than of the Russians because nobody had any food  so th ey were discriminated against where they were and they came back to Krakoff right after th e war  and then we brought them over to England and they always said they had been the happiest years of their lives.
America was still not in the war  but America had -- was giving for free  50 46 destroyers to Great Britain on generally supporting -- supporting the British war effort.
Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war  or a lot of things that I thought about as being if something took off  took of paramount importance to me  I would think of the time that I crossed the channel  and how lucky that I was.
Oh  yeah  yeah  toward the end of the war  I was --I was wearing a nurse's uniform  because if -- you would not be interviewed or -- Interrogated? --
We had no relatives in Salonika  except that some who were fortunate enough -- an d there were very  very few  one or two who escape Macedonia  Monastir or Bitola  as it was called  and make it to Athens  and in fact -- t-to -- to -- first to Salonika  but very quickly  my f -- fathers niece  my first cousin  and her husband and young daughter came to Athens  but we had no -- but I -- I think that theres no question that my parents knew  or ha d heard  although Im sure it must have been a very murky story  because the details do not even a -- become known until after the war  and -- and years after the wa r  that all the Monastir Jews  all the Bitola Jews were expelled  as well as those in Scorpia expelled.
But there was no more friction between Jews and Arabs in World War II  that was stop.
That while the war is finished  there are families somewhere from whom we hadnt heard.
And I think it really  now talking today  I think it wasnt only my father  because my father was su nk in despair at the end of the war  whereas everybody was rejoicing  and even I was rejoicing  my father wa s despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that ha d happened  and the -- the death of so many pe ople  not only in the concentration camps  but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war  I think just -- just crushed him  and he was very despairing.
They just wiped out...they were sure that they won the war  which they did won the war in Europe.
They could recycle  which  you know  kept th em -- and the worst thing was that from the Jewish money  and gold  and art  they supporte d the war.
And then we had all these places in eight years  Eisenhower kept us out of war  and becaus e we were watching everything.
I could have gotten  probably  a great deal of money that way  because of 83 what happened to my family in World War II  and all this  but I never had  for a second  a thought.
>> Bill Benson: By the time Germany invaded Poland in September 1939  of cours e launching World War II  by that time your community had already experienced profound change.
Well  unfortunately it didnt work out  World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered.
What are your feelings today about how the war has influenced you?
As a matter of fact  Ania's parents were deported to Siberia where she was born during the war.
Well I think I talked about the beginning  being a result of the First World War.
After the war they did not -- most people they did not have a separate apartment  they got a common restroom  a common shower  a common kitchen  and six  seven families  they shared.
My argument at that time was this was such an extraordinary situation what happened when we came and what we faced at the end of the war is a   a legal vacuum.
We didn't know where they took them until after the war.
And during World War I  believe it or not  as a very young academic  I think he worked for the -- for the Kaisers foreign ministry on some -- you know  routine job over there  it is -- was -- the reason I mention all this is -- is because his -- his cultural roots -- Im talking -- Im not talking about the Jewish cultural roots  Im talking his general roots.
Yes  he did that in the first World War  he he was a chemist.
And just as we started following  the word came down the war was over.
Did you have any health pr oblems growing up  before the war?
Did you sense that before the war  there wa Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 39 Before the war?
So there are Germans who claimed  when the war was over  we look upon you American s as having liberated us from this.
My mother may be more likely to want to stay here  oddly  because my father had been able his family  his sister and his mother  after the war  had joined us here  or were going to join us if we but he thinks in terms of going back  maybe.
18 the war is over  1919 the Dutch want him back.
And actually  as I found out  it wasn't  I just met her just after the war started and I found out that the store r eally was not hers.
I mean in Poland but they were Germans who emigrated to Berlin righ t after World War I. And my grandfather became a banker in Berlin and my mothers father.
But there were Frenchmen and Belgians there who just ran away from the war zone and finally wound up somewhere in the south of France because the south of France was then considered probably the furtherest and safest part.
Now I remember  now I start to -- to give importance to the facts  you know  but I went through the war in -- Spanish war  when -- when we had the Franco   that was a very good chance to go and take a day vacation because we were going demonstrating against this  or -- or when the [indecipherable] to go demonstrate on the British consulate.
I  at the end of the war  I was 99 percent sure that he is not alive anymore because nobody was actually alive.
Brussels wasn't severely bombed  but the Germans did bomb Brussels the first day of the war.
The war brides were coming in and I remember it was a Saturday.
Were there some kind of communal sessions where people were able to pray about the end of the war?
After the war in December of 44  I had the surprise of a cousin who came and found me there.
Then war start; and   the - her sons and came German first.
And the Germans had  at the time when we were there  some also guilt feeling because they  I presume they had to ask the fathers where were your grandfathers at this pa rticular time  what did you do during the war.
Im talking about already after the war we were together in France.
I did not realize what this all was about until after the war  but these were meetings with young people who my father helped escape illegally out of Poland.
And  so we came and my mother had a brother who lived in Borough Park  and his name was Blitz  and he had escaped just before the war  on the last boat to Brazil and came then that route  with his wife and three children.
You have to keep on remembering that 39  what the second World War  I was merely probably around five -ish.
And a great many actually  I think  World War II World War I killed a lot of people  and that World War II people  who felt that they were safe  because of the big to-do that the Germans always made about their World War I soldiers.
So that was the only time I really experienced sort of and that was after the war  way after the war.
But because it was also partly because of the war  I recognize that other people were also deprived who were not in the same situation such as the American soldier  so  its not a unique situation.
I see  okay  so the other photograph we saw was after the war  when its being reconstruct Remodeled  yeah.
He was -- when the war finished  the only Bergl is left alive.
A-And I always  I throughout the war period  I had that feeling  that as long as she is with me That its okay.
Like I mentioned  England and France declared war  Germany  two big powers.
Moise Weiner: Well  I can tell you one detail of the beginning of the war what the people heard about the Germans.
And the French prisoners of war cut through some wires  we were surrounded by . . .
Right after liberation he and Shia  this person who had been his employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Ausc hwitz with him  and had been in the orchestra in Auschwitz actually  my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth.
And then it became time for England to enter World War II  at which point it was said that its a crown colony  an oil colony and so they clapped every last refugee into a detention center with Interview with Erica Laufer 23 August 19  2012 barbed wire all around it.
And did he continue to do th is bartering throughout the war?
This man came through the war and this professor still and so forth. (
>> Bill Benson: You also shared with me that besides the restrictions of the anti -Semitic it laws passed there were also the privations of war and Budapest was being bombed by the allies.
So  that was shortly before - before the end of the war.
The war was -- the Russian came already in '44 till the Weichsel -- there was six months no fi-- no fighting in this side.
And already on the 30th of January 39  before the war broke out  he threatened the Jews  whom he accused to want to push for the war  and he threatened them th at if -- one thing is certain  he said.
Did they ask you did you tell them about what you had done after the war or did you not tell them anything?
And did they talk about the war  or it wa s as if you people just put it back and you were si going back to 1941?
Even going so far as to supply New Testaments in German for German prisoners of war.
He would have never done before the war because he was through and through and dedicated.
After a remarkable year in Panama   David went to Israel as a soldier in the War of Independence.
I was on my way back to Marseille when we went into the war  and we were -- there was so -- little uncertainty that the Germans were coming down into Portugal that our New York office sent their message over to Lisbon  all the Americans had come home.
Th at was ironic that here we had s-struggled so hard all these years to prove that we were not Jewish  and then afterward  after the war  it was just as hard to prove that we were Jewish.
I'm going to marry the Maruska after the war  and she was thinking...you know...you should live that long.
And when the war start  the Germans came to Wilna  after the war start with Russia  we thought  okay  it will be like in Warsaw.
>> Bill Benson: So at some point  Agi  you would move  after the war  to Israel.
01:20:00] [DL] The psychiatric issues which you experienced after the war  what actually happened when you were discharged from the army?
It was eight  nine oclock; the weather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war.
And from that time I guess until the end of the war  we were hunted.
So  the first thing I wanted to do after the war was to resume my studies.
And after the war  I made it clear how much I appreciated it.
Some of them died because of the war activities but many of them died because of the inhumane circumstances they were in.
Uh of that group of two hundred or twenty or forty that went to Bremen  only one survived I found out after the war.
But do you have any idea from reading or speaking w ith people s-since the war has ended  any notion of how many people survived from your hometown  of the Jewish population  roughly?
I matter of fact  there was a family who corresponded with me even after the war  after  afterwards.
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: Before the war there was a great depression just like in the U.S. It came later in France  but it was d ifficult earn a living.
And he went to Coventry  I think  as a volunteer after the war  and helped to redesign the town of Coventry  which had been destroyed by the Nazis  including their cathedral  the famous cathedral in Coventry.
Tell me the first time that you do you remember where you were when you learned that the war had broken out?
And alt hough I wasnt sure there was any future in there  I lived by myse -- I went and got an apartment somewhere else  which was great luck that I could even find anything after the war.
Zupolni  it was Simpleburg then and he had given hundreds of thousands of marks for the German war effort.
The Russians were in Moldavia  Bessarabia  from 1940 to 1941  when the war started.
End of Tape #5 40 Tape #6 Talking about the Germans  I knew Germany from before the war.
But it was later  I mean like I said after the war I was thirteen.
And you know  now that there was war in Bosnia and I was very unhappy with the United States support of those people who were the killers during World War Two.
As I think it's probable evident  there's -- not only has Rae had to skip over an awful lot of what she went through  there is a great more to be told about what happened in the immediate aftermath of the war  their attempts to get to Israel  ending up in a displaced persons camp in southern Italy  and eventually making it to the United States and beginning a new life.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 127 No  that is during the war.
I graduate in foreign languages just -- in June 1941 when we went -- the Germans came  when the war began.
Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.
And sure enough  I found out that in the neighboring cells there were Wehrm acht soldiers who tried to escape from the war front  and they were brought to Nitra  and they were tortured there.
Halina  her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifyin g the family as Catholics.
Yes  and no matt I mean there were Prisoners of War  there were DP's  just about anyone.
And after the war was in Foreign Legion  you know what the Foreign Legion  that in in French Foreign Legion?
The Germans who are fighting t he war  we're talking 1944 now  the Germans were fighting a war and losing it .
And at the beginning of the war  it looked like there may be an invasion  but I was never -- I didn't  no  I was afraid for my parents  and I thought -- all the time I thought that my parents would be okay.
Believe it or not  as of today I'm talking to you  Germany does not recognize that they were the ones who started the war .
He made out the orde rs and for the next several days  trucks of the Brichah were moving these prisoner of war parc els from the warehouses  the several warehouses in Paris  to their own channels for shipment u ltimately to southern French ports to go on socalled illegal ships to Palestine.
But before the war  before 39 and before 41 when it really affects you strongly  do you hear about the Nazis?
You know  like a song or something  which I have it  and so -- Do you remember -- again  you were very young  any experiences in those early years after the war  of any anti-Semitism?
And I was inter -- always interested photography  and he was a Russian Jew who had lived in Belgiu m most of his life  who was involved in un -- during World War two  in a spy group  work ing against the Germans  that operated in France  and in Belgium.
No  no  the only thing I remember is that after the war  in 1987  and I was there with Chris  that we went to see the barrack  so then I knew that was the barrack.
And evidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers to jump to jump into the camp  to prevent the Germans from murdering the prisoners of war before they are liberated.
One died before the war and one was taken in Auschwitz in a selection  and one went to Russia  the oldest one  but he came back after the war and got married in Chicago.
Because as I said too  you know  before the war there was a lot of Jewish people living in that area  in the poor area  you know  and of course so they had a cemetery.
That was the extent we knew exactly what's going on in the war to this point  that people are killing Jews.
War broke out June 22 nd  1941 and probably early July  the Ru ssians left and th e Romanians came back.
He told me that he waved to them and were still there after the war.
Oh  he really was a member of communist party before the war.
You couldn't pay a labor[er] more than the price from before the war prices  more or less.
Then  of course  came the war and I was overseas for nearly [phone ringing].
And so in essence he became a soldier  fighting for Germany in World War I. Tell me your parents names.
One in the green uniform of the SS  I think  mu st have been SS  and two black uniforms of German  the Germans  local Germans  who already were part of the German army  and who before the war were traitors.
And then we we when we learned that America is in war.
After the war  and on our...so-called \ on our way home \  uh  for discharge.
And my mother learned this story when she came to Ioannina that first visit after the war  that the this German officer asked my aunt to bring more wine that na particular night.
That was -- this was 1940  so that camp had been established somewhere between '36 and '38  mainly holding Spanish refugees that had come into France due to the Civil War in Spain.
So basically  basically  uh as the international situation  there is a war help us to be liberated from the pr ison.
And what did you do between after the war Im a actress.
My father was of the opinion that he had been in the first world war and earned the Eye of the Cross  and a veteran  obviously  and nothing could happen to him.
And as you see  we went through the whole war together.
But during the war he was a pain in the neck  he really was.
They were on the ship on the day that Italy declared war on England and France after the fall of the marginal line in 1940.
And  by the way  it was very difficult to get rooms in New York after the war.
And I tell you what was when I was twe twe twe seven seven eight years we come in this war in this fifth place  in fifth place from my from my from my childhood.
The war scared away all the -- Yeah  because I -- as a kid I had scarlet fever  and I had -- I got all the sicknesses that you shouldnt get.
Well  they murdered a quarter of a million Serbs during the Second World War  including  plus Jews.
They would have found us  or we would have found them  but nothi ng happened after the war.
Uh  and it's hard to tell  because of course I don't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started.
One  I forgot all this  was Yitzhak   which I met him only after the war because they went  way before even I was born they went to Palestine.
He was then shipped out of the camp shortly before the  the end of the war  when Count Bernadotte17 was able to get the Norwegians and Danes out of the camp and get them to Sweden.
And I think I remember by the end I was there they brought twelve thousand Russian war prisoners to Auschwitz and as war prisoners  it was winter time  December  they was twenty four hours naked and a very cold night and snow even.
Was that an important part of your identity before the war?
And then  shortly before we got into war  we had defense preparatory courses offered by different schools.
I think in the beginning I mentioned that my father volunteered for the Army and fought in World War I. So in 1934 the Nazis it decreed in that same rally in that same assembly  that the Jews  effective immediately  are no longer German citizens.
You know  people didnt know what was happening  it was the height of the Cold War  people thought that the Russians were sending missile s over and bombing Amer ica and we were going to be attacked any moment  and ther e were all kinds of fears everywhere.
But that was the last war between the Russians and the Germans.
We knew there wouldn't be any shoes because after the war there wouldn't be anything.
The way I understand -- I didn't know at the time but after the war  people that were older than I am told me that the population was like 15 000 all together  and almost one third of the population were Jews.
I had asked you about when the war was over if you remember the experience and you were telling me about that.
And we went to Vienna and my cousin  my  my husband met my cousin and we went to Paris where I jus t had a couple friends  no relatives and we went down to southern France and we went where we never did go to the village where we  we stayed during the war  we just  it was  we had picked the wrong time of year and it was so death  really hot  that we jus t couldn't take the heat and so that's one place we didn't go to but we traced all the other places I had lived and it was very important.
So my two uncles  they were st ill single in those days  and they were born  they were at that point in their 40's al ready  because the war  in '38  it came over the border in '38 from Germany and they were single .
McCloy had been the Assistant Secretary of War during World War II.
So is there a moment  lets say you -- the war -- the war is not over -- Right. --
It's such an unreal experience to a person who goes through the war.
Uh  uh  I discussed uh  the World War I with some uh  with a gentleman that had uh  been in that  and he told me that uh  he felt that we weren't finished with the Germans  that the Nazi uh  the Nazi uh  that were coming in uh  in power  uh  that there was going to be a war  and he impressed on uh  on me this.
Can you tell me a little bit more about the war starting when the Germans came in 1941?
So I continued and and then until the end of November when I was over in Sweden and was told not to return because uh some of our groups were taken  arrested  and then I had to stay in Sweden for the rest of the war.
But at that time  it was --the college was really not working normally because it was -- War time?
My wifes mother and her sister and other family members were in Shanghai  so they wrote us letters coy -- thing was more or less normal  it was just the beginning of the war  before Japan was bombed and all that.
And the th ought that somebody can say  ﬁWell  hey so today were going to have a war  and Ill shoot a few of your kids  and youll shoot a few of my kids  and then theyll be gone.ﬂ That is so obscene a thought to me  that I -- I mean  I literally  I dont even have words to express what I feel about that.
I loved to write and I took as my thesis the Civil War  which I was very engrossed in it  I looked at old newspapers and then I passed that  I did that one year  I could take only one subject because there was no one to substitute for me at home.
And when he traveled in the train he still did...didn't know that the war started.
Im not getting– [Laughs] End of Tape #1 14 Tape #2 Then the war came.

>> Bill Benson: Just can imagine for the Bocahuts explaining the presence of not only a young boy  but infant girl in their household  must have been -- >> Jacques Fein: It was a time of war.

Before we turn to those years and the war and the Holocaust  tell us a little about your family and you before the Nazis were in control of Germany.

And I think part of her family -- my wife's father was a World War I veteran  and the fact that I was -- ended up in the service  he thought I would be a good match for his daughter.
Okay  now I want to turn to another subject; again  before the war.
I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I could prove that my father was a World War I veteran.
In public school  and thats my mother transferred me to [indecipherable] to public to private school  and there were only 13 of us  and all 13 of us survived the war.
And then he wanted to know where I was during the war.
Some of my aunts were members of the communist party from before the war.
But then everybody start turning around and looking  if you  you see all of us were separated  from families  from sisters  from mothers  from brothers  so we didn't know what was going on  I didn't know what's on the other side of the wall during the war.
2 Well it's from a famous pa inter in Vienna  his name was that signature and my grandpar ents were very well off  but then before  after the first World War you know  couldn't exist so we went br oke and I had to .
So that studying  as I said before  because this was war  and I was back in school  and just one day to the next being occupied by books was great.
There were programs after the war in Kielce  there were programs all over.
To all our uh arguments and how often did I argue  they...we always got uh they have to win the war.
The buildings were built when I visit after the war  the walls were most likely close to a meter wide.
Well  you know  as they were growing older  they heard about it  and then I would occasionally tell them  ﬁListen  I was in Europe and there was a war and this is what USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 80 happened ﬂ -- you know  happened here and there  but I didnt really go into details.
And the behavior of the French  who had been so non-committal during the war  was atrocious.
He run to Warsaw during the war but he came home from Warsaw.
It wasnt the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasnt.
The population kept hearing all these lies about how the Jews were spreading disease  they were disloyal  they were dangerous to the state  they had to be deprived of their citizenship  relentlessly hammering away at this one group who is the cause of all the problems  based on the war.
Some di-did find family  went to join them  a-and -- Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 59 Were -- were you out there when the children actually heard that the war was over?
4 But  in general  did the Jewish Community and the non-Jewish community mix  was there any sense of Anti-Semitism before the war?
He said  I don't know but I think that we still win th e war.
Uh the man who told that to my step-parents  my war parents  uh was a marshall.
But very soon after the war began people who opposed the regime went into the mountains and created an Army essentially eventually   which was very prominent  actually  in my area.
But it gave everybody a sense of accomplishment  and my father regularly volunteered to give physicals  I think Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 43twice a week at the recruitment center and every -- everybody pitched in and World War II was unique that it was -- got everybodys hundred percent -- it was a moral war that everybody supported.
Moise Weiner: To study  yes  and the war delayed a bit.
After the war he used to come to Wroclaw  I used to take him to movie  we went together.
Uh the the war started in September of 1939 and and shortly we were occupied uh mid-September or late September  the public schools opened again.
And there we lived till I  went to Po till I went away  when the war started.
D-Do you  when you look back on the times after the war  do you see a lot of ways in which what happened to you affected you  or is that really very difficult to parse out?
Tell us what life was like for your family in the early years of the war.
Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10  2014 40 When you were with these people  did you tell them about what you had experienced during the war?
I forgot to menti on that when America entered the war  my grandmother resorted to ---.
And has very traumatic memories of his childhood  but he has made contact -- That were related to the war  or -- Oh yes  all related to the war  and then he was alone in boarding school in England and then he came here and -- but fi nally -- weve talked about this a great deal.
So that really stood me in very good stead during the war.
When the war  I was in the street with my friend.
We were always on alert  because that time the -- the -- that was the height of the Korean War and there was always -- dont know when the Russians are going to attack you from the east and so we were al ways someone [indecipherable] who was on alert  24 hours a day were on alert  because you didnt know when the Russians were going to attack or not.
We fought for you in World War   and we will fight 29 for you if World War should happen.
He was hidden the whole war so she had a home where to go to.

Can you describe your thoughts at the time of the end of the war?
Did you know of Jan Karskis work during the war  or did you only find out about it after?
Can you tell me a little bit abou t when the war broke out in 1939?
And then Reagans own speech -- that afternoon  we went -- Winnie and I went to Bittburg and -- and heard his 132 speech and -- and Ive quoted his speech many times  and -- we cant undo whats been done  we cant bring back to life those who have died  but the one lessons weve been taught by World War is that good much triumph over evil -- Im quoting roughly  good must triumph over evil and freedom must triumph over totalitarianism.
And first of all  Mr. Szymel   thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today  to share your experiences  to talk about wh at you and your family liv ed through during the war.
I can tell you my self not killing him from time to time when I had the opportunity  but I had two other people in the jeep and war or not war you just don't kill people who surrendered  so that's the story of Julius Streicher.
My father -- My father realized  you know  that it was dangerous for the men to be in the house because they were collecting men to bring them to the war zone for labor.
>> Bill Benson: Before we go on from there  the war began with Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1  1939.
And the Jewish community  whoever left before World War II survived and went to Western Europe  etc.
We figured this is one camp we will never get out of if the war lasts a ny longer and we had no idea in January or February how long the war was going to last.
He died beginning of this year  1992  but he made it through the war.
And to talk about it as history because you know very  very  in the very right after the  in the fifties  even in the early fifties  in the dictionary  the Second World War  what happened.
What I remember from my reading of the US military forces in World War II is that before it had been much more of a professional army  and World War II brought in civilians  and in many ways was a great leveler  or people from totally different backgrounds were thrown together.
And after three  four weeks -- after three weeks  exactly on July 4th  the war was over  and I was liberated.
So they had to find a place where the--the ghetto could only--there was at that time  in Kovno  was about  I would say  around--30 000 Jews when the war broke out and I think you probably know the percentage--maybe 3 or 4 thousand of these survived in concentration camps and so forth.
In 1994  we formed -- we  the kids who were chosen during the war and saved by OSE   formed OSE -USA.
And I remember so good that morning how my father  he said in the radio  that its war start  you know  wi that Germany crossed the bort   and its going start the war.
When the war  second war started  I was in the fifth grade  I just finished fifth grade.
Well  it was s-secrecy all around  especially in -- in my job because we -- we started to be involved in preparations for -- for war maps and invasion maps and that sort of stuff.
La ter he opened an ambulatorium  a free clinic because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people dont have money  so my sister and the brother-in-law who was also a member of the J udenrat  had the empty store because he was in the flower business  and in the war they didnt have flower  so he opened in his store the ambulatorium.
A new world is born  the war is over  lets get on with life.
We really make a sincere effort through the United Nations to stop that war. (
I would hope it is not a phase and I would think that the institution and the message are what -- something that will endure  because there will always be other generations with some curiosity about what was  just like there is still a curiosity about the Civil War  or any of these events that have happened in history.
Now the Nazism in certain schools was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the boardin g house to have me transferred to a school that was less stigmatized and coincidentally  the school from which I had to be transferred was near the courthouse in Nuremberg where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place.
After the war  I was actively looking into the faces of people  looking for my parents and looking for my sister.
It was another thing  we came to -- tto Krakow  and i -- I went to school in Krakow and my mother register me already -- not -- she didnt want to register me th-th-that I am Jewish  because after the war they had still pogroms in -- in Poland.
Well  we subsequently found out and when I mean subsequently  I mean many years later after the war that the selection that took place in Starachowice was destined for Treblinka  and that is where my mother perished.
Uh...My father at age 19 lost his right leg in World War I  and because of that he had received one of the early automobiles as a war veteran.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know  were your parents or others fearful that the Germans might ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 come back because the war was still going on?
No  but what I was asking was  this is immediately after the war  and you had come across that one camp where you sa w the survivors  but when you are out walking on the roads  did you see any other survivors wa lking?
So as a result  we didnt fear much other than the fact that we might have to be going to war.
And we found out after the war from people we never saw our father again after that.
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 120 So she and when the French got into Paris  he he got this place before the war.
We were sure that it will -- the war stop  it will not remain like that.
And they were like toys  li ke from World War I  actually.
Frank Liebermann: Well  part of Munich was that Hitler called back all ships at sea to threaten war in earnest.
And coming with a Jewish wife  to Germany after the war  eh.
>> Bill Benson: Although World War II began in Europe in September of 1939  the full brunt of the war and the mass deportation of Jews in Hungary didn't occur until 1944.
Because even when we got into a German house  even if we saw some food there  you know  because what was happening after the war  a lot of German households became empty.
Uh we had signed that we  before we came we had signed uh what kind of agreement with the American government that we were going to stay there for the duration of the war  and then go back.
That was his job and he got liberated by the Russians and six months before  in 44  1945  I would say in January  six months before the war ended.
Now that only intensified the feelings that the war had fostered in me - the feelings that there was something wrong with me and being a Jew was a bad thing.
There was a lot of that during the war  and you had to be very persistent to to be ab to to get out of school with a degree  you know?
I do know that most of his teeth had rotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of strength was he just walked around the streets of Munich and looked for a dentist.
Well  when the war broke out -- this was al most the beginning of a school year when the war broke out  and there was approximately three weeks of bombardment before the Germans entered Warsaw  and from the rubble I got injured but didn't feel bad.
My mother was very upset after the war  when the book came out  that he didnt she didnt know anything about it.
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12  2002 49 Well  its -- ma -- in my profession the war still continued as a civilian  and we were just as busy as we were during the war years  working long hours.
and I think she was the second in ma -- first was Esther  her  and then my -- what I want to mention is that in this pre-war period  and leading to the -- the invasion from the German  I know this because after the war  that contrary to some of the friends o -- friends of the family -- Mm-hm. --
And that was -- But on the other side  every b -- I think that some Danes believed that Hitler will win the war.
I have no clue how we got through a war  and my mother brought stuff.
Im speaking of some remains of the skilled Jews that were used for the war machine  that were separated from the rest of the Jews in in Shufka   and these were the Hungarian Jews that were kept.
But my father served for four years in the German army  in World War I. Got the Iron Cross  and the whole deal.
This was now toward the end of the war and uh uh...(cough)...we were uh in a in a town called Elernordheim .
They did the same in England  by the way  at the beginning of the war.
You know  I was -- of course I had something from the war.
But I -- I absolutely did not understand the war  Korean War  I didnt understand.
In Ruscova  because I came back afte r the war and everything was gone  there wasnt a stitch left in our house or anyone elses house.
And sin -- fr-from then on  I was away for quite a few years  returned about a year or two before the war came.
In another sense a few years after the war  so many millions of people killed.
Seventy-three we were we went together  73  if you remember was the Yom Kippur War.
And they sent one after another  they sent women from other prisoners of war  which was definitely very safer for us.
They were all on the outskirts of Germany  because  like I said  when the War would have been over  and Hitler would have won  he would have said he did not kill the Jews.
I had the -- this cousin  who before the war  came to United States  he got killed in France  has a grave there in a military cem -- an American military cemetery  and I visit his grave  send the picture to his parents.
They lost the war because the Germans took a part and this took a part  but they wanted to kill us  the Jews.
I have to explain that when you are with other people and they are shooting buildings with the Krajowa8 from across the river  you're scared  but you feel that you're in the same co-- position with all other people and that there is a war going on.
Also it had been for a long time a concentration camp fo r the Spanish civil war fighters  you know  who France had gradually betrayed--the first to come over and then Blum 8 actually had made some deal.
So I stayed with [indecipherable] Usas  and Mama took my fathers war medals a nd went to see our Prime Minister  Kubilunas.
They were the  they oversaw this particular camp  and they  like these uh  soldiers told us afterwards  that they  they had very  they were able to converse  they were prisoner of war  so they were able  through Red Cross  they were able to receive packages.
But her son  Muttel  who was my father's friend in Europe and had survived the war also  and was my father's friend in Germany  he lived with his mother  Mrs. Feldman.
It was during the war  and the Germans just told them to take that section of the country off  and -- Were you -- in 1933 you were really young  so I cant imagine  but by 36 or 37  were you at all conscious that there were Nazis in Germany?
I don't remember I went to a nursery or kindergarten  because the war started.
You referred back to saying  ﬁWhat about the Negroes ﬂ when you were probably only 14 or 15 years old  and then questioning the Vietnam war.
And 1939 I was after do -- received the -- a diploma  I was sent to a unit where we fortified our border and after three months we supposed to be transferred to a military school  and start war.
So did this make war that much more frightening to you?
Then I went back  as I mentioned before  to the same school  and it has been a hell of -- of -- for me to -- to catch up  because I didnt go to school -- Okay youre now -- youre -- its the end of the war for you -- Yeah.
And like I said before  after the war  we reported to the American authority and the American authority put out notice to the Germ an people to assemble there and there and there; and they took them out to the place where two hundr ed people were shot - to dig th em out and to have a real burial in a cemetary.
After the war  when we were still in that house  the brother came to pick up whatever they ha d. Then they said  I heard that there was somebody here  some shiksa here  who took away my dead brothers room.
My mother knew them and she talked about them very often  but And so you learned all that after war ended?
The newspapers were to tell us about the war  and so no war  no newspapers.

He said  \ You will be a soldier  because you didn't do anything during the war.\
They hadnt been Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10  2001 44in the first World War and they were cert ainly werent going to get involved in this one.
The next day there were French prisoners  ex-prisoners of war  who lived in another house there.
On the other hand  my uncle and his wife  my fathers brother  who was also a veteran of World War I  were taken into arrested and sent to a concentration camp  and eventually died.
Now  during the childhood the things I can remember  the things that stick out  is that as a child my mother had my brother and I sitting on her lap on a windowsill on Fifth Avenue watching the parade coming back from the first world war.
But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they really hadnt prepared I think the war went so well for them  both in France and Belgium and in Holland  you know  they wiped out the allies and came to to the North Sea and the channel  and really weren' t prepared to invade to invade England when the time was right.
I can't tell you nothing after the first wo rld war because I was born born already No  I know that.
So we kept in touch with them during the war  and after the war  and now I had the chance  I went to see him and talked him into speaking up his own thoughts of leaving and moving to Israel.
And I guess he went into business after the war  to manufactur e  instead of individual suits  that they went into manu -- quote  manufacturing  not to the -- to the extent that it was in the States  but thats what they did is  they went into manufact uring mens clothing  is what they did.
They were coming there late August  decided when they have time to do it  but there was a war going on  that came first.
The third day-- the prosecutor was a German who suffered an awful lot during the war.
I want you to tell us where you went next  but before you do  I want you to tell us how you were able to get news about what was going on with the war.
Well anyway  what happened then was that  lets see  about 1944  about February  the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian war pr prisoners of war  and they were starting to dig up thats what we heard from other people  I didnt see it that they were digging up the bodies  putting them in piles and setting them on fire.
But when the war ended in '45 the Haganah guys came in to Europe in what was for them force  maybe as many as 100  and it might have been 150  I'm never sure of the whole number  and they recruited me.
At the end of the war I guess because of that my father was not -- not very old.
Do you know why your parents  like after war broke out in Septe mber 1939  why they left Paris but would return?
On the way home I didnt travel the Autobahn  I took the side roads  because just in case of an accident or something  I still would have tr ouble explaining what I was doing traveling with a three star German general who was really a prisoner of war.
Ive -- ever since World War II  I volunteered in some way or another all my life.
Towards the end when they started to lose th e war  there was more transport.
As long as the war continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves  most likely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved.
And then there was terrible war going on in England  between the bombings and all of that.
You were in America for the civil rights movement  McCarthy era  Cold War  Vietnam War  womens movement  etc.
They were killed during the war  they were buried there and then these barracks were built  you know  before we arrived.
Now it wasnt that difficult to send the western Europeans 8 back  whod been slave laborers  send them back to France  Belgium  Netherlands  Italy although Italy was Allied Germany for a while they were also working in the war effort and had to be sent home.
And you're interested in what's happening after the war  so after the war  in school  I mean I was an absolute terror.
At some point when World War I started  he found himself -- no.
And if he did live  he would come back after the war and get her.
No matter what he did and all that  he is still [indecipherable] you know  they did [indecipherable] When the war ended  your Majesty  you faced another huge challenge here  and you had begun to talk about it.
Especially during the war where the movies were closed  movie houses were closed  theaters were closed and there was really no place to go.
When we went down  where the farmer and we went down  the war was that was the end of the war.
You know in San Francisco they met for the  to put  in the Un ited Nations  that help to settle the war.
I want to ask a few other questions that are before the war and then we come to those -- all those other events.
He left the little village in Villefranche for France before World War I. And when the war started -- and then he was an Austrian national.

The -- did you -- when the six day war was happening  were you -- Oh  I study -- I studied history  so I still do -- I still do now.
But unfortunately during t he war my mother felt that it probably was best that she stayed married to him.
>> Josie Traum: Well  after the war -- first of all  fr om my mom telling me what had happened to her parents to my father's -- one of his brothers  his whole family.
And one day  on the second day of our marriage  the war between Russia and the... the Germany breaks out.
Actually I was more in formal hotels which due to the war were empty and where refugees were housed.
One of the men who was working before the war  you know  to get woods  to to build the houses  we had wooden houses in Novogrudok.
Later he was a member of the uh the black airmen  the black squadron who helped form uh the one squadron of black aviators in World War II.
And when the big bombing in London started  it was impossibl e to get to work because there was glass everywhere  water  and you couldnt just go anywhere  it was -- and things were burning and that really brought the war very close to you.
The Germans were forced to fight a wint er war in Russia  which was -- had disastrous consequences for the Germans.
He was away almost all the time.03:10:00 So  he even had to go back before we were allowed to go back because the Danes in Sweden organized a military unit in case there would be war over Denmark then they could have gone over and participated.
If the war had broken out two weeks earlier  I would still have probably my mother alive.
When you left Berkeley the first time to go back for the War of Independence  you went back and -- >> Julius Menn: I wanted to leave some time.
We have a special project here which is right in line with your experience during the war and please call this number.
What was the like for you to receive that news that the war had ended?
Hopefully  we hoped that the Germans will lose the war  and they thought they were telling us going to be a Blitzkrieg in 2 weeks  the whole uh war will be over  and uh  everything will be okay  everything be nice and fine  but they were mistaken  the war dr-the war dragged and dragged  and uh  they start slowly annihilating us.
But the -- the context of the war at that time was that  you know  we -- we have to get into that European war because the ja -- the Japanese have already attacked us and were already at war  and that we have to go ahead and then do something just as my father did before.
My mother was one of eight children  two of whom had died before the war.
This was already two years after the war  was still -- was still USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 59 occupied.
That's where I lived until the war broke out and the Ghettos and so on.
When we walked up the mountain a man who looked to me like he was the mayor of Zeaphant [ph100]  I dont know ma ybe not  but an official in either case  stopped us and said that Austria is no longer at war and as far as hes concerned we are no longer prisoners; the war is over and we should be free  except since Austria didnt do anything to us he cannot feed us.
So sh he has a a wife and two children before the war.
But then he -- he realized the full impact of his own anti-Semitism only after the war  of course.
No sooner that he arrived to the United States   he was  he was taken  you know  to the Korean war  front lines.
An d my father was very grat eful to him and worked for him again after the war.
The war and increasing restrictions made life difficult for Hungarian Jews.
This behemoth for as long as the war still is going on in the West.

Before the war began  were you aware of events in Germany ?
No  no  its 1985  was the 40th anniversary of the end of the war.
After war  uh  nobody really was doing well in in those small towns.
Yes  I didnt -- I didnt look for a social li -- I -- I had a good relationship to everybody who lived in the house and I had -- and after the war I was -- I me t -- happened a neighbor and we kept together  but I had no -- no social life in that way.
Well  I was delighted obvio usly  that they were prisoners of war and we were being guarded.
After the war we were coming to Milano and all that.
But my parents were arrested so fast after the beginning of the war that there was no question of any point of escaping.
The Germans only came in in 1940  and we went to Belgium in  no we came  '39 we we nt to Belgium in January and the war started in September that same year  so there were no Germans when we  otherwise  why should we go where there are Germans  anyway?
I met him right after the war in Italy  and he had a left arm  he had two bullets or three bullets in they left there.
And after the war  right away after the liberation had started to work.
I think -- I think that it must have been -- I dont know if it -- if it remained after war finished in 1945  if it went on or not.
Within weeks they were all out and at home  but I'll never forget those uh  people in that that portion of the concentra...or of the uh  the uh  prisoner of war camp.
So thats how we learned and we came after the war in Bucharest.
In the theater you could forget  you see  the war  and especially for me  I had no chance  nothing  no cafes  just no -- it was war time bor ing.

But with his friends from Lukow who had survived the war  and some of them had as partisans and so on  these friends who were in America  their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern.
What have we not discussed in this interview that you would still like to -- to talk about with respect to your experiences as a result of the war?
Did you  during the rest of the war  hear anything about the massacres of Jews in other places in Lithuania   not just in Kretinga?
And then there was this effort to track  after the war  to try to get some additional information.
And being still prisoner of war specialists we headed immediately for Hitlers  and we went up to the Berghof and then we wanted to get up to the Eagles Nest and we found out that we were not the first.

Did you feel after the war that you -- that your -- that you needed to mend?
As the war starts to wind down  did you go  did you remain–?
And you would remain with them until the end of the war.
So I went right in the police station  some of my friends have been in camp who were there  come out join us  and I say I never want to be a police officer  because you know from the war the police you know that...

They hoped that with tanks and with soldiers  they will  they will be able to win the war.
After the war  this landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there also in the landowners house.

We werent worried  but -- worried  but we were very optimistic about the end of the war  how could it happen  you know?

When she came in 1938 to liquidate the property  the war broke up in thir -- broke out in ‚39.
The factory  as you know  was smelting ore  because there was ore in the area  and they were doing  it was doing already war production  because in Starachowice  where the factory was  the plant  was located in a district called the central [says name in Polish] the central industrial area  that was organized for Poland after the first wa r  to arm themselves because they felt  you know  now that Poland was independent since 1918  they had to be armed.
And finally  do you feel that there have been things in your life  decisions  or the way that youve approached things in your life that come directly from  you know  the experiences  what you went through during the war  what also  in general  the Holocaust  you know  that experience?
I asked my brother Fred  who did all the interviews  he said  ﬁYeah  something like USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 69 Boscamp  or something like that.ﬂ Anyway  I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec -- documentation in Amsterdam  and said -- described the hut where I had been  and described Oskam  and I sent a little picture  a little photograph of Oskam  his wife  and their son  who was then three and a half  four years old  and sent it off to war document -- and asked them  is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp  or whatever his name is still alive  and I described him.

We had a beautiful hom e. We had a beautiful life until World War II came around and this is when our problems started and our life was destroyed.
Yes  but was there an expectation that the Germans woul d attack  or did you think the Russians are here and thats going to -- Well  I -- I think there was an -- for the -- fo r a -- for awhile there was a mixed bag  but with the German successes in the west  you know  when they overran all of Europe practically  okay  and also with the -- with the London  you know  blitz  too  and all that  and knowing the history of the relationship between Germany and Russi a you know  and -- and -- and knowing the -- the -- the German ne -- expansionism and need -- need ing the Ukraine as -- as their breadbasket  you know  to -- to f -- fuel the war effort.
They thought they were delivered from the winds of war to survive.

When the war ended  I was in the vicinity of Dachau  near Munich  where I was liberated and met the American troops  who liberated me  actually.
When you lose one person  we lost one brother 56 before the war  he was 21 years old.
And you know people sort of sometimes say ok I seem to be war prone.
And while I dont think the average child black pe rson realized that they were tr eated as a inferior citizen  but they were treated that way  and this is  I think ho w we felt in Berlin during the war  in Germany during the war.
Four years of the war I was listening that all the Jews are killed  killed  killed  I couldnt imagine that this could be done by humans.
I started also taking courses that pertained to -- to -- to history that -- that wasnt -- you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 164 know  like I knew everything after the first war  I knew all that stuff.

So was the whole family  all of them stuck to their loyalties and to their convictions throughout World War I and World War II and thereafter.
Speaking of \ ours \  I mean Jews in Germany immediately after the war  knowing of the unbelievable horror under which these people had suffered  we had the same hatred towards Germans that the Jewish DPs had.
History World War II history  I didnt read about it  but I knew more than the kids in class.
>> Bill Benson: Manny  you also mentioned that there is the larger context of the war going on  so there was bombings and other deprivations.
And -- and we did hear  actually  a fair amount of bombing  although Amsterdam was not flattened the way Rotterdam wa s. There were certainly constantly air raids and sirens and planes flying overhead and some areas were bombed becau se the -- I know some part of the hospital was bombed  and I know the hospital had -- and the reason I know that  67 because after the war I became very ill  and I had to go to that hospital.
So there had already been -- those laws had already been introduced afte r the first world war and slowly increased and so on.
The connection with Israel that youre going back and forth  and so early -- Well  its a funny connection  because you know  all my youth  I was an anti-Zionist  I was an anti-Zionist even into the war  yes.

Lets jump ahead to start of World War II in 1939.
Do you remember ho w the war ended in How it ended  yes  I remember Churchills speech  hearing it on the radio.
And I -- I was not the very happy person that I was before the war.
It wouldn't escape me  especially  especially to see people who do have family  because right after the war  people came from Russia  people came out of hiding and here were those families.
And then he came home happy thats who knew the war is going to be for six years  nobody Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 34knew.
Well  I can perhaps add something  that with all these awful things that have been happening since the war  especially in this part of Europe and Romania  being on a program like yours now  I do hope that maybe I can -- I brought some light into some events  to explain certain things which Im quite convinced that very few people know. [
But uh this was still May 7th and that was just when the war was coming to an end and uh I uh I mean I was totally shaken by this experience but I but I had to go back to my unit because now uh all these German troops were uh surrendering en masse uh uh and I really had my hands full for for a few days.
Do you think that you would be different  a different person today if you hadnt lived through the war years and experienced what you did experience?
Sure.ﬂ And acted very civilized and took a walk around and as they were walking  the gentleman meandered in talking about the war situation which could hardly help because it had been going on then for about 4  5 years and he said  \ It's a terrible situation with the war.ﬂ My father said  \ No doubt.
My grandmother died at the age ŠŠ after World War I  near the end of World War I. And I was named after her.

Well  the Jewish community of Shanghai which I came into and this was already uh this was right after the war  the Joint Distribution Committee and uh of of the Jewish people heard about their Shanghai ghetto...well first of all  how did we become a ghetto?.
My grandparents died during the war  and so Jewish life really centered around the synagogue and so forth.
And  uh  the  the  the speed of our work was dictated uh also very strongly by the fact that uh  uh  we had to t-try to comp lete the job before uh  uh  uh there would be uh  uh this terrible thing called war.
So do you remember hearing that the war ende d while you were in Switzerland?
And their da ughter survived in England  thats who they went to after the war.

They were not only Germans  they were also loyalists from Spain who were fleeing after the Spanish during the Spanish Civil War  which was going on at that time.
And then he was drafted in 1950  in the Korean war  he was drafted and went to -- upstate to Watertown.
At the end of the war  or -- See  I -- I didnt stay too long there.
What they had there  they didnt know how long the war would last  and since no new kids were graduating from college  or very few  they had programs to give academic training and provide people for leadership and more responsibility later on.
>> Bill Benson: Before we go further into the war  tell us what -- to your knowledge  knowing how little you were  when the Germans came in  in May of 1940  occupied Paris.
I saw them when I was in England before th e end of the war the Jewi sh -- Jewish -- they had  you know  Jewish -- like a restaurant an d so forth.
But before we turn to the war and the Holocaust  let's start with you sha ring a little bit about your family  your community  and yourself in those years before the war began.
This was something that he fought for during the first World War  was for not only for Polands independence  but also for give everybody the opportunity and equality.
He had left before the war and been in the American Army and was now looking for relatives  hoping that someone could tell them what had happened to him to them.
And one of the first days of war when I stayed with my grandmother  the house in which we stayed was bombarded.
What Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16  2014 29 it was  was lemon meringue but it was war time and she got confused. (
And then on the positive side there were  during the war  there was I said because it was an airport there  military airport  the Germans were in  with their planes  air force and also some Romanian who also were forced basically to fight against American and Britis h and so on.
I was able to write and send letters  and once I was even given a leave of absence during the war to go back to Palestine and visit my parents.
>> Bill Benson: And the war  of course  ended 70 years ago last week in May 1945.
At the beginning of the war  the Soviet Union made a pact with the foreign minister and the Ambassador to Moscow.
Because when war broke out  that area became restricted and we had to leave.
And therefore they decided  since they were remembering that in World War I  Ostranlinka   the city was totally burned down by Lastrovmazofyetsky not having a river n earby  not having the main station railroads remain quiet  so they decided that probably the war would not reach in Lastrovmazofyetsky but it will be only in Ostralinka .
And I think you caught it right   though  when you said th at  after the war  it was not yet a very cosmopolitan society.
My grandparent -- grandmother brother used to have apartment building and one apartment was -- before war in Sacz  and one apartment was vacant  so our family just moved to this apartment.
We always have to be thankful for them because we -- now the children  you know  they -- they are aware that they suffered  too  while we were in hiding there  and th e interesting thing is this happened very recently  I got -- for our 50th anniv -- wedding anniversary  we got a letter from the third oldest child  who is really -- I would almost say obsessed with the war.
And after the war  I met him; and he told me that he got a post card f rom her on the way to Auschwitz which she threw out and somebody picked up and mailed.
When you were there the first time  so thats at the end of the war.
They are closer to the Israel -- to Israel on account of the Holocaust  because they know that we -- would we have Israel before the war  probably more than half of Jews will be alive  because they will run out and they will have a place where to go.
And I th-they wanted to take me as an American prisoner of war  and smuggle me to America   and I said no  I explained with my hands  because I didnt speak English  that I wanted to go to London .
Now when the war started  the first World War  th ey of course  as American citizens  had to leave Germany  go to a neutral country.
You have told us about the war beginning  your involvement in the war.
From what I understand in a lot of those camps  I have an American that was in the camp and I worked with him after the war and he remembered me always used to have a lot of talks with me.
And did you go back to Koblenz aft -- right after the war as well  when you were still in the army?
One thing I remember something was my mother -- the nurses came in and gave me a plate with a beautiful tangerines -- mandarinos or something -- which in Russia  it was very unusual -- the war  winter especially -- they said  \ That's from your mother -- you eat it.\
What do you remember of your life in Belgium before the war?
They wanted to it was part of the Germany before the first World War  and the Germany wanted to recover that territory  and they very b-became very aggressive against the Lithuanian.
When you first came to the United States  was that important  to find people who had been through the war and had similar experiences?
What did war mean to -- How could I not know?
So they my my father  and the last days  this is what I remember  Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 37when he said to us  you stay here  you know  because it will be blitzkrieg  short war.
So you really understood this was the end of the war  this was it.
And–the rest of his brothers  who are older from  not from the same motherŠ from the same father Šlived in Romania and they all survive and during the war they went to Palestine.
I mean I can't separate the war years from my recollections of my mother and my father and so I certainly was  I guess I've made USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 46 that clear by now that I  I find my  my mother's memory to be a very important thing to me and I had no intention of glossing ove r her life or my recollection of her life and  and that's part and par cel of those years  so I have never had difficulty thinking back  cause I have always wanted to remember her and that's part of it and I've really not ever had a problem discussing it  I've never found that I broke down or couldn't talk about it in any way.
We got everything back after the war  but one family didn't -- was not honest.
As a matter of fa ct the whole three are  after the war we knew  the whole three ar e finished.
When you came to the big city  Krakow  which has before the war  in the war even  in the beginning  ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews.
Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 34 So y -- During this war -- during this time I got -- we got a few postcards through the Red Cross  heavily censored  only knowing that they were starving because they said  you know  they -- they gained weight and were -- and now were up to 130 pounds.
And the partisans had suffered more casualties in this here last month of the war as they did in two and a ha lf years prior to that.
But I think it was both  it was the war in general  which all the children  Interview with Arlette de Long 25 everybody in my time suffered from  and it was personal in the difficulty of being a Jew and having such strong identific ation with -- with a man  with Christ  with a religion which basically also doesnt exist very much; its an idea in my head.
And because the Russians  when they shot those prisoners of war  they didn't do it like the Germans did where they made them undress  shoes went to shoes  pants went to pants  jackets went to jackets  hair were shaved.
Cause even Sadat had fought the Jews  but they made peace on the basis  and thats why she [indecipherable] she said we both have grandc hildren and we dont want our grandchildren to live through war.
And I tell you  when you went -- you go through a war like that  you become very selfish  too.
He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time  but when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming.
So Ive never -- I dont remember his name any more  and Im sure he died in the war  but Ive never for -- its a memorial gift to him.
And they gave me a glass of milk  which is something I had not seen in years  sin ce before the war.
During that time Hitler threatened the allies or what became the allies by calling back all of the ships at sea and saying that if I don't get what I want  I'm going to declare war.
I dont think I -- there was any more chance  when real war began  that they could get out.
And he says that then he went back to his hometown and the war broke out.
We don't know what mont h. We don't know how the war.
But afte r a while  the law came that you cannot stea l or take anything anymore  so what we did there was no food  no st ores  no place to go s hopping  after the war.
It was a very close family and directly after the war  of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 8 course contact was made with them again and in fact  one of my father's brothers came to Amsterdam not long after the war and he got  he got a passport  he got a visa and he was able to come and to arrange fo r my mother's care and also to start to arrange for our coming to America and so by the time I was told that my mother had not long to live and by the time I  we intern alized that  we knew that we were not going to be in an orphanage  for example  we knew that we were going to America and so we were looking forward to that.
But in 1938  life started to get a little bi t easier already  before the war.
They were not yet ready to act  the War had just ended.
This was the same place they gave to people who escaped Spain in the Spanish war.
He was taken to the first war  and he was taken to the Army  and he didn't like it.
When I saw them  well  they were prisoners who hadnt been fed who worked for the German war machine and given  not even  minimal rations.
>> Bill Benson: Halina  you would continue under these circumstances  living in Jaroslav to the end of the war.
No  till -- till the -- when the war started  yes  we wonder -- this is why when -- I try to go toward -- toward Warsaw when the war started  because I thought I -- maybe there will be a fight  and Ill not be on the side with the Germans  but Ill be in the -- where the pol - Polish are  and -- but unfortunately on their way  the Germans went faster toward -- came faster toward -- to Warsaw  to -- practically to -- see  they didnt take Warsaw  but 3 close to Warsaw  so that I was under the Germans  and -- and decided to go back to our city.
But at the base of that was my fathers hatred of Bolshevism  because dont forget  in the -- in the si -- the trigger for my dad actually was reawakening him to the threat of Bolshevism in the -- the civil war in Spain.
It takes 2 years.ﬂ The war wouldn't last 2 years anymore.
Now  obviously  I didnt have the educationa l background  because five years of ma -- you know  from age -- the war broke out in 40 -- from -- from age 18 to age 23  I was under German occupation.
Vovek survived the second world war  and I met hi m a couple of times afterwards.
And I think that was also one of the reasons why the United States didn't recognize what happened 35 in Germany until much later and Roosevelt had a ha rd time to convince them to  to do something about it  the War Relief Fund and so  they came all much later.
You may be aware of the fact that after the war was d eclared  the -- the -- the eng -- British government made a suggestion that children in -- living in the London area might 27 wish  depending upon their parents  to be boarded int -- more into the countryside.
We found out after the war that this woman was his sister  but we didn't know.

They were teaching in surrounding areas of wiciechowa and Leszno   and I lived there until the war broke out.
We survived the war and now we get killed after the war?
And one brother was coming back from the war and he stoppe d in Vilna to look for -- for Blechman family and he saw my sister.
>> Kurt Pauly: Well  when the war was over  you know  they began to look for people.
So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old border of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian territory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the Germans as I told before  after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland.
And she just lost him maybe for -- the week before the end of the war -- a month before end of the war.
The children - l ittle children... Everybody has little children this time you know - after the war - They married  have chil dren.
After the war a middle Hitler  when he chase out all the Jews from Germany  he went to Belgium.
And normally I would have been starting school  probably that September  but with the outbreak of the war  whatever formal schooling I might have had was deferred.
But there was increasing dissatisfaction as the war came cl oser to the German borders and the -- the German government -- and particularly the pr opaganda machine of Goebbels  had another weapon given to them and -- and that was act ually by the Russians.
Interview with Eric Simon June 21  2014 81 And the war was in much in progress  in-including American participation.
The work we had to do in England was to find to meet the conditions which the home office had laid down which was having a guarantor 50 pounds for each person which they designated as being money which would be used for the children's eventual repatriation at the end of the war  of course there wasn't a war to start with.
We went on a Dutch ship during the war -- already the war had started  through the channel.
I was part of the group of people who went through the war  some went through in hiding  be -- people in groups  some we re in hiding.
I didnt  but the minute I came   he tried to convince me that we should go to America  not to Israel  because its -- he had enough war  so did I. He had -- He was in the partisan all through the war.
And her father was killed during the uprising against the tsarist regime at the end of first World War  to free Poland.
45 Albert Speer(1905-1981)  Reich Minister for War Production from 1942 to 1945.
They knew that life would be very hard but there was always hope that the war wont break out.
And so ther efore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day  week after week  and we finally come to the day of Christmas Eve  which was a terrible day...because the Russians  Russia and Spain considered themselves in a state of war.
So you were very directly involved in production for the war?
They knew all these things because they were in the war anyway  also.
Now the 1st of September  the war broke out right a day  2  3 days later.
And this I remembered even af ter the war  that I promised her  even she wasn't alive and it was hurting me after the wa r very much that I didn't give her this...I should marry a \ Hasidic boy and gave...give the \ Nahas from me.
S -- 1938  ‚39 -- Libby -- you -- in -- this is already -- in nine -- in 1939  see what ha -- see what happened in 1939  we were saved by the -- its -- we ex -- the war started and the Germ -- we 18 expected the Germans.
The partisans arrested my father as an enemy of the people  you kn ow  because then it stopped to be something like a war  it was a -- the Slavs against the Italians.
Without refriger ator  without any  you know  fancy appliance of any kind  so in some ways  in some ways it was almost worse than during the war.
Especially because Mima died in -- in -- just a few months after the war ended.
Vichy did not govern France since the end of 1942  when Germany occupi ed the southern French ﬁfree zone.ﬂ Elizabeth-Anne Wheal  Stephen Pope  James Taylor  A Dictionary of the Second World War (New York: Peter Bedrick Books  1990)  500.
Because he succeeded to wriggle himself out from Poland while the war was still going on.
I did nt know what to di I it was war  I dont know.
But I got used to all this  but when I came to Israel   they have the I remember I was with my friends  the neighbors were my friends  and they were the same age I was  and they the plan was  that time  I think  after the war of 48  or whatever  I do not know  the plans was there from the [indecipherable] that everybody tells me  you got to go down on the ground.
What were your reactions when they told you the war was over?
And I said to myself  \ I have to survive the war.
In September 17  the Russian-Soviet army invite in Poland no declaration of war and gi ve us the knife in our army from the back.
It was an -- a professor in Holland what wrote a lot of books about a second World War and in begin  they didnt believe us.
And after the war was over  you went back to Israel?
Before the war  my father came from a family of 11 kids  and my mother comes of seven children.
And thats why we lose the war  he said to me.
Wh at we did through...during the war or...it was war time.
A day before liberation on April 14  one day before we were liberated  we all knew or felt or sensed that the war has come to an end  that we are going to be liberated in a day or two.
I didnt live with with with my father and my parents during the war.
Even before the war  then  before you we re working in this of fice  you worked in one of those transit camps?
I always said we going to meet my family when this war is over.
So there was a war  I dont know  in ‚67  between Israel and Arabs  and one of the boys came to school after the war has ended and said  ﬁMr.
He said as a matter of fact uh there was a 9 large supply that filled several warehouses in Paris of prisoner of war parcels that had been sent from the United States during the war that were to be shipped to Switzerland.
We followed the n the the news of Americas involvement in the war.
It was not an easy time for anybody after the war.
But this is -- this is forgotten  this USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 43is gonna be -- this is just part of histor y. And as far as  for instance  Roosevelt  Roosevelt to me -- see  I -- I didnt know  I never realized it  being in Europe  and -- during the war  to me  you know  Roosevelt was a -- a -- a -- as far as a -- a great president  you know  and being an anti-Semite or not  we did not know.
But  I know there is another war going on with Japan.
Later on  when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family  I realized we really copied -- we copies–no  we didn't copy it.
I did not begin school at all  because the war broke out September 1 st  1939  and I was just I had just turned in August  seven  and in Poland school started at sev you know  first grade at seven.
They figure the war will end  they tried to organized most of those to go to Palestine.
When we heard the war was over  it meant nothing to me.
My fathers sister with the six kids had only one surviving child  my cousin  who was my only survivor other than my mother  that survived the war.
And he had a contract with the war department to work at the military government in denazification  and I happened to be in that department.
And this was another piece of injustice that I suffered  because we  the people who were -- some survivors that were booked on this line were put in the very bottom of the boat  and the top were reserved for the German war brides.
There was something in existence which had gotten started right after the war called the Central Committee of Liberated Jews  and then there was a huge fight as to the preposition.
Did you ever meet Germans of the war generation  or the second generation [indecipherable] America?
My parents did not know where to go af ter the war.
They never met them  like this distant Uncle that left Poland before the war yet  before they were born maybe.
I  I feel that that I can  that I can explain or like people more than I 24 could before the war.
Later on  it started slowly  and then after the end of the war when the facts were available became known.
We have pictures of my father right after the war   not right  right after the war but in '46 where he looks fine.
Which was huge  yeah  and so he got a job in a coal mining district in Yorkshire  in Wakefield and they moved to Wakefield and they first lived in a small house and then later on they bought a much larger house because nobody else had  in the war time  wanted to buy a large house.
Lets say a brother  a nephew  survived the war in Russia  they came back for the child  the child was already five  six years old  the child didnt want to go.
Adam Czerniakow was a good friend of my fathers before the war.
When -- when you think about your life now  and you think about what it was like for you in the Netherlands because of the war  and because you were in hiding  do you think that changed you very much?
So  how old do you think he was at the end of the war?
And we had an interesting arrangement at the War Production Board.
Following his arrival in the United St ates after the war he eventually became a doctor of veterinary medicine.
He served in the Second World War as a flight engineer on one of them Dakot a airplanes.
They were Russian  released Russian Russian appar Im so rry  Russian prisoners of war.
These people  people  they run away  they made it  they made after the war  they died already.
So when  when did you finally talk to your daughter about the war experience?
In Dnepropetrovsk  afte r the war  thats -- Yeah  in Dnepropetrovsk  I want in the school   but I got sick.
I went to a black -- black barbershop  and then when I met the barber on the -- on the bus  I sat with him  and the guy sa id  ﬁYou better get up because theyre gonna stop the bus  because black people should sit in the back.ﬂ And you know  so I kept getting in trouble  because we -- after the war we didnt like discrimination at all  so thats wha -- Let me go back and ask you a coup le more questions about Landsberg.
Tell us about that period between the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 start of the war in Septemb er 1939 and before the Nazis came t o Hungary.
And I al so remember that -- that several things then happen as the war got worse and worse.
At the end of the war  a couple of months  you know  the end of the war happened different places at different stages  you know.
Because Tanta Ella survived the war because she came to live with me in 1946.
Its very difficult  because we have seen  after the war  many thing which goes near Holocaust.
The people in charge of us were Germans -- not Germans  soldie rs  but prisoners of war  criminals  people who were sent to concentration camps for crimes committed  and all of a sudden they became the elite 33 of the --snapping their fingers.
And then after the war  beginning -- starting a life over again  I would hear her cry at night at times  certainly  in the first few years.
We knew the war is going to be -- to the end.
Uh so that uh I was pulled out of the uh away from the unit that I had been assigned to in those days and sent to a military intelligence uh training center in Maryland in fact uh which uh in which we uh were assigned to these uh different jobs of either prisoner of war interrogation or or some military government or some other  some other activities and I wound up with a unit that uh was charged with prisoner of war interrogation and uh we uh first went on maneuvers and this was now '42.
Didnt she tell you that you had changed a lot  the first time she saw you after the war?
So they was treated here now like everyone else  not like prisoner of war but like a prisoner in a camp.
And then he was taken as a prisoner of war  and he came back to Kolbuszo wa he started to run his office.
First World War  you know  and after first World War and everything  maybe he knew him from there  I dont know  he told me  you know  he was an old man  but he told me those stories.
I took both my kids  my husband and my two kids and we protested th e Vietnam war.
It was what everybod y felt was a very just war.
All of these Gentiles you were sort of friendly with before the war  what were they doing?
He built a house a year before the war  and this was the most exclusive  the most beau tiful house in Kolbuszowa very ---.
After the war  I was  for a long -- some time  very friendly with a Russian girl  then I was quite friendly with the Italian girl.
I remember it happened maybe two or three days after the actual war started  and I remember long lines of people  these were the refugees who were trying to escape from the German part of Poland  they would -- I mean  there were people with bundles  children  and I mean it was a very sad picture  and that's what is in my mind  of all these people walking on the street  not even on the sidewalk because there were so many of them.
And my war mother said to me  in the beginning that I was there  that of course I came from a different milieu  and they would try and find another place for me.
Suzy Snyder: The war is -- your -- Halina Peabody: The Russians are coming.
A. Buchenwald  a few days before the end of the war -- I didn't know that it was going to be a few days before the end of the war  but the manager our what we called it in German  was Polish.
Do you remember do you remember where you were then the war Eight eight of May  wa s finished  no shooting.
But at the time  the first months of the war and people are leaving did they have  was there any news of what was going to happen to them when they get into the territory controlled by the Soviets.
No  I th I do though  think  or actually I did often  sort of  when they would turn seven  like when the war would break out  it s not that I rethought what happened to me so much as I sort of marked the time and said  this is when when it started for me and and look what theyre like.
Even after the war  she was clamming up  she wouldnt talk.
Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 92 Well  its important that you got your parents stories and what a wonderful -- acts that they did during the war.
And when the Dutch police after the war  wanted to round up all the Germans  they went back to their old files  and lo and behold  there are two more Germans  the von Halles.
07:16:00 But as you read history  and study the whole the whole scene that has unfolded in the second war that was never even contemplated  or one step from the next  was the more horrible step from the next.
You Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 84 Well you were here for the the Vietnam War and the Cold War.
But as I said before  the real effo rt in Norways war was the sailors and the -- or that was the real thing  but so -- but everything you could do against the occupying powers in Norway would  of course help -- help out.
What about anti-Semitism on other fronts in Fran ce after the war?
A nd you know  given the command structure  once a brigadier tells me its a war crim e  the ones below him cannot say its not a war crime.
Now  after the war  when you came back to Vienna -- Yeah? --
But it came very  very good after the war  when I worked for the dictionaries.
There wh ere wa -- the war was not over yet.
And by looking at that aspect of the -- what happened during the war  he was able to then talk to his children about the other things that happened.
I mean  not the war [indecipherable]  but there was liberation for a war.
So in those let -- last few days the ambassadors went back and forth  but then it was war.
Prior to th at  I forgot to mention my you know  there were transports going  prior to the Germans arriving  there was a way of going to Palestine th-that was there was some sort of effort made  and my uncle tried to get on one of those transports  because he had been a Zionist before the war  which my father was not  and he kne w Hebrew  and he rated whatever  you know  an affidavit  or whatever they needed at the time  to prove that they were worthy of going to Palestine .
And for a number of months in those early days after the war  the JDC did what it could in Feldifing and I think a similar effort was mounted in a Jewish displaced camp in the British zone of -- of Germany.
The minute the Germans declared war on on on the rest of Europe   to take over the world  that was passe  you know Okay.
Well  I know that he must have been when the war started  thats he must have been gone  I think that he was killed  yeah.
But this fear in me that I'm in the war  I'm being bombed  I'm being left behind  this -- I wasn't home.
After the war  they want to make into a great communist country.
Tell us about your family  your community and what life was like before the war began.
You -- after one and a half year would have been on September the 15th  1939  and the war broke out on 1st  September the 1st  so I ended up being a soldier while the war broke out  so I was in the war as a soldier  Polish army  against the Germans.
The owner of the store was uh was Jewish family and they was very very friendly with my my brothers  so so they was live only one block and uh almost like uh live together  you know  until war start.
Let's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family  your parents  and your life before the war  before the Holocaust began.
He was -- his right shoulder was broken in the war and he could never lift his right hand any more.
Who had been the director of a type of [indecipherable] institution in Germany  until he himself  as a Jew  was expelled and taken to a concentration camp before the war started  and finally released  and who came to this country  or at least came to Britain as a refugee.
This is -- I was not sorry that -- when the war started.
This again  this was very shortly before  before the war came to an end.
He had himself four children   and he came alive out of the war with his wife and the four children.
My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to officer training school for four months just before D-Day  and of course they missed most of the war.
But you had -- didnt you ha ve indications that the Germans were losing the war at that point?
But again  the luck.... This man was after the war  had been I think ten or twenty years in prison because he had given people to the Nazis; and by chance not my sister and not us.
You know  before the war I attend  in 19 -- the year 1938 -- ‚39  I was attend to the last year  to the gimnasium  because folsee -- the education was four years in gimnasium  and was in mas -- last year.
And it did  right at the very beginning of May. And it' s interesting coincidence that the month of May was the month when the war ended and when Hitler ended.
It happened in 1939  it comes the war between Poland and Germany.
And then came the war and my father go  and so my mother had this little boy.
Bu t it...it got to the destination  because it got back to me after the war.
We were on the fourth floor  and everything was burning around  and we had to start the war.
>> Bill Benson: The question  Anna -- >> Overcome the scars of the war?
That now is a war; and war will finish  and we will be all again friendly.
And then describe what you were saying that y ou were supposed to go to England and the war broke out  so Well  yeah  I mean  that that then the whole thing got scrapped because we couldnt leave  we a-are we had already packed all our things  so we moved in with my grandparents.
It turns out that he had them inspected by a scribe  after -- he has them now  he had them inspected by a sc ribe after the war  in New York  or -- or in Israel for that matter  and they were letter perfect.

And I had been totally cut off from them and two of them were the girls I had hidden and two of them were other cousins and all of them  in some way were connected to me  because after the war they were -- I -- they were in the institutions -- Its okay.
Most of them wanted to talk about their girls back home and how homesick they were and couldnt wait til they got back and if they werent injured very much  they said  ﬁOh  this means Ive got to go back into the war -- fighting again ﬂ you know  and I -- but others that were being -- thats -- if they were more seriously wounded  were shipped back to England and then they vess eventually they went home or were taken care of there.

After the end of the war I was transferred to an intellig ence operation in Austria  and when time came to leave the army I was not an ideal soldier.
They all claimed to have been survivors of the war and all were damaged by the war and all were both deaf and dumb.
You see we did not know whether the war was ending  where the positions of the armies were.
In the beginning yes  but then when in 41 the U.S. entered the war  even postal communication was difficult.
One of the things  of course  your money was in Holland but the Nazis were not allo wed -- remember  this is before the war formally began in September 1939.
I would like to bring to the attention of my listeners  my future listeners  that in 1988  so many years after the war  we went to see the concentration camps in Poland  and we also stopped at Babi Yar in Kiev.
After the war  we will then see what we can do.ﬂ So -- but we had trouble  too  with Platon.
You see  Kosovo -- I dont know if you recall from history  the historical thing  in the -- 1480  I believe  the Turks massacred  you know  the Serbs in Kosovo  and they won the war  and they were sit ting then on yugosla -- on Serbia for 500 years.
Well  you know  for many  many years after the war  I was always dreams.
NORMA SCHNEIDERMAN September 21  1994 01:00:34 Ok  I need you to tell me your name as it was during the war years  the town you were born in and the year.
But I didn't  I couldn't because he was accused in Austria and convicted of war crimes against Aust rian refugees but he was also in Holland responsible for the deportatio n of Anne Frank  who  my real desire  but without him the whole thing wouldn't have worked.
So your family life and your family before the war  you told me a significant story that your mother shared with you along the lines of someone saying one day  well  today you now speak Yugoslavian.
It became more and more important later on towards the end of the war  you know  when we were all in the same boat  you see  where we were all living underground after having been liquidated by the Nazis.
And my in-laws gave us a lot on which the two boys -- they had two sons -- should build for themself modern homes as the war comes to an end  and again it's a possibility which we could comfortably wait out in my parents' house.
A bet for a quart of strawberries and cream to be payable after the war.
And as fate has tha -- an-and justice not  we -- presumably one of the reasons that the United States of America went to war against Hitler was about the horror that he was committing against the Jews.
Going back to the stadium at Nuremberg  going back to everything they ever built  which was always larger than the person  ev erything that Speer desi gned  which was going to be in Berlin  right after German y won the war was on a scale that belies imagination.

One of the people who survived the war  was Mr. Ignatz Horvald  who was married to a Gentile woman  and he was  at that time  when the war broke out  he must have been in the late 60s or early 70s and somehow the Germans didnt even intern him  at the end of the war  what they did to every other member of a mixed marriage.
She lived in Siberia till the war finished  she lived there.
But people were probably more conscious with the fact that this was another devastating war that was going to take place.
Did your father fight in the war  in World War I?
The prisoners of war was over 2 500  so you can imagine what the situation was like.
Before the war  before I came to Sobib or   I worked with a farmer  and um  so I thought I will go back in this direction.
And but during the war years  I remember a few points where my mother ha d the most difficult hardships.
Next time  start to write again  I wrote all the time  in the forest  in piece of paper and gi ve it to farmers and after the war I collected about 40 percent.
But the things Switzerland did after the war  with the gold  and not paying out the moneys that people were entitled to and denying them what was rightfully theirs  this is what I resent.

Well  there was only train going to the French border because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that.
BRENDA SZYR SENDERS June 20  1991 01:01:32 Tell me  Brenda  just a little bit about your life before the war  before '39 when the trouble started.
And when my wife picked me up from Fort Mead   she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for me.
Anyhow  I woke up the next day in a field hospital  believe it or not  a German  wounded German prisoner of war was lying next to me.
And also  he had been a drafted in the tsarist army  but he wasnt fighting in first World War?
Because up until that time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in East Prussia at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with.
When we went down from where we were hidden  the war was over.
And I told them very freely and o-openly where I came from  what I had experienced  the war  and so forth and so on.
He said that is that priest who fought us during the war.
We went through the war and now Im not going to see her any more if I dont go now.
Do you realize that if Hitler had won that war and become what he wanted to be  the thousands [indecipherable] encompassing the whole world  that we wouldnt be sitting here  talking?
And then the war ended in May 1945  ended in Europe with Germany's surrender.
Well  talking about the war brings a lot of bad memories  and a lot of heartache.
And the reason I'm saying this  because when the war started  Germany attacked Poland from the west.
Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 142 when the war ended  and you know when the punishment for being in Paris on eight of May 45  and you were in American uniform  and you walked down the Champs Elysee   I got caught in a its just funny I got caught in a circle of French women  with a lieutenant colonel of the air force  who was 23 years old  and the two of us could only escape after we kissed them all.
Yeah  and he used to tell us all the time  he used to go to the church and there you listen to the people what they saying  that it's going to be the end of the war  soon  soon it's going to be the end.
Everything was still  you know  ...uh...from the war  we ride in open trains you know  on those hiding out and so we got to..uh...Krak...Krakau.
And it was a army barracks from the French army from years ago  from the second World War.
And did the war -- did World Wa r II seem closer in time to you there than it did -- Yes -- -- when you were here -- -- much closer. --
And -- but he also seemed to indicate that he knew the times we were living in  and he -- we were just fortunate in running in -- ther -- there were people like that throughout the history of World War II.
I suppose you were aware of the fact that America had entered into the war?
And so my father helped her  of Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 53course; after the war they sent her money.
So  I dont know if they knew them before the war  or if they became friends after the war.

I know what he did after the war  I know they were hidden with different families.
They wound up for the better part of the war with a couple.
As it happened  that part of Latvia remained under German rule until the end of the war.
We had everything  so we were properly spoiled because of that  but thisuntil '39 and the war  the PoleGerman war started.
It took me a long time to forget that the war is over  and I tried always to remind me  Sam  the war is over.
There's no...We're very lucky that the war came to an end.
We put him into the the mattress  covered him with straw and when the selection went on   somebody else went from for him and uh uh when they also checked the the th e barracks  didn't find him in the in the in the mattress  so he luckily survived and he survived al so the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he uh died in New York at the blessed age of ninety-two.
Now  that wasnt during during the war  because I had not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet  and I I didnt know about that.
did you and after having served in combat did your attitudes about the war change at all?
The went to universities in England during the war  and everybody had a dream to leave Lithuania and go someplace.
So  he survived the war  I guess  that uh sort of they forgot about it and I think he went back home after a couple of months  but he stayed with us for quite a while.
And uh  during the the end of the war  through her we find a lot of information.
The war and increasing restrictions made life for juice in Hungary increasingly difficult.
It had it had Polish Christian workers who were working forced labor on German farms during the war  who were also mixed into this mix.
I and my mother  we shared a room with a neighbor of ours who...uh–was...we were close before the war and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband  and her daughter  who was my brother's age and I think they were frie nds...uh...had a room that they acquired somehow from some relatives or friends in one of t hose houses  and they took us in and we...shared one room  the four of us.
So um  she was gone  but I went to her with my daughter after the war  was one of my first visits to  to go there with the train and visit  and um  the first thing she said  \ I'm sorry  but the Ge rmans told me I could use all your things \  that means um  bedding and uh  uh blankets and uh everything we left there  beca use we went without anything.
However  once I met my husband and we were ma rried  I was able to become an American citizen because my husband was in the American army during the war  and I became a citizen within the first year of our marriage  and I w ould not change that for anything in the world.
And you stayed with them until the end of the war?
And I said I'm sure the war will be over in less than a year  and Suzie said no  we're not going to make it.
And as a physician  my father was a lieutenant during World War   so after five days he came home.
And -- and this is true  I -- I would  with frequency  stop by the public library branch near my junior high school  all the way down on 178th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue  quite a bit out of our neighborhood  to look at Holocaust and World War history books.
In fact  when my brother and I came to the the U.S. after the war  it was only German.
And but when the war  we started moving from ghetto to ghetto  he took the birth certificate out you know when they started moving us around.
It was already before the war...I mean...yes  before the war it was a million people.
Uh we were the first and only Jews  about two hundred and fifty of us and that camp was attached to a factory in which they manufactured the casings for bombs and therefore there was a need for lathe operators and all that stuff and it was one of those...as as the war was going on  the time was passing  conditions were getting worse and worse.
And before the war started I had been involved somewh at with the Quakers and their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War.
Later told me Dorothy after -- my sister after the war.
So its for many years later about two years later they would the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial  and I participated in that one.
I just remember him saying  when he came home from the war  he went on a motorcycle  and he had a bad experience.
Before we talk about you coming to the states  talk about that period before the war ended.
Uh let me ask you about what happened when the war ended...and how did you know?
I -- I remember I -- just after the war I went with two friends on a cycle tour in Holland  and we came in the middle of Holland with all farmers country.
Yes  yes because I know he sent letters some  after the war.
Of course  we had no after the war we had so little  and we  as a family  had more.
So it was a [indecipherable] pleasant  but mostly Americans were telling us  how is it in the war?
Did they talk about the war  about Hitler  about the Nazis?
I still am in debt to you.ﬂ And then  also a -- I would like to tell that after the war  when we met and we got married  we got married under our re al name  but not officially.
The second is the negotiations which I mentioned before with and certainly contributed to to help prevent the extermina tion of the people who were still in the camps at the end of the war  but apart from this  the attitude of the Red cross was uh not very helpful  and not very uh courageous.
Tell us 24 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD about the end of the war for you.
The preparation before the war  as I mentioned about the dam and the mobilization it started already  in early '39.
When we came out  there was a realization that we had war and that Germany has attacked Poland.
Until 1939  let -- Q. I just want to ask you a little more about your family life before we go on to the war.
But so this this is before the war started  that you got here?
They got good pay  they received good food  add ..adequate housing  and they worked in the war effort.
And when I came back after the war  suddenly the door shrank. [
Is that that when were talking about those war crime trials  and what you mean is trials that took place within the camp of Dachau   for the camp of Dachau .
Well my  the  the greatest influence of my war experience certain ly is to apply for the job at the Holocaust Memorial Museum.
You know  when Vietnam war first started  when it when it was first started in the 60s  late 60s  I was for it.
Some of the girls stayed in England when the war was over  and others went to different parts of the world.
Well  of course  food in th -- probably the worst part of that entire war experience was the last six - nine months   where we had no food.
What -- what I was saying wa s that in some cases the children and -- and possibly even the spouse  particularly if the subject met the spouse after th e war  or met her here in the United States  they have no clue that subject X -- that husb and and father X was a concentration camp guard  or was a shooter in a -- in a police squad in the east.
We didnt know what war means  but we when we heard the bombs flying and when we heard that people got killed  we got scared.
So so he he felt that his father having been a veteran of the World War I  and decorated and you know  au Austrian c itizen to begin with  whereas my parents were naturalized.
S-So  when you started to learn about what had happened  and the scale of the killings that -- the murders that had taken place  after the war  do you remember the -- how you learned about that  and the effect that it had on you then?
This is tape number one  side A. Okay  even though  in the first interview that the Holocaust Museum did w ith you  we got a pretty good sense of your Holocaust era experiences  lets go back to before the war and just pick up on some things and clarify some things that -- that -- that we could get some more detail on  before going on to post-war experiences.
During the war when you would see a German soldier  was that a frightening sight for you?
The war had st arted and they wouldnt let the boat continue.
I think they were  in -- in the aftermath  they were the most decent ones of all -- of all the nations who were involved in the war and took advantage of the superiority of the German army  o-of the -- of the -- the German government.
And as time progresses  which is again very  t-to me  of gr eat interest  the interest in the Holocaust  and you know  history per se  you know  about World War II  the interest by young people increases every year.
There was still  you 30 see when the war ended  there was such a  there was such a  a  thrust by the Germans  the young Germans  to poison the minds of the American soldiers.
The war they had some feeling about some kind of Disaster  yeah.
No  only my grandfather on my fathers side who of course died before the war did observe the Sabbath and that was about it.
In the fifth grade  my grades were not good enough because the war broke out so I couldn't continue any more.
I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the Ghetto  tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe.
They knew the peasants from before the war  they dealt with one another  although not always -- sometimes the peasants forgot all the [indecipherable] sometimes  in most cases.
So then in -- and after the war  when my uncle  my only unc le what I had the [indecipherable] was not a real uncle  was a second cousin  was a cousin from my father -- from my mother.

What was it that -- that made you realize the war was ending soon?
How do you think your efforts of -- of doing what you had to do  you know  using your wits  using fear  using whatever motiva ting factor you had during the war to -- to survive.

Of the four young women  she was the only one to survive the war. (
And there were -- the guy who was -- was checking on the sentries  he grabbed on my -- on my -- on my gun -- he -- he -- he grabbed the gun and you know  he had the right to kill me right there and then because this is -- this is a war  its not -- its not no -- no nonsense.

I  as a matter of fact I enlisted beca use  there was a war  they were beginning to draft people  my father had spen t  I guess a year and a half or so in World War 1 as an infantryman.
But uh right smack after the war you see  I mean not even after the war because the rest of Holland wasn't liberated  some very bad things started to happen.
So what did  I mean youre a little girl still  what did that mean that the war is over?
And I just remember we went to  to the house we had my father had bought before the war.
Well  my father ba at that point  the only way he could survive after losing the thing in the bank  was to apply to the post office for a job  wh ich  he took the test  but because he was a veteran of World War I  they gave him extr a points so that he he was one of the chosen.
They were they in the process of divorce before the war?
And she returned to her native Italy after the war -- which was devastated.
When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody else in town  and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes.
You must have had -- any kind of war mu st have brought out some strong feelings in you  I would think.
But it still  from what I understand  the Germans  when talking about the September war  1939 war  in their reports said that some of the bravery was enviable  about Poles before they died  or before they had to leave the post  or so mething.
But it didn't last too long  because the Germans  the Russians decided to give Vilno back to the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians always claimed that Vilno was the capital city of Lithuania and the Polish government took [it] away from Lithuania in the 1st World War.
And some of them survived the war  and quite a few of them perished during the war.
And they have been my father spent the war in the Soviet Union.
And a man came along and shoved her into the gutter and said to her apparently so you old Jewess  you survived the war  well get you yet.
Because -- and how long for a survivor  where I starved  where I got boils  because after the war  I didnt have cultume enough  and everything.
The Germans uh had...I guess there was some sort of an organization that was uh formed from the Jews or appointed as a leader of the Jews and the the intermediary between the German command and the Jewish community where the Jewish community was taxed because I remember having to give up some valuables to help with the war effort.
But eventually  towards the time close before the outbreak of war  only the main store remained functional.
just after school  10 12 ye ars old and when war came in  they had a middle class position and I was born in '29  th en I had a brother  a sister born in '31 and a brother born in '33.
I showed Bill a portrait he took of my mother after the war.
And so that thats what it sounded  but I dont remember there were no acts of war in the city itself.
We did stay there until the end of the war  because my mother always told them that she did not want to be separated from her children.
And we were sitting at the table  and talking about the war and everything with some of my sister's friends.
And that  to us  we were beginning to feel that the war  that we were maybe winning.
And as a matter of fact  he was also one of the victims  but of another in Vicovnya   which recently was opened up on the Russian  near Kiev  that it was the prisoners  who were not prisoners of war  but prisoners who were taken to full prisons.

But we wanted to go home  we didn't want to stay there.
And then I suppose I made  well  somebodys desc ribed me as having made a moral argument  which may or ma y not have had some kind of ef fect  that not only are we entitled to this legally  but theres a moral obligation on the part of Switzerland because Switzerland  well  they allegedly armed themselves to resist any aggression if it should come and did not bear any of th e real costs of the war and al l sorts of other people did.
But he saved my sister dur ing the war  my sister dur ing the war.
In the time before the war broke out  what did your parents think about everything that was going on; do you remember their talking about the Antisemitism?

So a-and in World War II  of course  theyd been in the war for three years before we came in  or almost three years.
And they were only killed in 44  about three months before the end of the war in that part of Poland.
So I spent two years there and then I enlisted at age 19  just going on 20  because everybody was doing that and it was  as we now would call it  it was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the the Jewish people would talk about a lot in the prairies.

It was in no way organized with a plan for the future  even  because the war was now turning  you know  the war effort of the Allies was now taking shape.
I said  ﬁI just coul dn't carry it.ﬂ I mean  that's how people trivialized the war.
And then a historical pattern of extreme anti -Semitism  then youve got this great combination that when things go bad  as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation  well  first the defeat for Germany in World War I which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then  this  this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people.
You see  after the war  I suppose  the Americans realized a) they might have done more before the war  and b) they had money.

>> Warren Marcus: So I understand  the sister already here  are you saying did she have any idea what was happening during the war  to the rest of the family?
I had one scholarship in Chichester and decided that I wanted to go to secretarial school beca use I was very much aware of the fact that I was being supported by people who were not my parents  and I also felt that if my parents were saved after the war  I would want to have a profession to look after them.

I lived -- Dont forget  I was born in a -- during the first World War  thats 83 years ago.
Was there an announcement that the Romanian army is going to -- Yes  there was an announcement  yes  yes  yeah  yeah  there was a big announcement  very dramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall Antonescu  was broadcast all over when it 37 happened  on the radio  on the  you know  public speakers and so on  everybody heard it  and the war started  the -- before that  the town was al ready full of military  it was obvious to everybody  imminent that something will start sooner or later because the city of Iasi was at 19 kilometers  which is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia  which by now was Russia already.
And anyway  many  many weeks it took before we could take the Du cla pass and then  then we were  we ended the war  the war was at an end when we liberated Prague.
But I was already out of the war for several months at this point.
My maternal grandfather died at 55  although my grandmother  interestingly sur -- not only survived the war  but managed to escape with us   and lived to 96  in New York.
And -- and they -- and I used to smoke cigarettes after the war -- in -- before the war  and after I was 16  and I smoked cigarettes at home.
And here too  they had announcement of things that happened in the Jewish immigrant community   and people -- also after the war -- I want to go ahead on that now  when people came over from the camps  they would have long lists of newcomers  where relatives could meet again.
Do you have any special kind of dreams  or have your dreams changed since the war time?
My anger lasted even after th e war when I came to the United States.
Unfortunately  or fortunately  whichever  I was still not a citizen  and even though my commanding officer did his utmost to take me along  the war de partment -- at that time war department would not allow me to go because it was too dangerous if I were captured as a -- I was still  more or less I -- an Austrian  or an enemy  anyway.
But the Germans came already  and every day was a different war.
We arrived at the railroad station which was close to c -- the camp  which was called Conde Gurs  which incidentally was built by the Spanish when the Spanish Republicans lost the war in -- the civil war in Spain and came across the border.
And we were in Zbaszyn until six weeks before the war broke out.
40 Yeah  but you see  what happened was  it wasnt a war.
3 >> Bill Benson: Dora  you were just 3 years old when World War II came directly to Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941 when it was attacked by Germany.
For reasons I cannot explain  the German government accepted these certificates as proof of our being displaced persons during the war.
The German prisoners that were across from us were prisoners from before the war.
He and I were the only ones who survived the war.
Tool makers and whatever other tools th ey had that came in handy for the war effort and for that reason I be lieve that they had preferred treat ment at work.
Don't do that or they'r e expecting so  and this was the man that we wrote after the...after the war  let us to the German courts th at they should not shoot him.
After I found out that my parents had survived I moved heaven and earth to get over to Germany to help them after the war.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 45 So  this was hi his death came after the beginning of the war?
But after the war  you know  you are going back  you are trying to determine in your own mind what happened.
Did do you have memories of going to school before the war?
Informati onally  as another one of the homogenizing elements in my life  at Penn State  it be ing a land grant institution  it required all freshmen  and sophomore men to participate in reserve officers training program  ROTC  in World War two uniforms.
No  no  no  Im not talking about those who were murdered  Im talking about the town before World War II  or the village before World War II  about how large was it?
They were marched   whatever happened to them after the war .
The 1st of September was the first day of war  and I remember there are certain moments that are crystallized in your memory.
And because they were part of the underground  after the war they were able to find me.
Before the war  it was a big place like near there  and they used to keep bread  bread and bagels  all kinds of things in a big box  like a very big box  like this  a big box.
And below is the -- are the names of his two sons who died in the wa -- in the first World War.
The Winnipeg was sunk during World War II  in in the Atlantic   when it was working for the allies.
We arrived in that town shortly after the war star ted.
So when -- when the war was over and you were now in 1945 -- 1944 -- 15. --
They were so gullible probabl y  and they believed that another few months  another few months everything will come back to normal so we shouldn't lose time and we should be tutored privately so we can attend school after the war is over and everything comes back to normal.
Did they try to escape Warsaw  or No  when my mother my mother my mother before the war was always advising to leave to South America  because a cous my ma my my my grandma cousin  first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well.
We met in 1950  and Victor went to the army in the meanwhile  because it was the Korean war  a nd I was at Indiana University  completing my degree  and when I got back  and Victor was just honorably discharged from the army  we got married  which was the right thing to do. [
My mother neve r became an American citizen because of involvement in properties in Poland  but she came to visit h-- us in 1938  and when the war broke out  she got stuck.
Was there talk about war  about Germany attacking Poland in 38 - 39?
My  you know that's  th is was months times and I really coul dn't tell you  but I know I came to Barrie in '45  my father left I think  end of '44 and I left '45  in the beginning of '45 and I was brought in that camp  transit camp from the English and I remember  wasn't that the time when the war was finished?
Because World War I stopped in 18  what was an an -and then before so  a year before  his nationality was Austro-Hungarian.
So he was between them  and he was a POW  a prisoner of war.
So we were there  I don't know how long I was still there  and the war was coming to an end.
So that until you became involved in the war cr imes trials  your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then?
And they promise them at the end of the victorious war  of course  they will be put in place and manage these industries for the SS.
So it was a matter of getting enough to eat when the war started   because we didnt get ration cards.
And there is this little tiny face  as I say  just swathed in this enormous U.S. Navy surplus sweater  and -- I mean  there was th -- there was nothing in Amsterdam when the war ended  you know  th-the re was nothing for those stores  there was no clothing  there was -- I dont even know how the hospitals operated.
We e nded up we ended up in Trier and thats where I was registered as a prisoner of war.
>> Bill Benson: During that time  before the war began in September 1939  had your parents been able to be in touch with family members in Germany either in Palestine or in the United States?
8 I myself...the the Congress...the World C ongress office in Geneva has uh during the war sent hundreds of thousands of of parcels  uh mostly from Portugal  small parcels but uh which certainly have have helped thousands and thousands of people to survive.
That was Munich  and in August 39  the war was declared  so we had been married exactly 5 years then.
We were already better off than the -- than the Soviet prisoners of war.
I did not immediatel y see any ruins  but as the Germans were moving closer  they occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war.
Anyway -- and the result of this is  although he never  ever worked on arms  that th e Belgians say you get capital punishment if you ever come to Belgium after the war.
Plenty of food we had already there  and this was the best conditions in the war since the war started.
It was their work  and as they cleaned up in the war  they were assigned to it.
One of the most the things I remember most distinctly  and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming interested in history and politics and so on  cause I remember when when the German Russian non-aggression pact was signed  I prin I announced that this means ya war in Europe .
She had one five dollar bill from bef ore the war which she kept through the worst of all possible times.
Cold War and Im just wondering how you saw th at and then also I know there were so many issues going on about civil rights for African-Ame ricans.
So clearly thats Augusta Levy after the war  and now well see a larger picture of the store.
We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were and respected before the war  the Lithuanian army who really directed most of these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free  but they didn't.
Th eres a whole book on it by a gentleman by the name of Rukerle  who was -- who was in charge of keeping track of these war crimes trials.
You but you s you did say someth ing  that you thought the war influenced you even to become a doctor.
He said try...he said I know  and we informed of that  that amongst these British prisoners of war  there is a system that every month or every second month  every third month  one of them...it's like a military action  has to try to esca pe to make his way into Switzerland  and there he is bringing news and information about about the life.... END OF TAPE 4
My little set-to with DuBois about von der Hyde and Haberland62 pales into nothingness against the totality of Joe DuBois's contribution that I know of  to the good part of the war effort an d Nuremberg.

This is tape number three  side B. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 86 The soldier whom we met in the train  coming out of Germany  I mean af -- when the war ended  who happened to be a Jew -- a Jew in Russian uniform and who asked us on the train where it was we were planning to go to -- in Poland and we told him that were going home to Starachowice and he asked us wh at size town it was.
A. I think that the Jewish men of the of the Jewish section used to spend most of their day playing cards and exchanging stories and trying to outguess the political situation and trying to guess when the war w ill end.
And I knew Lodz  Lodz the city  and I had many friends there before the war but who knows where or what.
Before we turn to the war years  tell us what your family's life was like  what yo ur life was like  in those years before the war began.
And for most people  probably  I mean you cant  I havent tried it  but any time you would talk to any German about it then they would immediately tell you how bad it was during the war with ration cards and bombs falling on your head and all that and people tell you how bad it was to shut you up.
Which in a way  the fact that it was all farmland saved us to some extent during the war in that we did not starve at any point.
Well  if the people would have done that  would have de-registered in Berlin  they would immedi ately have lost their apartments since as a result of the air raids many people lost thei r apartments and there was practically no new building going on because of wartime conditions and all of the raw material and labor were really put into the war effort to build tanks  planes and whatever else was needed.
What we were just talking about  obviousl y  there's frustration in your voice about the situation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year after the end of the war  a year after liberation  that people were living in very cramped quarters  that had echoes of concentration camps obviously they were worse.
The war started in 1941  22 nd June  the Germans began to surround our Leningrad.
But it is part of  at the same time  a feeling that we had to achieve  because if anything happened to my father and mother  there we were  at least until after the war  and not immediately after the war  but when things started getting put back together again.
Well  after war broke out  and -- well  the first year people still went to Shanghai  and there was still some immigration.

Yeah  you know  I was a part of it  but I was small -- no  y -- I was too young  and we were only like some  you know  listen to some news fr om Russia  whats going on in the front  how the Germans are already retreating  and to enc ourage people that soon  soon  soon  that will be the end of the war  and th -- you know  so we were listening to the news  writing down and then giving it to read for people  and so this was not exactly a big job  and -- But you did that?
We found out later  after the war  that very early in the morning the Hungarian Nazis ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VER BATIM RECORD 22 came and collected the people  among them my grandmother and her two sisters  and Mr. Varga  as I mentioned  who knew the family  called an uncle  my mother's uncle  who was already in what they called an international ghetto.
So I assume obviously she would have found - there were all these organizations after the war  all these Jewish and non -Jewish organizations tracking down people.
After the war  particularly  it was so many Russian film s  you know  coming  but I always went  went to see films.

My two aunts  one from Warsaw  one from Krakow  came to our area  to our house in 1939  when the war broke out because they were more afraid of the German occupation than the Russian occupation.
That was the most noticeable part  and this -- listening to these comments of -- theyre coming  theyre not  theyre further away  closer by  and judging of a sort  I got a sense that -- wh -- since I then knew right -- it was a war  everything else  that this war is now reaching a different 52 stage.

What was about her was self preservation  I mean that's how she survived the war  I mean by having others killed.
We had a bookkeeper who survived the war  we had my brother-in-law  my older sisters  her husband later joined and he had the pr esentation of chandeliers and enamel bath tubs.
Now  by 1943 even the high command of the Germans knew that the war was lost.
Where we were occupati on took place  they occupied all Poland  and 41 [indecipherable] is sort of coming with the idea we should go east because the war  she says a lot of people went to the east [indecipherable] Russia  took half of part of Poland  and so you figured for the time being  til they -- til they have to pull out -- back  we will stay in -- and my mother there agreed with me  she says  go.
My wife tells me that during the war  we're the same age  there were rationing  certain things here  butter was restricted  gasoline was restricted.
So we to ok and started walking because  you know  the war you no have cars  you no have nothing.

Russians are really literally on the outskirts  the allies are sweeping through Europe  the war is essentially over  and here's this concentrated effort again to exterminate the Jews of Hungary.
But to me she is that child  that beautiful 13 year old lean child who evidently knew nothing but fear and love in her - this enormous love for the family and this fear of what Hitler's era did to her and the war came.
And and tw o prisoners fell in love with my aunts  and they married my aunts  and when the revolution of Russia started  the war with the Interview with A. Zalc  L. Ragin  J. Mizrachi July 23  2009 5Germans and Russians stopped  because the Germans made the Russian revolution  I dont know if you know th at  yeah.
I mean  if you can imagine how eager I had been before the war started  to go to school  to have a life and so forth and so on  and now I come through this period of intense confinement and containment and -- and life picks up again  and I can wave the flag and I can put the picture of Queen Wilhemina over my bed -- which I also brought to America and also had over my bed in Rochester  New Yo rk.
And he asked me another question  \ Did you men during the war--after you left the camp  or after the war  or even at home--talk about these terrible camps and these horrors that you saw?\
I never saw  before the war  my mother with a gun.
So your uncle who was in Holland stayed there  he didnt No  he he passed away before the war  he was sickly and after we left  he went downhill real fast  and in fact we were in the United States only about two months when my mother got word that he passed away.
Like  in Manchester weve got some members and of -- weve got a lot of members that were then in Israel are now -- that wer -- are now in Israel were originally in England  and some of them -- in 1948  or 47 and 48  they decided to go and fight in the War of Independence when the state of Israel was born.
They didn't have to go in the  in the war  fighting on th e front when they went to a concentration camp  so they went by themselves to the SS.
Now  during the war  lo -- you have to be in some way -- you have to use the authorities of German  and therefore I -- I will mention for you who I was.
And and a thing Interview with Jan Hieminga August 9  2016 53 This is after the war is over?
We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I  immediately  and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia  and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia.
And we picked him up and you can imagine  you know  you loose a person...this was already uh how long the war was...I don't know  three months  four months...I didn't keep count...and to meet a person that you left   you know.
So  we were waiting because then  after few weeks after the war  I was waiting  I went back to Michalovce  and was looking.
And so when war ended  really  we moved to siles -- lower Silesia  which was Germ an territory once. [
That was a very popular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad.
And but I have a feeling that my au nt who was an adult  she had been married before the war  she had two children  she may have had so me money with her already.
We were just talking about how -- what your familys religion was before the war.
Interview with Fred Firnbacher September 16  2010 31 That was confiscated by the Nazis  my grandmother had to sign it over  and after the war  we did get some restitution for it.
That morning was the first time -- my mother was dressing me to go to synagog ue  the first time since before the war.
He promised he will marry her after the war  but after the war he changed his mind  but he - he wanted to pay them back for what they did for him.
But at the end of the war  there was no one left but I. I know that because we have decided that whoever survives wherever  our contact is people we know  distant relatives in Palestine at that time Palestine  Erat Israel  and there was no one appeared RG-50.030*0580 4except myself.
I remember once he was saying  you know  wh-when the war is over  when I going to go home  what I gonna told USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 37Julians mother how Julian died  you know ?
And they said  \ We don't have food.ﬂ They said  \ Good.ﬂ They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war  the whole thousand.
I lived with them briefly when up until the time that war broke out  and then I was moved  as I said  to to this community up in in northern England .
I was in my village  listening to a crystal radio and I thought  ﬁWell  its inevitable  the war is co war is coming and well have to fight.ﬂ I was too young to to be conscripted.
Which were a salvation  because since that time  I did not read a single book during the war.
So  when you were with these folks  you never talked about the war?
Anyhow  he wound up in the French Foreign Legion and spent World War II in N orth Africa with the French Foreign Legion.
I wasnt born then  but she came and must have been in the -- after the -- I think after the second World War -- the first World War.
Baroness Von   I think she was a Baroness  she came to Dachau and asked me if I would go she said her husband had requested that I come down and see him at Landsberg prison  that he had been convicted by a war crimes court in China and this really piqued my curiosity because I was doing some writing anyhow about the various war crimes court  and I wanted to find out more about that  to that extent I wanted to talk with him.
And his brother -- Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 27I think there were about three or four of them  and it was the same business  and unfortunately during the war  many of them were bombed.
And the my father tried  of course  to the separation was supposed to be brief  but to bring us there  but war broke out in le-less than six months later and that that was the end of that for us.
And he found his mother 22 years after the war  my husband.
During the years  the first years in the 30s  and through the war years  was your fam ily following what was going on in Europe   at Interview with Henry Stern June 8  2016 47 Oh yes.
Unfortunately the grandmother  af ter whom I am named  Johanna  passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War.
I didn't know where my father was in France because he left Paris - he came to Nizza [Nice] and then he was in hiding for the rest of the war.
And the war wasn't over until May. So they looked at their watches -- they gave us a slab of bread.
And there I worked all the war until 1945  until I was called to the army.
One were the wa -- the soldiers in the first World War  the others were the Communists.
And of course the f -- the farther -- th-the longer those -- the war lasted  the more conspicuous were a young man of military age who were not in uniform .
When the war started  and my father wasn't there anymore  he used to come and buy from my mother.
And so it sounds like there was a real ef cause effect of what the war did  and their Yeah.
The men must go to Leningrad  go out from Leningrad  go out from Moscow  to go to the places because they must go to 15the war.
But if I talk about Sweden  I think we could have sort of brou ght out this to the public in  say  in 1943  when yo u could see that the war is not going to be won by the Germans  and after Stalingrad and all th at and so on.
There wasnt really that much to talk about either what you had done before the war  it was really mostly what -- what you gonna do from now on  when the wars over  when you get out.
That was -- all the people  both sides  were happ y to have Switzerland and Sweden because they could meet and they could -- sort of a country which was not involved in the war.
I was going steady with a girl  so war or no war  and maybe I was reckless  or I didnt realize what Im getting into it  but all these ordinance I took -- Ill say -- I say okay  I can live with that.
And when we returned–well  mobilization was fully on  and shortly afterwards  which was Friday  if I remember  September 1st  the war started.
It was in the last days of the war and people were shipped in from Auschwitz  from Riga  from all over the place on death marches.
I'm not sure most people would ma ke that connection unless they had your experience in the camps  that there was a kind of similar  I guess  brutality going on between treatment of people in the camps and what happened during the worst of the civil war in El Salvador.
So we decided that I'd go to Wash ington to look for Kilg ore documents because the people on that investigating committee were Justice people  Treasury people  War Department people a limited number.
You were just about to talk about going to Belgium right after the war  and ad -- looking for your family.
That time this was 1940  I think  when the Russian made a Hitler make a pact with Stalin  they not gonna go to war any more  they go not gonna fight.
Well  we had to wait til the war really ends  and for us it was terrible to think that already in October the allied forces were only 60 miles from The Hague  but they didnt come.
Now the higher headquarters have got to deci de what to do about war crimes trials.
But  Ill te ll you frankly  when there was talk about war  before the war broke out  and my parents said  ﬁOh  its going to be a horrible thing if there is a war because the fi rst war was so bad.ﬂ You know  they used to tell us about the first war.
So  because in the week that is the end of the war  we met in Kazakhstan.
You got drunk from the ether like when a sick person or something  they gave ether before the war.
It wasn't  it wasn't exactly what I thought a war would be.
Believe me  I knew I was Jewish  because there was some persecution in Poland too  after the war.
And when he went into the service too  he bought bonds  even he had allocation taken out of his pay  which was very moderate  and he was married at the time  and he had an allocation taken out in war in bonds bought for me.
An d we were not too much worried about Holland being becoming involved in the war because in the last war  that is  World War I  Holland was neutral.
Did you know  did you ha ve a sense Germany was losing the war when you were in the camps  could you tell what was going on with the war?
But as soon I joined the intelligence  they made me change names  and I chose the name of Lelotra because during the war  that's the name I used for my fiance to write to me.
This is a protected territory and we do our job for the government and leave us alone.ﬂ We confronted the man after the war.
So now the war is winding down and it sounds to me the -- the negative part was when the young -- young men ha d to leave to go to the internment camps.
As we draw the interview to a conclusion  if we can just go back now to the realization that you have  that the war was ending and... That was a...that was a...that was also very emotional moment  I'll tell you.
This was the beginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war.
I should sa y that Warsaw was before the war so beautiful that they called Warsaw the second Paris which people don't know about it.
Did you return to Brezany at the end of the war in 45?
I don't need the world to learn anything from the Second World War  from the Holocaust.
Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood memories before the war?
He was 15  before World W ar I. And World War I caught him.
Eight years before the war we built...over there wasn't...wasn't...uh..that you can...uh...uh..for...for th at you can pay off...only you had to have money to build so they put together penny to penny to be able to build a new home because the children started to grow up.
Bill Benson: Tell us about her -- at the end of the water  you were liberated in the summer of '44 but the war went on  of course  until May of '45.
You would think you gonna [indecipherable] suicide or anything other -- I didnt  I saw -- we get -- we must get married  we must have children  otherwise Hitl er has won the war.
And he was the oldest one  so he went to World War I. He was in the Army.
But I did not seek any contact with him after the war.
When the war came along  he continued in this work until Hitler called him down to (clearing throat) Berchtesgaden one time and told him that he wanted him to become the Gauleiter of Vienna...that he wasn't...hadn't been satisfied with the earlier leadership in Vienna  and he had alienated an awful lot of Austrians and wouldn't he accept that position.
But when World War II came along  they couldn't get sugar.
And while I have nothing against people studying the origins of World War I  having at one time myself thought of doing something on the diplomacy of the late 19 th century  that set the stage for the first World War  it seemed to me preposterous that nobody had done anything similar  seriously looking at the origins of World War II.
War  persecutions  ar e very often based on fear and it's very often a groundless fear.
Well  the best evidence is the fact that they got the presidential citation its either the presidential or war department sar citation  some call it presidential.
He knew the war was coming and so he didnt go.
And so by the time the war was over you were what  16?
And he wrote him as soon as the war broke out.
On my mothers side  the one brother escaped first to France   then he was underground for a number of years  came to the United States after the war.
Did you get any news of the war  the way th e war was -- was going  that the Russians were -- were coming?
I dont even know -- Did you talk about what you had experienced with these other children  during the war?
So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews  the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.
So they after the war they came to the United States ?
See  that was our thing what comes later  when the war broke out then  they brought forced labor in from the Ukraine   from Poland   from Holland   and theyre working there by the farmers  and and in the factories.
Belgium declared itself neutral  like in World War I  but in both cases Germany didn't expect that.
I believe one of the sayings were -- were -- were you -- you were convenien tly in London during the war while we were in the mountains.
You know  it came to me  you know  that was everything the war comes through up here all the time.
And this is [indecipherable] [indecipherable] he survived in Soviet Union  but he died later  young  he had a tumor in his head  so -- but I saw him after the war  in Israel.
When your father got back home  do you remember seeing him for the first time after the war?
And as soon as the war was over  he left Germany  he went to Holland  never ret well  he returned to visit his mother  etcetera  but he established his business and residence in Holland  became a Dutch citizen and he ended up saving the family.
And two weeks before the war ended somebo dy gave them out and they were all shot.
There -- there were lots of -- of changes  there was a lot of violence and turmoil in the war  and I -- i-in the world  excuse me  and Im sure that these things  given my mothers background  these -- these changes  it must -- must have in some way influenced her -- how -- how may we say it?
I was not with my parents ever again until after the war with my mother.
It was the war...the war was the end of the war.
Yes  Im curious about him because he really he got punished after the war.
Because if the war would end in a little bit maybe you will survive even there.
So  these people in obviously the war ends and life is hard as always.
So -- But what we wa nt to do today is talk about whats been happening to you since the war.
We didn't know what  we didn't have  talk about kids my age  you know  when the war started I was 12 years old  I didn't learn a trade or anything else  my way of thinking was completely distorted.
I was doing something that they didn't know of  something to help to dismantle the war machine in as little a way as I possibly could.
L et's start the conversation today with you telling us a little bit about your family  your community   and you before the war began.
They used to socialize  and then closer to the war  that dried out.

I didnt go into the prisoner of war  I just deserted from the Germans.
clothing  so they were sewing machine  and for those job women were hired  and women did that before the war  too.
But cernly all the money was owned in some respects  nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime  on the other hand  he was proud of the merit of the German troops  while my father  as an also World War One officer  all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union  because he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat.
I was living a fantasy  but I fanaticized before the war because I found it very  very exciting when they talked about when my moth er and father were for the first time in Paris in 1928 at Maximes when the dinners my parents attended in the private home  the private residence of my aunt in Berlin  for the diplomatic core  where Hindenburg would say to my aunt  ﬁYou are my Garbo.

There was a handful of Spaniards from the civil war  who the Germans captured somehow  one way or another from France  France turned them over to the Germans and there were Italians and there were a handful of Czechs and maybe one or two Greeks and that was it  so we were the first Jews in Mauthausen [not correct] and the first Jews in Ebensee and getting back to these building sections  when we finally reached the bottom one  under it was snow  in the middle of June.

So when youre growing up -- this is before the war -- Yeah. --
And then I started and when we got we got to Nuremberg  some more people came in and I was assigned a German refugee by the name of Norbert Heilpern He spoke very good German and a broken English  but he was...and incidently  he'd been a soldier in World War I on the German side  and so it was often interesting and he'd often put on a little act for us at parties we had where he'd play the Prussian soldier.
Mr. Funkin was a very well to do -- a Jewish family from before the war  and you know  Jews could not keep in Petersburg -- this is the capital of -- of Russia unless he was a -- big merchant.

As much as people didnt want to go war in America or Americans to go to war  people like my dad and at this point we too felt better get in there.
Some people had some ancient rifles from the First World War.
So their territory was pretty small  and the war start coming to an end very quickly.
No  we yeah  must have been in Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 53spring of 1941  because we were already there when the war broke out.
Then the war was over  and we came to the United States.
There was a great fashion at that time of heavy nets -- I think in the 40s they had them here too -- they were all different colors and you were wearing them like down from your head to cover your hair and they were like brown and gray and all kinds of colors; heavy  knit  made by han d. And these Jews had a factory some place before the War and they knew how to do it manually.
Yes  but not about the war  just about what his life was like Okay.
I was -- our company was doing some very precise and important war work  and I was a nighttime supervisor.
they immediately activated that  an-and they were trying to give some kind of a priority to produce the machinery of war.
And as I said  our luck was that my father was an officer in the first World War  and he had the Purple Cross  the German ahtler  and whe -- we were priv ileged to go to Theresienstadt.

This is tape one  side A. Mr. Lessing  were just going to go on and recap some of your experiences during the war  and if you want to just start talking about -- I di -- basically from the beginning of the German occ -- occupation in the Netherlands  when you went into hiding  and the [indecipherable] a short description of that time  and then well go into the postwar experiences.
For no reason they -- the war was almost on the way  you could see the war was on the way off.
the Vatican in my opinion  and there there are twelve or thir teen volumes of vatican documen ts what uh what they were doing l 53 during the War  I believe that the real problem in th e catastrophe of the...which happened to us was never taken seriously by the Vatican until the War was practically over  and I believe that there was no real realization in the highest uh levels of the Vatican bureaucracy  uh no real evaluation of the out...of of th e the the dimensions of the catastrophe  and I believe that the Vatican was better informed maybe than we believe.
Kielce was physically and emotionally devastated after the war  and on top of that the system was imposed on us that was against all the values of the society and that was a very bitter to swallow to learn the outcome of the Yalta agreement.
Bill Benson: When you were liberated  when you knew you were liberated and the war was over for you  your family and other Jews that had survived came under suspicion by the Soviets.
He had no idea what was meant by a war crime.
Then after a while  the people of the camp  we got them to go out to cut wood  the young people by telling them all sorts of lies about how they were going to learn how to use power saws  which they'll use in Palestine  God knows if they had trees there or not  and uh we promised them an extra reward of cigarettes  which we got out of the Red Cross packages for prisoners of war  which we had quite a bit.
and put there  and you know  I [indecipherable] because it was -- was the -- after the war.
But the kids  you know  my father was [indecipherable] he is sending his boys  his sons to learn whatever is needed to be learned  until the war broke out.
I mean  look at the people who landed up in Shanghai  before and during the war.
After th e war  well the reac tion of the Dutch people to the Germans was unbelievable.
But finally  in 47  he was in -- in charge of the economic affairs and war reparations  which in Japan and Thailand  nobody had been succe -- had succeeded in rearrange this thing because during the war Japan [indecipherable] occupy Indochina Interview with Thea Rips January 20  2004 43and Thailand and so on  they took away the gold and lot of money from the country  and -- and at the time Macarthur was in Japan  very much pro-Japanese  you know  and he was opposed to the fact that they was requested to return this material  this gold  this valuable s -- to the ca -- to -- to the Thailand .
I was told after the war that about 30 or 40 of them survived the ordeal of evacuation and death marches.
After I came -- after the war  after its -- everything was done -- after I came  I find out all about they made a -- like a tree from -- from a -- like a -- a tree -- like a -- a round -- a tree -- a round thing with one entrance.
From Vilna I gave her a...a document  and that she's an editor of a newspaper and I'm sending her to Rumania and with these papers she came to Rumania uninterrupted and from there she came to Israel and she gave a report to...to a high...to Ben Gurion  other people from Israel  and they have a very good information what was going on during the war in Vilna.
Also my husband lived befo re the war 20 years in Poland.
And one day I came from work going home  he was walking with his secretary and his secretary knew me because he used to work for my father before the war and I knew they were talking about me.
This my two brothers  my mother  and me when...this was be fore the war.
Always when I have a dream  its always a dream from home  before the war.
It could be that was also hearsay because  yes  people would expect that  judging by the first war.
Which had been a concentration camp for the Franco Civil War  he had his enemies there.
The Swiss government knew very well that there was no place for us to go until the end of the war  yet I  as an i mmigrant  had to have my visa or permit to stay in Switzerland renewed every six months and every six months  \ Why aren't you leaving?
When you moved across the border  yo -- well  you ended the war in Manchuria?
Just before the war ended was the first time I got a letter  where he wrote me how happy he was to find me  and described him his situation in Israel.
And then I went to -- I was sent to Europe to interrogate war prisoners.
I know after the war when I came to the city  to the house.
Didnt you hide some -- some folks during the civil war?
Well  the War of Independence in Israel was to this day the hardest and the bloodiest war in Israel   the hardest and the bloodiest and the longest.
When the war started  and then when you made that walk  you were going to go enlist to fight.
First time in '60 and then honeymoon in '64 and then in '86  and three months ago  I go again cause I have some -- I go to this man who save me in the War.
After the war  the Pagrachs came back to Dinksburlow to  they were in hiding.
So that you see  that's what we had to live with then after the war.
There I also remember the sirens they were more frequent occurrences as the war grew the sirens and the hum of the airplanes above and always an S.S. trooper standing in front of the barracks at the time  outside.
Frau Shermburg was the wife of a doctor whod been killed  and her son had been killed in the war.
And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds  either in Piedmont  or Lombardy  people who died in the war in 1848  in 1858 - 59.
Boy  he -- the war didnt take very long  so that was all over.
There was...at this point in the war  people tried to keep alive from bombings that were going on.
One afternoon  you now  if you ever worked for a foreign diplomatic place  you know that three o'clock in the afternoon they close  never mind the war or not  and at three o'clock there is this banging on this door outside.
Well  I had a very happy childhood  although I was born before the First World War.
which wa s the -- the capitol of th e providence where we -- where we crossed and there they were assaulting people of the Geneva convention says that a neutral nation has to turn the citizens of nations at war w ith each other.
The -- the point is that the people that I knew never  ever held it against me th at I repre -- I was representing some -- that this was a Cold War and I was representing any kind of Communist type of thing  because basically  i-if I may just venture a guess  the reason that the American government was interested in sending people in there  was to really determine  are they turning Communist or are they staying quietly   but -- but fighting it?
And incidentally  I had a similar encounter because not everybody in Britain was giving their best for the war effort obviously  but many did and many were very heroic.
Early in the war you and your family lived under Russian occupation.
T hen you were mobilized for the Six -D ay War.
In the other house lives his old mother  and he lives in the city  which I knew he lives in the city from before the war  but  so we went across  and we're went into the barn  we climbed up  and we laid on that loft upstairs  but nobody came.
After the war  we discovered that he led all the Communist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023 8 of an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk  which was about 10 - 15 miles from our farm.
And he -- so he -- this man and his mother somehow were hidden and they survived the war.
And that already Soviet prisoners are war -- of war are committing suicide to the left and to the right because they know that their fate is going straight to Siberia.
Or a man by the name of Kasztner--a lawyer  a Hungarian lawyer  who negotiated with uh Eichmann--who then immigrated to Israel after the war and was assassinated there by some people who thought...by a person who thought that he had done something that was inappropriate  or there was a collaborator.2 Those particular stories are well documented elsewhere.
It would have been suicidal for him to agree to such acts at the time when Hitler was already losing the War and he maintained diplomatic relations with  with the Soviet Union until the very last moment.
>> Bill Benson: So they throw him out of his job as a judge but give him a decoration for his First World War service.
And these Jews had all been coming in the '50s -- after the war -- and they didn't know.
And what happened was  uh my... They dealt a lot in those days to...uh you weren't able to buy food  things like that  right after the war.
And then the war came anyway  so she lived for 30 years with this gall bladder.
But  if I would go right after the war there  I would live there  I would get used to it  to th-this life  this kind of life.
I hate real war movies  like shooting and things like that.
And and the guy  when we once ask him why  he says  well  one day I may be a British prisoner of war  and well  anyhow.
And we of course have no idea how the war is progressing  or at least I dont.
Ive had the friendship of so many wond erful -- I discovered after the war that I was working with all the top people of the Committee of National Libera tion  who  in their turn  were so helpful to our work for Amnesty Internationa l development.
During the war did your parents ever talk about the political situation in Europe ?
Second time  when war was over and I came back to Warsaw and I found my wife   I decided to go first I went to Kielce back no  no  to Warsaw.
The truck just took off and they uh they beat her down to the ground  my mother and uh could do nothing and uh I can imagine uh after the war for all these years to have to live with such memories  what it means to uh to or to my father for that matter  that he couldn't uh that he couldn't protect my brother and that the uh guilt feeling  uh him feeling that uh he had uh taken my brother with him rather than having sent him with me uh and that in turn may make him feel guilty if uh if I was able to survive and uh if he had let my older brother go together with me that he maybe he would have survived too.
We entrusted them with several valuables because we thought that after the war we would be able to retrieve them.
Thousands...thousands of Russian people were waiting for their sons to come home from the war and meanwhile they were laying in that ditch.
70 -- six -- 67 was bad  that was during the war time.
And of course they took her to the clinic where the doctor was and the doctor confirmed -- I don't know how it works but he confirmed that she was infected and she was sick and she was put away to be seen only after the war.
And my husband and several -- and other people  the younger  the younger officers said this is ki -- the kind of war it cannot be won.
But I almost feel ashamed that I lived in a culture where coming back after such a horrible  horrible war  that our neighbors truly didnt want us.
First  let's begin with you telling us about your family  your community and yourself in the years before the war  then what happened when Germany attacked Poland.
Their children went to England   and one stayed in Holland   and was killed the last day of the war.
When the war brok e out  when you realized that America was entering the war  do were you drafted  did you volunteer?
After the war  as Julian didnt have anything else but one pa ir of pant and a shirt  and he was always a snappy dresser  he ask me to press his pants.
The reason is that basically they survived World War I  and while there were privations and problems  and several armies swept through Warsaw   the Prussians  the Austrians  the Russians and so on  basically civilians survived and were not considered combatants.
E asy to remember  the end of World War I and Veterans Day.
So  before the war started  did all three of you live in the same place; your mother  your father and yourself?
I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem when all of a sudden I  war would be overŠwe were always optimistsŠand I could go to  instead of the first form to the second form an d Latin would create the biggest problem.
I said  do you think now that you lost the war?
So we knew that this was going to be the end of the war.
They were spared in the town of ma -- Marmande   and two doors down was another Jewish family by the name of Alco  all of these were our friends after the war  and they were spared because they were French born.
What was my job there for the War Refugee Bo ard?
It was known from already before the war that he wasnt much in favor of them.
Now he can come and God but the..the...right now after the war he will come to convert us.
I said that  you know  Interview with Riane Gruss January 5  1996 98childrens stories usually start with once upon a time  our stories always started  after the war.
Eh there were there not not to far from from Nuremberg there was a very large of former Polish Prisoners of War.
They brought 10 -- at the foundry  before the war they made all of the locomotives for Poland.
And the war start  and there was in the beginning  the -- But before we go to the war Rachel  I just want to spend a little -- Yes? --
But one thing was certain: when the war was over and the people who survived from the community got together and they kind of gathered 51 all the information that was available  everybody knew that the transport from Starachowice wound up in Treblinka.
After about eight months in Portugal  where there were no ship tickets because it was war and there were sub marines in the Atlantic ocean.
Its for people like war killed  tue  blesse  fatigue  decede  provision.
One was in the 1922 and th en during the war he passed away in 1936.
But she had sort of protected me from various things that went on during the war.
found some airplanes while the war was still on  five days after we were liberated they came to this camp  dropped off bombs  five prisoners got killed by these bombs after the liberation.
They had she had survived the war too  and we were uh we were allowed to take  get our old get our old apartment back and uh just about at that time my mother  who was racked with pain all the time was no longer able to uh bear her pain and uh went to the doctor and was found to have uh bumps  lumps uh and she uh never really recovered.
End of Tape Four Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 104Beginning Tape Five Were you smoking before the war?
Okay  so aft during the second World War  Mr. Ronniker is still in a position some kind of position of authority.
How did you find out that that now that the war is here  on our doorstep?
Anised was a very  very right wing g roup of underground partisans in Poland in time of the war.
But we had not talked about leaving Poland before the war broke out.
>> Bill Benson: It wasn't too long after the war began  I think when you were 14  that you could no longer go to school.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 80 Well  you see  after the war -- oh -- oh  after the war was ended  theres -- there was so many widowers  so many invalid s  you know  people unable to work.
After the war I told you we were in this small town on the Elbe River  the Commandant made me a translator  you know.
Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8  2010 14 But they were all prisoners of war.
It was everything normal until one dayŠit was about the 7 th of May  7 th of May  yeahŠcame KGB and took us all  took us to a place where it was about a few thousand Russian former prisoners of war  that big villa with a big backyard.
So they gave him Turkish pris oners and German prisoners and Austrian prisoners from the first World War  and they used to work in the factory helping to smoke the fish.
So that before the war  Poland was at -- at the war with all its ne ighbors  no longer so.
Yeah  the war was still -- and -- and I had to yell USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078 111over  you know  hundreds of people to te ll them there was no Mario any more.
Actually  some of the buses  some of the cars were requisitioned by the army when the war started in 1939.
The war ha d been over for two days but this was still 64 unoccupied territory  and it was scary to -- to see this man still completely self confident  as if he were on top of the world.
Th at that territory had to be clean of all the Jews  which that territory which was expected to become Romanian in the event of the war ending with a German victory  should be clean of Jews.
But  I was not this kind of Germany  it was like after the war Germany.
So this was your business after the war  here in the United States .
There was priest there who taught us religion after the war.
I placed the baby at that time with them with the understanding that after the war somehow so mewhere I will get the baby.
I think they just thought it was Jewish -- Jewish and -- Jewish connotation  I think  even -- even while the war was right there  still hot.
Was your fi -- did your father go to war in 1918 -- 1914  or not?
And uh when the war broke out... Before the war  tell me about the memories you have of your family before the war.
During the war  two of my husband's sist ers were accepted to medical scho ol.
Not onl y that  some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had  during the war  connections with the British.
You don't see any single person  and curfew was on till the end of the war.
During the war he -- he -- we -- we had everything.
What I remember -- I think I was either 16 or 17 -- the war was over in 45  so I was 16  and at that time -- and came here when I was 17  so when we left Kenya  someone gave my father a book of pictur es of the camps.
So Hungary declar ed war against the United States and there was no American consulate because we were allies of Hitler.

If she -- my mother -- if she thought differently  I --I never heard  she just -- she went through one World -- the first World War.
I condemn for what happened during the war and the immediate post-war period  and I praise this country for the period since then.
So it was --the war was winding down-it was still very heavy fighting  but we were advancing constantly  and we were --so we had to move frequently  very frequently  a nd it was --I don't know how many times we moved  but it was --we'd always set up our tents in a field unless there might be a building handy that --that we co uld set up in which would be a --a real help for a hospital because I remember  you know  a dog could wander through the operating room in the tents  and that's just the way it was.

They kn ew they existed  but I did  after the war  spend a short time at Dachau interrogating guards and people there  and it looked just like those pictures that you've seen.
Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17  2001 31 There are some things that happened in this country  a-after the war -- you know  in years since the war.
How we got there And so now the war is over?
So the war started after your sixth birthday  right after your sixth bir No after  before my sixth birthday.
When you were in tight s pots during the war  did you pray?
And I felt very strongly  well I wasn't the only one  this mistake had to be corrected after World War II.
He knew that war was inevitable and by the time -- so Germany invaded Poland  we were already in this house in the country.
My sister did not want them to know about the war  about our experien ces  she wanted them to be normal American children and this really didn't always work  b ecause it wasn't easy to be her child  as I found out.
Im wondering if there are things politically around -- either in this country or around the world  that have happened since you came he re  that have resonated particularly with your experience during the war?
We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945.
And when the war started  there were no more letters from my parents  though -- the contact between Germany and England  there were no mail -- there was not the usual mail service  was completely stopped.
I think the second World War did not do the so much damage to the world than it did to the Jewish people.
At the beginning of World War II  he lost his son.
Now they didn't want the co-  number one  th-the German soldier  uh  was a told all the way back from Ger- uh- World War I  when they had black Americans fighting over there in Europe  uh that  don't be captured by black troops.
My father was an officer in W orld War I  decorated with the Iron C ross  F irst Class  and was enormously proud of it.
And you were Im going back now to th e end of the war  did you enter the city of Berlin?
And I -- I -- and it -- I dont even by -- that -- tho -- the p -- the -- the occurrence of the war mellowed her.
I think what we all -- most of us who went throu gh the war wanted to lead a normal life  which meant getting married  and having children  although there are many -- quite a few hidden children who never got married because theyre -- they [indecipherable] had a terrible hard time with relationships.
Well  my nieces were born  not just after World War 2  but a long time after World  World War 2  World War 1  what do they know one from the other or the Civil War  the Revolutionary War  the Crimean War  I mean it's all one to people who weren't living at that time and I want them to know the story and I was anxious for them to have a c opy of it.
And  your family  while they believed very strongly in charity  was that ever on any organized basis before the war?
They should have a profession and God forbid a war comes over or whatever  they should have something to fall on.
We wa and war  it you know  it was war and we a we had gone through the the Russians  I think  invading Finland  an d this was in the news everywhere and as children you you followed this.
What was more difficult was during the depression as said  when I was depressed that was  yeah that was worse to bear than what I went through during the war  yeah.
>> Manny Mandel: Budapest was a city of a million people  20% Jewish  200 000 people before the war.
There's Hitler here; there's a war here  but you could be saved.\
But the worst  the 28th blow was after the war when he had found out that the world was so little interested in what he had to say.
That means they will go to the regular prisoner of war camp  and that  they lived up to that  one must say.
And everybody was always suspicious  leery of that  that cannot happen  take people for thousands of miles to gas them to kill them and then the -- always came back that there were always rumors in the First World War that turned out to be just that -- rumors.
And when we saw the first Russian...when we...we left this apartment after two weeks because uh the war  it it came in and uh we had a...my hus...my...wait a minute  how was that?
And when people say the Jews wanted the war  it's all nonsense.
is a meaningful word  as ordi nary citizens of a society  that ther e be at least the potential  if we do something like what was done during the second World War  regardless of the circumstances in which the individual found hims elf  whether he was compelled to do it  or whether he did it out of his own a -- a -- as a volunteer  that there be some possibility of legal consequence for that  no matter how many years go by  in terms of that type of crime  I -- I feel 81 - in a recent news reports of the proceedings against the Chilean -- former Chilean dictator  Augusto Pinochet  that this -- though there are legal problems at every stage  theres serious legal problems  the idea that our world  as a world society now  is no longer prepared to sweep responsibility for crimes in an official position  where an official abuses the law and causes death and suffering to people in his care  or her care  if in the future  that -- that there shouldnt be some  somewhere down the line  the possibility of legal consequence for that.
Oh  you asked me about what I kn ew about the war.
My mother after the war when we were living in Sweden slept an awful lot.
And then I was transferred to the War Crimes Commissi on.
We we heard from other people after war I heard too  and no w from our group of twen ty  after the war we was nine or ten.
Beginning of '44 and so on when it wasn't very much -- you didn't not ice very much of the war then in Budapest at that time even if Hungary was an ally to Germany  you know .
I remember I enrolled at th e Hebrew University  I had people  young people  Jews  nobody wanted to talk about what happened to me in the war and they knew that I was a  a Holocaust survivor.
Because many are saying  today  'We were forced to take part in that war.
Okay  and then after the war ended  how long did you stay in Bergen– I Sylvia Green 67 January 11  1996 Page 67 mean  after liberation.
Historical experience had taught them that in 19-- in World War One  as Allies again of the German lead entente  they were losers  dismembered in terms of territory and so on.
Its around Reims  Versailles  its -- its -- it was near your well known during the World War One.
He informed the press and the Department of War that he intended to go to Germany and himself make sure that these Jews got an honest and fair treatment from the American Army and the American Army wasn't going to treat them like the Nazis did.
Thirdly  he was able at the same time  not only to present this famous report on the acquiescence of this government in the ma ss murder of the Jews  he was able to use this opportunity to come with a positive suggestion  and this positive suggestion he had uh prepared it with his uh legal advisor  Professor   and this was the idea of the War Refugee Board.
Then after the war ended  and the Russians came in to liberate us  th en my mother said now we can't tell the Russians that Daddy is in Siberia.
And when they came to Israel  they came right into the war  because they came in 48  from from the ship  my brother-in-law was taken to the army  and my sister was left all by herself  and very  very sick and discouraged  because we left one war  and came right into another war.
His wife  and family was evacuated du ring the war  and they were living in the countryside.
Probably that he was sent to and this was well after the war.
In other words  that they  you know  either ended up in prison or could not be used -- Oh  yeah  the ones who -- who were suspected of being war criminals  -- Yeah.
To the war effort and I have a reply from Himmlers office  from Himmlers headquarters  that he grants permission and that the matter should be take n up with so-and-so to transfer the Jews  the scientists.
In those three years  from the end of the war until 1948  uh we found out how a few of our family members had perished.
The man who was running the prison  I don't know if any of you know the history of Holland during the war  there were quite a lot of Dutch Nazis  and he was one of them.
You know  they were taken there as not exactly prisoners or war  but they were isolated and kept.
This war  this experience turned him off  but a scholarly type of a guy  but not a scholar.
That when there was the Finno-Russian war  then you were on the side of the Finns because you know  they were the weaker  or the it was their territory that was being attacked  and so it was more that you were on their side than the Soviet side.
They were French  they were Belgians  they Were you slave labor  or were you treated as prisoners of war?
>> Bill Benson: During that time  beginning right away when you landed in June of 1939 and  of course  the war beginning in September  did you have news of the rest of your family in Germany?
And at that time  when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno  I was already  well  a young teenager at that time  I was mostly  well almost 13 and 13  and I began to understand  you just don't talk about things of importance during the war.
And in 1939 already  before the Polish War started and  uh  at that Commission  they said it was visible that my father was a invalid  partly from the Firs t World War.
Before we had very little contact with protestants but during the war we were fighting the common enemy  then we got together and I got to know many Protestant ministers and we worked together and they tried to help and during the war they were brought together  the clergy of the different denominations.
That means we knew that Hitler is kaput and we  we were hoping and we were very an xious to see the end of the war.
Uh the the signs of it were there and in the turmoil of that world and quest for revenge that the average German had at the time...I just knew that it would come to another war in which I no doubt would be involved.
But this is what somebody told me who I met after the war.
And he was so effective in hi -- in this job  that immediately after the war the Greek government condemned him to death in abstentia because he managed to escape and go to Israel  where he became eventually  the director of Nuva  which is one conglomerate dealing with produce.
In the war  I became the first one that it was changed.
And then I get my own apartment and went back to school  and when I was 17 I married  and that's also the story after the war.
See  but right after the war  I mean  the Fr ench government took us  but there was a lot of anti-Semitism there.
And when the war began  you see they were in Northern Poland and as far as we know  when the Germans invaded they perished.
And then by that time  Germany and England were already at war.
But prior to the war for instance  to give you an example of the relationships is that when they said to put the yellow thing on the  to show that you are a Jew.
Uh  being from Germa ny  my father was able to read through the cracks of the wood some of th e station names that we went through  so we definitely knew that we were going to upper Salezia  which is now Poland  and which is near Breslau  what used to be the German city of Breslau  and where most of the concentration camps that we found out after the war were lo cated  including Auschwitz  and a lot of the subcamps.
You told me that your first memory of the war was when the Gestapo came to your house.
This Congress came to amend on the outbreak of the war between Ge rmany and Poland and then Professor Heim 2Weizman   then president of the Zionist organization  his last moving words as a converse I remember till today...w e have to...we have to bring it  the Congress to an end.
Even before the war  she was always good to people  and always taking in people.
He had worked in a bri he was a banker for Deutsche Bank  but he had worked for several years  much earlier I think  just after World War I or something  in England   and long enough to be to get British Interview with Eric Simon June 21  2014 51citizenship.
Could you tell me something about your town before the war?
I never talked about the war years  by the way  never.
He was in the manufacturing business of mens suits  and at the time just before the war  was starting to get contracts for army uniforms  and apparently had an in politically speaking.
Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of  and his name was Gorajetski.
Well  I -- I went to visit my uncle  eventually  after the war.
You know  that 's how things were  but Max  who was a marvelous person  and he survived the war because we made him go to Switzerland.
I went there too and I registered and I had a very easy time because af ter the war I worked.
So  our whole family is suffused with stories  and this is -- this is a -- a cutie from -- from the war.
And Interview with Lucie Ragin July 23  2009 4we were very happy family and all of a s udden they said it woul dnt be good for the Jewish people to stay in Antwerp because the war was broke breaking out.
After the war  I was so occupied with my own life  I think  that I didnt want to know exactly what.
And they were very  very well-to-do  they he made a lot of money during the war on things like quartz and all kinds of raw materials.
My other brother who was with him was kille d in the last days of the war.
In 1940  before America joins the war  my mothers father develops cancer  and he was  as I say  a neurologist  way back.
I cant answer that  because I n -- first I said yes  then I heard about all the war stories.
There were sk irmishes in Poland and Russia which led to the war in 1920  1921.
It was a very sad  sad and that meant that the war will end  and that be the end of it  which is a total  total relief.
I found out this long after the war -- long after I left.
And it didnt worry us too much  because the -- the war was going to USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 3 be over anyway very soon  we all knew that  and the Germans would never do in Holland what they had done in Germany  to the German Jews.
And the Communist uh representative  a big deal probably  after the war we find out and organize this group.
I was hungry  and shivering  in middle of the night  and I didnt know  I thought that when -- when I  Polish citizen  come to Poland after the war  they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 50 going to embrace me  they going to give me I dont know -- I came there -- food and ev -- nobody.
Where were you when you found out the war was over?
The earlier ones  I didn't know if they killed them yet  till after the war  when they took them to Treblinka.
The camp the Germans lost the war before I was released from the hospital  or rather  they had to leave the  the camp.
And then after that you learn that you learn after the war  that they went into hiding.
And then the war broke out  and I never was able to get the visa and emigrate to Palestine.
In a hospital  they had there a barrack from the prisoners of war  about 20 of us or 24 I don't remember.
Um  well Leon and my mother plunked down 60 dollars for a bo ttle of gin  but I didn't know about that  and I would be studying with one of these bottles of gin  you know  those earthenware bottles  and I would fill it with hot water  and try to study in my room  whic h was fro-freezing cold  and put blankets over me  and this wa-hot water bottle  a nd put on gloves  and my little fur coat  and I'd try to study  and then I would come with the bottle  ---- cold  I would come in the living room where we had a 2 lb coffee can  you know  those Maxwell coffee cans  and cut a hole in the bottom  and we had tiny little bit of fuel in that  and on top of that was a kettle  either with hot water of a kettle with sugar beads to extract the sugar from it  a nd every house smelled of sugar beads  and if I now drive past a field of sugar beads  I still get nauseated because it smells like the war.
Now in -- I know you were very young  of course  in 1933  but as the years went on after Hitler came into power and before the war started  had you ever heard of a man called Hitler?
He arrived after the war  he was in concentration camp [indecipherable] .
Or of this innate insensitivity to Jewishness  or anti-Semitism  whatever you want to call it  people were brought up with this sort of thing and even though the war was over and done with  it was still there.
And after  after the war  after  since I was liberated in Po land  somehow I when they when we were liberated  I still went to formal school  but it was there was not many  many Jews left in Poland  so  so.
But the Korean [indecipherable] was coming the finish the war  they gave up.
Was your conditions worse because you werent considered a prisoner of war?
When the war was over I had -- I lived with my mother for a period of time until we actually came over on the S.S. America  one of the ships.
Oh  the people that we had  it was very interesting after the war when I found those people coming out of hi ding  and we all stayed together.
>> Bill Benson: Before you came to the United States  after the war for four years you remained in Belgium t rying to rebuild your life and your family.
It's it it's just a by coincidence that you stayed alive and at least in the last four months of the war.
herself  yeah and [indecipherable] So did your grandmother live with you after the war?
They stayed in Brooklyn  yeah  through the you know  so I yeah  and And did did the when did the que stion of what had happened during World War II every come up in those years?
You see  Tito is a major was criminal  but without Tito the war couldnt have been won the way it has won  so Im kind of caught in between.
And the tug of war between the sentiment an of emotional tradition on the one hand  and the not wanting to belong to anything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing.
Because before the war  if Jewish boys were supposed to be drafted to the Polish army  they did everything possible not to go.
And I told them   I don't know if I said it in my tape  I don't think  how they look to me and so on during the war  they were sitting and crying.
As they were still thinking in the terms of 1930s when the Spanish Civil War -- as a war of where the classes sort of got mixed in.
I mean  I was in England during the war but I was safe.
And then my uncle wa s coming  whom I last saw  I think as a seven or eight year old in Yugoslavia  b ecause he came back from the prisoner of war camps -- camp.
Anyway  that pa rt they staged in this -- in this little film  the history of the Jews there  and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major.
And two things were interesting– Maybe I should just interrupt you to point  to say that  for the sake of the tape  that after the war you spent a year or so in Budapest.
And that after losing World War I  there was first of all  it was kept intact  as opposed to the Austro-Hungarian empire  which was 2 000 years old and was completely chopped up because of the ethnic elements  all of whom had been caught in this thing we just mentioned about th-ththe tightrope between repression and redressing  because if an Austrian emperor or Austrian government tried to redress the demands of the Hungarians  or the Serbs  or the Czechs  it was politically unpopular at home and deemed insufficient by the recipients of the programs  who wanted out  never mind how and just soon er better than later.
And she wanted to adopt a kid from the Holocaust because for the memory of her family  which been perished in the war.
It would not be given the liberty that it enjoys today and enjoyed right after the war.
Anyhow  I thought  who in the we we couldnt understand because we didnt get wind of any war being over.
What was your life like growing up before the war under communism?
And of course  to be liberated by the Russians  but I I didnt know that  but five days before  at the camp gates  arrived hundreds of trucks  American army trucks  to pick up American prisoners of war  and English an-and and the western allies.
This was...he was in Shamisho   I remember...this was a big event in first war  first of all.
And they told us  they left the gate doors open  and they said the war is over.
What about the people that you knew from befo re the war.
Did you feel it was important when the Americans joined in the war effort?
And this was a very big income  because according to the estimation  what was done by  uh  German Distribution ------------  he spent in the last 8 months of the war  from October  44  till May 45  he spent 4 million marks  equivalent in these da ys to 2 million pre-war dollars.
Ignacy Paderewski was the great Polish pianist  and prime minister in the first World War.
And as far as he was concerned  the prisoner of war and you didnt have a right to try him.
Actually  for a government that was -- that needed its resources  its soldiers  railroads and all for the war purposes  instead concentrated on using all of those facilities to gather up and deport their Jewish population.
By the end of the war  though  I knew catechism better than I knew Judaism  so.
I was told very early on that my mother had lost all her family  and when the doctors told her that she was not supposed to have a child  that her response was that she didn't survive the war not to have a child.
If you're working at a municipal or a federal office that register s people to leave the country  and now you have have a German occupation  a Nazi occupation  and it's war time and pe ople are no longer allowed to leave the country  what happens to that office?
30 Yes  I know a situation like that  where quite [indecipherable] precious things were given away to Greek friends  who unfortunately  after the war  they didnt -- not all of them gave them back to the Jews.
I -- The only thing I know  that we went into a prisoner of war camp.
24 We were scared that theyll find us  you know  where can you --- Did your parents also read a news paper in the town before the war?
In Europe  yes  we had cars and trucks and all of that  but I remember riding a motorcycle with my uncle cause we didnt have a car and I remember getting a flat tire every other block  cause we didnt have the good tires  you know  right after the war.
I -- you told me about that before the interview  but I dont think youve described that  so -- At the end of the war  I went there [indecipherable] this was May  95.
The first thing we did was that my husband uh discussed with a doctor if he could get his um his um now I  I don't know the word anymore  uh removed appendix–yes  his a ppendix removed even that appendix was fine  and when he woke up in the hospital  there were mo re lost appendixes  so this would since we had to be at  at the 15th at the station  that was a few days before war??
Because that was the end of the war  a nd all of a sudden they had refugees all over Europe  so they formed this international refugee organization  and they took over the administration.
Oh we -- oh we -- he always said  you know  we got to learn all the work on a farm  no matter what  and so we had to do everything  specially near the time when the war broke out  when it -- it got ba d. We couldnt get any workers  so we had to take over  and every girl had their j ob  you know  in a -- anything in a farm.
We were in good working relationship with the akar  with the armia kryova  with the Polish akar  and the reason for it is because this was an area where before the war Poles were considered colonizers  you know  occupants  you know  that they were sent in by the Polish government to Polonize the area.
Halina  her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifying the family as Catholics.
Because they had a transport they sent out in 19...in 1945  before the war ended  they sent a transport of girls.
And the letter with the my fathers death came to me in the letter  because all the letter was censored during the war.
244 During my activity in Schwandorf  my father managed to realize that I was alive and in Schwandorf  and at the same time I also realized that he survived the war.
He -- he was el -- actually living  during World War Two in Germany.
Well  I never got back to Chic ago because I moved from the SEC to one of the wartime agencies  the office of Price Administratio n here which seemed a little more exciting at the time as we were just beginning to get into the war.
Anthony: You talked about your reaction to the end of the war  the loss of your brother and family members.
Uh  before the outfit (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) went overseas  uh every uh outfit had 5 to have an orientation officer to give an explanation as to why we were fighting the war.
But upstairs from the Germans was a wonderful lady  Madam Dene ux  who hated the Germans because her husband died from the mustard gas in the First World War.
You wrote a line soon after the war  and this is what you wrote: \ I feel like a dead degraded cowardly Jew.\
And and then we came to amer then  we had a when we took a boat in Liverpool   and that it was black out  because it was war.
And then a few days later  the war was -- Wars on.
We had no idea where exactly he was  but after the war there were announcements all over the place  and my mother put announcements in the radio.
But I know that there was a sense that the war was coming but there was really no place much to go.

They were the first ones to break into the warehouses and he thought he looked very snazzy in that outfit  this was after the war.
I couldnt tell you really exactly what they did during the war.
Actually  before the war  about 1/3 of Warsaw's population was Jewish.
There were some  you know  what -- when people ask me today  you know  a-about the Germans  you know  of co -- of course  you know  after the war when I -- I -- when I were -- when I came back as a soldier  there were no Nazis  you couldnt find any  you know  there werent any  you know.
But they left because that's why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life.
DL] That would have happened in the latter part of your life as opposed to after the war? [
Interview with Henry Kolber 7 You were 16 years old when the war began in Poland.
>> Rita Rubinstein: 1944  the sounds of war got very close  and the people we lived with  they took their family and took us along with them.
Now after the war was over  we had coupons  and we could only buy food with these coupons.
But during the war  like I told you  most of the houses was taken by the authorities and given to non -Jewish people or they put some Army commander or officer  give some room in the houses.
And the first war was that we should do things in our own name  but to wo rk through indigenous organizations.
Okay  so youre talking about after the war now -- After the war  right  yeah. --
The only thing was the pay  and and then the when th e war was over  why the prices started climbing  you know  and so I my wife an d I talked it over  we thought its time I got a raise.
And in those year s  right after the war and even in the fifties and sixties there wasnt any unders tanding or talk or research or literature or anything on what it was like for children who had to be reunited with the parents.
Well  I described to you the earliest war crimes investigations which were killing of hostages in France  in Belgium  Malmedy Massacre 2  for example  which is better known one...shooting down of Allied flyers  and then we ran into Buchenwald first.
I don't know if it is now  but it was bombed out during the war  but there they put us up(?)
I was -- war was declared 10 days Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 14after my 16th birthday.
So we moved there and that was...no I was going to say it was the last move before the ...that was the last move before the war  of course.
Its really just the outside  because the rest was destroyed during the war  but the outside is still standing.
Yeah  this is my sister Riva  with her s on Gregory  and my nephew Alexander  before the war.
Did you stay in Kretinga for the rest of the war  until the time you left?
Now  not even the commies in the Spanish Civil War were doing things like that.
At that point  when I -- when the war ended and the Russians came  my mother told me we're going to tell the Russians that Daddy's in a German camp  and I want you to know that we're not Catholic  that you' re Jewish.
During the war  we didn't have...we didn't have what I  I think  we only thought that we should live through the war and maybe we'll find somebody.
>> Fanny Aizenberg: Well  I had a sister who has remained alive during the war in Belgium.
And among the reasons I gave for our being in...in the war was the inhumanity of the Germans.
They were destroyed.5 And they  uh... After the war  in 1947  Max came to Shanghai  where I lived.
At the Tlomackie  I was only for about six months  five months  six months Yeah  before the war broke out.
As I was saying -- saying to get back t-to the war  you were following what was happeni ng and communication got less and less -- Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 46 Yes. --
And wa -- one night I was the -- see  we talking about after the war  we got back in the war this time.
effect  what -- what -- what effect did those experiences during the war have on you for your life afterwards?
And she was in contact with the person in Israel who has collected all information about children  as -- in -- during the war.
From what you tell me  my image is what we see in war movies  literally hundreds of thousands  if not a million people  on bicycles and carts and cars and trucks  all fleeing Pell Mel  trying to get away  is that what your sense of that was like?
There was a write -up about him a fter the war.
And eventually these people were caught  and by eventually I mean sometimes a matter of weeks  months and we did set-up war crimes trials in the Dachau concentration camp.
I mean  you said your father followed the progress of the war with the pins.
So the Yugoslav Army was just whoever was there was taken to prisoner of war camps.
There was World War II  it lasted from this date to that date.
Uh over...when we came to Lublin  actually the war was still going on.
Some of the doctors  there were two  one of them died  so we were friendly later on  my mother and I  and we have seen her after the war and were together in Sweden.
One of her feet  her toes were taken off after the war.
They were sort of not communists in the way that we thought about it after  during the cold war  but the kind that people there thought in kind of idealistic terms.
We were waiting until the war will be ended and we were thinking how it would work out  how it will be  how it -- how nice it will be.
And when the war st arted  I guess Im wondering I went also to pre-school at one point  and it was a Hebrew it was a Hebrew  I guess  a Hebrew pre-school  and I was the thing I remember is they taught us on the blackboard  you know  they made like and they said sus  so they made a a you make a a you make a circle  you make a a straight  you know  a a line  and a little dot  and another circle.
How did that affect your family  your father being called into the war?
So  your husband mentioned that before the war started  when you were 16 years old  you left the bakery  is that correct?
I had four uncles in America  and after the war they were looking for family.
Right after the war  theyd had enough of the war  and and [indecipherable] so  in matter of teaching  you tried to bring in the things that had happened and their influence on their lives  but most people were much more interested in getting jobs and buying cars and living.
Nev Id never been to synagogue before the war  or during the war  for that matter.
We now have a common foe  and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war.
Tell us about your parents and their life in Brussels  Belgium during the pre -war period.
By talking about the tough situation of the people  the fact that the war have some big impact on our lives  to do something.
We only found out after the war that preparations were going on to...to kill everybody.
Yeah  that wa they were just always and he came over here and visited with her and her husband  and This is after the war  yes?
Can you tell me about your earl y days in school during the war?
Certainly justice wasnt served because when I was in Europe this last summer  in Czechoslovakia  in sl -- actually two years ago  theyre bil -- building a docu -- monument to -- theyre bu ilding a monument to Hlinka  who was the head of the fascist party in 19 Slovakia during the war.
That luck would run out sooner or later and so they were able to get in touch with someone  a Christian who was actually a colleague of my father and my father was a teacher before the war and so was this gentleman.
Incidentally  he went to the European theater during the war; we lost track of each other.
I said uh  \ I'm glad that I learn a job for after the war.\
And my grandchildren have already heard the tape about my -- our life in Czechoslovakia during -- before the war.
And she wanted to be with us til the war was over.
After the Second World War  after Holocaust  fifty years  seventy-five years  people forget about it and they will not like to discuss it no more.
At the university  I was pointed out about this one professor who I was told was -- belonged to the Nazi party and that it took him a long time  that he was among those who were questioned after the war  what did you do in the Nazi party and so on.
One thing I didn't stress much but one of the problems in Yugoslavia that was different from elsewhere during the war  the Serbs were persecuted in the camps.
in this camp  in the war [indecipherable] you know  this and his brother Was underground.
They had a major influx of workers from Kentucky and Tennessee for various war plant -- Dayton was both a Chrysler and General Motors town.
And they I dont know if youve ever seen the [indecipherable] but I didnt know til after the war that they had a building up there  the Russians  a lot of them disappeared.
Meaning the depression following it  meaning defeat  meaning the Interview with Peter Masters August 7  1998 51peculiar post-war post World War I dealings  politically  where Austria was completely emaciated to a six million country from being a world empire.
You know  its the sort of thing we -- we said about the Germans in World War .
>> Bill Benson: And  of course  the war ended in May 1945.
He taught catechism at the Belgian border to Nazi  no  I mean  non-Nazi children who would cross the border before World War II to learn catechism because it was forbidden in Germany and under Hitler.
I do reme mber glimpses of it from before the war  not too much.
And most of the people that lived over there came -- came before -- before the second World War.
So when the war came and all these Jewish laws -- Jewish males between age 18 to 50 were taken to forced labor camps  these people tried to prove that they were not Jewish and they submitted all kinds of petitions to the government to declare them Christians.
>> Kurt Pauly: Well  my father was  as I said before  was in the First World War  was very much concerned about where to go.
I didn't r ealize what the war -- what's it all about.
Then we we hearing the possibility of war  and the that be you know  now the England is rearm finally re-rearming itself  you know  a-and theres more and more talk about the possibility of war because Hitler wants Danzig and a-and England has a pact with Poland and France and so forth  theyre gonna come to the assistance of the Polish government.
However  however  as far as Im concerned  there is horrendous damage in all of them because of the war.
Okay  what does that do to you after all you had been through during the war  to have that?
Did you know what was going on in Europe with the situation with the Jews  or what was happening at all during the war?
Anyway  so after the war I went to him in Israel and he did give me the shop and to make it short  I met my wife  we married in Israel and left for America.
But I was opposed to the war and I didnt see a need for it and theres been wars there forever  it was imperial wars.
They're looking to negotiate to save themselves from being war crime eligible and other things.
Thats 39  thats when the war was supposed to start in earnest  but nobody was shooting at anybody.
When the war started I was seventeen years old and we had to have a permit to live.
And also the Allied had landed in Anzio  so we could hear the war ad vancing very closely.
Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war  but about my concepts about working with people and children.
They told them that they were going to a nice place  secluded  and you will be able to work until the end the war.
And we all had...uh... outlook s on life and we were already...we were...we were knowledgeable about the...the possibilities of...uh...of war ...of the expansion policies of Germany...uh... The first feelin gs of war came to us when Austria was incorporated  the Anschluss.
When it started the war  it stayed in our place where we worked  was a whole  everything to fixing.
So th-then you -- youre going to involve with the history of j -- the Jews in Frankfort  right before the -- right before the war?
This is what I wanted to tell you  that it was wonderful because I -- we were Lithuanian citizens and we were not -- we w -- were not under the Hitlers la w  and we got even -- but my father told me when we -- we lived on kuf -- Kurfurstendamm and we got for breakfast  for instance  a -- a little britchen  a -- a -- no  a piece of white bread with butter  with -- or margarine and marmalade and my father told me that the Ge rmans dont receive it  and the Jews definitely not  because it is very hard now and they are prep aring a war.
You dont remember talking about what they -- what they went through during the war  thats [indecipherable] No  no  no  no  a -- a -- yes  I -- I -- not in that school  okay?
Finally they hate they they came they told them that not to touch the the hay because the war stopped.
Early in the morning we hear the bombardment and over the radio it was war.
After the war  we tried to help in nearly every cause through every means available to us.
Before the second world war  my name was Lily and this how I was known by all my friends.
We did listen to it  and so we were aware of the war in general.
Eventua lly in 1948  after the war  when the State of Israel was established  where ...where else would I go?
Uh  you see our part  it belonged to Austria before the first world war.
This is tape number two  side A. And you were talking about after the war and your marriage.
At that time  radios whatever you could hear  they announced already that the war had begun.
So as the war went on  she worked as a live -in housekeeper for a retired Polish engineer and his wife.
Well  the longest time that the camps were in operation supposedly  the beginning of the second war  and when the Yelta release started pouring You mean hang on just a second.
And be for the fact that the railroad tracks between Grodno and Marstee  were not ready  because we  the partisans  the yesterdays destroyers of that  to s -- to not let the Germans be able to carry on their war  now had a problem of going back to see that theyve all repaired  so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies  as well as manpower.
At the end of the war  when you were still in Europe and word came out of the ta what truly happened to many of the victims  which I assume you didnt know during the war time  do you can you descri be what some of your thoughts were when you saw pictures from the camps  from Auschwitz?
later on too  see  Particular at -- it tied in as part of my pattern of circles into what eventually did happen during the war and -- Right. --
Most of those people were the real Hasidim from--who surv ived the war and from way back.
>> Albert Garih: When we heard the war was over  it was like something -- like a balloon that had blown up.
And they had also a grammar school or public and until the war started  when suddenly in 1940 the war that came.
Do you remember the day when the war ende d  where you were?
And that was a day of levity during World War II when the entire city of Brussels was covered with Neswah  but not the real one.
One of the things it needs is toothpaste.ﬂ Now Otto Bierman was a chemist and so the -- the commandant said  ﬁThats a good idea  can you get it together?ﬂ And you know  and  ﬁWhat do you need  you know  to do this?ﬂ And Otto gave him a list and this and that and -- and he said  ﬁWell  I will need so many people to do this  to produce whatever you need  which is quite a bit.ﬂ So I forget how many people it was  but one of them was Heinz and that saved his life  because he was still there after the commandant was gone  you know  at -- at the -- when -- when the war was over.
He loved Germany   because he was in the first war  and the Germans treated him wonderful.
And then I was starting gymnasium until the beginning of the war  until it was destroyed.
By that time prisone rs of war were being captured and being identified and hold them for war crimes trials.
Well  right -- right -- right after -- right after the war I'd been up in -- in -- back -- back in -- in Paris and we were making a change in the member was in charge of our operations in Germany.
And in that...in this particular transport they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war.
Not even friends  not even when I go down to Americ an Legion or the vets  I never told about war.
Mean  and so she would be tried for war crimes of course.
And we -- if they want to waste it  thats up to them.ﬂ Were you more sensitive to this because of what you experienced during the war?
Which means these were old time civil servants from way back  or the exceptions were made if they had fought in World War I  and been decorated  and so on.
Audience Member: So if you met a German who had killed people during the war  like 16 he was like sorry he did it and he came up to you right now  would you be angry or have hard feelings toward him?
76 No  because they weren't -- th-they were stri -- it was strictly -- there was a war going.
How old would your mother be at the end of the war in 1945?
And my father always said [speaks forei gn language here] You have got to become a somebody  youve got to become a somebody beca use you are number one  right  after the war and I said -- well Ive already me ntioned that to you  see.
That didn't  you know  like I said  I was only 13 years old when the war broke out.
As a prisoner of war  I had the right to write to send letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me.
By now the war was on one year  two years  and a ve -- at one time  after Mrs. Allen had been sick again a nd hospitalized  she got a shock me -- treatments  several times while I was there.
And she she got him after the war  after Ludwig was killed  but at that time  he was live for whatever reason  he was living with the father  and Alexandra Sokol was the head of the international couriers section  womens courier  and they were also responsible for also attacks on German criminals.
They had interviewed a lot of German people about Crystal Night there  and it they they had th-this film was made aactually after the war  in 1989  so much later.
There was stories all over the place  but we had a normal life and living like normal people  and then  of course  in 1940 came the Russians because the war started already with the Germans.
This time they called it L. Do you remember about how old she was when th e war started?
So he was expelled and not [indecipherable] And [indecipherable] sort of That was during the war.
Was there a  a Quaker religious class in your school in  during the war?
But I no have to tell you what happened after th e war  you know  there was a big mix.
They felt that th e war is going to be finished in a matter of -- in a short time.
And I told her about the incident   and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman who decided to adopt my brother who then came to England at the beginning of August 1939 and started to process papers fo r my parents to come over  but unfortunately due to the war breaking out in September  they never made it.
And I could very easily put on civies and go into a bar and sit down and have a beer and listen to everybo dy refighting the Second World War which was fascinating for me  you know.
Sh e felt that its very important  we have to have it after war.
As far as  you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your school and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitis m was not going to be as much of a problem any more?
I think the truth of it there are so few childre n  Jewish children  who survived the war  so few -and then were reunited with their family or something like that.
Th e same guy  he was officer before the war  in Belvedere (332).
And the thought of me as a teenager being a copy girl for the ﬁDaily Newsﬂ on Times Square   during the war  in the dark  is beyond me  but I did it.
Uh  I did find uh a few wounded in  in a German field hospital  and made arrangements for uh  their ev acuation  but because uh we  it was getting dark  this was late in the day  we felt we had to get b ack to our lines  and the war was not over yet either at that point.
But we were very poor  we had nothing left after the war  no money and so on.
It was like  it was like  that was  I think  the horror of  of the war years.
Did did you fight in the War of Independence in 1948?
Where did you It was a cruise ship when it wasn't during the war.
Uh...Now Everybody by that time was killed and the...my...uh...during the war  there was  of course  no...not much money because my Aunt Etty...uh... husband worked for the...they made him work for the German and they didn't pay.
Very soon I was a prisoner of war and I was assigned from the government  an apartment.
But  during the war  in -- when they opened the borders  we met my uncle and my mother saw hi -- her brother for the first time.
In the my father was a soldier in the World War I  and he got a citizenship because of that.
After the war  when I came to Cs because I want ed to ask anybody  anybody saw him  anybody heard because during the war I was th inking  they don't know where I am and they don't know where they are.
But for us  even when the war was finished  the war wasn't finished for us; for us  it wasn't.
I had an uncle in Israel  who Im -- talked about before on the tape  who went to Israel  became prisoner of war  fought for the briti -- with the British  and -- my mothers brother  and who broke the saber for the police  thats the story I have here on the tape.
And he he he used to sell  before the war he used to sell import fruit  oranges  bananas.
So  we were there for about  oh I would say afte r the war - about two months or three  maybe.
But we were all pretty much  you know  cause we were picked out by our grades from the exams that we did as to whether you were going to go to -- and there was a -- there was a time there that they wanted to put us in the ASTP  which was army specialized training program  in which th -- you know  if you got into that program you didnt have to go to war  which of course was a foolish thing because that -- that wasnt so.
Never  never learned Latin  nothing  cause with that  that one year that was in Unsee  you know  right after the war  in the ninth grade  I took English  not that it helped any  but I was more interested in Lat in  so he said  \ Oh  yeah.\
No  I do not remember when the war started  I only remember when the Gestapo knocked on our door  and said get out  at gunpoint.
And we arrived in Kenya  which at that time was a British colony  and I dont know under what quota  under what auspices  but the day war broke out  we were considered enemy aliens.
This is in Ioannina now  there used to be there used to be two synagogues before the war.
I think it was mostly after the war that they came.
Marty  who was 93  was a combat veteran of the Second World War  seeing action in North ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 Africa  Italy  and elsewhere in Europe.
He was in the British navy during the war  and he came and demanded from the Slovak government  his -- his sl -- fathers store  yeah.
And he survived the war and then came to America and wrote the book.
And then  after the war  you know  when we came back  we were all asking if somebody saw my father.
I was at that time  when the war broke out  the biggest problem was to get gasoline  you know  to have -- so we had -- the Polish army retreated  and there was -- two officers were in Poland with a car.
And they had formed this Vaad  just for the purpose of helping the Jews the war was ending whom they knew would come and needed help  even in Europe.
But when I tried to schedule this out until the end of the war  I got in the end compressed.
Anyone who has seen German soldiers in -- in an ordi nary life or in -- du-during the war or on -- on parades  they always looked spic and span  there was not a button missing  there was not a spot.
So we mostly associat ed with people we knew from during the war.
Well  my mother applied immediately for -- a-after the war was over  she applied immediately for pro -- visa  with the -- of course with the sponsorship of my uncle  and we were placed in the quota of Poland  which was then behind the Iron Curtain -- Right. --
What I was trying to get at was that -- that same -- that same feeling it sounds like motivated you after the war of just not -- not -- not taking on responsibility in -- for something bigger than -- than what was within your sphere of control  in a way.
And he had been in World War I. So he pretty much kept us up to speed.
I think also because most well  I think almost all of us in Britain had suffered the bombing and suffered the war.
When the war started  we again were set back incredibly far back as far as as trying to help them to get out of there because normal escape routes were out of the question and you you could only find uh certain ones and and that only if you had quite a bit of money uh either to bribe officials or and and just for the passage and and everything else.
And one of the most intimate friends of Father Bruno  a friendship which continued after the war  was the Rotmeal brothers who are now in this country.
Of course  thats where the action was at that time  and I told him that I would like to go to Germany  because I know the language  and he said to me that  ﬁOh  youre not married now  and every officer has to go initially to Korea.ﬂ The war was still going on  we didnt know when it was going to be finished.
Because he was fighting in ninete in first World War  in 1920.
And -- and I was waiting  but the airplane never came  because its the first day of war  and the airplane was supposed to come from Warsaw.
It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the barracks.
You mean he's worrying that the war is to the end  and that I am like I am  doing that to the prisoners  and he is afraid that maybe I will get the punishment for it?\
I know that they had an airline that was traveling into Ecuador and -- and some of them actually  during the war  were sent to the states to camp  you know  to whatever kind of camps they had for the Germans.
You know  we were both 16 wh en the war broke out in Europe and 17 when Holland was invaded.
He has spoken at such places as Fort Belvoir  where he received his 50 -year anniversary pin for his service during the Korean War  as well as at the Veterans Administration Hospital in DC and to other veterans and other military groups  as well as to various schools in the local area  including the one that his granddaughter attends.
And living in Warsaw from 1932  before the war  what was that like?
But the Quaker s were very involved in this because  as now  they were against war.
He left -- they liv ed in a city called Kielce and in 1937 too  he left for the United States  hoping to bring his wife  my sister  and a little  four year old little girl to America  and that never materialized because of the war broke out.
Then I was two -- two or three weeks in the course -- course  and afterwards the Hehalutz movement  the leadership was in -- they felt that is -- theres war  of course  coming  and they left.
Oh y -- yo-you see  this tension started many -- maybe two  three years before the war occurred.
He says  ﬁI dont care  the war is over.ﬂ I said  ﬁI cant mail it because there is no -- no mail yet  no communication.ﬂ He says  ﬁWe are leaving tomorrow for Honolulu.
I really don't remember even realizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started shooting into the air  and it came  sort of   on my birthday.
And besides this  I worked in  I worked in Brooklyn at the teacher's seminary  also  wi th the State Department to bring over girls from Sweden and they brought over about 5 00 girls from Sweden  who were stranded there after the war.
And after the war was over  they kept on seeing each other  and dating each other  and they wanted to get married  but of course she was Christian Orthodox  and the rabbi wouldnt marry them  she had to convert.
As a matter of fact  after the war ended  many teenagers t hat age had been in Buchenwald.
When I was 11 years old and when we start second war  they they have problem because they wanted to have mo-model for the German people  for the army  to to make for them for me it was I was not interested in th in this problem  for I was too young.
I thi nk some of the Jewish organizations were not that up and up as well  after the war.
My cousin  this cousin  didn't wait for that  she escaped into the woods and lived the rest of the war with the partisans.
And I felt I knew  and I told her  \ Stop repeating it  I know how to get there \  because we used to go there before the war and my mother used to buy some of the dairy products  like milk  and cheese  and butter 22 from that farmer  so I knew his name  I knew his family  and I knew where he lived  only we didn't go through the river  we went all around.
I need to stress  I  what  what my sense about Holland during the war was based on  based on history  basically  data and in retrospect  is that there was a small percentage perhaps five  five percent  if that many who act ively tried to help Jews if  Im not sure there were that many  who were  who risked their own lives.
I used to play chess when I was young  you know  before the war.
And then I un derstand we dropped another bomb subsequently and then the war did end.
Did you have any reunions with other people that you met be fore or during the war?
A lot of pe ople joined the army  and they went to fight the Germans  because in Ural was very quiet  we didnt feel the war.
People told us that after the war and we only heard about that later.
And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer  continuous practice of law in the state of California  I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of the experience of the war is I havent gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot the Nazis or the Germans.
On April 28th  because May 8th was the uh the end of the war  the liberation day  but A-April 28th was his birthday  and we wanted to do something for him for his birthday  so each one of that of us  of the prisoners gave a little portion of their  our bread  and a little por-portion of our terrible jam or marmalade  whatever it was and  and  and um  mmmm  margarine  and so meone who must have been very  very handy among us  I don't remember   I don't know who it was  made him a birthday cake.
After the war  of course  my parents being Latvian  they were...from citizens from behind the Iron Curtain.
The only thing that I I received through the war were certain letters from small letters  really simple letters; we are well  and so on  from the Catholic the Catholic the [indecipherable] organization  you see  th ey were doing this  they were sending let-letters  but I never answered them because I didnt know how to do that.
I went through the war with you and Mordechai  youre not going to a kibbutz.
01:48:23 After the war  I need a pair of pants. (
And thats where my father di -- where my father worked to the end of the war.
I watched these Jews  the whole  uh  during the whole war and they are just like us  and I completely...it was a completely wrong belief.\
How did the American media present the news of the war and what had happened to the Jews?
But after the war there was obviously the teachers union   labor union was penetrated by communists.
And when we came back after the war -- first of all  our house was 90 -- 85 percent destroyed and my father said some of the furniture  he could even find in the woods  still  it was just chopped up.
As difficult a time as I had with my father after the war  he was a fantastic father as children.
October 15 was a very big day  because Horthy  too little  too late  decided to do the \ honorable thing \  and he had a radio broadcast saying that Hungary is going to get out of the war  it will be neutral.

When they found out he was 15 years old  they threw him out   so he joined the Foreign Legion  and he spent the war years in what is now Vietnam  in Indo-China.
But he knew him from first World War  because I think after the first World War  Hoover sent money to newly resurrected Poland   and somehow he must have been involved in that money.

And I went to the -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 34to graduate [indecipherable] at the German university in Prague before the war.
Were you were you But I became sort of my world became only books  and and reading  and I excluded practical I did not know whats hap I knew that there was war  though  in Spain .

This is tape number one  side B. And I wanted to ask you about the state of your health at the end of the war.
You know  in Germany every year you have different police departments in diff erent parts of the city and when my father came there and he asked by sheer coincidence the officer in charge was a former comrade in arms from World War I  and he said  Fritz Rosenbe rg  come in here for a minute.
It was not part of that  it was as of everything  when the war started  that was the churches were closed  and you could not gather.
So was there any  that was during the Korean War  right?
I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war  and then he began writing short poems  and I think there are eight or nine of them  and they were written to me.
I ha I have here a lot of stories from the end of the war.
And I think she lived with them during the war  in England.
We was in the concentration camp already  I don't know exactly  maybe 12 or 15 000  but you have and -- after this coming all the prisoners from war  from the English people  the American soldiers  the French sol-- you know they -- what was the prisoner from the war.
So  I took those documents and he said he decided  even though he was no longer a soldier  he said  Im a civilian now  but he decided that as a former general  he might be considered someone to be made a prisoner of war  he ho ped this would not be the case  but this is why he let the message be transmitted that he was ready to be in touch with the enemy.
A little officer  you know  in the army  in the first Wo rld War.
The questions are  why  when there is a war  soldiers die  some civilians die  why would one human being  or one race  want to eradicate another race?
So we smelled in the air that the war eventually will come to an end  but we not going to go out alive  because that's what they told us.
Now the what I reme would thought would be an ironic thing is Oh  hes a World War I veteran.
We had just talked about different ways that this has shaped your character  that the Holocaust and war experience.
The first time I was supposed to go to Israel was in 67  and the war broke out.
Well  we came home -- the war in Japan -- well  while we were still -- no  that was in Germany  when the war was over and Hitler killed himself and my friend Grace brought this radio with her.
They managed to get to England in the late 1930s before the war started.
This was after 1943 or  was this still during the war.
So -- well there was not much food anyway  but -- and then  before the war was over  I think  on America  they sent on the Red Cross  they sent food over.
I as a Zionist and professor...my my patron  my famous a nd beloved patron  Professor Sigmung Belaski who was a famous professor at the University of   which is now   after the first revolution  he run away from from and he came to Kovno  Lithuania and there he was admitted as a professor of civil law although he was a Jew  although he didn't speak Lithuanian at all  but he was world famous and he wrote several monumental books on the civil war in uh in copyright and so on  and I was lucky enough to write my thesis  my...you know...wha t you call it in other languages  the doctorate  I wrote with Professor Belaski  and when I...when I passed all the exams and uh I was waiting for the evaluation of my thes is that they submitted to Professor Belaski and then I was invited at his...at his law offi ces and then he asks me what do you want to do with yourself when you graduate law?
The rest of the time we went to the.... People coming in from Ukraine  you know they escape from the war  so we went over there to the sea.
But during the war years  it was -- made a stable out of it  the Germans  you know  kept horses there  and so on.
Well  the only thing we knew in 44 really  during the war years Israel did not know...or I did not know...I don't know whether the powers to be in Israel knew very much  but we were very concerned in Israel about our own survival.
Not at all  except that they were I can only I dont remember too many holidays before the war  barely any at all.
Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21  2011 109 After the war.
The war is over and -- and maybe its -- maybe there was a feeling that its time to start a new life or -- but at the same time  youve got this burden of knowing what had happened to your family and to your people.
But in the smaller town there  we are talking about a city right now that prior to World War -- to the outbreak of the war probably  maybe  had 3 000 people in total population.
But after the war  actually there was a -- a cousin of my husband  she was marri ed to a Polish Jew  who was a watchmaker  and he couldnt make a go of a nything  it was a wonderful guy.
She had gone to Paris seeking -- looking for anybody she had been connected with during the war  because she had lost all her family.
You know  the Pole  after the war after the war  th-the Russian took par-part of Lvov  and th-they give the Poles the West Germany  theyre called Farbruck there.
And the third text comes in the day which the War Refugee Board is created.
And then later  the rumo r went Hanny Janssen had tried to escape  but that wasnt true  and she had to go a month to the bunker  so we were a month without her  and she never knew who -- but then after the war  two guys from the -- from the ger -- from our police came when I wa s studying nursing  and they came to the hospital where I worked  and they were from the -- the political police  you know  who were checking on all traitors.
So we had to get through to the American zone  but this was the beginning of the war.
They had a close  ongoing personal relationship with the second largest political party in Germany after the war  the Social Democratic party.
I mean I think that we  they were all part of our foreign service and I dont think that they knew much about it  but it was all very separate from the war until more rec ently .
I made an acquaintance of a French soldier who was a prisoner of war.
Even when I  even before the war  you know  for my parents to buy something like that was a tremendous financial sacrifice and I had absolutely no interest  none.
How did...from the Labor Board  how did you come involved in...as the war drew...drew closer in the war itself?
And are you hearing things about the progress of the war also?
Well  it moved me very much  and it certainl y made me realize what people had been going through during the war.
I should ask  do you recall the end of the war?
And thats how we knew that the war is really getting close.
This was a time where I registered as a chemist  as an inventor and later on this resulted me working on this super-weapon development which didnt turn out anything but it was a good vehicle to ride out the remaining mont hs of the war.
He said  you will work and help us to win the war.
You mentioned the importance of their lo -- of your parents love and support for you  in helping you get through  afte r the war.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 55We never went in  we went in on our destination because you know  its not written in stone during the war  it changes from minute to minute and the orders and everything because the strategic point and thing and the fights and the retreating of the army and all those things.
Now is that the uncle you were talking about -- about after the war  who came back and -- and tried to get the things from the people who were saving your parents things?
The war started  I still remember  Friday  1939  and we heard immediately the thundering of the cannons.
My brother in law which I mentioned before  was one of the top millinery producers before the war.
Having been a history teacher before the war started  I was selected to do that.
That was -- then -- that was a -- none of these divisions appeared again for the rest of the war.
>> Bill Benson: As you said  the war for you and where you were living at that time was over ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 in August of 1944.
Do you remember reading about the Munich pact in the in the newspapers  in Oh yeah  this Is that when you found out about this  or was it after the war that you No  we read  because it ca me out in the czecho in Czechoslovakia   in the newspaper  there were that was happened in in Munich  actually in some newspaper who were openly said that Czechoslovakia was sold.
But I wanted to ask you whether you wanted to say anything about your husband and your relationship with him  because last time we talked you said he was a stranger to you and then all of sudden you met him after the war.
And also  in the hotel where we lived  this German soldier was talking to my mothe r  I dont know  in German  I guess  and he said  he doesnt know whats going to happen to him  he really doesnt want to be a Interview with Lucie Ragin July 23  2009 11soldier  he might never see his kids ag ain because you know  its war.
I was fifteen when the war broke out and I was three years...my eighteenth birthday.
And I saw him many times after the war  all the others were -- They were killed. --
When war over  my parents got a room and my father returned from army 1945.
I met up with some distant relatives of mine  all survivors and there was a cousin of mine who was a rabbi before the war  and he survived.
Now  as the war began to draw to a close then  how many times did he help to spare your life then?
And there is  I think  growing a new national identity  which looks more at the chain of events  starting in the Third Reich  leading to the second World War  and the Holocaust  and certainly then  being in the background for the formation of the [indecipherable] republic.
Even after the Americans got into the war  we were always trying to get to Marseille to try and get visas to America because we have a 13 Town in central France which gave its name to French government after France was defeated by Germany in 1940.
A. 1940  May 10  1940  when the war broke out in Belgium.
And even my father  because my Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 57father was  before the war  very much involved in Jewish in Jewish  like organizations.
Ac tually there were a few not original from Lithuania because all were Kovno Ghetto  Kovno Ghetto  but in Kovno Ghetto the majority were Lithuanians  but then there were certain Polish Jews who run away from Poland during the war and Hungarian.
So -- and then they put me on -- on the build-building a railroa d. Its already the second year of the war and -- near Stalingrad  on the other side of the Volga  because there was none there to put on this side -- on the east -- west side -- you never know which [indecipherable] it was.
And I said  ﬁPeter  I'll come  but I hate it.ﬂ He said  ﬁI'll make it worth your while  you'll meet the people who are like me  who are born in the late 30's or in the early 40's or after the war and you will see that they want to know  they want to help  they want to do.ﬂ I said  ﬁI don't believe it.ﬂ I was very Jewish in this respect.
Q. Do you remember how you were aware that the War was over?
After the war we start organizing the...the escape of the Jewish people from Russia.
After the war -- he survived the war on the same camp as I did  Bergen-Belsen.
It was much later  towards the end of the war  and it was when we -- when we fled the farmhouse  we -- we went back to Amsterdam  and back to Mr. Initout  where we were originally  in his small apartment.
Wh en I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war.
The ultimatum was rejected  and September 3  my birthday gift  France and England declared war on Germany.
After the war I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this.
Just like during the war  you see  when the French made the Maginot line  they thought with a wall they can [indecipherable] the peace and the Nazis just walk around.
She took him to Vichy  they call  and she was hiding po the war  th-they because th ey when the Germ an came in to France they took all the all the Jews to the to the camp.
My Dad  keeping in mind your possible interest in our integration in American life  that this was also the period of the o utbreak of the Spanish Civil War.
And we were hoping that when the war was over  we would find them maybe in Russia  in Siberia  or someplace  but it never happened.
It seems as though you were able to immigrate fairly soon after the war ended.
Of course  Korean War now  as I know it  was really the -- a -- a piece of the larger picture of the Cold War.
Now  we three  we are natives of Kretinga and its better for us to be at home than anyplace else during the war.
It really switched around six months later  first when the German lost the battle of and went into retreat in Africa and th en  couple months later  Stalingr ad  that was the turn and in many people's mind  there was this possibility that Germany will lose the war.
What was his what was his experience  serving in the war?
Because order was given by the Hitler that this is the day to begin the war.
When we were still living in that house of this gentleman who gave it to us and we were so very hungry  we decided that I will try to go to city to people that we knew from before the war who lived in our building.
So to say that I was a total  normal person when the war was over  probably not if this was my daily routine of hiding a piece of bread.
Yeah  I mean  the atmosphere  there were st ill a few German workers in that Jewish department  actually  some even women  they had started to use women in factories  which used to be also unheard of in Germa ny  but simply because of the labor shortage after the war broke out  since you know most of the able bodied males  of course  served in the Wehrmacht  in the army.
We were  all of you know the war ended in May of '45  May 5  1945 in in Europe and we went back to - we had nothing.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 15 trucks hired by the Jewish Agency representative in Paris were busy transporting the Prisoner of War packages out of the American military warehouses to be used for the purpose I indicated at the outset.
>> Frank Liebermann: Well  I mentioned Munich  which in order to underline the threat of war from Hitler he called back all German ships at sea.
Sure  I the the end of war is really the end of war for for the Austrians  there was nothing.
When the war ended of course  on the other hand  we started to see the first displaced people  displaced persons  survivors of the camps and the brigade as you probably know.
And I had two friends from before the war yet  that we happened to be together as school girls  and I made them do the same  because they -- they relied on what I wanted to do.
So when we decided to get married in the ghetto and I mean you wanted to have a little something so first of all I had still my dresses what were made to order before the war.
Only in the beginning of the war  there was a -- what you call a razzia   and a -- a German -- German soldiers were going from door to door to find men to work in -- in Germany.
Especially when the Germans marched into Russia  he said that'll be the end  that's the end of the war.
War is not over and you are with them and you go essentially into military situations with them.
So so the picture that Im getting is that you were born into a well-to-do family  that your mother had come over Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 31 W-Well-to-do family which already lost a lot  but who will stay comfortab but because of the taxes remember  after the 1920 war  when we came back I wasnt born yet  but when my mother went west From Minsk [indecipherable] No  no  she went west to Poseland and she was stayed in Horvaths house  you know  where her brother was married  with my sister.
Certainly during the period of th e war  and probably thereafter  because we always had the theory that we didnt want the Germans to come back again in Latin America  particularly in view of the fact that the National So cialist philosophy was one that was anathema to most of us here.
For instance  to work in a all kinds of agricultural work that I was not really qualified for  but I could at least make a living and I think till the war crossed the River .
And they both had been in hiding during the war  right?
Before the war started  already feeling that it was coming  we were diggi ng on order of the government  we had to dig shelters in the 6 street against bomb attacks.
My firm--which was a Panamanian firm-a Panamanian consulate was closed  because Pa nama declared war on Japan.
He never was in Ge rmany before he was... After the war.
Although  I have to admit  that because of the course of events after the war it came easy for me in terms of  everything was facilitated for me.
I did not meet any of them after the war  and I dont believe that some of them survived in the Soviet Union.
And -- and I was active in the Zionist movement before the war  so after the war they came in  oh  this organize  I said  ﬁNo  I am a Jew here.
Although actually some of my fathers Lukower friends  that is the friends from the town that he met again in America  they might know her name because she lived with hi m. All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in Germa ny after the war.
Ah  I dont know what the problem– I only went to one grade  okay  before the war started.
Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 48 November 29  2012 When your children were the age that you were during the war  did that bring back a lot of memories for you?
It was on the water  and 27 after the war  the royal family used it as thei r summer palace  and the family couldnt get the house back.
Tell us about that time before the war and before Kristallnacht  about your family.
When the war broke out  Sam's father escaped to the Soviet Union while Sam and his mother Sara remained in Warsaw.
From my perspective today  when I look back to conditions before the war  I must say that the family living before the war was much more cohesive.
15 Interviewer: And your father met your mother after the war?
Among them were five thousand Germans who were free workers  a small number of French and Czech workers who were free workers who were only obliged to work there  and a great number of slaves of uh various degrees  prisoners of war  English prisoners of war  French prisoners of war  Yugoslav prisoners of war and so on.
The next day they put us on a ferry boat and took us across to Sweden  because Sweden went to Germany and asked them for  at the end of the war  and asked them to give  they should give them 5000 survivors.
And those were the da ys when they were beginning to find some of the Germans that had lied about what th ey did during the times of the war and lied about taking parts in concentration camps and came to this country and they were finding some of them.
And it was a town  population  I think  I would say around 12 -- before the war  12 000.

Its really strange  because I know were going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later  but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed  we sort of introduced each other  and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years  and I kind of ended up  not meaningly  sounding USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 4 like a Pollyanna  because everybody was telling not just horror stories  but of how terribly it affected them afterwards.

But when  after the 67 war  when they opened this road again  there it was  exactly wa As your memory.
I became friendly with two or thr ee of my fellow Polish students  but strangely enough  at the Polish student home in Munich  no one spoke of his war time experiences  and we were so touchy and respectful of one another that no one asked the other -- well  we might ask where you're from originally -- no one asked how did you survive  and I'm talking about non-Jews.
Now Athens pre-war  as well as post war  I mean  I think all cities on Sunday  they are so quiet  it -- it -- it sounds almo st de-deserted  especially in the commercial.

French Jew  German Jew  Italian Je w  you are Jew  you have to die.ﬂ And along those lines  you also mentioned last time that befo re the war and maybe during the war too  you thought of yourself that way  as a French person and then as a Jew.
And my brother  he...when the war broke out  he had a nervous breakdown.
What about the German prisoners of war you said were on this island  did you see them?

She got polio after the war  so it wasn't because of the war.
World War I. So she brought up her brothers and sisters.
But certainly  its only from a German viewpoint  the average German viewpoints only -- its necessary to -- to connect that with the question of the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war  or the murder of Slav people  and Gypsies  and others.
Well  it was -- it was very interesting because  see  it was a very diffic ult situation in some ways because the Poles consider themselves -- cons idered themselves the first fighters in the war.
And now the war was over  and I went back to the trade school  and I finished one year of -- to get a diploma in instrument making.
And they started to get lists of people who survived the war  to be able to match them up with children that were collected in the -- in -- from camps.

When I came after the war  I couldnt go to that brick  they build a garage.
Well  when after the war  when only my brothe r and I survived  she was real upset when we told her were going to try and go to America.
Let me let me just take you back for a second to [indecipherable] I I might even remember all these details and everything  but You said that when you when you were stopped at the border  and you had hidden your papers  you thought of the the prayer book that you had hidden during the war.
So  let me ask you something  you were a very  very young child when the war came in 1941.
And the case against Streicher was relatively weak because we couldn't prove that he knew about the extermination of the Jews until some information came in the war through the Sturmer   that he was talking about the Israelitische Wochenblatt   a weekly published by Jews in Switzerland.
And I am saying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War  my family sort of stayed to stayed in the geogr aphical locations they were  but all of a sudden they were citizens of three different countries  Czechoslovakia   Hungary and Austria.
And during the war  my brother was in the army for four years  and toward the end he was on a leave  and he went to visit Emma Goering  to see if she was still al-alive.
It was still the sa somewhat in the process of being formed  anyway  at that time  and this is here is the beginning of the war  too.
Because by this time in that -- immediately after the war  the first thing that --that we got right after the war  after we had this incredible jubilation on the Hooftweg  was that everybody hauled out their clandestine radios and their record players and their hidden Dutch flags  and the orange streamers for the House of Orange  and o -- sudden ly this stuff came out of nowhere  and we had 88 three day block parties  essentially  the whole city that I remember  everywhere there were loudspeakers running  music  and there was dancing in the street and there was just unbridled joy.
So that night  my mother tells me that she resorted to all praying and pleading for help...(long sigh)...at guidance for her family from the Lord for some way of trying to see what she could do so she would not get separated from her husband because that's how families got separated during the war  and she knew that if she had to leave  he would never find us again.
But h-his family owned some galleries in Holland  and so from Switzerland he went to Holland and when the war started he was not allowed to emigrate any more and he was deported with his parents to one of the c -- camps in the east and exterminated.
All the time they said he is a kozak and they brought him straight from the prisoners of war camp to the 9th Fortre ss  and then it was already 1940...1943 when the Germans were in retreat  so they wanted to...ga ve the order to dig out from the pits the corpses burned them  put them on fire  so that there remained no...no sign of the cruelty and and the murder  so there were I think sixty-four uh Jewish...sixty-three Jews and one Polish woman...sixty-four  and they were in five  six in each .
They also went through a war where they  you know  where theyve lost some loved ones.
I suppose it was a question of upbringing  because afte r losing World War I  for which many Jewish Austrians were great enthusiasts  they they suddenly found that war is hell.
When the war in Europe was over  did you make any attempts to find people that were left behind in Vienna  when you had left?
This was a Jewish family who went  instead of going west went east and found refuge in Shanghai  lived out the war years in Shanghai and then came to the United States.
Why I say this  after the war  my friend came back.
At that time  Russia held about a quarter of a million Polish soldiers in it prison of war camp s. Russians wanted to use those men to defend Russia .
I would ne ver think of saying  ﬁYouve got to hear my story.ﬂ I myself wasnt interested in my story when the war ended.
I was sent to concentration camp  and my brother was in prisoned of the war.
But what happened is  when the war started  there were obviously -- I was 19  so one of them was 11 and the other one was nine.
Do you remember th-the day that war was over  or not?
Slovakia enters the war in 1941 when -- when -- I think so [indecipherable] -- when the Soviet Union wa -- wa -- when the Soviet Union is a -- is attacked.
So -- i -- i -- after the war  my father used to go to church because he thought -- he -- he started saying  ﬁThey USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 56 going to kill me.
Well  we were all -- the American Joint Distribution Committee  they were in charge  even during the war  with some of the aid that they distributed to us.
Interview with Margitta Cooper January 4  2002 98 That is the calamity of the -- of -- of the second World War and the Jews; it is the fact that the Austrians  the Germans  the French  all the rest were allowed -- not only allowed but encouraged  to act on festering anti-Semitism that had been there for a very  very long time.
Well  like I say  that you know  I remember Pearl Harbor   that I remember  and you know  during the war  I mean  I dont think there was we didnt know that much.
And then I could say it  and then they let me go  and they said  ﬁThey are everywhere as spies among us.ﬂ Because about a year and a half before the war  two years  you could get -- the families could get a German maid so cheap  and they lived in your house.
But on the third day of the war  we  for instance  communicated to the International Committee of the Red Cross  that we had organized ourselves in a special little committee in which we are dealing with the world -- with the war affairs  and that we wanted to be in contact with them  and we were certainly the first to take this -- this in itiative.
Can you tell -- Th-That was -- that a Jewish fighter is -- you know  because I -- I always thought about those -- you know  I didnt know where -- where -- where my family was taken and -- and til -- til you know  I was liberated 1944 and my feeling was that Im doing something beside as a fighter  Im doing a duty for the -- you know  something for the -- for the Jewish people– That -- and that -- I was able to do something– Now I -- I came back after the war to my -- I was liberated 1944  in -- in June.
She wore a sheitel which is a wig  and va -- she was with us during the war and of course  died in the war.
She didnt do it for money  because after the war  when Julian joined the army  and the first money I got  I went to her  and I gave it to I wanted to give it to her  she wouldnt take it.
Uh and uh also because the there was already a war going on in Europe uh by that time  of course.
It just sort of reinforced the -- our feeling that we were fighting a just war  that whatever happened  it was right that we should be in the war  that we were the good guys  white hats  even though there are times during combat when we we ren't nice guys  but combat is like that  you fight to survive.
>> Bill Benson: In September 1939  the Soviet Union and Germany attacked Poland which really begins World War II.
The war began in June as I know  as I remember  22   41.
Yeah but before the war there were fences  natural fences  like you can see in each city  that is a suburbs they are living like in a village  like a cultural village so everybody has around his house a fence.
I opened the door  uh  and I saw those 3 Germans  one in the green uniform of the German SS  and the other one  uh the  the 2 other ones in black uniforms of the so-called Volksdeutshen  which were the local Germans who sympathized with Hitle r before the war  and they were traitors to Poland  and when Germans uh occupied Poland  th ey all joined uh  uh  uh the German army or whatever unit they wanted  and the German in the green uniform said  \ You are arrested on political grounds  puts uh together  a few warm clot hes  and all the valuables  your jewelry  your money  put on the table.\  (
And then here are pictures of after the war of my mother and myself.
Let me ask you something about -- again ab out returning to Bosk ovice after the war.
My aunt -- One of my aunts and her husband and the daughter  they went back  because they had two other children that -- they learned about their survival and just so happened that both of their daughters were -- they had distinguished themselves  you know  in the war  both with the partisans and later  the civil administration.
After all  you know  to be 12 days in a war  being all the time on a on a aerial bombardment  you know.
And it took awhile  until  well  at one point  much -- not much later  but in 1950  there was a war in Korea and I was just the right age for that.
The only h-help they could give to us  its either to hide a Jew  or to take their belongings and hide them  hopefully to give them back to them when they come back  after the war.
And after the war was lost by the empire  Hungary was carved up  many of my family members ended up in what is now Slovakia  Romania  Serbia.
So  the very eastern part of Czechoslovakia was very close to Russia   and thats why it was so  later on  during World War II  Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia was ceded to the Russian sphere of influence.
Now  I had gotten quite a number of invitations like that  because ma ny people knew my parents well  my father  before the war.
Now  she was after the war then tried in a German court  well first she was tried by the Russians who everybody hoped would just finish her off  instead they gave her just a 10-year sentence from '46 to '56.
The situation before the war was already ripe for this  but like a like the churchman said 1 National Democrats (Polish); abbreviated from ﬁEndecja.ﬂ 3 in Poland  ﬁBoycotting is all right  the Jews.
I remember that the war br oke out in 1940; that he was there  and he helped my mother a lot in the ho tel in that time.
My father thought now the Netherlands was neutral during the first World War.
from the end of the war  which  you know  such a such a small detail  but its an important detail when you dont know it.
And then ...then when the war came  to France  1939  we have really also suffered much.
Mr. Estelberger forced his daughters husband  his son-in-law  to be come Germans  by which the grandson  Alphonse  became -- became liable to serve in the German army  and he lost his life  shortly after the war  in Russia.
3 your parents were in Budapest in the years leading up to the start of World War II and the Holocaust?
Oh  there was a systematic preparation of the German population for war.
And  as they had nationa lized a number of things  number of buildings  number of factories and so on [indecipherable] Yugoslavia after the war.
I remember one day shortly after the war  a man totally knocke d at our door.
Yeah  when they had the war within a w eek or 10 days they occupied Poland.
And he introduced me to the girl who was really from Germany  from Berlin  but she had spent the war years with her family in Bangkok and was sent to a Dutch school there.
It had before the war some 300 000 population and now with the refugees the town had over a million population. ..
If the war would have lasted a little longer  they would have been dead also you know.
It was mostly  in  maybe 3 one third of the population  about 100 000 at that time  maybe a few years before the war  there were 100 000 Germans living in Lodz.
But th -- one thing that some of the people  not all of them  but some have said to me that by sort of the da y of liberation  or the time of liberation  the end of the war -- Yeah. --
No  my grandfather died before the war  and my grandmother died before the war.
Not only did he survive from having been in Auschwitz from the earliest days  but he was sent to be a slave laborer  all though Germany during much of the war.
The inflation didn't go unscathed by us and there was rationing of food and it is one of the few recollections that I have of being with my father after he had gotten back from the war and we were riding out in horse and buggy and opened freight car like in order to go to a neighboring village and buy from the farmer four geese.
We didnt know exactly what was supposed to be happening but we always hoped that maybe th e war will end and everything will turn out all right.
If he was born in 1893  then he would have been of draft age at what point  17 - 18 years old in the middle of World War I?
He went to Europe for a conference in 193 9  but before the war started  before September.
And she lost her first husband in the Jewish Brigade during the war.
The reason I know  when we came back after the war to Theresienstadt  we went to look up the original records.
When he saw that the war was imminent...you know it was just about any time now.
5 Well  I would say by the time the war br oke out  yes  when we didnt  yeah.
02:53:48 Did they -- did people get to go back to their homes after the war ended?
That victory in St alingrad had special meaning for me because it really was the turning point as most histor ians say of the war in Russia  but also the turning point of belief in what was coming among those people who had to survive...the remaining Jews.
So it was a three part city that lived pretty much in peace til the war broke out.
So that was already battleg round  that was war already in full force.
And life changed tremendously because OSE came back and reclaimed their children  their hidden children  and my c-cousin Kurt and I were split up for the first time in the war.
Only they  when those people stood with red flags  my fa ther  Mama and I  we a ll worked -- walked to [speaks Lithuanian] The War Museum.
And then I spent my days going into different small coffee shops  because in daytime I couldnt go to that place where I lived  so -- but it was very na tural that I was wanted in Sweden because you couldnt have Norwegian refugees running all around the country  in a war.
Are there are there any other memories  fragments of memories from that time  about the war  about the occupation  about perhaps conversations that were had about these things  that that you can recall  when you were still in Vilnius?
Okay  and let me ask you one more thing ab out Vienna during those time s  in doing some of the reading and preparation for meeti ng you and talking with you  I understand that there was a fair amount of anti-Semitism in Vienna after World War One  did you experience it?
Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8  2010 49 Looking back on your war experiences  did it change how you felt about Germany or Germans?
So this was in -- during the -- the bat -- World War two  that he had lost his leg?
I think the war was still on  and coming down to the hachshara that was in Perez  and there wasnt enough space.
Cause th-the surviving sister came to visit Martin often after the war  after he -- when I was there in Wiesbaden.
You see the first years  '42  '43  the war went bad for allies.
And I have no feelings of hate  and then  especially now  it's already after 40  50 years after the war  those younger generations  they are not responsible for it  for the co-co  what the parents committed  what crimes the  the parents committed.
So  one day  when the Korean war started out  th-the store didnt do that well  and the man what he has his partner what I know was not a nice person when he started with him  he was desperate  Chaim.
Yeah  he was he went into the army after the war.
And -- you know  we were all  after the war we were all -- we -- we didnt particular think that we had done such great things.
Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war.
Any war is horrible  but it was done by an intelligent  educated  bright people  to take a whole nation and say vermin we are going to make the earth clear of you and have everyone pa rticipate.
So that's Chaim want to go to the farmer where he worked before the war.
And ‚99 was a very happy year  and before 1940  until 41 when the war started in Russia and Germany.
You mean jer before the world war world World War II?
When the war was over -- now  from a personal point of view  toward the end of the war  I knew I was not going to marry Manfred and we were talking about marria -- he want -- he wanted to get married and I knew I couldnt marry him.
Really  during the war  I co uldnt believe from five sister  one sister  her fri ends Š about ten friends from her class survived.
It was  but we weren't  if we had fr om 1939 until 1946 already it was  it was already after the war  it wa s heaven.

Either that they were ordered to do it  or that they had to do it as a pa triotic German when his count ry is at war.
And he called me and told me the following  that during the war a German soldier came to visit him and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 11brought a message from my father which st ated that my f -- my mother had been -- had been massacred together with 30 00 0 Jewish women -- women and my father and the husbands and the relatives had to look on.

Well  I have a after the war I had a lady who used to do my washing  a German lady  refugee lady who had a bunch of children and she escaped from the eastern part of Germany to western part of Germany  she has a daughter  was ﬁRita the Virgin.ﬂ And I went out with her daughter a few times and she says  ﬁStefan  be sure that you dont go to sleep with my daughter.ﬂ I said  ﬁFrau Anders  139 I would never go to sleep with a beautiful young girl.ﬂ ﬁRita is a virgin.ﬂ Well  we called her from then on  we called ﬁRita the Virgin.ﬂ ﬁI would let Rita sleep with a rich American who would give me a big bag of Polen kaffee 140 unground coffee.
So  fo r example  the prisoners of war who had been killed  are not recognized the victims of the war to that kind of some kind of the defense that Russian would  after finally admitting that it was Russians  at first they said th-the the German forces came with the po the Russian prisoners of war who are in Russia.
Perhaps later on  but its -- its appropriate now for me to tell you  because you asked me this question about Thanas sis  that at the end of the war  when I returned to Athens  within a couple of weeks there was the so-called troubles  between the central government  now liberated.
Suzy Snyder: But she was born right before the war broke out  right?
In the last moment The last they they put this in  the saying about hero  because after the war I met some of the guys who did belong to it and and they wrote it on [indecipherable] paper that I was  and didnt touch it because I wa snt a hero  I wasnt fighter  I was only fooled by myself and I was hit by a bulle t  which I shouldnt stay there  at the window.
Did you have any idea what was happening elsewhere in Europe during the war?
And and so the first days of the war  your father is someplace  and you dont know where.
When you when yo u were here  when when the war was over  when you were I dont know when we want to start talking about this  but you must Im assuming yo u had some other fears  fears of Well  let me just okay.
When I when the war broke out in Israel in 1940 se end of 47 fighting  I was already trained good.
Just a -- Yeah  something like that  yes  not like boom  boom  in the war.
But the war years were pushed aside because I was busy living.
So this was basically my understanding of -- of -- you know  after all was said and done and I start -- started reading history  it go -- just confirmed what I have already experienced  that this was not a war like any other war.
Lets say  we had so many refugees in Warsaw during the war  as the Germans advanced from the west Okay.
So it wa s terrible  but what happened one day the...the war was getting to end and there was a...I saw on the side there  there was a transport of...of German Army  a convoy going on the...the high...highway  not far from the camp.
I need to...we need to stay with what happened during the war.
Can you tell me what happened with your sister during the war?
And dur ing my painful years of the war I always remembered his last words an d I felt that I must survive. (
Did you hear about the war in other places in Europe for instance?
And that's where my family settled for the rest of the war.
>> Henry Kahn: Well  I learned it after I was in the United States   after the war.
And I had a friend I met there too  after the war  and he was a barber and he came here first.
You described for me the time for you and your family in Czechoslovakia before World War II and before the Holocaust as a time of hard work  but also a good life  one in which you said there was a sense of safety.
But he was in the war  and he was in the military from the beginning of the warŠalready before the war  he was a military.
It was getting worse and worse and from the small town around the war zone  which were German liquidating  they were bringing everybody to Warsaw .
Uh the Kamerlings having been arrested uh in the very early stages of the war and sent to Westerbork were in the nature of trustees in that camp and had uh quarters other than the barracks in which most of the inmates lived.
Ah  going to pogroms  basically we are talking about what was happening in Russia under the Czar  and every time  you know  there was some problems like  for instance in 1905  Russia lost the war against Japan  and here the charge was made  and naturally he would send the Cossacks to kill Jewish communities.
Here is the police registration in -- in Karlsbad where  for the first time since the war  I gave as my nationality Jew.
And I remember these three Gestapo men coming in and searching the house  and one of them stopped by and spoke in broken Polish  and asked who was winning this war?
And when I  and after the war I did  I was invited to Peking where at the palace I was given a palace for the weekend.
When the war started  I was working for -- how do you call that?
When the war ended  OSE  the organization that had put you into hiding with the Bocahuts  removed you from their home and took you to an orphanage.
This was the family that hid us during the war  my mother.
That was the end of the war  and then the woman next -- across the street from us  she was a spinster.
So  for a few days Bulgaria was at war with all the countries in the world  both with the Allies and with the  with the Axis.
During World War I  both my grandparents and many of my grand uncles ha d served in the Hungarian Army with distinction.
Til once happened that somebody told me af ter the war  that a woman  very tall and skinny  a real musselman  sh e somehow came to the lager  to the other lager.
Theres one thing that happened during the war that I think that it made me a whole different person.
I dont know what what would have happened  what kind of person I would have been  if the the war hadn't happened.
Obviously  it was not within their physique to take it too well  but other than that  they were not deprived of food or any kind of things  which was later very prevalent in the war.
What were conditions like at the time that the war ended?
My sist er was married a year before the war  therefore her baby was born the 26th of August one week before the war.
He said  some of you boys will have to go to Japan when you finish the war here.
But 8 jewelry and other kinds of things of this nature amassed into significant dollars in those days  the reward that he received from the many others that wound up after the war -- if you recall  where was Eichmann?
And it -- the other thing that was interesting is I went to a public school   and before the war  religious education was part of the public school education  and during that peri od you had English  whatever  geography  history  math  whatever  and then it was religion  and the Catholic kids went to their class  and Jewish kids went to their class  and it was  you know  history of -- of the religion.
I mean  it was basically I guess from we were suppose well  we were supposed to leave in in August of 39  or September of 39  and just when the war we had packed Interview with Ellen Zweig March 2  2010 12everything up  after my parents had made special furniture  small for here  because they knew the apartments here were much smaller  and we moved in with my grandparents and then the war broke out.
It was a very sad thing  but we didn't know  because the medics could have be en backing us up  but we were so far ahead -- actually  the 11th  when the war was over  we were the furthest east of any American troop.
Of course that view of myself uh changed very quickly once the war came  because my Christian friends reminded me very soon that I was not one of them.
So even before the war started in '40 other international events and domestic events starting to  to  to uh  to occur over there and the Iron Guard and other fascist organizations become more powerful.
After the Germans broke through and got to Paris  the Italians declared war on England and France.
You would help  on some corners they had what they called the   where they made soup for something like a nickel  you would get a bowl of soup  good soup  good soup and you would help there by firing the cannon  or by cashing the money or something like that  you would help to collect raw material that was used for the war effort.
I came across  myself  before the war  cer tain episodes like  when I used to walk to visit my father in Abarrov.
So there's still -- the war is still somewhat going on in different parts of Europe  for sure.
The Polish manager  the   said to us  \ Look  it's going to be pretty soon the end of the war and you can do whatever you want.
After the war  Jacques and Annette were placed in orphanages  then later adopted by an American couple  Harry and Rose Fein.
Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 65 And then the war started  so he  as a scout  went to help in that hospital  because he knew thats more important than that  but he was going not to be involved.
I asked him would he not grant permission for all of those military prisoner of war packages to be removed from the warehouses for this purpose of feeding hundreds of Jews on this journey.
I understood only after the war when he boarded his train on Monday morning  there was absolutely no guarantee we would see him on Friday or Saturday.
So  after the war  when we were liberated  and my father had come to my ho use where I was hidden  he -- he took me along up north  where he had been living all that time  because we really didnt know what we were going to do.
Now talking about the reaction of non-Jews to the Jews  when I was in the army I went in the war.
It was so tempting and I knew if I could get my hands on something like that  I could probably live un til the end of the war by bartering that for food.
He just [indecipherable] tolerated it  and he didnt come back  an d I inquired after the war if there are any relatives of his  and couldnt find anybody.
And where were -- what were -- where were you in the War of Independence in 1948?
And forgot all about it but when the war was over  you know  we had to uh report every six months to the police and they presented us with this signature and with this promise.
After the war he was called for the Nuremberg Trial  and my father then [indeciphe rable] this man wasnt a Nazi  he saved a thousand people.
To some of them  this was not the Dachau but the fact of being in the 20 th  and in the war was probably the I dont mean to sound disparaging but the biggest thing in their lives.
And she she she embraced me and she said  you tell tell my son that I said you will survive the war.
So they felt very safe the this point after the war  which they did not feel before.
There was no synagogue there  and of course during the war  I was never bar mitzvahed.
05:27:00 Can you think of how -- could you talk about it after the war?
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 75 So wi so in Russia  while you were deep in Siberia  you knew that the war had broken out  but when the you go to the secret police offices  the NKVD  and they tell you you are free.
While the old people that build the organi zation in 1917  after the first war passed away  slowly but steadily  we took care of it.
I was...never had money floating in my hands as much as...that's be fore we went into hiding...this is the first two years of war.
Page 10 At work  in the metaleines workshop  did pe ople talk about politics or military issues of how is the war going for the Germans or th e Russians moving  fighting back  or the Allies  the Americans and the British?
And your father begged her to stay  and he said  the war is coming  the war is coming.
Now this is interesting  your father fought in World War I ... World War I  by the Hu ngarians and the Romanians... The Romanians gave him the pension... The Romanians gave him the pension and when the Hungarians came back they took away the pension... they took away th e pension and took away... the lis cence uh... the liscence for the cigarettes ... Because he was a Jew?
Still the same the same system  the same like how the fir first page  to the w-war to Germany   and war machinery  bulletins.
I was initially in Feldifing after th e -- right after the war.
passing by with our Mercedes in Poland   a burning tank  a Tiger tank  which I know  by chance  because the driver said  this is a Tiger  was was the biggest German tank  and one of the last inventions in in the war  it was built up.
And so Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 157 This is when you came back to Poland after the war?
When  after the war  when we had to go uh  when we were in Lublin  one of the men say to us \ You can come and live with us.\
But this evolution of your Judaism and your relationship to the religion may have taken the course it t ook anyway  but can you identify or can you discuss at all how some of the experi ences you had during the war might have affected this?
I mean  it was just a question of evil against good  and it was just impossible that Hitler could win the war.
at the end of the war  which camp were you in?
It would -- i -- i -- I think it -- it -- its good to remind them  in your mind  of things that were also good in our lives  before the war.
In 1940  when Hitler told Horthy   whatever his name was  from Hungary  you can re-occupy this area  Maramures   you can re-occupy that you had it the first before the first World War.
And I  I just played and we lived in that apartment the whole in Vastergatan during the war we lived.
So you  as a young man say  13  14  15  you were beginning to see yourself fighting in the war?
And was that close to the end  or was th -- It was close to the end of the war  yes  of course  and -- and then the boys were [indecipherable] and I went to a marvelous -- well  she was a nun with a very strong character and so on and she was in charge of an orphanage and so on.
Because Eisenstadt where she was born before the First Wo rld War it belonged to Hungary.
So  they said if you go to Cuba  its the easiest way to come to the United States  and then we remained there for 11 years because the war broke out.
And then by the time I was close to 15  15 1/2  I was pulled out from there also and I had to go to work for the war effort also.
And after a few years  when I was a little boy  my parents moved back to Poland and -- before World War I. This was Galicia.
But that building survived the war intact  and it looked as a va -- as I remembered it.
A -- a war crime is a murder in a situa tion in which a war is properly conducted in the Judeo-Christian interpretation  according to the laws of Judeo-Christianity  in which you kind of go contrary to the laws and do the killing  even though the war crime legal setting would not allow you to  or not order you to.
Before we get to your work in your fighting group in your resistance  during the war  Ive heard that your father hid a Jewish family  or hid Jews and I wonder if you can tell us that?
And there wa s a pair of white boots in the window [laughter]  it was kind of a silly thing in the middle of a war  but anyway  it was a pair of white b oots that I kept looking at.
In Krakow   it was a other  naturally we couldnt go out  we couldnt kill people any more  it was after the war.
I almost got involved directly in well  I did get involved in a way  in the Yom Kippur war in 73.
What are your feelings toda y about how the war influenced you?
I would ho pe that my war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about others.
Was that– will you say something about your relationship after the war?
But I dont know– The camps that the Red Cross– I mean after the war began.
We went from Luck  which is near my hometown of Horochow  we went to Krakow  which was Poland  it was after the war  because we still had to wait a while from the time I was rescued  I think it was about eight or nine months before the war came to an end  so we went to Krakow.
We didnt speak English  but they cut the wires  and they told us we are free  because the German ran away from the camp  they locked up  and we didnt know the war was over  either  but we understood whats happened.
Well  as a Jewish person  before the war  I knew -- like I said  I knew I wasnt equal to the others  because I wasnt treated that way  but I always felt I was  in myself.
SE: Nineteen-four -- in the war -- 1942  or the 43 - 42 - 41.
And after the war  we -- we always heard that he suffered terribly.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 After the war  Jacques and Annette were placed in orphanages then later adopted by an American couple  Harry and Rose Fein.
So  this is Irma Deutsche  and standing in front of my father is her daughter  Edita Deutsche  and the interesting thing about this picture  its taken in Zagreb  that its picture is in black and white  but the photographer has seemed to taken it upon himself to hand co lor the signs that they had to wear that said  ﬁJewﬂ  and this is what they had to wear during the war.

And in ‚39 before the war started  maybe a month  the town was small and we knew each other.
And that's when the war ended  Fi rst World War  1919 or so.
And the search to be able to go Palestine as it was at that time Before the war I didnt know but after the war they  but my brothers they were in organizations and like Bet Tah or other  the other ones.

He was in the military  he enlisted in the military when second World War started.
The po -- you know  the war started September first  1939 -- in all the history.
During the war I had to It was ironic actually because during the war they would sayŠthey didnt have enough sugar or enough nylons.
Yes  I think it was in '44 until the war was over in '45.
Holland as a -- a country did finally make so me blanket payment of a coupl e thousand dollars to everyone who was caught up in this war  with the understanding that you then didnt try to sue them  or get anything back.
What happened to them?ﬂ And ever ybody used to tell you the biography of the war  the concentration camps  of the lif e  what they had there.
You were just mentioning a moment ago  off tape  about yo-you -- before the war  as you said  you were an atheist.
I used to...I...my brother was older...I went on vacation there  to stay with them and then the war broke out in 1930...uh 194041.
That -- thats the way it was  until we came to Germany  we realized that the war was coming to an end.
And because in all the time I lived in Natrona  I don't know how many years  20 years  you know  after the war probably  and I just forgot about it.
If you want to see from the Civil War  if you want to see about an ything with the Indians  parts of lands  how everythings there.

>> Could you talk more about how the war affected your spirituality?
So being a child I didn't know that  Iearned after the war  but what I remember is the Riga Aktion.
Your two sons  were they did they ask you  as they were growing up  about what the war was  and what you ha d gone through  and and anything?
That was a year or two later after the war and they married and they went to Israel  but they went to Germany camps to wait  waiting camps until they were transferred to Israel.
And then started the war and I went looking for a job  and they sent me to Siemens  Seimens .
We had some 3 500 accused that had been denounced in the war crimes case at Dachau.
When the war was over  I tried to get abitorium which was awful and I went to a school which was  we were all Jewish or half Jewish kids who wanted to finish high school.
Soon as the war broke out -- They -- theres not -- -- the mail stopped.
My -- Luckily  my grandparents  and my uncles also survived the war.
When the war broke out on Sept. 1  1939  most of our belonging were already at the ra ilroad station at Katowice  on their way to being shipped to Israel.
Re -- during the war  because my parents were sending me to school  and in Romania -- In Romania. --
And then lately  just before the war  he was owning his property which was not far away from Kielce  by the name of Ludinya  not far away from Czestochowa.
I would like to ask you to describe your childhood before World War II  when you were growing up.
What sort of things became import ant to you based on you're experiences during the war?
And Ive always vowed I would never name a child after a relative who was killed or died  because my brother was named after the oldest so n of my grandmother  who was killed in World War .
One of the reasons that Hitler could take power in Germany was that Germany felt that it had been badly treated after the last war in 1918  and they spoke about it.
You see  45 then in Stum  and this again  I wanted to stay to alive and I feel that even in Stum  one day came very good information that in Warsaw  this uprising  it was in August -- I'll never forget  it was August 1944  came informa tion to everybody the Polish  you know in Warsaw  and I said \ Oh my God  maybe it will be the end of the war.\
So  at the certain moment you feel that -- y-you are afraid be -- the adults are talking about the war.
We thought that if the war w ould end everybody would come and try to help us.
So he said to me  \ I t's not the partisans  it's not the war.
So he -- that became a major part of what he had after the war.
The war is over  the guy is alive  he went back to Paris -- he was hiding in the south of France  he was -- went back to Paris  opened up the same business  and he had the nerve to use my fathers trade name for his own business.
And Well  the nine months that youre in Britain before the war breaks out  youre not receiving any kind of schooling?
>> Bill Benson: I wish we had you for several more hours because what David would tell you about  once he left Panama  the exploits  if you will   to get from Panama to Israel and then to ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 fight during the War of Independence and then return to Panama  just an entirely different story to be told.
You remember maybe or you know something before the war Hitler had in the place of   before it was a corridor  they called it  the train passed from Germany through Torran to Dank.
Well  one...uh  we were uh  pulled out of that duty for uh  two weeks  a week or two weeks work in guarding a uh  large military prisoner of war camp.
Okay  now  after the war  when I was come back home  I found everybody survive.
And God knows we had to win the war if we wanted to survive.
I don't remember the name of it but there was alwa ys around a little older  an instructor we used together for a couple of years before the war st arted.
And the Lyba actually  if not Lyba  we wouldnt survive  because he was a village Jew  and his profession was he was a trapper before the war  and he knew the woods.
Did the German Jewish -- And the -- -- community empathize after the war and -- and -- I dont -- I dont know that there was any -- any real relationship after the war between the German Jews and the eastern European Jews.
And in this place they had a man  a Russian guy who came  the first World War II  he married a White Russian  and his name was Matt Rosov.
Yes  we suppor ted the German war effort  for the love of Pete  reluctantly and only for a while.
You know  the war wa s over by that time  and the Army still hadn't been demobilized but the war was over  so this was a miracle that we had survived  it was a miracle that he had survived.
There were  you know  af ter the war  I suppose there are some statistics.
Uh there's another stor y of uh which was given by Professor deYoung  who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from Holland  and he was a young man and and and the government of exile in Holland during World war II  and was in charge of radio emissions  and he gets hold of some of my reports  and he reports in a lecture he gave in Washi ngton...no  in Harvard  some time ago  and uh tells the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of Holland  .
Now from the 47 six  two from my people before the war  they were Rabbinical students and they were very nice boys and they were very capable  went back to our town  to Kolbuszowa  because they said we are now free.
I never really saw them after that until after the war.
And it was a technical school  if you want to be an engineer or something– as far as I remember in Poland we had  I think it was in 1933  every student had to wear  I dont think in the ghetto was  but before the war it was on your arm  on the left hand side.
Q. Would you say that your life befo re the war  you had a nice life?
Where did your...where did your unit end up when the war was over?
It was a pity to look around the Bema the people what survived the war.
Well  I -- in -- in these trips to France  I remember allowing myself to reconnect with some of -- not only the relatives  but with the people I had worked with during the war  those who were still living.
My grandmother was taken to a hospital where she lived during the war.
My education was interrupted for quite a few years until I got back to the University of Michiga n. Well  actually I went to a High School in New York after the war and they mainly taught  just learned English an d the American History because I needed that for my citizenship.
Yeah  after the war we wrote to the Red Cross to inquire about my moth er and my sister  when and the Red Cross told us they went to for two years and then they took them further away and sorry  we ha ve no  we have a list of the survivors and my mother and my sister's not on it.
S o  between my brother fleeing -- my -- her brother  my mothers brother fl eeing  and saying to his sister  why dont you drop everything and come  and the actual things that happened after he left  they must have done some things  including the fact that when we finally ended up at the home where we -- where we were hidden for the war  and led into the basement  there in the basement were two beds that I recognized as having come from my home  and a quilt and some bl ankets that I knew were from home.
>> Suzy Snyder: Did you have a hard time giving up Catholicism after the war?
In the early days of war  that means 1939  '40  there were multitudes of organizations  underground organizations  all eager to fight Germans.
So they took a lot of prisoners of war  and they were still in uniforms when I saw them  because we were guarding them then.
The first thing my father did  because he was always nostalgic -- they suffered a little bit -- more than a little bit -- about anti -Semitism even before the war.
And  so my parents decided that they would establish the fact that they survived  and claim Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 138property in Vienna that they had before the war.
My mother turned on the radio and we heard that a bomb  a couple of bombs  were dropped on Warsaw a nd that we were at war  that Germany bombed Warsaw without declaring war.
I -- I -- I know at that time I had no thought of the war ever ending.
Can you tell us please about the cases that you treated that deal with problems that were caused by the war?
I was so focused on -- on my school and on my activities and this was not the -- the youth of today dating and going out on Saturda -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 50 But -- but -- well  I -- I gue -- the thing thats -- thats -- thats -- seems impossible for me to comprehend is  what was the progression in the pre-war and the early years of the war  in your understanding of what was exactly taking place and why it was taking place?
We were not gas -- there were gas chambers  which I saw after when I went  after the war  two or three ga -- not gas chambers but crematorium.
I think in contrast  I think I had been much more affected by the -- the war  though I did not see the -- the horrors that he did  but by the separation  because I was at an -- at an age wh ere I could begin to -- to think about things like this  and in -- in -- internalize them.
And so so yo u know  then  towards the end of almost at the end of the war  in July of 1945  because everything was being liquidated and  you know  the British and the Americans were going to move out of there too  we were taken by train to Baghdad in Iraq.
My fa ther went -- was in the service for four years as I told you  he was wounded in the war.
So -- And they send me back -- send me into -- to Germany  instead of -- in the Korean war.
Well  I want to find out; do you remember what it where you were when you learned that the war is over?
And anyway  I sa -- we survived the war and after the war  I was in the ballet with Sonia Gasco.
Yeah  totally  I totally sort of divorced myself from my real self and chatted with them and later on I think I felt sort of elat ion that  you know  that I was able to put up such a front and  I mean this whole  in the beginning I changed  in the later part of the war.
George  while the full brunt of the war would not come to Hungary until 1944  the lives of Jew s in Hungary including Budapest would change significantly once war began.
I had absolutely - I came out of the war like a racing horse coming out of a stable.
Did you feel a particular warmth for the Russian people having sacrificed so much during World War II?
They lived through where  during this 1992 war  there was a lot of talk about where the majority lived  and it was mostly on the border between Bosnia  Serbia and Croatia  going much further east.
But now I usually write Je wish  its just easier  but I -- you know  I dont think I really -- I didnt -- I think  because of what happened during the war  I didnt like af -- being affiliated.
Every day  this was in '44 just before the war ended  they had some American and English prisoners and they would parade them and the Americans would go with the V sign and the Italians applauded.
After the war in America my father was utterly fluent in English.
>> Bill Benson: Before we continue on with what it was like for you living with the Harrisons both during the war and a little while after the war  your parents  of course  when you left  were still in Adelsheim and your brother  Herman  was with them.
However  during the war  Germans -- it was very lucky that in our town there were somehow more liberal.
So I went into -- I went in -- had an interview with her and she said -- she knew that I wasnt a survivor  she knew that I hadnt had anything drastic happen to me during the -- the war  yet she said  why do you want to do th is?
He wanted to make himself economically indispensable -- or near ly indispensable -- to th e war effort.
Theyre interested in the war itself  and they continue  as I s told y mentioned  to turn out books on the origins of the first World War  another one comes out every year.
And now youre back after the war and youre no longer wearing the star  youre no longer distinguishable from the rest of the popul ation.

My father had five siblings  two male siblings survived the war and one female.

I had already been out of contact with the tr oops and what was going on in the war because it was -- because + two months  shot down in June and I wasn't captured until August  so... When the knock came on th at door in that Parisian apartment  did you know straightaway that it was the Gestapo or was it - I didn't know who it was.
If you'll say the threat from the Nazis is over but now you're occupied by the Soviets in an absolutely devastated city  what was life like for you immediately after the war?
Also was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used to spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war.
I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe that the Poland going to lose the war.

Then I was united my sisters and my mother said before the war t hat we should all meet back back to Poland so whats happened was that my sister says its no use to go back to Poland.
And Hedtoft almost broke out in tears because he was facing the war and the war didn't respond.
Then later the lawyer  Vladimir  her husband was taken to the war in this time.
My mother actually was most of her time in just the family and then the war started then.
The only scary part there was apparently they knew that that was in effec -- there were als -- there were also French prisoner of war camps around there  and they didn't bomb us  but we -- th -- we mo -- they move d us into the -- into the place where they kept the ammunition.
Did your attitude towards religion change as a result of the war?

And...uh...of course  many people had from World War I w eapons that they brought home  souvenirs  sabers  a long saber they carried these tremendous sabers  and some had guns and many had knives and a law was passed  ﬁNo Jew is allowed to have any weapons  any knife over a certain length  etcetera  etcetera.
In a war situation  if you are Jewish or not  if you are caught  you are killed.
And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother  who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship w ith my fathers brother  is after World War   when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother  they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo  who obviously had a very good military record  and said  ﬁWhy dont you come back into the German army?ﬂ And he said  ﬁWell  you know  Im Jewish.ﬂ And - and apparently they said to him  ﬁWell  w hy dont you just say youre Christian  it wont any difference ﬂ and -- and left it.

Not too many was Communists in Poland and still was some and very funny thing  after the war the Communists go to Russia and was killed later there by (?)
I met him at a dance  at a synagogue dance during the war.
One point I wanted to make is that always the German afterwards  after we won the war  always pretended that they did not know  and that's absolutely not true.
I had an aunt here who left Germany before the war.
However  on my dad would go once af when the f-first World War was over  he went to he decided he was going to go to Germany.
So  weve talked -- Hanne and I have talked a little bit about just how your experiences during the war have sort of affected maybe the -- the -- the type of parents youve been and the type of people youve been in terms of -- ML: Well  look  weve -- -- and the kind of choices youve made.
But one of the things that they did was the Russians -- the Russian Army basically laid down their weapons and became prisoners of war.
But 70  I could s [break] Okay  so my interest was  why I have a question about Mr. Ronniker is this  if he was a pre-war diplomat to Germany from Poland  how is it that he even had any position at all during the war years in Poland?
Larrys mother  also a German Jew was incarcerated in Theresienstadt  a -- a survivor  e-e-eventually in Auschwitz   and -- but she  like m-my mother  survived the war.
And I fou nd out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the war is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self -preservation thing.
Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1  2010 39 Because maybe they were afraid that after the war somebody will point a finger and say  oh  you were a soldier.
And and three of those si blings  all boys  escaped to the United States in before the beginning of the second war or the first Wo rld War.
And I gave them the message  happy knowing this is the end of the war.
So some of the boys after the war  May 8th  1945  some of the boys I found a couple of Jewish boys in the sa in the unit.
16 Why is Denmark different from other European countries in regard to anti-semitism and what happened during the war?

I feel that the Nuremberg international war crimes tribunal  wh ich was signed by 23 nations who had been very directly  and some i ndirectly involved -- Right. --
Where we lived before the war was actually where the main ghetto was set up.
I did receive  finally  my visa  but the Haas fa mily did not and at that point  since we had lived through thick and thin through the war  I decided to let my visa lapse  even though I was told by the -- and I told the consul I will go when the others will go.
Well  you know  before the war  there were a ll kinds of rumors coming from northern Poland.
They were not against it  and they knew the war is here  and people get engaged earlier  or even marry.
Then at the end of the war  it was the fifteenth of May  1945  I escaped from this prison.
They never succeeded to defeat the Romanians but after the war they took it.
I he was in World War I  he was a soldier.
Before you turn to the war years and the Holocaust  tell us a little bit first about your family and their life before the war.
But I do not feel  frankly  that I have a copyright on either the 1930s or the war  and that if someone else would like to do this  they are welcome.
And at first the Polish forces were winning  and then the Soviet forces got all the way to Warsaw   and it looked like that the Poland was going to lose  and they were going to enter the rest of Europe   but they wha-what is today called the miracle on the Vistula   Marshall Pilsudski   together with Marshall Foch   the French support came up with a very good military strategy  and beat the Soviets  and took hundreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war  and th-that was the end of the war  th-the the Soviets capitulated.
Which it was that it was shameratsyer  that it was a youth organization belonging to the Zionist organization  and th at spark kept through me  it was the new thing  just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto  and become a resister  and fight the Nazis  this is how it was  the new fighting that it became in me  and I assume in the rest of the guys that are war with me  because when people reso rted themselves to go on train -- to a -- rooftops  and on the steps to go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable] on their shoulders  and speeds of the trains maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour  maybe 60  ttimes 50  doesnt matter the speed.
So  that was very  very lucky  but the overall picture of -- of the Cold War and Korea  as it was in -- evolving  was so far -- no  it wasnt foreign to me  but it was a -- I just could not comprehend it.
At the end of the war  after the war was  was over  General Bill Donovan was very interested in  was one of the first  I think  to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major war criminals.
And there was a war and the Romanians fought against the Germans  the First World War.
After the war he was what we called [Speaking Non -English Language]  meaning he got a pension from the French because his father was killed.
War production and I was assigned to that war production which was a big barrack in Terezin  built outside the camp.
I guess they were on the boat when the war broke out  or some thing that close.
And they cannot say  ﬁHey  we give an SS man.ﬂ Say yes  wasnt in the war  and while I was in concentration camp  I dont get it.
Toward the end of the war  a group of German prisoners was being brought in and uh when I uh interrogated them  one of them quite uh freely admitted that he had recently come from Berlin  that he had been Hitler's chauffeur  and that he  he had been present uh at the time when Hitler committed suicide.
A. No  no in those days prior to the war  no.
My mother worked with him after the war in different organizations.
When you were drafted  the war had started but the Unite d States hadn't been involved yet?
It's sort of a strange questio n  but when you started working  you probably worked with some people who had not been in Europe during the war.
I had a brother there  a tailor  he was doing subcontracting  tailoring  and I went to him for a while  then I went to work for somebody else and I worked until 1939  ‚till three days before the war broke out.
I had one time -- I -- Are you talking about after the war now?
DL] Were you interviewed after the war at all for your experience at Auschwitz?
I think I had a couple of weeks of the second grade and then after the war  after we came back in Rainin  I  they  they kind of  I mean lots of children had  had not had proper schooling and I kind of had the third grade  sort of.
Uh  uh  I think the one you're referring to is actually a uh  a German prisoner of war camp.
Is there a feeling that th ats a place that your -- the whole family will be able to stay for the war?
Uh  by early '44 the officer corps of the  uh  of the  uh  Czechoslovak army in  uh  in the west drops some officers down  and these are the officers with who  with whom th ey served prior to 1939 and they say look  we have to start getting ourself ready becau se the Germans are going to lose the war and so the officer corps uh decides that we are going to  uh  uh  attack the Germans when the time comes  when the...in order when the Russi ans come over the Carpathian rather than have destructive  hand-to-hand combat because everybody sees that when the front goes this way and that way through the Ukraine  there's nothing left...we are going to try to attack the Germans from the back.
At that time the war in Europe was on and British bombers would come over Berlin practically every night and bomb Berlin.
So here are people  not only students  but you 85 know  veterans of a war.
And listening to these the radio programs of the day  like the trace of lost persons  the FBI and peace and war.
But overall  the time after the war was not -- before I left for Israel  was not entirely smooth.
You know  Im trying to get a sense of you know  the war is just ha You know  in beginning  I look a-at al l of them like theyre all killers.
And Budapest we found right after the war what was going on they had fighting going on between Buda and Pest.
In fact  I talked to a survivor  and really there are two stages of survival  one is survive the war  another one is survive the post-war.
And one such train was a prison train  with -- guarded by soldiers  with -- with bars in the little windows  and right away the rumors spread that this train was a prison train for the followers of General Vlasov  and General Vlasov was a -- a traitor to the war effort because he -- even though he was originally a very heroic general  he surrendered to Germans and he promised them to fight on th eir side  along -- and he recruited lot of former prisoners of war  maybe mostly Ukra inians.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 >> Dora Kl ayman: War crimes trials  yeah.
And then he realized that there must be German prisoners of war on there.

Before we turn to that time of the war  tell us a little bit about your life  your family  your community in the years before the war.
One is  what do you remember as your time of greatest fear during all of the Holocaust and war time?
They did give us a place to sleep and they did give us food  but we  both of us felt we would like to -- and they helped us to -- to get a room by a German family  the first one  Frau Beans  I think  I dont remember  a war widow with a son and with her aunt.
So you see  my idea of -- of war  after it was o -- after the second war was all over  was really that it brought out the beast in the human being.
They dont go into the war until June of 1940  when they attacked France .
I was trained in Serafand  then I went to Egypt  then I was retrained in Serafand  then I went to Egypt again  and then I went to Italy and then as the war finished  we moved up to Belgium  Holland  France.
My mom and I and sister before the war  we lived in Broday.
But thats where they ja -- I thing American military thought  or whatever it was  I dont know the reasons that they had some factories that were making materials for the war effort.
Before we turn to the war years  tell us about your family and your community and you in those years before the war.
Being that my wife had here family  and family from before the war.
And at that time  Chamberlain and Daladier decided -- I dont know whether decided  they thought if they give in this little bit to Hitler  they avoid World War II.
So the Germans were actually -- I mean  really in my opinion they were not superior to anybody because they were superior as far as the material go -- went  the -- the -- the war material  but once the allies got to the point where they overtook them  there were no more heroes.
And he was the one who was killed in the war.
And fortunately for me  because here I was on a war of my own  and which was not allowed  but I found out that he had been the guard in a concentration camp.
When th e war was over  the Russians came in  in Lithuania.
This outcome is even more remarkable in light of the fact that 90% of the Jews in Belgium at the beginning of World War II were foreigners  many of them in the country illegally.
They were manufacturing...uh...um... stretchers for the soldiers  and...uh... other things that were helping them for their war ...uh...purposes.
Of course  I didnt know about uh the Holocaust until after the war was over.
You just -- if you hear anything its about the war itself.
Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its doors  and I went to Rome.
And you couldnt get passage because the GIs were coming back  the war brides were coming.
I don't think that I understood that it was liberation day because I don't think I understood that we were at war.
Well then  the head of the Swedish Red Cr oss  a fellow name -- name -- fe-fellow by the name of Bernadotte had made a deal with Himmler  that he would try to negotiate with the allied and get a peace going  and the price for that  Hitler had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that all Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- concentration camp inmates should be shipped to Sweden until the end of the war.
And uh  they also  uh  toward the end of the war they tried to  to perse...prosecute him about those  uh  things.
Weve got to move to a certain area of Lodz  which was the poorest area of Lodz  which was called Baluty  you know  its funny enough  a lot of Jewish people lived there before the war  you see.
>> Bill Benson: And do you know what their life was like in those years before the war?
After the war  they met and they survived  th e parents  and they lived in a small town in Poland after the war  and we lived in a big city  in Wroclaw.
I was born in Ashoshok and raised there until the war  I was staying there.
Yes  I -- I li -- do  because its like we coming to the war situation here.
I think the -- the man in ch arge is the one who signed  who  being a Jew -- his name was Izrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war  and during the war  the consul of Spain in Salonika.
She had co me to France to see us  so J ackie -- when I talk about what happened during the war  he was always with us.
And there were some young people picketing  you know  and protesting the war.
I know he was with his friend who became his brother-in-law later becau se they married two sisters when they came back from the war  back to Warsaw.
He decided I needed to tell them that I lived in France before the war  in my stupid little French  and -- and that I -- and my na -- and th -- and ga -- he gave me another name to sound more French.
So I know they lost a lot of money during the revolution  Russian revolution  that when my mother used to talk about  but -- Can you remember what your grandparents home was like in Pinsk when you were little  but -- but not -- not during the war  when you were little.
Why you stay in the oil business?ﬂ The first -- so  and -- I was more close to Maurice  he was close in age  and went through together all the -- all the war years.

054 Lillian: My official schooling came to an end in 1939 when the war started  when they bombarded Warsaw and when the Germans ma rched into Warsaw.
We crossed the Rhine and then we went to south Germany  but that was in the -- near the end of the war.
In Witzen (Ph)  1939  half a year be fore the war started  I had to visit another man with whom I worked together for several years who was a representative of the Danzig Jews.
The teacher got very huffy initially and then  of course  worri ed because this was right after the war and they had to go through denazification and all of these things.
Do you remember finding out about the -- the official end of the war  and -- It was just one of those transi-transitions.
But the story that you tell  for instance  abo ut your brother hiding  how did you... There was that woman on the third floo r  was like  how do you say  easy  easy going  and after the war went to her office and suddenly I feel a woman giving me a slap on the face and shouting and and everybody turns around.
So  they were not allowed to use in the schools in Vienna after the war  any of the German textbooks  which meant that everything was dictated to us.
Three  if the Gestapo ge ts me and I don't come back afte r the war  find your father in America and take the children to him.
Then I said -- I just thought for a moment -- I sa id do you have any photographs of before the war?
The war had involved both Deso and me because Deso was a psychiatrist and kept people out of the war  with certifications.
We had a relatively comfortable middle class life in Budapest before the war.
You can spot a Jew during the war  they looked super.
What did it mean to you that the war was over?
Well  when I survived the war  probably not until I finished school I should say...even in school because uh when I went to high school uh Hebrew was offered and uh I needed a language requirement and that was an easy language requirement.
And I reproached him  and after the war when I met him  I said  \ I could never forgive you for having said that.\
And thats where I made it all the way through  through the whole war  wouldnt -- I didnt get killed  would you believe it?
Of course  the times were from Depression through World War II.
Well  I think I have covered what I wanted to cover about your time in the Resistance and Im probably going to move on to the post war ins -- I thought we could maybe take a break now.
If I told them after the war  there was a Sobib or   never heard of it  and never heard of it  and that hurted me so much because I thought it would just be forgotten.
I want the china on table.ﬂ He says  ﬁI want the silverware on the tabl e  and the napkins and lace because  just because there is a war doesnt mean that we have to eat like animals.
And so we stayed there for a few months and then the owners of the villas wanted to get their villas back  so they moved us to a place near Bari  a camp that was used -- it was a -- this was a Italian military camp before the war and during the war  the ge -- the Fascists kept their internees -- Jews from Germany and from Yugoslavia  were interned there.
During the war I was  uh  a Marine Corps lieut enant.
Well  as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through  were driven through the town and the treatment of them.
My -- I -- if I can answer you this  I must go back to moment where my father was during the World War  first  was prisoner of the war  and was working four years during the war  arrested by German  and was four years in camp  where wa s working 94 -- ni -- ni -- 19 -- 19 after Polish state  it was created.
This mo ment I have to tell you  first of all  I went in a girl from from my house gave me an address  she got a starv a brother-in-law in Poland after the war  he was a very religious man.
There was prisoners of war  Russians  Soviets  you know  Ukrainians  whatever.
4 >> Bill Benson : At that time  March 1939  the war would begin a few months later .
Yes  but that was after after Id left  and after America was in the war.
Cough) Another thing...a thing happened to me which is one of those incidents that uh that reoccurred over and over during the war where something happened over which I had really no control or or when it happened I had really no way to project what it will lead to that allowed me  that that that saved my life and gave me an opportunity to continue  you know  with my struggle to survive.
Okay  I would like to know what happened for the rest of the war. \\
Is there anything that you wanted to ad d about the war  or your life before the war that we havent discussed?
And during the rest of the war years  from 40 to 45  how much correspondence and communication was there with your aunt who was still in Germany?
So we was tha -- we didnt even know when the war fi nished  because I tell you how we find out.
Next year  1939  the war doesn't start until September 1 when Hitler invades Poland.
Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 25 July 14  1995 No  I couldnt tell you exactly how long  but I was home for August when the -- when the war was over  the Japanese war.
Wasnt really until World War Two that we got out of the depression.
We were in our warm bedding  bare footed and sudd enly we saw a tremendous army entering the village  blood splattered soldiers  fighting soldiers  spent completely  and all kinds of war machinery  a nd we didn't know who they were .
Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17  2001 17 What stands out in your mind about th e time from 39 when th e war broke out in Europe until Pearl Harbor?
The Hilfsverein was an organization set up by the National Representation of German Jews in Berlin to assist people with their immigration problems and since America was still out of the war at that time  there was -- Jews still could immigrate.
But you know  even after the war when we came I was proud to come there.
People looking what they lost in the Second War  what they go  how to give them direction  what they do  what they go and how they can find help.
We didn't call it the holocaust  of course  we called it the war  or the camps  or the Nazis  whatever.
He will help Mother  and he will -- he always -- he survived World War I  he will survive this war.
>> What has the significance of Judaism been for you since the war?
I really have no idea where or what or how  but I guess she's one of the 6 million Jews that vanished and that died duri ng the war and nobody will ever now where she is.
tape break] had some wonderful de tail about the road into Dachau and how it was towards the end of the war and they were moving so fast that the food drops couldnt keep up with you and sta moto motor oil was a priority  that that you were without [indecipherable] No oh wi oh no  it w-we were with the third army and we were moving so rapidly that we had no time to have food .
So one of our neighbors denounced my mother  and we know it's the neighbor because after the war we found that he was using our silverware and our dishes.
Thats the people who lived through the war  they came from Russia with children  they killed them all.
But all of the people who maybe lived not in Slobodka before the war  they had to come to the ghetto also?
Th-That -- that was the notion we had  and I think there is perhaps another indication of that  that when the w -- the war broke out  and Germany attacked Russia  only about a quarter of the Jews from Latvia fled with the Russians.
But they obvi ously dont want peace [indecipherable] You think they want war?
They mu st have escaped from the oncoming liberators  whoever they were - Americans or Russians or w ho knows what; we didn't know anything about the status of the war.
And even  I thought  I mean  even even Napoleon  whe really a reasonable military leader  he did things  and I thought well  Biržai will be also in history like Jaffa  you know  some cruelty which happens during th e war  you know  without any reason  something well  what do you mean  I m ean Jews were hiding weapons.
Before I wanted to say  I went to school before the war it was a church.
The British soldiers came on April 15 th  the end of the war on May eighth  and the -- and for me the 10 th or 11th  so something is miss -- something was missing  and then I gi -- went out and met people  they saidsays   ﬁOh  you are still alive.ﬂ We didnt -- We -- We didnt think that he -- we are alive.
This was just before the war broke out  a few days before the war broke out.
And  but somebody further down obviously did  and we eventually found out in the end that he  hed been brought up in England and erm  when  his mother had married a German soon after the First World War  and moved to Germany with him  and after  when he was still a baby anyway  she left her husband and brought him back to England  and of course he was brought up in England.
So it wasnt -- Was there any thought about the trip  that it could prevent your sister from being caught up in the -- in the -- the war  in any way?
What did you start learning about or realizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on?
I played soccer after the war in Czechoslovakia  a little bit like a national pastime  like baseball is here.
And they  and th e war  early in the morning we heard the Germans marching in.
It was not so good with his health after the war as also like to get close.
Remember  I was I was in the war  I was discharged from the Pacific in the early part of 46.
Since I mentioned that things were bad for the German army  and it seemed like they were losing the war and it was like toward the end  so at that time some Germans...civilians might have been a little kinder and maybe they helped some because of the fright of what may happen to them for what they did.
After the war  after the collapse of the government -- I'm sorry.
But she said  Mr. Menn  go back because the war is coming.
If I will kill Germans after the war  and I had a chance when I was liberated.
And so half a year later  war is declared on Poland.
I read the paper  of course  and while I read the paper  I also learned English more   and and I can only say th is  you see  that when the war started I was registered in class 4-D  which was clergy going to school  because I went to the Yeshiva and they were exempt from actually joining the war  even though I tried to join the war and but the only thing was at that time  either buy war bonds  or I even tried to join the war by being an air raid warden  but after awhile they told me  you cannot be an air raid warden  I was considered an enemy Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25  1998 6alien  despite the fact that I was Jewish in the United States  and I always had to get permission even to travel  lets say from Baltimore to Yonkers  where I had a little shop  in Yonkers.
I mean they heard from many of the older children who retraced their steps  tried to retrace their roots during the war.
During the war there was nothing for shoes   especially in Europe.
As I said before  probably  since 1941 or even since the beginning of the war  I dont ever recall having to give anybody my name.
So  does that mean towards clo clos er towards the second part of the war?
Did you have knowledge of the extermination camps before the end of the war?
And from there  I start to -- start the Second World War.
After that were kicked out and Russians took it back until the moment when the war between Germany and Russia broke out.
mili military  who was in the first World War with my fa -father.
We were very close friends and this was through the whole war.
And the war was [indecipherable] was fascinating  because they advanced  they went until Moscow  and it is a phenomen onal  it was extremely -- plenty of tension  and -- and -- and -- in-interest.
>> Al Munzer: Well  after the First World War  after the demise of the Austro -Hungarian Empire  when Jews were somewhat protected  there was always the fear of pogroms  of persecution  and of the possibility that they would have to leave their homes in a hurry.
And...uh...uh...in the meantime  he met friends...made friends in Detroit and when the mission was disband after Pearl Harbor  he got an offer of a job in the war industry in Detroit and was permitted to migrate to the United States.
Of course  nothing was the way it was at the time  becau se in the meantime there was a war.
And the people that I knew felt that the Germans needed to be executed themselves as a result of what they had done during the war.
Uh  can you tell me about any of your recollections uh from your childhood  before the war began?
How much longer did you spend in Europe after the war was over?
Were a lot of the dental problems a function of the -- Of the war.
They were allies for the first World War II  which is why Hungary lost territory and had some deficits from the war.
So they had some difficulties  all the result from the First World War.
So that is and the widow of one of the brothers  of Henry Batlaj   did survive the war with two children and ended up in France  where my parents never really contacted anyone after.
Because when my friends from Venezuela  we only 18 Dutch families  and I knew them all because those women married mostly  they ha -- they were engaged  and then they got this great job after the war from Shell  so they quick got ma rried and they had their first baby their  and the doctors only spoke Spanish  and they were scared stiff  because [indecipherable] they were expecting their first baby  so I was called out for every delivery  and they all became my friends  and they were like brothers and sisters.
But before we had a chance to be really that scared  we saw American  people in American army uniform running out from the woods and they saw us and saw how we looked all scared and  you know  and they said  \ It's the end of the War  end of World War II.
But me being only ten when the war broke out  I really didn't know much.
We -- this what happened just after the war  and I started to think independently  was that I started to understand the great effort of my parents  and parents of my friends  that they fought to reach this independence.
Well  this is what I want to ask is  do you have a memor That was the time close to the war.
How could the war be over if we are still in a camp and they are marching?
Can you tell me where -- do you rememb er the moment you heard that the war had ended?
>> Bill Benson: Once the war was over for you and your family  what did your father do then to try to build his life back?
Tell me  when did you s did you find another job  during the war  when the Germans were there?
>> Bill Benson: When Germany invaded Poland September 1  1939  starting World War II  Warsaw was attacked that very day.
And actually  people st ood watch in the neighborhood  on the streets  you know  there were sort of like citizen patrols and it was clearly war time.

In 1968  he came back home to Hamburg and he told the German authority that he's back from the war  he was in the Wehrmacht  that's the army  and he likes to get a pension from the German govern ment.
Were you ever confronted w ith moral choices that were difficult to make during the war?
And we knew that the -- we just were praying the Russians would win the war.
And he decide and he neve r went back  he so he was lucky  because the war broke out a year later  and he was in England.
The Germans had excuse for the war that we are all Communists.
I was in the war  served durin g the time of Korea.
And when the Naz -- on July 21  1941  the war started.
Can you recall  what was the sense in this country to the news coming out of what is now war torn Europe?
And also with your parents  just to repeat what you said  you did not really discuss war years with them.
In fact  one of her first friends  girlfriends in -- in Baltimore was a girl -- a young woman who -- who had survived a -- a camp and -- and came back after the war  from Sweden.
We managed to communicate after the wa second war a little  but my parents were in the process of diso divorce  anyway.
Did you find an alternative way to practice your religion after the war or was that not important?
But after that  the war and everything  they been we have to leave Africa  because we went only  you know  for during the war.
So I phoned to my friend  to Vsetin  my native  native uh city  where I was native  and before the war I was in connection as I told you to this  to transmit  to help this crossing of the borders  and this man who was enterprise man  and he was also involved in th is.
The other -- I guess the other question is  there were these various organizations working after the war in Europe.
I didn't have nothing to eat after the war  26 nothing.
The end of the war happened one year later  May 1945  May 8  1945  and I remember it was announced by the sirens.
There was a school in Italy where Jewish families could send youngsters to this school to teach them how to be a Marine and how to fight at war  and they were preparing for it at that time  the beginning the Jewish Army  the liberation Army in Palestine.
We werent aware that the soldiers were going to there was going to be a war .
Had you ever before the Germans came  before the World War started  did you listen to the radio outside of you know  radio broadcasts that came from London or other places outside of Poland?
From there on for the next following four years during all the war time  I traveled from one prison to the other.
It was  you know  trying to take up something that could help the German war effort -- Right.
Yes  she was killed dur ing the war  and two young women slept in another room.
The war is over  in fact the war ended  unbeknownst to me at the time  th is unit of the dienst stella ost  Colonel Holters and two of his officers -- we decided to send them to Augsburg  and then from Augsburg to our special service sta -- our own detailed interrogation center  our own service station in the Ardenst  in Revan.
What did you learn from your pa rents about what their experiences had been during the war  during the time you werent in contact with them?

And by that time I had handled a British major in the col -- in the prisoner of war camp  Id handled a C.I.C. major  and once you have handled a C.I. major  you can talk face to face to an American general.
My mother told the story after the First World War ende d  Yugoslavia is created in 1918  she's 10 years old  they come into school  they say OK  tomorrow  we're going to change language.
What were the signs of -- of th e war now -- now encroaching  coming?
When we came to the posters  it was a Declar ation of War.
Jews were in the small minority  there were people there from  there were Frenchmen  there were Italian  soldiers who were interned by the Germans somehow after Italy changed sides and declared war on Germany in 1943.
So they decided they're going to build a camp  a war camp near Krakow by the name of Plaszo w. For about two or three weeks  we walked every day  a group of us  from Krak ow and then there was another detachment from the ghetto to Plaszow to prepare for the camp because that's where -- their way to build the camp.
Would you have felt willing to go and fight in the Korean War if you hadnt been involved in this student– or what were your feelings behind that?
The house was built before the war  originally it sold for about 6 000 dollars.
I had not known of that existence  and the madness  and the badness of the war was really beginning to come home to me  when I heard these people who had escaped by night over the mountains.
I think you mentioned that your mother after the war found the passeur who had taken the money from you.
Were you members of youth groups  were you involved in anything as the war approached  '39  '40?
It was January twenty-one a nd the war was continued until  as you know  until May. So here was all the time moving Russian truc ks and armaments and soldiers.
She sent me food packages and money and so forth So your Uncle managed to survive midst the ruins of Warsaw until January 45 and then he was liberated by the Russians and then at the end of the war --?
This whole idea might have s ounded good on paper  but it was  of course  done mainly in order to smash the voice of th e workers and to enable German industry to increase production and mainly war producti on  without any disruptions.
And and Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 25Id like to know personally  for you  for your family  where were you  and how did you learn of the war?
And then I'd like to you tell me a little bit about your childhood and background before the war.
I said I know people here what they killed Jews during the war.
But he was executed three days before the war su pposedly ended  in another camp  in Flossenburg  where they execut ed a lot of people just before the end of the war.
He was a very distinguished establishment lawyer from New York  originally been fr om Philadelphia  and he knew nothing  really  about the specifics of the trials or of those particular accused; he was familiar with the overall trials and in fact supported them in the Department of the Army when he was Assistant Secretary of War.
So even when the war starts  there is a possibility to leave?
Did you I guess my larger question is   did you go back to any of the places  whether it was Wilno  whether it was Nesvizh  whether it was the various towns you had been with your mo ther  after the war  to see what they looked like?
I didn't know during the last years of the war where I would go  so I knew that I had to do something in Holland and by coincidence in touch with the underground and that is why I started to work for them  but after the war  so many people in Holland talked oh I was in the underground too.
Interview with Jacques Ribons 61 So you kept in touch with them after the war.
We come into we are -- one thing after the war when I was there  we had to stop somewhere and there was a little .
I came right after the war and when I came here to the United States in contact with people who helped me as a surviver.
6 >> Sam Ponczak: Right after the end of the war  right.
Only to say that after the war  I was seven years old when I got back to Paris.
But finally -- and this is when we came  in 49  to Pala -- Israel [indecipherable] was Israel state after the war of liberation  where I had the reunion with my sister  my grandmother  with my uncles  with the whole family  and Norman with his brother.
But then the united -- I mean  England went to war.
Privately everybody knew that once they lost Stalingrad and they started around back  that they would lose the war.
You know  I went down to the American Embassy  the old one which was destroyed during the war.
I belonged to a Zionist organi zation during the war  it was Dror.
And because the Germans lost the war  in the First World War also  it became Romania .
Was there ever a a sense was there di wer did there come a time where you could sense that the German war machine was slowing down?
We are now -----------------  but the feeling was  was getting too early in the war  we didn't what they going to do with us  but we  we  we were stuck we seeing  we start seeing that the older people are going to one side and the cripples ones and the healthy ones he's putting other side.
When I went away to Siedlce and when everything finished and the war finished  I went back to Vengrov.
And so  as a very young person  my experiences of the war were watching th ings being blown up by -- as the war progressed.
To me it sounds like youve had such a varied life  with so many different parts to it  and so much you know  a a child hood in a smaller Polish city  the war and the Holocaust and Oh yeah.
We were young then  and here the Six Day War  with Israelis  what are we doing in South Africa?
End of Tape Nine 186 Beginning Tape Ten I think what well do is well close off this part of the interview and I will come to New York and interview you on your life after the war.
I say  yeah  I was in Prague for a couple days after the war  I was trying to get the visa to go to Switzerland  which of course they wouldnt give me.
As a matter of fact  uh  some of them  I met  I met after the war  uh  two of them or three of them I met when I give evidence in Nuremberg against -----.
And and during and after the war she went back to Germany once and stayed with my father  you know  so I mean  they were very good friends  they really liked each other.
So  in in a months time the Soviets attacked Finland and became Finnish Winter War.
I was just doing the best after the war you have to understand  I mean we had things so good after all these things.
I wondered  because you've met so many other survivors  what the average effect was on their religious beliefs before the war  the effects on them  and how they felt afterwards about their faith.
But you you and your family expected the war to be over so you could leave  I gather  right?
After the war my mother was not there and because -- maybe because of the war we didn't keep any kosher.
My mother managed through the Red Cr oss to send a telegram to Palestine to say that we were still alive and this was...it mu st have been in like 1941 or beginning of '42 6 which he got  and so my uncle in Palestine somehow heard of a an exchange that was planned between Palestinian nationals who had been caught by the war in German territory and German nationals who were caught by th e advent of the war in British-mandated Palestine  and so an exchange was planned for these  among these people and my uncle contrived to try to get us on that list.
Did you notice anything in Paris related to the war at that point?
But he said out of the Rosenberg  what they producing out of the Rosenberg files is a tremendous number...amount of materials on slave labor and spoilation and the stealing of art treasures and all this kind of thing  but they haven't produced anything that directly ties them to aggressive war.
And he was in World War I from the first day to the last day and was in every major battle and wounded three times.
Then ther e was a brother  the youngest brother and he came through the war.
Yes  well  when you say house  you know it was -- th-the University of Washington had -- all the universities were packed after the war and they didnt have housing for their USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 107 students and -- grad students or anybody  and -- not enough.
Effect on you from the war  that you  th at you can piece together.

We just knew that his two sons ran away to Russia at the beginning of the war  but we didnt know about Uncle or -- or his wife.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 247 Oh  this is pre-war Poland   before World War II Poland borders.
>> Bill Benson: Jacques  before the war  have you been able to piece together anything about your parents' lives before they came to Paris  the family  anything about the family in Poland before that?
He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the orphanage or whatever  and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young 01:21:30 women to a place at the outskirts called Marianske in ghetto.
I didn't know we could writ e letters and my father-in-law knew   he came later to Warsaw then we and he brought this and th ey been looking and everybody ha d machines and you know they needed this  from cotton made; they used live befo re the war  WWI  in the same building.
And he was very  very concerned to the poin t that when the war seemed inevitable  he and my mother drove around the country  looking for a house that we could live in and -- outside the city  because we didnt know the city will be bombed.
So that was very recent from the time that the war had started in Yugoslavia  which was April 6.
And after the war she married that son  a physician who had a successful practice in Syracuse.
Do you think that these experiences during the war had any sort of long term impact on you?
He  of course  lived to eat his words and ended up in Israel as probably I'll talk about this later  at the end of War Two and with the establishment of the State of Israel.
And then  of course in September 1  war breaks out when Germany attacks Poland and Britain declares war on Germany.
We loved each other and uh the war broke...took everything away from... Where did you grow up Adam?
Otherwise  of course everybody -- we went through all the things which were done during World War II.
The day we arrived there the Russian war commidant was not there and his under link di d not know the procedure.
So What did you do when you heard it was  the war was over?
We were in the eye of the storm  but we never knew what was happening  of who was winning or losing the war  or how the war was progressing.
Only  oh  less than a month from the end of the war in Europe and I had to do some import -- I mean some essential work  so I worked for the -- really some clerical work  a filing clerk in London for a time.
Came to the U.S. >> Al Munzer: I think my mother just really wanted to get away from all of the memories of the Second World War  of the Holocaust.
Of course  then they used them to put the Je ws in af -- especially after the war started and nobody could leave Germany any more  th at was a -- a different story.
By that time  in the beginning of the partisan war  the major things that the partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do  was A  kill known collaborators  primarily to elevate the morale of the people.
And and it all that secrecy was not lifted til after the Vietnam war.
Oh  I heard this and I heard that  soon the war will be over.
This is tape one  side B. We were just discussing again  your ex experiences during the war  and you were mentioning the -- the various places that you were in hiding  and one question I wanted to ask is  how many of the places where you hid  how many knew that you were Jewish?
And my brother went to a peas ant which lived a little bit above our home  and the men of the peasan ts were in the war.
Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war ... Well  I had a mother and father  of course.
My father went into the war in 1914  '14 to '18  World War I. He ha s a business already.
In fact  my mother thought she would not survive even after the war  because she was -- she was like skin and bones.
No  I didn't know much Yiddish but after the war in the camp Lithuain a Jews eating in the kitchen getting the food because we didn't have nothing  th ey heard us speaking Poli sh they said no  only Yiddish.
57 A. There were more  but after the war I met them in Torran and one in .
But his daughter  who was in in Kochetayev   and wife  they came back after the war  they were released  and they went to Israel.
And we live until 1941 until begin the war be tween Russia and Germany.
SL: Ma -- When they had that missile -- missile in the Iraqi war?
Were not too many families  because everybody came out of the war and today  you see a guy and tomorrow he disappeared because you know  they said the biggest freedom is when you have nothing.
I -- and I -- I just wanted United States to go and bomb Serbia and stop the war.
So there was  ev en among the Jews  there was some kind of a way  when they was talking from years ago when delegation went to Roosevelt about whats going on and -- and it was -- During the war  mm-hm. --
S: Very little  except the uncle who lived in Jerusalem and during the war when we were still living in Onod  he would write to us and he would describe the mountains of 45 Jerusalem  the beauty of the country.
Their job before the war was like federation  we have it in America.
Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 39 I didnt think about it  and it was fa r  far away  and the news we were getting from war communiques provided no clue of the direction or success of German penetration of Russia.
>> Bill Benson: In fact  once the war began  it became a troop transport ship.
You left off with-you had just finished talking about your schooling and you finished describing what happened to you up until the beginning of the war  of being in school and all of that.
And it was quite and I decided then and afterward that I will leave after the war  if he's in trouble  I'll help him.
It -- you know  give me some background in Europe and -- and also the war of Japan.
For a while  I traveled to Usti nad Orlici (Czech Republic) c.715) or the German name for it would have been Aussig (c. 716) and hoped to settle in Czechoslovakia because I was ... When the war ended and from my experience and knowledge of the Czechoslovakian pe ople  they were the friendliest people I have ever come across.
And they said  ﬁIn your -- with your background  you got yourself education after the war  which we consider college education  [indecipherable] military [indecipherable]  and you -- so -- so you entitled to it.
>> Bill Benson: And once Germany invaded the Low Countries and invaded France in May 1940  full -blown war is on in France at that point.
And after the war she found out that the man she was living with was actually a spy for the Germans.
And that was the first day of the Second World War.
Before the war  how were relations I mean  many Jewish people say that Poles are very anti-Semitic  or that anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland.
Lot of people came from Israel  they were te-telling us stories how Israel is building up and about the kibbutzim  and this was very interesting for me  so I was the whole my life I spent til the war time  in in the Zionist organization.
They must know how it was difficult in the war and what for  for what reason.
A nd after  after the peristroika  Jewish uh Jewish artists in Lithuania stated to collect what remained of Jewish artists from before the war and may exhibitions.
The Americans were trying to -- to promote and to present the side on Vietnam war to the Israelis.
We used to think that she s a very old women  in those days she was only 54  or 53  you know  at the -- in the war.
Uh  if the war ended six months earlier  a great many more would ha ve survived.
And on the -- I th ink it was the 3rd of September  when the war broke out  I was sick.
My father volunteered in World War I  went to the front  became an officer and got decorated with the iron cross; really believed that he was doing the right thing to risk his life for Germany.
Its and its the war is something awful in my eyes.
When you look back at yourself as a parent  what influence did your war experience have on the way th at you raised your sons?
W e were spared because after the declaration of war  manpower was in short supply and in Long Island City which is not far away from Jackson Heights there were some small manufacturing facilities producing parts for among other things  tanks and submarines.
As a prisoner of war camp the Nazis didn't care how they treated the Russians so there were no beds  there were no bunks  there were concrete floors with straw thrown on them  and totally encircled by a heavy chain link fence  barbed wire  guard towers  machine guns  heavy search lights  the whole apparatus that looked like a bloody extermination camp.
Are there any sounds or sights today that you hear or you see  or any smells that kind of bring back your expe rience during the war  either in get in the ghetto  or in hiding?
I was eleven  eleven and a half years old and when the war started I remember uh as it was starting I remember the excitement of...excitement on the part of an eleven year old of seeing our parents uh you know getting ready and listen to the radio  listen to the news and there was something about uh I suppose exciting about it.
What do you remember about the ending of the war in Ludbreg?
So that they came out just bef ore the war broke out.
And she went to the forest and she reached the forest  and she reached the partisans  and she was -- her sister was already in the part isans and she was older  until the end of the war with the partisan.
And these other boys we re members of the resistance and they were given the privilege -- they were given the privilege to liberate -- to enter Germany  and -- and -- and they wanted to enter Germany  because France wanted to enter Germany to have some say after the war.
Now before the war  the central Siemens factory was in Berlin  although they did have factories in other parts of Germany  but in Berlin was the central f actory  and also the central administration building of Siemens was in Berlin  and it was a huge complex  it took  it was many square miles large  fenced in of course  many  many buildings manuf acturing all kinds of things.
Soon in  after the war broke out were you aware be ing as they said in quotes resettled in the East.
When events like the Eichmann trial came  did that stir up more memories of the war time in -- in Scotland for you?
So I had my head fixed and then after war in Germany  I got a good German surgeon and he cut it open again and left only a little  tiny I mean  it was a scar  Im it was enormous scar.
Information was known and leaflets were published about his past  nobody could say we do not know what Waldheim had done during the war  and I decided as always to go to Vienna   to Austria and mobilize on the spot  so I went there with a couple of addresses of movements  I got some youngsters around me  young people of the left movement; by the way in one d emonstration we had to pose as Kiesinger and in the office of that movement I found posters where they were marching a couple of months before  when there was the war of Lebanon and Israel.
And we'll see what will be  but he said  it's  the war will come to an end.
What the soldiers in the  in the uh  uh  uh last winter of the war where they execute them by Gestapo when they 're in French country  close to 150 American soldiers were executed.
So  in the Kalendarium  I found out that the chief executive officer of the factory that was appointed or whatever  placed who has gotten this position three years before the war  was a German  a spy  who not only spied for the Germans to let them know what is the operation like in this particular because that was a whole region  not just St arachowice.
Then he was--in the war--in the war  he was released from Dakow and put in the army and the uh--I happened to mention that I have a child--he don't live in the ghetto  so--so he brought--one day he brought me a bag of sugar and he brought some flour  I think like that.
But as time went on  in 1939  Hitler decided to go to war.
So when the war started between Serbia and Croatia  the Serbs feared they might destroy the archival material.
We worked for the Nazi war crimes commission  which was headed by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson  who was to be our prosecutor for the United States.
Right after the war began in September 1939  you were called before a tribunal and a notation was put in your record that said -- I'm going to read this -- \ The holder of this certificate is to be exempted from further order from internment and from the special restrictions applicable to enemy aliens under the aliens order.\
Here as you know dressed in only in rags and that was uh...but I was appointed by the uh American Joint Distribution Committee to travel on my own through all the south from uh Rome south to Sicily to look for Jewish refugees and we found...we found quite a few who were hidden and uh they didn't know that the war wa s over.
After the war they made a hospital where Himmlers palace was in Bergen-Belsen.
And he was the first  after the war  he did it in our Czech country.
And  well they declared them dead at the end of the war  you know   45 sometime  the date o-of May 45 when when the war was over.
Cause I don't know  as the war progressed  they used all kinds 37 of things to make bread go furt her.
The only trouble I -- remained after the war me and Edna  but no more closer people.
In th e time of the war  he was a head  a leader of a partisan unit  Akar  which I mentioned before  AK.
Mr. Moise  tell me a little bit about what happened with you and with your family when the war started?
So uh  my family life started I guess in the 20's after the war.
One of them you anticipated and answered in some way  which was o what you knew of your fathers war years  and of his family life  had he told you stories  and you say no  he never talked of it.
After Apr il 1st  1933  certain uh laws were promulgated whereby doctors and   uh Jewish doctors  Jewish doctors  lost their license  with the exception of those who had served as veterans in World War I  and since my father was uh uh...had seen action in World War I in France and in Russia  I was entitled to continue uh with my studies  but as I say I did...came to the conc lusion that uh this would not guarantee me a future  not in Germany  so then in uh in uh Apri l-May I I stopped with my studies and I uh got...I was volunteering in in some kind of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth movement  the work done...especially the social wo rk being done was always connected with the Jewish community.
`This may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a war veteran --- Is that really ---? --
Well  then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to Germany  we felt it in Poland.
Her husband  I think was a -- a prisoner of war.
>> Bill Benson: Bob  as you said  the war was over for you.
He was on his way to the 1st Zionist Congress that was being held after the war and he remembered me from the first episode even though I didn't know him at that time.
So there was no– you knew that you weren t going to get involved in the war if you– Well  I dont know that it would have mattered.
The second or the third day that the war broke out  that they were fighting in Holland  we tried to leave.
Actually my last relationship was w ith a Jewish man  who also had the  well  had some background during the war but his both pare nts lived and he really didn't have much hardship except he understood what it means to be a Jew and confronted with anti-Semitism and so on.
And she lived in Toronto and she had  through somebody at the information center on the Holocaust  she had ga -- f -- happened to meet somebody whom I worked with during the war  and gave her my addre -- a nd she wrote to me and I found out that I was the director of the childrens home  af ter the war  where she was.
>> Bill Benson: And with the liberation  of course  the war -- in August 1944  the war would continue elsewhe re until May 1945 f or much longer.
It -- it was just clear you couldnt kee -- I think they were only together for a short time after the war in the same DP camps.
But during World War I  my father volunteered with the German Army.
On the other hand  you couldn't go into many street  and I have many memo ries of standing uh I do have a memory of for instance at one time and that was also maybe a ha lf a year after the war broke out  uh standing in front of the main street in our city  which was ca lled  became Hitler Strasse  but it was the street of the Third of May  which is when the Poles had a national holiday  and it was a beautiful street with  with many trees.
I am a veteran of World War I. And it's a good possibility that the Nazis will not punish the veterans  the German veterans  of World War I.\  To make a long story short  they did marry.
Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 63 Lets now talk about what happened to you after the war  summarizing on how you got to this country and so forth.
And  uh  I give them that freedom  because I am not myself so strong on  on religion  but I do believe in God and it came back to me after the war.
It was a nice time  and we followed 17 everything and we thought what we should do after the war.
New Tape] Tell me a little bit about th e school that you attended before the war  on Rybna Street  if I remember correctly  and the school in the ghetto  but first talk about the school before the war.
War had broken out and there was no way to go there.
I had it for 11 years already that I lived under this Hitler and my bad blood and no chance to ever get out and in '44T war we knew  but we didn't have any 10 details because the Jews were not allowed to have any means of communicati on.
So it was what became the American zone in west Germany after the war was over.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: We were dispatched to a location where we have to build foundations for a new Berlin after the war.
Then he turned against the Russian s and thats when England declared war first and then France.
After the war she came once to visit that I was wum -- I was married already  as I mentioned  we were not in -- we were not -- how you say it in English?
Audience Member: Before the war started and you were in Poland  what did you hear people -- the Jews saying about what was going on with Hitler in Europe?
Actually  a -- an-and this is something that -- th at really struck me during the war and after the war and now  in retrospect  how very little we knew about what was going on in Germany.
Did you have much information about what was happening in Germany with Hitler...before the war?
And what the Germans did  it was -- it made no sense to transport Jewish prisoners  and to lose the war.
And after the war  Horsts father said to his two sons  who were now teenagers  ﬁWe have belongings from a Jewish family  the family Cohn  and Im trying to find them  and if I dont find them  I want you to promise me that you will always look for them  and we have to return these items to that family.ﬂ So I couldnt belie ve what was happening.
A. Now  they -- the people involved is a Jewish concern of Jack Rosenstein  who was in -- a big businessman in Zurich who was during the war in New York.
Because then as war began  I was at my grandparents' house.
Oh  I do remember this because we -- my father felt  the day the war broke  that was September 1st  19 -- '39.
Did you -- I understand that -- that when you were -- the last couple of years of the war and youre a little bit older  youre eight  nine years old  and you hear about the war  do you also hear about camps  do you hear about death factories?
In Bratislava  after the war  what was it like to be a Jew?
The war was over  you were with your future wife? [
After the war  no  af ter the war  we lived under communism and we went to synagogue secretly.
Uh  my father  uh  brought ma ny of the people from the local district back home alive and  uh  after the First World War  he took his non-commissioned officers and  uh  set up a business where the non-commissioned officers from his 2 battalion became his distributors and my fa ther was the wholesaler  and by 1930 my father dominated the  uh  the oil  fertilizer and  uh  uh  flour distribution business in the  in the entire province.
That before the war will fin- ished we'll be...so the mood after each selection and after each eh months and after each thing that was probably when we heard that the Germans were defeated there in Russia.
There was a lot of good souls during the war  even Germans.
About eight years in -- My last job was in a town called Guildford in Surrey in England  and it was with the Abbey Road Building Society where I worked as a bookkeep er -- sorry -- You were about 25 years old then when the war started?
DL] And when the outbreak of war actually happe ned when you were twenty two  whereabouts were you and what happened to you from there? [
I went back again and thats -- actually we saw each other for the first time  even though we double da ted in England during the war -- or  after the war  I didnt know him during the war  after the war we double dated  we were engaged to different people.
My idea after having met together with Segalovitz -- Koppelmann  who confirmed what Segalovitz had re ported to me  who told us a little bit more 56 about his relations with Schulte  his reports which he had brought before with regard to the development of the war.
They were not able to do it  so you had certainly a...during the Depression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to capitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh Germany had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was not defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called home-front  which means by social democrats and communists and the Jews.
It is over there the holiday of Pole  the liberation of Pole from the first war  so this is 3rd of May  the parade of 3rd of May. You have over there many Jewi sh children standing because it was in the middle of the town.
And that he would have gotten out after four weeks anyhow  because all veterans from World War I were released from Dachau at that time.
When after the war and people liberated  they were drinking and eating and they weren't eating for years so right away a lot of th em -- so he was in a hospital and they had to do surgery on him and everything and he came out of the hospital  he doesn't know why he had the operation or anything.
When I heard that Musso-Mussolini entered the war  I -- I had to go home  I was sick.
Yeah  because Siberia  the war  Siberia  and so -- and then my father struggled.
Her father was not  her fa -- father lived here through -- through the war.
And Roosevelt saying we -- first we have to finish the war  then well think about the Jews.
So when we went in this factory  textile factory  we start to discuss during break what  how to sabotage the work over there because they produce for the war.
We were approximatel y at the level Bologna and the war ended and we were very happy.
So so whatever what whatever was promised  didnt happen  because United States didnt want to I dont know didnt want  didnt have ships  or whatever  the war was  you know  in in Going on.
But I did hear about him in uh about 2 months or 3 months after the war ended that he was in Salbergs.
He served in Germany an -- as a -- an Intelligence officer after the war an-and after -- before the [indecipherable].
And just the beginning of the war  Russians were going to the main square.
When he cam e back  he was invalid from the 1st World War.
When they first came  they came to your tow n  they came to Rozwadow a week after the war started?
My fia...Alec  who was my fiance  he applied for medical school in Poland but they didn't want to accept him on and when the war broke out  when the Russians came  he got a job as a bookkeeper in the railroad uh on the rail...in the railroad authorities.
I took my brother to Pinsk after the war in an orphanage.
These people were responsible for -- for economic war crim es.
My father -- my father was -- he was made the director of that -- CEO of that factory where he was the accountant before the war and he was -- the war was still going on.
Oh yeah  thats good because a lot of peopl e -- lot of people dont -- I tell you  my middle daughters family -- her husbands family  Jewish  she didnt even believe it when -- she said she never heard anything about it during the war.
No  because people already knew them by their name before the war.
So tell me what  the war is over  you're no longer . . .
I think we got the help from that Jewish Gemeinde  and also my mother remarried in 1945 a man that she knew from before the war.
I -- I worked in Philadelphia for a couple of years and I -- I wanted to get into the war.
Because th ey took me after the war like a hospital.
And of course eventually  everyone was killed anyway  but this was one of the terrible things that went on as the war progressed and as the war against the Jews progressed.
There was anti-Semitism in the Polish population  foreve r. Before the war  during the war and after the war.
The war is over  and during the war we often met  but didnt dress up in uniform  always had to be back home before 10 oclock when curfew came about.
I couldnt do anything Interview with Phillip Abraham 10 August 21  2011 Again  pre war .
In -- in summary  I mean  I-I must say that I -- th -the years in the 30's  leading up to World War Two and the Holocaust  I felt  I mean basically li ke an outsider  like b-being  I mean pushed away from the main body and from all the fes tivities that the Germans enjoyed  from which I was excluded.
My father spoke Hungarian  because he was in the first World War  and that was during the Hungarian time.
Then again  it was still  after the war  things were not normal yet  so I didn't pay much attention to it.
That is one thing that followed me right through the war.
He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the Bavarian city of Oxbourg before the war and now he was rabbi in Springfield  Missouri and he and his family took me somewhat under th eir wings.
>> Albert Garih: I think  besides the war  1938 was the worst of all years  actually.

Because Ilu Turkow then had me in this home and with his wife Diana Blumenthal showed me a handwritten song my father wrote once for his wife which he buried in a can in the Warsaw Ghetto ruins be fore he managed to scale the wall posing as a Polish railroad man and found it after the war.
He died about six years before the war from a he had the brain tumor.
Well  your family had a very difficult time in those early years right after the war.
A lot of battles took place in Belgium during World War I  and so there was no lost love between the Belgians for the Germans.

And the German Government arbitrarily declared that they died in a concentration camp on May 8th  1945  which was the last day of the war  the date of war.
But I know  because of my background  that treme ndous harm was done and that  there was enormous pain and my  the oldest one  Betty  who is  who  who was born during the war  I mean she knows it  shes done a lot of talking about it and  and she is aware of  of  shes aware of the horrendous pain.
Which wasnt a factual statement  because it was very possible that Hitler might won the war.
So her outlook on the war  bo th then and now  i-in retrospect  is Im certain quite  quite different from that  lets say  of her oldest sister  who is significantly older than she.
SONIA BRODECKI Page 9 SONIA BRODECKI: Cause you saw so many people  after the war  we had music  we had food  we could exchange wishes.

Th ey were rather uh requisitioned by the Italians fo r their uh truck drivers  and many of them even came with their families to to spend the duratio n of the  what they thought the duration of the war would now be.
Archives are terribly  terribly important  and I only hope that people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during 67 the war  before the war  after the war  which might be useful  to find out from an archivist where they might be useful.
It was after World War I  and people  really  materialistic -- they were very poor  really.
You were  you know  a -- a younger woman during the war when all this happened.
Of course  you were young when the war started  but do you think youre more religious  less religious  because of what you Im relig less less relig less religious what happened to us.
I had one teacher in middle school who lost her husband and a son in the Second World War.

You go through the winter of 1940  and di did your sister and yourself ever refer to that conversation that you had about gee  it would be interesting to see what war was like  after you actually felt it?
Now  you missed your chance  there is no war  so you better go to America  make money  send us the money.ﬂ So we didnt stay there  but  I have to tell you one -- this was the first trip  we were in 1949.
I have seen during the war that the Jews that were killed had these papers with them.
And  if you could  Mrs. Gelfer  just give me sort of a sketch of what your life was like down the years after the war.
That we knew the war was over and we had a chance...a chance to go..to go and we..we could go  of course  that we go to...Shanghai to the city  and..uh... Yes  that was...that was...uh... beautiful.
Did -- Did you experience any blatant anti-Semitism during those years that you were [indecipherable] After the war.
And matter of fact  you know  if I was young boy when th e older people says  you know  what they was going through the first World War  I laugh and I says  ah what -- they say they eat rotten potatoes  you know and this and this.
And during the first world war my grandfathers and their brothers have served with distinction in the Austrian Hungarian Army  most of them as officers.
It is hard to recapture those moments of delight and joy mixed with sadness and sorrow  for there I was  23 years of age  having just emerged alive after a cataclysmic long war and imprisonment  and alone in the world.
Interview with Erica Laufer 37 August 19  2012 How aware were you of World War II going on at the time  besides the fact In Georgetown.
Before the war  do you remember being able to do this?
We can't stay here the two of us until the end of the war you know  alone and we don't have enough money to pay her so we came out of hiding the next day.
Uh my sister...I had a sister who was eight years older than I was who when my parents died chose to remain in in Hungary and went to live in a convent  and uh during the war the Nazis sort of seized this convent and used the women for housework and uh whatever else...sewing and Lord knows what what else...and then when uh during the siege of Budapest  they uh...when the Nazis were fleeing Budapest eventually...this was in the winter...uh they took my sister and all the other women in the convent with them.
We didn't know at this time that  for instance  Jewish leaders were stormi ng the chancellories in London and in Washington uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't kno w that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL  saying that uh uh the uh governments have to co ncentrate on the completi on of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording  that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners  the Nazis could become more vindi. ..
And they wanted to interrogate me once again  which was  you know  it was the end of the war.
The priest said you stay here as long as you want  until the end of the war  but after a number of days  we realized that it was too dangerous  not only for us but for the priest.
And in fact my own cousin was able to leave through Russia  went to Japan  and managed to get into San Francisco before the outbreak of the war.
I mean there were pe ople who made their way illegally during the war but the survivors from the ghetto were just myse lf and this other woman.
All the others were either killed in the war or they're gone.
Now I think I was allowed to stay in this German high school because my father had been a what they call a frontkempfer [ph]  somebody who had fought in combat in World War I  and Jews who had that status had at the beginning certain privileges.
They were starved to death and worked to death  thos e Russian prisoners of war.
And I know that because after the war Pollack went to the exhumation.
So after the war he actually came to to to Germany to take us  but we left early to friends.
Yeah  in London   yes  until the war  and then we were evacuated to the Midlands   each class.
There were a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war heros  like Simon  whom they didn't want to kill off either.
And he said -- and he said  ﬁI felt that the guy  what he really wanted  was the little flashlight.ﬂ Now this wasnt an ordinary flashlight  it was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war.
>> Bill Benson : After the war ended  you found your daughter   Josiane  and then you were reunited with your husband   Jacques .
We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in America because the war had ended.
It turned out I was not by myself  there were other -- about three or four Christians and they were talking about the war  the -- even they mentioned one guy tells about that Israeli ar -- tanks hit -- hit them so hard that it -- and th ey went to -- into Sinai peninsula.
So my Aunt Mina had the maid before the war  so after the war was over with  Mina wrote to Yulche [ph]  the maid  to go to the people and tell them that she was alive and then that Mina was going to call her or talk to her  how to ship that– her stuff here to the United States.

On the train...I shaved on the in the railroad stations and I living and sleeping on the train  back and forth every day seeing her in the hospital  and uh then finally when she was released from the hospital I got another job on the railroad tracks with through somebody th at I met  and in August of 1944 we were liberated by the Russian army in a town...because already at that time as you know  Russia and Germany were in at war  so liberated by the Russian army  and then uh in 1946...in 1945 '45 we escaped from Poland into the German zo...into the American zone in Germany in a Russian ambulance.
This guy was a guy who was an official of a bank in Warsaw before the war.
And they were both Jewish and had two children which were already uh grown-ups and I lived them as their little brothe r and until the war started in 1940.
Uh I first went to England and uh there was involved for a short time in the uh defense of the uh east coast of England on the Channel area  where the buzz bombs were at that time being employed against uh the uh island  and uh so from that uh point we crossed the Channel and I think that was my first uh uh impact I suppose of the uh horror of war.
And I had this very romantic idea  the United States  by that time I had seen a couple of war movies and I just  you know  I had thought everything American was just wonderful so I said  \ I want to go the United States.\
Because it was coming closer  the war was getting -- coming to an end  we felt.
There was far too much isolationism in the United States to allow him to declare war  but he was actually supporting the British in their war effort.
War is hell for everyone  you know  but that's you know  we were there.
But when th ey chased us out  not until after the war I found out that wh en they chased us out they didn't chase out the whole city  they just chased out part.
And then when -- when the war started [indecipherable] we were really elated  we heard on the radio that Germany had attacked Russia  we felt this was the lesser ev il.
And my first memory Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 10of the war was a Nazi airplane flying very low  and somebody living in the same apartment building jumping out of the house with a small revolver  the kind of the kind that ladies would have in thei r bags  and he shot at that plane.
Once you were under Russian occupation during those first few period of the war  what was life like under the Russians?
Not during the war but when we were  when we went back. (
Because we figured that during the war the factories will be closed  then that will be worth more money  but she left the fabric -- I mean I don't know how many bolts of fabric she bought  she left if with that family  with him and his family.
I -- When I got mail  they offered me an affidavit again  which we had already before the war  but the quota was exha usted  so I couldnt -- you couldnt use it.
What did you do after the war  if we can backtrack to...?
I think its after after the war crimes people got out  a lot of it was torn down  like I said about this man telling me a lot of a lot of buildings were disposed of.
My paternal grandmother was killed during World War I. And my paternal grandparents both died from an epidemic of cholera.
Before the war started  he came to marry my mother  and then orders came  the war had started  so he couldn't stay  but three days and then he went back and my mother was born in M-u-c-h  pronounced in German   which is also in the Rhineland areas and she was born in a resort town  which became a resort town and I already mentioned her father.
28 Because they -- that rabbi knew me personally fr om way before the war.
The friend  Wladislaw Brezovsky who had gotten me out of the ghetto had a  was had a British citizenship as well as Polish and after the war be cause he worked for a British firm.
It was you know  nobody was talking about anti-Semitism  or anti because all these people  you know  left before the war.
We worked then together  I mean  we were usually interspersed  there may have b een a woman here and a male here and so on  several males and so on  and among ourselves a real camaraderie developed  the chief foreman was a man  his name was  I'll never forget  Alexander Siegel  and this  he was about in his  retrospectively guessing  in his late 30's  I would say  possibly 40  and sort of a real rough neck  extremely nice to all fe males  who also after the war really didn't find much reason to complain about him.
My upbringing  I am a Batar person these days but I only switched  I only changed after the war.
The ...the war paid... Everybody paid a great fee in this war.
How did you feel about the war in the first 10 to 20 years after its conclusion?
>> Henry Kahn: No  not even during this time  because the war had already -- well  I didn't get to write a letter anyway.
So  does this mean that when people were told they could leave Latvia a couple of weeks or a week before- No  the week before the outbreak of the war  these were the so-called ﬁmass deportationsﬂ Yes.
I would say that it was a little bit on the back burner for maybe  oh  20 years after the end of the war.
My mom wasn't a war widow because only people who were part of the regular Hu ngarian Army and who died  their wives were declared war widows.
I said  \ In order to get me into the Army to go back to Germany  you have to declare war on Germany again and be losing.\
When the war began  there was a simultaneous increase in violence against Jews in -- in Romania.
26 About that little boy... Oh  that little boy came over  so then we hear the war coming nearer.
He never wo he never on ce mentioned a single thing about the war  and he would hide photogr aphs of him in uniform.
She went to school here to speak Eng lish  and she was a seamstress for a period of time and during the war working in a -- a -- as a supervisor in a factory making uniforms and raincoats and so forth for the military.
But its remarkable you know when you think what the Germans did after the war and they are hardworking and but then I think half of the American population is German.
He was called to that battalion  and when they were surrounded by the Germans and kept like war prisoners  they were ordered to stay in a lin e  or two lines; I dont know exactly.
He survived the war and did something that I admire him for.
There were a a prisoners of war s  were a lot of in there.
But after the war  with very little money  one of the things that he had been interested in when he was in Paris studying had been African art.
This was just something that I accepted as the norm  that some of the people in the neighborhood I lived in  in Washington Heights  had come over after World War as survivors  as compared to the many  many other  particularly German Jews who settled along Fort Washington Avenue in the late 1920s and 1930s  before the war.
So the feeling was already that there is going to be a war.
The telephone the the radio is t alking [indecipherable] the war is ended  go home.
Did you have much to do with her before the war?
Now what  what news were getting about th e progress of the war and also what the Nazis are doing to Jews?
Then one day after the war  in 1947  we got passage to go  to come to this country.
Gentiles  again  the war  the army eventually  everybody who was fifteen  fourteen  fifteen  sixteen at the end of the war  the & RG-50.549.05*0001 16 last few months  the Arrow Cross people  they fo rced children out into the street with a gun.
It used to be called Bresl au before the war in Germany.
I was his only Jew  but I was the best  so  but it was surprising  that so shortly after the war  there was still ignorance and these negative feelings about Jews.
He said  we are at war with Japan and Germany .
But began the first sign when we saw the war in our uh  in the middle of our house.
And it was the War on Poverty  which [indecipherable] I dont know  so we can politically th-the time ca [indecipherable] exception.
The mo -- the other one was born after the war.
As the war ground on  by the winter of 1944 -45  which was an exceptionally bitter winter  that's one of the memories you do have of that winter and the deprivation that was all around.
Little by little  we find out to what extent it was even after the war  what the Nazis had done.
And then -- and then finally  when war broke out  the little girl said [indecipherable] said  what am I going to do  I cant write to you any more.
Not frightening  they were just uniforms  and I had seen pictures of my father in the uniform for the World War One  a nd th-the -- and I was exposed to many uniforms that -- that people wore  I guess.
You don't ever dare -- nerve to separate me and her after the war.
And so and then by the second part of the war  they already knew that the Germans are being pushed back  and wa So you so you knew that?
But the -- the sad part of the story is that four weeks  or a pproximately four weeks before the end of the war  he was caught by the Germans on one of his missions  he was on a mission  I dont know wh-what his mission was  and he was caught and he was executed.
My mother courageous as she was said well  if you want to let out your ire on a poor war widow then do so.
And we kept Jackie  the oldest one -- we kept during the whole war.
She sewing for us  and she always wanted us that we have much better than she has  because she has very hard time during the first war.
So -- So at the end of the war  you -- you didnt know what had happened to your parents  but you started to hear.
Was it at the end of the first World War that she grew up with your aunt  or was it earlier?
He was not a very highly respected person before the war.
A. In September  1939 Q. I thought you had left Brussels a second time  because you were in Brussels during the war.
Can you imagine  Soviet years  war is still going and I get to the street with a man in German uniform?
I was 11 when the war broke out in '39  about 13 in '41  '42.
It was uh...the war ended in May and when we decided to leave was around August  so we went to a friend of ours who we knew that she lives in Lodz.
Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20  2009 151Its not my name  but the similar people that after the war they got together also  but they had the higher higher number yeah  a later number than mine.
Then a -- then I -- I wound up in a -- in a camp near Frankfurt where a lot of -- that was at the -- a-after the end of the war already  when -- where they kept a lot of high German officials and officers  generals and admirals and so on  near ha -- near Hamburg .
The political leading came mostly from the place where we have been working because they knew everybody and I think that the organization of the communistic party was nearly the same as it was in the pre .. .. war time  but not with the same people.
Was it hard putting your life back together again after the war?
What do you remember hearing about Hitler before the war started?
And my father who spoke German perfectly before the war would never speak German after the war.
We have many arenas of war and people talk about peace and it continues.
This was like the first time that they were happy for anything during that war an d the bad times.
Montessori was here in the early 1913 she wa she was here  and there were schools and by 1918 when the war when the first World War start  these schools were all closed.
One of the last sessions -- recently I had to go back to him for just the one session  because I have interviewed a man nearby here  USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 97 who had been in Auschwitz with his brother  and the story was so terrible that I had nightmares overnight  wh -what happened to him  happened to me during the night  and the next morning I was crazy  I -- I couldnt clear my head  and I -- my wife said  ﬁYouve got to go see -- see a shrink because  you know  this has been too much of a thing.ﬂ And I went back to him  and we tal -- and he helped me immediately  and we talked about it  and he -- he explained to me why it upset me so much  because it was -- this man had been with his brother in Auschwitz  and it brought all my war stories back  the danger  and the fear with my little brothers  and -- and I said  ﬁYou know  I never talked about the Holocaust with you  did I?ﬂ And he began to laugh  he said  ﬁYou did nothing else.ﬂ He says  ﬁYou did -- you did all the time ﬂ he said.
But finally my father said he had found a place to live  so we came...we went back to Paris and we joined him and things were almost worse than they had been...uh...at the...at the beginning of the war.
In the meantime  the war  you know  happen  and in France ha -- 1934  my father passed away.
Th e 1600 plus people primarily professed to claim to be displaced persons captured in Central Europe  because of the war; but they really had Palestinian papers.
Not they Finns didnt became Nazis at all  they were allies during the second World War with the Germans  but they still were a democratic country  and had nothing to do with the Nazi ideology at all.
We had f -- about 40 or so ordinary German soldie rs who were ordinary prisoners of war.
So therefore I I also know that helping was very  very difficult during the war.
My mother  fortunately  went through all of the war with her two olde r sisters  and most of the war with their father  before he was lost in Auschwitz .
In 1936 he received a special medal  which apparently at that point was be ing given to all former front line soldiers in World War I. End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of the interview with Gerald Schwab .
And we left on August third and in September the war was [indecipherable] .
There was about  as far as I know  130 000 Prisoners of War  of all nationalities in Poland.
But I mentioned  I want to mention that a lot of German Jews came back  German Jews after the war.
We were going to synagogue for the first time since before the war.
He he he earned the Iron Cross on the first and second class  and must have done some outsta he never talked about the war.
Warsaw is a as it grew  during the time after the first World War  this was under the Tsarist Russia .
ŠŠ General Bradley and also ŠŠ one truck reported war correspondents.
He was a big leader for the war  he our leader from in war for the area government and I was working with him  yes.
Tell us what you can about that and about the eve nts that occurred before the war actually began with Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939.
What really USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 9 happened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a train and I went to some kind of resort  to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole world situation and then brought my grandm other back to Strassber -- the following year  when the war really was going to get started  same thing happened.
A nd you two stayed together for much of the rest of the war?
The first thing happened it was raining lik e this  just before the -- like today  the night before the war  maybe two nights ear lier  maybe three nights earlier.
However  we had to register as German citizens living in France while France is at war with Germany.
And I knew that the business in the preceding months before the war was very  very dead  was virtually at standstill.
Dirty  uh thirsty  very very uh tired  like escaped from  from the war.
And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time the war was -- was actually ended.
My cousin in Israel could only provide information about Poland before the war.
But until 1942   and for me until 1944  a child  not going to certain streets  not seeing certain people   to me it was a regular war.
And I said  well  I don't know  the war -- they said  we're going to release you but under the condition that you have to leave these territories.
I was privileged in many ways because the time of the Romania was  after first World War  and the economic situation was good  and my father business was good  so I didnt have to wo rk.
And at as most of us most people know  there was an agreement in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Act   which kind of divided up Poland  you know  be-before the war even started.
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Michal  this is before the war  and your relationships.
Well  I asked about the anger  because its striking to me that you came out of the war and you had lost  your whole family had been killed.
That girl I met  was a  was a beautiful girl  her name was Susie Kuhns  and uh  Susie said that war is  how long  she said  to me  we stood at the window of the train  she said  \ How long do you think it's going to last?\
And she always told me her husband ha d been a drummer boy in the Civil War.
I would go to get to London -- you had to get pol -- permission from the police department that you were leaving your re sidence  since we were known as enemy aliens all during the war.
Well  during that year  until th e German came in the fr ee zone  I wouldn't say we felt completely safe  but the Germans were not th ere  so we  we thought  we could survive the war there.
From there we went to Germany  but it was just shortly after the war.
And the middle sister  Sarah  she went right before the war  this present conflict  like 1990 - ‚91  I think.
A little more than half of the Jews in Belgium survived the war.
So several hours later  by sled  we got into town and a tall extremely ha ndsome man with a moustache and dark hair; he looked kind of like Clark Gable or possibly–.. No  no even more distinguished than that  not as romantic a figure but the one who -- what was that great war movie  Mrs. Miniver  who was the husband of Mrs. Miniver?
And from the hot el  for some reason we we we shared an apartment with some other people by the name Nussbaum  whom I remember very well and who survived the war and who lived on the street adjacent to the only skyscraper that Amsterdam had for very many years.
All German governments after the war  we -- with -- with a -- with no exception of political -- political s -- parties  starting with Conrad Addenower  accepted publicly  the responsibility for the guilt or the tragedy of the German nation caused by the Nazis.
The war So in other words  they they were they the the peop the SS  which was in charge of the concentration camps Correct.
Some was put  they took like  this is interesting now  they took as the beginning of the war  some hostages in our city including I remember my father.
So h-he was then optimistic too  hey things are going to get better soon  he says -- this time he couldnt tell you nobody advances  the war was over already.
Were you encouraged at all to speak about your war experience  either in that particular program or even in -- in [indecipherable]?
>> Ronald Coleman: You mentioned that you had a cousin who had been killed at the very beginning of the war.
That was only a year before the Cold War broke out.
Yeah  because yeah  because the the guy who came from this woman  they told him she told him that probably went to there  because if he didnt [indecipherable] and I didnt find him  not during the war  that means from end of October or so til after the war  so I knew that he went there.
And some authors  and I'm not quite sure that I share all this opinion entirely and so on  but the fact is that towards the end of the war the Germans tried  even first the underground in Germany tried  those people who were fighting against Hitler tried through our people in Sweden through the Wallenbergs -- that's the relatives of Raoul -- to get contact with the allies.
And on the way as I was walking  uh  the sirens would go on  and we knew that this war  people were getting killed on the street  they used to throw bombs  and this is the way I knew that the war broke out.
I hope I never see starvation or war  and none of you do.
I didn't learn until after the war that they had strict orders not to put the fire out until the fire threatened the adjoining bui ldings.
Did she do much talking about what she went through during the war  and before the war?
It was translated in Polish and in 1939  before the war  I could never get the book because this was such a popular book in the library that my name didn't co me up.
Its really tragic because its not only my mother  but think of all the wonderful people who lived in the community and think of all the little children and they did not survive the war because of the Nazi madness. [
I said   before the war I was 14 years old  and after the war I couldnt be  because I was always almost like in a prison [indecipherable].
In 1945  in the fall of 1945  the war has ended already.
And I'm conservative  because I had to make it  I di d. When I was in the army  I made 72 dollars and that's all I had and I bought a war bond of 18 dollars and 75 cents  every month for two years.
The Jewish leadership elaborated a plan in which some people would never the less enter the British army for training but also so that the war against the Nazi's would not be won without the Jews being represented as an independent fighting unit and so that people would know that the people which suffered most took part against Nazi Germany.
So you feel like your time in -- in those years in Berlin right after the war  it was almost like there was a timeta -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 4 Yeah  it is -- Some sort of reconciliation?
You know  many -- its -- its an issue for many Holocaust survivors and their children  about whether they would talk to th em about what happened during the war  or not.
During the war you didnt realize the full impact of the genocide.
Before the war  the idea of going to America was a horrible idea for most Jews.
It means the navy blue granna -- the navy blue police  because they had navy blue uniforms  but this was the police from before the war  and they didnt behave so hundred percent like the Polish people desired.
And while -- he was drafted into the army  because this was the Korean War -- he was drafted and meanwhile I got that offer.
And And that that was the only time I got hit during the war.
Did it represent at all a place  I mean obviously  the  some of the attacks following the six day war were  you said were very scary.
>> Bill Benson: And just to remind the audience  war had not actually begun yet.
Anyway  then Just before we get into that  I would like to just move back and get a sense of what was your feeling  when you were in the infantry  about the war?
Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 18 You had no idea that all those horri ble things were happening throughout Europe concentration camps There was there was no radio inform ation about whats was going on in Europe other than people who had radios and then had war stories  but they never said anything about the killing of Jews.
I heard that this was the worst front in the war because it was warmer it was snow.
Those are feelings that I had after the war  not during the war.
And after the war -- I forgot how many orphanages they had ; unfortunately quite a number because many kids had no more parents.
Yes  I it did  du-due to the fact that I was always a happy-go-lucky guy  e-even during the war.
And then after the war you know  nobody ever thought that we were in shoc k or anything.
That him being aware -- sh -- maybe shutting things out  allowed him to sort of maintain some of his former life all through that -- the war.
I didnt know the war was over until three days after it was over.
Which is why I can understand the Bosnians reciting a war from 800 AD or you know whatever.
Not a big ship  but there was a quite a few people there and they were throwing slices of bread to their relatives  so th-they -- th-the situation -- the [indecipherable] situation apparently was very bad after the war.
He was a captain in the Red Army during the wa r  and at the end of the war decided that he wanted to get out.
And we lived there  like I said  until the war came in and... 1 Norma Schneiderman was born on February 18  1912.
Actually  at the end of the war the man was found in a movie theater  gunned down 12 by someone in retaliation.
But even though the war had ended and you we re supposedly liberated  you didnt tell these people that you were Jewish?
The anniversary of the end of the war  she took pictures of my uniforms and the fl ags and all my souvenirs.
What are your recollections when the Germans came to Chelm at the outbreak of the war?
And they were only once [indecipherable] and you always prayed beforehand if God would protect everybody  also the enemy  where the Dutch people were [indecipherable] and I think God is almighty  and Hein was killed in the end of January 45  the war was over.
It would certainly remain neutral in the second World War since Hitler probably needed a neutral country in...in that part of the world.
People had to emigrate  which wasn't very easy because not many countries -- it was after World War I. Everybody was still struggling  I guess  or whatever.
He came back after the war  and he went after  a year after that  he went ba ck to get the house and his barns back  and uh  other people lived there.
And I went  and we told the people to to the Polish town I dont know  Hrubieszow Hrubieszow  or what  and the and mine cous in lived over mine cousin – A2: There was a story during the war  Mommy  where they caught you with a blanket  with a Polish blanket?
What happened is after that -- oh  the Germans asked for the Jewish population earlier in the war.
From my side  I feel  I went to them before the war in vacation  to spend my vacation at their house  you know.
The United States was also involved in a war in Vietnam.
In the 19 later 50s and 60s  I was working on the origins of the second World War and German foreign policy.
And we all  everybody felt that the war cannot last forever and that eventually this is going to end and that we have a chance to survive.
You know  everybody got sick after the war  because eventually it started coming  all these goodies to you  and I got very sick  and they took me to a hospital  and this doctor came in.
They were good friends of ours  very good friends before the war.
And we took together the train and we found ourself if I am not wrong  a day before September first  so and the next day war started.
And then in 1938  '39 or '40  unfortunately the war broke out and everything became like turmoil  with the bombardments of small towns and some children started to come into our orphanage.
This is myself  Julian Bussgang  and -- in uniform  and a f -- colleague and friend called Anjay Kovach or Andrew Kovach  and he is in civilian clothes  and we are both students after the war at the Polytechnical di Torino  which me ans Polytechnic of Turin  in Italy.

And at some point in the Ukraine sometime in the fall of '44 before the end of the war  when the Germans were going backwards.

After the war  did you consider at all going to Palestine?
Uh  I was uh not raised w ith stories about the war  with stories about the Holocaust.

They had the em demonstr ations all over  and bringing people e over  and many people came over afterwards  but they had not actually been in the Nazi concentration camps per se  they had  during the war they had gone from Germany  Russia  Poland and so forth to Shanghai or into other places.
Did that leave any time for you to follow the war news?
Id like to leave the the stories and the experiences about World War II to the side right now  and concentrate on on what what was life like pre-war.
They knew the -- the war was bad  but they -- I -- they did not know how -- how it reduced us to become USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 52prisoners  and not -- nobodies  comparing to what we were before  and so on.

There was nothing to supportŠI tell you  I was sent to   which is a city  when the war started  I was there. (

This camp and this camp Jewish inmates were together with Soviet prisoners of war.
At least during the war  and then -- then for another year  or almost a year  yes?
I had not had a chance to eat bananas during the war  I had a great urge to eat bananas.
Same thing with prisoners of war in Japan and even Vietnam  I know all these things happen.
After the war  people were -- late -- later after the war  many people would travel to Poland to seek their roots  and find out -- well  there are some people from Israel that went there  and they went to a -- a -- a city USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 64where their parents used to live  grandparents and so on.
And knowing what I knew after the war -- Yeah. --
I didnt know 3 this until after the war ended  when they were printing these statistics.
But this I guess is one of the early  of earliest clear memories I have from the war.
And then he was -- then the war broke out  of course  and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 26 they took everything away  and he was also ready [indecipherable] it in a way  very respected in -- even in Germany.

That photo was sent to me by my aunt  who had survived the war in Chile  and she told me thats my father and me   when I was very  very young.
People had an inkling that war was not far away but nobody really talked about it  that this was in 1940 I would say.
I got liberated 2 days before the end of the war.
I dont know but Im sure they didnt build hospitals during the war.
But this 60 interview comes to a very nice note  because in 1951 my war parents had another son.
Was there anything about the way the Ameri cans were responding to the war that surprised you?
So  eventually  I got drafted and well  I got drafted in the month that they declare end of the war  in January ‚55.
So the Jewish   which took care of the Jewish life before the war  told them to register  so the Poles should be able to get jobs.
Well  I heard it right away  because when they went -- came to our town  they -- I told them not to go  because I knew that nothing good -- because they killed so many during the war  and when they went there -- then later  the Polish people between themselves  everybody knew about it  because this was not done in secret.
So  going back to to the be the beginning of the war Yes.
>> Marcel Hodak: Well  after the war what happened is that they would gather all of these people that they knew  the girl  women with the Germans  dancing or drinking or whatever you want were brought into the town square.
The fact that I was German  and everybody in the United States was against Germany   because of what Germany had done in the war.
Do you think that your experience during the war had anything to do with your feeling about working for fairness and justice?
And then  much later on  in s when the war was already starting  and 1939?
The German took these people  first transport  maybe one -- I dont -- thousand people mo -- maybe more  ma -- less I dont know [indecipherable] exactly  and take the people  put in the sleeping car  first class  and said  you are going to France to -- to place where is very good resort  because was really resort  and you wait there  we change you for prisoner of the war  German prisoner.
And  of course  the...the journey on the wagon from...uh...od to Wierzbnik was very unusual too because we were...we had to hide and we had to...uh...sort of...uh... pretend that we were not Jewish and the way we were doing it is  my father used to live during World War I in Germany for some reason I don't understand why.
He went back to Germany to visit relatives after Wo rld War I  met my mother in doesn't matter where Quebec.
Then I knew him  I saw him during the war from the beginning.
Remember  it was still a year after the war  and we had to wait for the next available ship with a opening that was traveling the United States  and that -- the first opening was in October of 46.
And -- and this is what I felt that should be instilled upon them  because I  during the war  lost all this.
So  when the war started  I was st ill in the gymnasium or academy.
Then came the war and I never went to th e gymnasium.
That was going on from months after the war almost we found out where they took them  Treblinka.
What was the end of the war like for you and your family?
Before we talk about the start of the war and the events leading up to and following the German occupation  perhaps you can start by telling us a little bit about your family and community life before the war started.
So  when I came to the United States  and there was a war  I was -- I was just hoping that theyd beat them.
>> Bill Benson: But you made it and served in the Israeli Army  saw combat during the War of Independence  went back to Panama  and then came to the United States and met Adele.
As we came to the main road a truck  a German truck came out and the road was very narrow and the truck stopped and a sergeant  SS sergeant got out and apparently he had the intention of arresting us and that we are trying to interfere with his war.
After we presented a fair amount of materials on that  it became so clear that the British had a lot to do because they were working on Count Two  which was the waging of aggressive war  that we better combine some of these so actually we had some presentations during that aggressive war part by British counsel in addition to American counsel.
Must have been jul June or July or something like that  that I would say  because we were there for a period the little period longer after the war ended  you know  s-so And you were already nine  right?
When you speak with Americans about the war  or the concentration camps  or the Holocaust  what do you find?
For instance  when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to show their loyalty  especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky  there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to the Polish air force as a show of patriotism.
In the meantime  a lot of people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people  and so my father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just about six weeks before the war started.
When the war ended and people started looking for each other  that's when we found out who is alive and who is dead  and who went back to Hungary and who did not.
You see  contrary to -- of course  every time somebod y asks me  ﬁWhat did you do in the war?
And everybody was up in arms because it was the war.
I -- I -- I -- every time I see that they have money come in -- so -- Did you feel any hatred or -- towards th e Germans right after the war  or desire for revenge at all?
He did not make a big deal out of it  but of course  we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here  a diamond there  a fur coat  whatever  gave it to 42 him  and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto  there were collections of gold coins.
And so th-the place of my birth again  of course  totally changed and course the city was destroyed  the -- ravaged during the war.
I had [indecipherable] And so did your brother -- -- war was actually over. --
I would say we went out in Poland  actually  befo re the war broke out.
He came after the first World War to Atlanta  Georgia   and he opened up a flower shop.
It is  but I   but I think that is so common to most of us women and to most people that Im not sure where thats a remnant of the war years Anita Frank 80 [Date not labeled] Page 80 or whether that is  that is a  whether  whether that is just part of being  most  few of us sort of like to be corrected or  or criticized or disapproved of so  I think  I still  theres part of me that still wants to please others even though intellectually I know thats not what I should be doing.
Then the teacher of French language  yeah  I had a private less -- private lessons of French before the war.
Finally we find out that he was released two years after the war.
Later after the war  I knew 32 what it means  homosexual  gay etc.
So what they did  because the German f eel  they get tighter with the war.
Then I had it  such a stor y I will not tell about this because the war started  I could not bring her.
When I -- when I had the permission to go down perfor m my job in the factory  my brother set me up  that I should get in contact with th e employers who used to work before the war  and tell them if they come to work  they will be able to earn three times  or four times as much as they earned b-before the war.
But you didnt know that time  but the Jews supported the war.
But anyway  time for introduction and ﬁOh  I'm from there  I'm from there  I'm from there.ﬂ All the kids that were there  were already prior to me and were out before the war  because they accepted children from seven to 14.

Here we see Henry's mother Hedwig and his father Adolph who was a merchant and fought for Germany in World War I. Later Henry's father became president of a Cattle Dealers' Association.
So  in other words  was it an English child saying to the principal that no  I dont want to talk to the German prisoners of war  because theyre the enemy of England and weve just survived the blitz  or was it a No  I just said I dont want to talk to them.
So we were saved by the very fact that my father -- father  who when he volunteered for the emperor in World War I  had no idea that he would save -- that this action would save his -- our lives.
And my mother  after the war  when different lists circulated in the camps  I never seen the name of my mother  so I -- I think the -- this -- my supposition is correct.
you know) Well  obviously I wouldnt Remember  that was in 1947  (I) shortly after the war.
So basically befo re the war  on the eve of the war  in 1939  on September 1  1939  my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous.
Also that fact that you could buy chocolate which was a luxury - well it didn't exist in Denmark during the war.

Um...what happened um...as indeed things changed  and the war drew closer?
We never thought its going to star t a war over there.
So our experience is war related more so than Holocaust related.
But there are some people also  I know  who lost their religious belief after the war.
My father  they asked what you were doing before the war.
You know  we were losing so many ships during that war  but many people older than I were volunteering  and  what the heck?
I'm a generation older than you and I have more moral beliefs than you do  you are totally demoralized by war.
My father and I followed right after  right after  and we came to Bialystok and in Bialystok there was danger again of being killed  again  after the war by pogroms.
He was teaching me after the war immediately  because he gave me some privatenot private +.
And I lived with the French ex-prisoners of war at that time  and I said to myself  \ I should go because maybe my mother came back.
E: At the end...at the end actually  the c ongress were closed immediately because the declaration  the German declared war against Poland.

My aunt  whose husband had factories that manufactured felt for printing in both Germany and Italy  left in 1936 and moved to Italy  and a farmer hid him as a farm helper during th e war.
And during the 17-18's  during the war  coal supplies became very short and I still remember when we had to have a pushcart and go to the harbor at the river where the coal was brought in.
It -- I think what happened is  remember I mentioned to you that when we came to Cuba  after -- after the war  after we left Germany  and we went to Cuba because my mother had one of her sisters living there.
Even after I was transferred from the immediate area  I would still come back a few times and later on made it possible for her to be nearer where I was and uh I found her some lodging...her and friend in in Munich where I had been transferred after the war.
And only later  after the war  we realized then that was pr obably the OSS people.
They have pi cked it up a lot  but at that time  ten years after the war it was just total denial.
And I used to help my father  I learned how to sew  and then the war start.

I remind you also that not until 20 years later was there any criticism above the president at the time  President Roosevelt and the Congress for not  you know  opening up the door and saving people  which of course in retrospect we all realize should have happened but at that time  I mean we went  everyone  all the Jewi sh refugees and the non-Jewish refugees who came to America after the war found this a land of opportunity and equality and you know  place where you could start and didn't matter what you had been  if you wanted to become something you could and we were very patriotic about that and I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 32 internalized that very fast.

I said  the war is over a year  if you didn't hear by mail or if nobody came home  that means it's over.
So I had in my mind said  ﬁMaybe if I will not be able to proceed with my education down there  my parents will not be able to -- to afford it  so Ill go to Palestine and maybe down there Ill proceed  or whatever it is necessary to do.ﬂ But -- and then -- and then you are asking me about before the war  correct?
I made it to a lovely  colorful  untouched by war  just fabulously looking town in Sweden called Goteborg.
I also find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to meet with prisoners of war.
Well  somebody that you work -- happened to work with before the war even and -- yeah.
And for example  I knew a former colleague  non -Jews  who was  his father was in the Army  and at one point we start to talk with him about  to meet him and to talk about the war  about the  what's going on  and he had some good feelings about our fight.
And there was one Quaker service in the Second World War.

And so we -- for us the war wasnt over until two weeks after V-J day.

Now  war is over  I want to sell the real estate  so I want to go there.

That peaceful life  that life of storekeepers  tradesmen  craftsmen  minor civil servants  was interrupted by the war.
And as I mentioned be fore  he had been in America before the war.
If -- Id like to get a sense of your -- youre a young woman at the ti -- at the time that the war began  what were your dreams and hopes at that time for yourself?

Well  in preparing for this interview  I did read one thing that right after that war  that there was a -- a few situations of anti-Semitism and that people attributed it to the Nazis had sown some seeds  and -- and then it -- it kind of was pushed away again  but that -- that it was hard right after the war  and some people were grumbling and saying  oh  everythings the Jews fault.

Why did they go to Villefranche and would stay there for the remainder of the war?
I think the government began imposing anti -Semitic measures right away  beginning with the war.
Uh  my mother came from the Polish side of the Bug River and and my father was on the Russian side and  uh  they were childhood friends and they immigrated to the United States at different times and met in New York and my father was in World War I and  uh  in the infantry which  uh  I was quite proud of as you'll find out later.
Do you ever talk with your -- or years ago  did you talk with your daughters about your experiences during the war?
The war started  I was almost -- slightly older than 1 year old.
And so in that sense  I didnt know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this.
And that turned the war into the battle -- and that turned the war into the battle for England.
Bu t anyway  this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley took a -- pictures of this room with all the mask  with the colored light  and so we had a jolly good laugh at that time  and reali zed that the war was really over  we could talk about it.
But I loved Austria...and I stayed in Austria after the war and I went to school there  and my husband was   before I met my husband.
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 7 Right  and he was quite active in in in that military  he was already in reserves  but Soviets still  you know  has So youre talking now youre jumping a little bit to World War II Oh  yes.

>> Susan Snyder: What happened -- how did you regroup after the war?
I was in the orphanage til the war ended in..in 45.
We re mained enemy aliens for the duration of the war -- >> Bill Benson: That was because you were German by birth?
And the third brother  this very wealthy guy  he came to New York  he -- he -- he had a lots of money in Switz erland  but the war it came  so then he come to Italy with the rest of us  but when you come to the Italian part I w ill explain it to you what happened.
And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy  both i ndividual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war  but the experiences  the feelings  the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period.
Before we talk about the events that happened after that  wh at happened with the war and you were trying to get out of Austria and coming to the United States  first tell us what your life was like before those events began  in your family  your community.
The people who were in Madrid  there was a large colony of Jewish people who had been there since 34 '41 or '40  you know  when it was still--before the Americans got into the war  there was some kind of a pipeline  but af ter--definitely after '42  once the Germans had occupied the whole thing  nobody had passed  so I was a newcomer and everybody was so eager to know everything.
And German know this after the war  and before too  the big concentration Jewish people in Poland  thats  15 from my point of view  was created and yet -- and German created so many concentration camps in Poland.
Fo r instance  there -- there was a -- a countess who was collaborating with the Germans and they put her in jail after the war.
Did World War II  in some ways aside from the bombing  did it ever kind of come up in co nversation as to whats going on in Germany  whats going on in Interview with Joachim Baer March 1  2010 28 Oh yes  yes.
Yet during the war  before we left  we had to take in into a spare room another fellow which was not Jewish; and he lived in our house.
I remember after the war  after we re turned from Auschwitz  a new -- a crop of teachers came  and I presumed school in -- in Serbian.
Right after the war we returned to Warsaw  my mother wanted to get that briefcase.
I remember waking up from the sound of airplanes  and the telephone rang at 5:30  6:00 in the morning  and my aunt said  \ Don't be upset  but the war has started.\
Tell me about what happened when the Nazis...what happened when the war broke out?
And I played stupid  and -- and during the second interrogation  the Gestapo man by the name of Wipper  [indecipherable] Wipper -- we never found him after the war.
So when youre referring to the day that the war started  youre talking about the date that England -- England went to war.
I was with a group of young people  we wer -- we survived the war intact.
Caught -- conscripted and caught up in a war they didnt understand and didnt have any responsibility for -- Mm  thats right. --
This house was occupied during the war by Germans  and later on Polish authority -- the city or town  village o ffices were set in this house  and my father just left it the way it was.
Okay  describe for me what it was like when the war began and the setting up of the ghetto  and what things you saw then.
Like when my brother said  \ Listen  and if should you not  should German not win the war  we will protect you  we will be here vouching for your good behavior and for your humane behavior.
This is the 50th anniversary this year  of the end of the war.
A nd to the end  you know  I couldn't...couldn't see any other way out but to come back to Kovno  and when I came back to Kovno  two days later... The invasion... The invasion...German...German war break out and so as I said yesterday  I went from the from the pot to the to the fire.
People are getting killed  there is a war going on  you got it good here.ﬂ So we told him  we said  ﬁWe will have to return those  we cant even touch it.
Yes indeed  because I remember them taking me to synagogue  and playing with my neighbors and taking me sled riding  and What are your first memories of the war?
But  the lady who rented the place had two children and one boy was about a year or two older than I was at the time and he and I had become really good friends in the war and sort of partners in crime  you know  we could think of every possible mischief and we would just do it.
Thank you very  very much  Mrs. Tobis  for agreeing to speak with us today  and to share your experiences of what happened to you and your family during World War II.
Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War  in 1915...the war was...the the front was standing in our town for about a year so Sov...the Czarist Russia and Germans.
After the war he went  according to -- I have no real proof but it was kind of corroborated.
So  Id like to start with those and then move into your life since the war ended.
You told me when we first met  in your early years before war broke out that life was beautiful for you.
Mostly  the Jews were not -- they had a bad feeling towards the Jews even before the war.
When your children were the age when they could really seriously study World War II and the Holocaust  did that elicit anything from you?
And of course she actually signed us up  we did go to a German school there after the war for a little bit  but not very long  about two months.
The awful thing that happened  very shortly after the war  1946  was that my brother contracted scarlet fever and died within three days.
I mean  here the war was practically upon us  the German Army.
And Kielce was a big town  a big city and had a lot of Jews before the war.
As uh as a rather neglected but uh byline we told to ferret out war criminals and uh those uh guilty of uh genocide and and so forth and uh the first inklings we got of what really had happened were when we did extract such information from prisoners.
German prisoners of war  they put us in charge of the prisoners.
So I flew down to that near Warsaw was a summer place where they were before the war sending TB patients.
What you were feeling at that time  how did you learn the war was over  because that's a pretty important . . .
So he knew how to -- how to work for the government because he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces  not too many people nowadays know this.
And then we heard President Roosevelt   you know  say that were at war.
We were ready to go to–Israel but the War of Independence was going on and I will be maybe selfish to–admit that.
So my first boots that I wore after the war was some small soldier's boots.
A. My uncle turned to my aunt and he said  the war must have done something to her mind.
So  in fact  during the whole length of the war we were Dutch Jews.
When you realised  did you -- when you realised that America was entering the war  did you enlist  were you drafted?
I heard that he was alive almost to the very end of the -- of the war  almost to 19 -- almost to the end of the war.
>> Bill Benson: You would live in Belgium for the next ye ar until World War I broke out -- >> Fred Kahn: World War II.
Well  he was a reserve officer when the war broke out  so he was called in  and he was almost immediately captured actually  in Lithuania .
But my mother  even before the war  somehow she said  ﬁThere is no future in Poland for Jews  let us go to Israel.ﬂ It was not yet Israel  still Palestine.
Now when my father was alive and he talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto.
ﬂ By the time some Russian or someone occupier would end the war.
But when the Americans  with the vast machinery for production  came into the war  somehow we really knew we might win.
And then they went to England  then they both were in British uniform  fighting for the allies  til the end of the war.
She was not as wild as she was during the war.
I dont remember  th ey were very often  and they increased in frequency as the war progressed.
And in that vei n  he wants to tell us that it is up to us to prevent any big loss of population  the Germans gave him a number of children between the ages -- I dont remember  young children  but not too young  you know  the -- they -- the Germans will bring those children to a sp ecial care -- camp  that they will get a very good care  better than 77 in the ghetto  that he can assure us will happen  and that will allow the ghetto to survive til war is ended.
Well  lets -- lets talk about that now  the end of the war.
It was my real uncle  after the war and they  I don't remember  it was some friends of my uncle that they heard from somebody else th at was in the camp with my parents.
Did you ever hear about OTRŠOrganization through Training and Rehabilitat ion  an organization would exist even today in different countriesŠin Sudan  in Russia now and soŠ Because my mother during the war  she send me was a designer from Vienna who used to give in a school.
During the war  it had exchanged diplomatic people  Japanese from the United States to Japan  etc.
I usually  I mean I started going to school in the village where we lived  that was during the war and that was pretty traumatic to me b ecause the teacher was Ukrainian and he was  I Edwarda Rorat 12 February 25  1996 Page 12 was the only Jewish kid in the class and he hated my guts.
You know what the war is like  now you can start working on it.
So the war was still stagnated -- s-stalemate -- a stalemate  there was -- th-there were not -- not -- didnt move  nothing happened.
This was the old man who passed away after war  a few years after war.
But to lose ones country  for which my uncle had died in World War I  my father and biological father were both officers in World War I  fighting this country Ill give you an example of my family.
There was war so I uh we we try...everyday we hope the war will finish and uh we be free.
Because of the war  I had to change myself  because if I went to school in Russia  I had to be better.
I know that many of those who returned after the war to Russia  the NKB were not very nice to them.
>> Gideon Frieder: It's true that the war proper didn't come to Slovakia until 1944 triggered by the uprising against the fascist government of Slovakia.
Okay  before the break  we were talking an awful lot about your childhood  your early years  which coincided with the war years  when you were having your very first impressions  your very first memories  and your father was the director the governor general of Poland.
How did the rest of your family fare once the war was over and independence was won in Israel?
And you know  if you read  you know  about the book  ﬁAll Quiet on the Western Frontﬂ by a German writer  Remarque  who describes the first World War in the west.
So when they broke when the war broke out  she saw with the Germans beating up shi Jewish children in her little place  so she decide to run away  came to us.
And the -- the -- her husband went to war with the Po les.
They came to the city of Bamberg in Germany after the war  and from there they went to Poland.
Not so much  uh  because of the war and what the Germans did  but the...all the misery that we had seen  of everybody.
But then I was preparing myself to go to engineering and the war striked and no more school.
And on the Carrera there were a few buildings that had no windows  the war had gone   had happened there before th is happened a nd in these few 16 buildings  we were  I would say  20 or 30 people in a small room  so that  and we slept on the floor.
There's a war still going on i n other parts of Europe.
They used these papers which were given out by the Jewish N ational Fund as cantors as docume nts of having been displaced persons because of the war.
Today  after the war  the names of those people have been established  and it is known that it was done with all of the perfidy of the consequences that such a form of extermination carries with it.
Although it takes a whil its gonna take quite a while  but since nobody else has done it  which is part of why I did my book on the origins of World War II  I figured Id give it a try.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 120 Okay  so that would have been well after the war.
So he lived under the -- on the Soviet -- I mean  he was in the Soviet Union for part of the war.
And in those days before the second World War  this was a beautiful profession.
It showed a picture of a B-17 and a silhouette of a B-29  showed how much bigger the B-29 was and that we warned the Germans that they were going to start using these planes on th em if they dont surrender  and stuff like that  you know  and and it showed how Am ericans treat German prisoners of war  and stuff  it showed them in mess halls and stuff like that.
When Am erica got into the war  he said to her  \ You have to go into the Red Cross.\
So I -- by the nature of the animal  life would be different because of the war in so many ways which I cannot eve -- trace.
At least I didnt understand anything about the Jewish question before the war was over  then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naive in that way  you know.
So we they took a they found a lady who had been a teacher before the war  and she was the wife of a of a she was Polish  not Jewish  and she was the wife  a young wife of a Polish deserter.
10 The only time that I remember really anti-Semite is just before war  that I faced that.
So  when we are loaded on those trains  I dont know that we know that were going to Auschwitz or I dont even know that - I mean  I didnt - I didnt even know that Auschwitz existed  but I figured if there is a war and the soldiers are moving closer  there will be soldiers fighting with soldiers.
And we knew  all of us  that the war was a terrible thing.
Anyway  the people that I met never  with the exception of the old lady in Berlin after the war  who admitted that she was Nazi and so were all her friends  the doctor and the personnel in the spa were very nice.
When the war had been   the war was still going on.
In -- you had to -- I think it was in Germany  it was also before the war  in Czechoslovakia that everybody had to be registered at the police station.
And this was the nature of Hungarian Judaism lasted until the First World War when everything ended.
So the brother died in service before the first World War?
But my question is  how large was the community before the war  the Jewish community in Serei?
I was 20th Congress which was the last Zionist World Congress  before the war.
And -- not for permission  okay  I wa nt you to tell me if  from what you know about military discipline and military command structures if this can be looked at as a war crime.
I admire his courage and strength that he exhibited during the war.
After the war  I found out that the people who pushed me away  like Alec Lamenstor  for example  my boyfriend who wanted -- we became fiance  he pushed me away  they were all killed.
When he was searched after placing all these things into these barrels and buckets  they found a small amount...like a dollar bill in one of his little vest pockets and because of that  he was lined up against the war to be shot too.
And he and the family here in Brooklyn worked on the papers and got them ready just before the war broke out.
After war was end some Russian people  in this concentration camp was 5 000 Russi an army officers  and this people was stoned one guy (??)
Then and they s the Farkos couple even survived  and they went after the war to Israel  and they died then in Israel.
Everybody used to say  if they will take us to Germany  they are going to put us to work until the end of the war and then we will come back.
Now tell me about before the war  how life changed for you  what you remember.
He went to this camps because from this camps  because like for instance at the Sarvar where we were  there was the camp where the war was full-written  goodbye  goodbye because from Sarvar they went to the German concentration camps.
And the efforts I tried to make would be after the war.
And after that he was the official photographer of Admiral Horthy 1 whom he knew from World War I  from Vienna.
And I thank to the mill with his wife because nobody from from the Poles would take us in without money and without promises that after the war  they will be big shots or rich. (
We didnt call it the Holocaust  of cour se  we called it the war  or the camps  or the Nazis  whatever.

I re member vividly  I must have gone to school because I was in Heidelberg  and they had a bi g exhibition under a tent in the middle of the town square of some of the war booty that they had captured in Poland and France.
Well lets go back to that time  immediately after the war when youre -- youre -- you joined the Czech legion -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 52 Yeah. --
The end of the war  Harry Truman and I share a birthday.
Our landlord  he was the head of fences before the war.
And I remember I had to bring some proof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise I could not have gone.
He had this document from still the Reichsbank  and that he had was going to Holland to bid on some very important mate rials which were needed for the the war effort in Germany or for the military  and they couldnt keep us incarcerated because he had to get on with this business.
I mean  my father was a soldier in the first World War.
In we were open...we were there and from then we went to war.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0026 17 Ill tell you  as far as I can remember  we were so numb  that wh en they told us the war is over in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want -- we want to go  we couldnt go anywhere.
Did you overhear your parents talking about the war and all the terrible things that were happening?
So he start the factory of smoking fish  and he was very successful with that because in those days   in the first World War  the Russian army had no C-rations like today  and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a piece of bread.
Interviewer: Did your father ever talk about World War I or the Revolution.
Why a farm and not any other kind of employment  because you see  as a  as a youth organization  as a Zionist organization  even before the war we prepared ourselves to refarm workers to live on a kibbutz in  in later Israel  so that's what we wanted to do.
Because look  before before the war  whe-when I learn history in the school  Lithuania was like  in a way  ene my of Poland   you know.
And when we met a week ago or two  she didn't believe that I don't get money from the Nazi war because we went through so much  we said  \ Ours was our daughters\ .
After the war  I had various jobs  the bo the first the first job I had was a manual job  polishing buffing the metal.
He was a very nice fellow  who became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army  and then I found out later on  when I met him after the war  in Prague  how terrible all these officer were treated.
Had I known that the that the war ended  I would have just marched onto the American side.
Because before  many people had accepted -- they were against the alliance with Germany from day one  because of the memory of World War One  because when German and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner  farmer family treated them well.
So he had finished law school and was already a practicing lawyer before the war?
And right after the  right during the war  when the ghetto was finished and we ran away from the ghetto  my mother left a lot of things with that lady.
They want also to print in the gay news  they want to show the world that the war and the stupid rules of the war in Nazi time must be over  never again.
No  he came from Poland  from Lodz  just before the war.
There was a woman with two children - her husband was in the war.
It turned out that during the war he was in Hungary and he had a Hungarian wife.
You said your husband was from Iasi  just tell me what happened to him during the war.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: At the end of the war he was exhausted and worn ou t  worn out.
My father was 29 when the war broke out and they had this 2 -year -old kid on their hands.
So the first half a hour after the outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might  the Lithuanian fascists -- they called themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists   I don't know exactly -- the very same organization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities  they were within one half an hour in uniforms.
And because she was in Garmisch  uh  before the war ended  so she had a rights to to be considered as a...as a person with permanent resident in Garmisch.
And so we were really advanced and so during the war years  and we talk 21 when I was 21  I was studying for what you would call a masters.
I was in his office on one of my trips home reporting to him  and a congressman was in his office at that time and several of his deputies were up there and I was just standing in the group of them  and because I was present the subject got around to war crimes program.
Were you ever afraid again  the way you had been during the war  that -- that something bad could happen to you  simply because you were Jewish?
Well  uh  you know that  that the war started in 1939  and I was in Switzerland minding my own business  and  uh  I just came back to Switzerland from a wonderful trip  uh to  France with other students  and when we arrived back to Geneva '39  beginning of September  uh there was a Zionist Congress in  uh  Geneva  and the people took time out in the beaches  and we were all out in the beach with my friends  and suddenly the microphone blared that Poland was overrun by the Nazis.
And  lo and behold  years after  after the war when I first remembered this  I looked and there is a little scar there.
They may not have had anything to do with each other before the war  you know  either socially or academical ly  or what have you  but just know that if not your family  somebody from your town was there  this became th e closest kinship that could be.
Before we turn to the war  tell us a little about your parents and their life in Brussels  Belgium in those prewar ti mes.
Was he in -- in Britain for the duration of the war?
indecipherable] i-i-its a -- was the -- the anti-Sem ites in the communist party wanted the Jews out  because -- So where were you when the war was over?
But you know it better than I do  that the world we live in now is probably going to be very easy to declare thats a civil war  thats a civil war  thats a civil war.
Our job is to get home  not tra try not to be taken prisoners of war  but get home  because we will be needed.
Because we were i -- we were in the war  right?
You come with us  and some other people with whom we met there  so we went there  and he had a little house and he had a basement for I don't know what  maybe washing or...we didn't have washing machines...and he gave us that and he gave...uh there was a mattress  two mattresses  and there was a... PAUSE - BLANK IN TAPE USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 19 ...Russians liberated Budapest and if you could tell us how the end of the war appeared to you and what you did with your husband and your daughter at that point in time?
And I still insist today that actually the real winner of war were the Russians.
Because the First World War told him what – what happens Š i ts a war .
I saw her again about tw o years after the war.
So when I left  one of the things my parents had tried to get us out  which I did tried to do and I did manage to get my twin brother out  but unf ortunately the war broke out  and I could not get my parents out  and they perished in Auschwitz.
indecipherable] the war  we didnt talk a bout what we will do when we -- because we really didnt believe that we could survive the war.
Neighbor was Jew  people where he was before work  before war he was work with them...also that they was still make the dress uh but for the store also  but the the Jew was uh persecuting and uh and uh buying...they can't go out.
He said that if he survives the war  after the war he will do anything for me.
Uh on the one hand  for instance  there were a few uh...which has nothing to do directly with the War Refugee Board but it has to be mentioned as something which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh agreements.
03:14:04 So  they thought that they're going to survive the war  for sure.
First I war -- I had a friend  her name was Eva  we went to  as I mentioned  to learn cosmetic together.
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 15 And they were dividing the land after the war.
02:09:05 I mean  you can tell from the way I spoke a few minutes ago about Roosevelt  that I had absolutely no question in my mind or emotions about the purposes of the war.
Again now  Im talking about befo re 1939  before the war.
Uh today the community is about the same size as it was before the Second World War.
Before the war  this used to be the ...the....also a \ ambulance\ --like social...social medicine station [ NB: perhaps \ ambulatorium\  (Pol)  an outpatient facility of a hospital].
The war was going to end  and we were starving  for starving.
After the war there were t-two of us in that school who were Jewish.
So now  what is your memory  your first memory of the war when it began?
My youngest brother was only 6 when the war broke out so I started to tutor him.
He was a very clever young man  and he walked up to the German and said  ﬁShe is my best worker  if you take her away  itll hurt the war effort.ﬂ He thought hed kill him  but he didnt  he just left  and left her.
Was that the time that the United States was at war with Japan?
Uh...They...in a farm house  and the people took pity on him and he stayed there all through the war in Lithuania  and then went back to Kaunas and he got married and my brother brought them to Israel and he just died about 2 years ago.
So in fact  we used to walk it after the war.
Interview with Tole Madna April 18  2002 32 So now its the end of the war and how much longer did Bobby stay with you?
He always give us hope  all the girls; and the girls took care of him after the war by helping him.
There were some bad times  sometimes he was very sick but all in all he  in the end of the war  he was much better than a few years earlier.
And when war broke out  of course  a month later  I mean  everything stopped.
An older brother lived thro ugh most of the war  but managed to come to the United States.
All you have to do is look at the history of World War 2 and see how it went for the Germans  how it went for the Japanese and took a long  long time before it started turning and the front was very  very far from us to do us any good when it started to turn in our favor.
24 Charles LaFollette (1890-1974); Representati ve from Indiana  Deputy Chief Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg in 1947.
Let me ask you  as -- as were moving forward in time and -- and it -- and its getting a little bit further away from the horribly traumatic experiences that youd had during the war  and youre getting older at the same time  at this point are you beginning to feel certain things  remember certain things  realize the -- the depth of -- of tragedy of what had happened to your family and -- and -- and to you personally  or -- or was this -- or were you just sort of going on in life and moving forward and youre living another life and going ahead?
A nd usually th-they still were looking for witnesses  and by chance they found me in Ameri ca  and I could help a little bit  so I was asked to come to the Netherlands  and I spoke to the big shot from this war documentation  and he told me that our denomination  Christian Reformed  and its really small  were the highest in resistance  and al so had given most of their lives.
I lived there for a year for sure and I gave him my brother to the orphanage because I didn't have any money and I went to the orphanage after the war.
Th en later on they said two because they really saw we needed -- we re -- really need workers because they all -- they all wants to go -- you couldnt get Austrian wo rkers because theyre all going to war  you know?
I feel guilty to my sister   to myself because I don't have any pictures of my family  my parents from before the war.
One flight up from that was the wonderful woman whose husband had died in the First World War.
We already have guns  because during the ja -- the war  I hired few different guns  and I hired few different radiopera.
But its hard  its hard to be very religious when I know some people all together forgot about religion after the war  others went just to religion to get strength in life.
But  you may know or not know  that in Belgium  in addition to Christmas  the children celebrate St. Nicholas and that was the big event for the children before World War II.
And the garrison  the German oc -- the German garrison in Limoge was not the same as it had been before June of 1944  because some of them were sent to the war front.
But he announced during the war and after  all the news  whats happening on the front.
That's where I spent the first year and a half of the war.
One was nice Oh  the other reaction that says oh  now now now  we may have another war.
And so we had to give the apartment  you know  to them  because the wa y they continue the war  the raids  they couldn't live in Naples or in ot her country of the south.
I do not think that I was bothered by it  because during the war  I was about a half a year or eight months  hidden under assumed name in -- in the parish of a Lutheran minister  so that somehow I was used to Christianity  as far as that goes.
Al-All a prisoner of war doctor  all German German doctors came in  in the although we went to the hospital there.
>> Bill Benson: You were instrumental in helping them after the war get recognized as righteous Gentiles?
Yeah  they survived in a -- in such way that I have three of them  one -- one book was -- two books were -- were given me by the students of his -- o-of his school after the war.
I don't think the war was over until spring of '45.
And I always remember that barn  there was a big storm before the war  and the wind tore the whole roof off  and we had to pay a lot of money to rebuild the roof on it  and the Polish government put a new tax on us for the new roof  instead of giving us a tax reduction.
Now  looking at you  most of you if not all of you  are not World War II veterans.
Before the war I actua lly didn't have contact with the Polish people  only in the place where I worked  they used to come in as customers and I used to talk with them a little bit.
A fra -- as a little -- because you were -- 4 Always he dressed nice  even after the war he dressed nice.
Split is a small town on the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia  about 50 000 population before the war.
His father and his mother were a dear friend of mine before the war.
You figured it's a war  maybe the war is going to finish tomorrow.
She told my father  she said  Well  the Russians were worse to us in World War 11 I than the Germans.
6 My father was let go after four weeks because he was a veteran of World War I  was fighting in the German Army  so they let him go.
We -- especially during the war  we kept very  very close  because thats all we had.
So I was not that close to her even though I wa s with her all the time and practically  I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this  but my father  and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a yo ung man because he was always away in  in the concentration camp.
So  you know  I spent some time in Japan  at Okinawa and so on  in the Korean War .
In ‚47  it was still very difficult to move around  and my family managed to book passage for me on the SS Ernie Pyle -- you know  Er-Ern ie Pyle was a war correspondent and this troop ship was named after him and then it was converted to transport people.
All through the war  I thought my parents would survive because of the sort of things he did in the village.
There were four  when the war ended  there was the English  the Russian the American.
Yeah  I would like  I was thinking to be safe as was before the war when we can go everywhere and nothing happen to us.
Do you have a choice if you think its a war -- if its a war crime?
We stayed all the time til the end of the war together.
talk about that period as the war ended and what was going on in your life.
And it was real Jewish hospitality that was known before the war which was absent during the war and again  you know  it was like slowly coming back to life.
Uh from there uh...this these were the the final stages of the war  that it was becoming quite obvious that it would soon be over  but uh reports reached us that uh the town a few miles away from there was was ready to surrender because there were uh flying white flags uh from from their houses and uh so it became my job  along with uh a very small medical detachment and and the military government uh detachment  uh to go to that town and take take the surrender.
When he agreed  I hoped that time we will outlast this nightmare of the war.
After seeing Buchenwald  after seeing the concentration camp  did it change your attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?
Let's start with start with you telling me what it was like to hear that the war had begun  and how everyday life changed  wearing the yellow star  all the things that changed.
So my father  knowing that previous war -- the war first  they took the rations when they occupied.
Well  after the war she told my mother that as she was trying to save my life she said  \ At the same time I was thinking where am I going to bury your child.
And it turned out finally he was all right  and after the war I  I spoke to him.
As soon as the war was over  this all broke up  you know.
Im going to start our interview by talking an awful lot about what pre-war life was like  so that we get a better understanding of how things really changed for you when the war actually occurred.
And tell us a little bit about your family life before the war.
What occurs if later we're in Germany  and after th e war we might be repatriated  liberated to France  which was a neighboring country  or to Palestine  which is where we're headed in the first place.
And I figured customs office  its war time  theres no trade  what -- what customs office?
So you met Hugo a long time ago  bef-before the war?
Then  there was  after the war  in Ukraine  near my town  a family that I told you they were hiding  four kids in [indecipherable].
He was prisoner of war  he had been taken as being the only official left of his entire battalion because everybody run.
They shortly after the war  it was either in 1940 it probably was I would guess it was in 1946  I would guess.
Did you talk to her about --about your war experience  about the Holocaust?
Certainly our people  many of our people were were crying and so and and praying  and my reaction was  I said be happy uh to see them b ecause you might have relatives sitting in the cockpit  you know  and and doing this work in our interest  and certainly you had to reckon that you could be also amongst the targets  but this is...in war  you know  you you you unfortunately you don't know where it hits.
>> Bill Benson: Dora  when Germany launched its attack on Yugoslavia on August 6  1941  which  of course  was roughly 18 months after the war had begun elsewhere in Europe  you were away from Zagreb on a visit with relatives in Ludbreg.
Insdg No  not that I -- no not that I -- Did you ever see combat before the end of the war?
He was any anyway  he he was told to the woman  who spoke beautiful Russian because she was born in Saint Petersburg before the war.
And I think all this war I ha d always this feeling  I'm not going to make it  nobody's going to make it  no Jew is going to make it  but we have to make them pay dearly.
I said  ﬁFor heaven sakes  there is another war and nothing has been learned?
He was selling coal before the war and during the war and after the war.
Well because of Eric who stayed after the war to try to find what was going on.
You know  I was nobody Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8  1993 47recognize  you see  the way they were I paid the fortune for my life during the war  because I they people were recognizing  the Polacks  from my husband from my fathers factory guy  he was running after me from one tram tramway to another  and I escaped.
Just before war started between Russians and Germans  they came  they left Russian side and they came back to Warsaw and my brother left right away for my parents to Kielce and were there.
And of course this was in the early days and right after the war  40 -- middle of 1945 and so things were still a sense of -- I mean  its like if you look at films  American films from that time  they speak about Uncle Joe and that everything was friendly and these were our allies and blah  blah  blah.
Uh  then the war was over pretty quick which we all know  and uh  where to go.
I was doing bricklaying and painting a lot and I learne d the trade very good in the war  I was very good  young  and I kept my mouth shut  because I was afraid.
You dont know much about the war; that will give you a good picture to realize whats-whats going on.
The only nice thing in this camp was that there were German war prisoners and other British were walking outside.
If you would m eet the tram  if the tram would be coming  or if the person No  simple  simple this that was my own I was all the time thinking what will be when it end the war  I will find my parents  or not.
They thought parents have to know  and after the war theyll be confronted with the fact  and this  so -- I mean  I could have avoided that  that they still had to have that sorrow.
And up there to in the cor Up there is Wilno   Wilno we have been many times a number of times we have been during the World War II.
What was happening in your life right be fore the war?
At that time there was a law that whoever finished medicine after the war in Vienna  cannot be allowed to  to take the boards.
I heard that  after we left  there was such pandemonium  and I think that this continued until the end of the war  there was never  nothing ever ran smoothly  it seems.
I was away from the war for nearly six y ears  not having any contact  isol ated from the whole world.
German patrols began appearing in our neighborhood dressed in what were known before the war as anti- [102] suits.
3 My grandmother lived with us  my father's mother who had been widowed in World War I. She sent her two eldest daughters whom I had never met until I came to the United States to the golden land.
And my and my mothers twin sister  who died of a of the influenza epidemics after the first World War.
Where were you when yo u heard that the war in Europe was over?
1 Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.
But I knew  we all knew the war was coming to an end  and we even knew that before I was arrested.
So what I did literally the day the war was over  May 8th  1945  I wrote a letter to the then head of the company and said  \ I just don't feel like coming back as an employee  but I do want to maintain a relationship with the company  and I want to start my own public relations firm when I get back  and I want Fergus on Company to be my first client.\
So we got to the court  I parked my car  I -- like I said  I was in uniform  and came out with her  and theres a -- a guard or some guy up there by the doors on the courtroom  and the courtroom is filled already with people  complete -- the guy said  ﬁCant go in  its full.ﬂ Well  I figured I am an officer in the United States army  they lost the war  Im going to go in  no matter what.
But later  after war when I spoke to her  she said to me that in Lvov they were afraid to keep me because apparently they were in the middle of the town and they were simply afraid.
And lada -- some of the people that immigrated before the war had relatives sendi ng back letters  and telling him all about the buildings here  and all the things  what was happening.
How long after the war began in Poland was this armistice when you went back to Warsaw?
We sudde nly  when the war started  many Jewish people fled from Poland and came and each and every family brought in somebody to live because they there were quite a few but this is a habit of Jewish people someone comes over and would sleep over a night and then stay and if they dont have money they dont pay.
Of the three million Polish Jews from before the war only about 250 000 were still alive at the end of the war.
Well  my father left Poland from the port of Gdynia  or Gdansk in late August  with the last ship to leave a Polish port before the war started.
Because after the war my father came to this country and after the war he went to the Red Cross to find out about relatives.
Excuse me  before we go on there again  I the reason why I ask about the war years is  how did your family react  how did your parents react when they when the U.S. when the war started in Europe ?
From my one and only aunt that came to the United States just before the war and pictures from her and making copies whatever I can get  anything and as many pieces of information I'm able to collect from the couple of surviving members of the family and it's basically genealogy but I am not going back very far because right now I'm not well  but I want to do this for those of my  members of my family who were killed and even those few who survived and I would like this  to give this for my children  who did not know their aunts  uncles  grandparents or cousins  so that they will know their family  at least through these pictures and whatever information I can gather and write down for them.
I'm not...I'm just using this opportunity to show that you 96 had to to use absolutely unusual methods  a nd it was...now let's go back to the action of the of the War Refugee Board and what was.
Uh...Because I had fought in the Spanish Civil War  I could take advantage of the fact that the Spanish government had said that anyone who had fought...any foreigner who fought in this war who should ever find himself in difficulties could turn to th e Spanish Diplomatic authorities for help.
You know  as youre talking about this  wh -- you know  where you started talking about looking at this picture  and youre talking about the war thats going on now in -- in Yugoslavia and Serbia and Kosovo and -- and were looking at the picture of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 76 these children  youre talking about war and children.
>> Irene Weiss: Hungary was allied with Germany but by 1944  the Germans were losing the war and the Hungarian government realized that they might be on the losing end of this war so they attempted to pull out of the alliance.
World War II began in September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland from the west followed quickly by the Soviets attacking Poland from the east.
>> Bill Benson: You told me at one point that you remember the joy and exhilaration of the people at the end of the war  the French people.
After the war was over  and you said you -- After what?
I only remember things like...like my mother gave out some Persian rugs to some Christian friends because we had...my father was 4 years...in the first World War  he was decorated.
So he said  \ In the afternoon you have to go up to the palace to do the new Secretary of War.\
We were -- what -- what they did is  I dont know if you saw any other videos  but -- but -- or if youve read anything about the Holocaust  but towards the end of the war  when Hitler started to lose the war  he started -- I use the word he because of Hitler  but basically its -- he didnt do it alone  obviously  he had his machinery that worked for him  all the people that ran the camps and ga thered the Jews and drove the Jews to the death camps and drove the trains and so forth.
>> Bill Ben son: Your father had served in the German army in World War I  right?
But he was worn out   a widower traveling during all the war  for the whole duration of the war  under the threat of being arrested.
If anyone's seen on television not so long ago  it was brought the story back to life  the way Stalin was forewarned about all the things that Hitler was going to attack but it did not want to listen to and he even went away and executed some guys  calling them propagandists and until the war broke out  he didn't want to believe that that would be the case.
Well  if I have to continue about the Moscovitz   then he died  and then I saw Mrs. Moscovitz when she went to Milan  a-after the war sh-she was there.
Well  how do you think that  having witnessed what you witnessed  what kind of an impact did that have on you as a person  after the war?
When you when you helped those two families come here in the early 70s  was was that the first time you were helping refugees from Europe after the war  or Yes  yes.
In my experience that I had in the war doing almost around 3 000 operations  which many surgeons never see in a lifetim e  the experience I obtained there was not recognized by the surgical specialty group.
He had the possibility to see the documents because he was working ther e as a doctor together with the German block meister but he finished before the war.
I wanted to  on this question  still talking about post-war  and ha your your feeling  and your relation to Germany   we jumped ahead to more recent times  but the first time you saw your nanny  after the war.
But when I came back  I took my mother oh very quick after the war  ma ybe two year after war or three year after the war.
What you did after the war (the war crimes work)  how important was that for you?
One was Maria Borofska  and because somebody by same name met me  that was -- so my name -- I got the new papers  which was Maria Vorshinska  and that was my name during the war  and even after the war  I just kept this name til I got married.
We tend to think of the expe rience of Polish Jews as being in ghettos and concentration camps  very formal places  but of approximately 3 million Jewish people who lived in Poland before the war  about 250 000 survived by being in the Soviet Union.
I was taking in about some war  and one side is going to lose  and these guys are going to get it  and theyre leaving  walking away -- way -- when people saw these trucks  or whatever it was  with [indecipherable] German soldiers running  the commentary was theyre surrendering  theyre escaping  theyre doi ng something.
Not like was after the war -- After the war  yeah  yeah  right. --
So he said  ﬁWell  gee  how long were you in forz -- in war zone?ﬂ I said  ﬁTwo and a half years.ﬂ ﬁTwo and a half years?
Did they more often want to talk about the war time experiences in co mparison to their past before the war?
In those early days of the second world war  things went extremely well for the German s. They conquered France without too many problems.
So while you were in hiding  were there any other -- did you just think you would stay in hiding the entire time of the war?
My question was what was their reactions when the full extent came out after the war was over.
If I had a secretary to the fiflagunsaftargum -- Dagushensky  Yelsi Dagushensky  her father was before the war the -- the cormeister for the Jewish temple.
I found out after the war when I went back  I found out subsequently that the Belgians  th e fire-fighters were given strict orders not to make any attempt to contain the fire unless it started touching buildings.
So I thought I had it made and even after war I thought I had it made  but what was the thing was I was in the Jewish barracks  the only place which was segregated inside the camp was the hospital  they had one barracks for Aryan prisoners and one for Jewish and the ones in the Jewish got virtually nothing to eat.
And they were tried on slave labor using large numbers of slave labors  using concentration camp inmates  and going into occupied countries as Flick Enterprises and...and profiting from using the property of occupied people against the laws of war.
When she -- when the war ended  the village was about five or eight miles away from her town in Lewino [?]
Well I -- I am curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered in many different places  and your mom would -- would travel [indecipherable] and Im sure its -- what [indecipherable] look like.
I might tell you a story about  uh  uh  th e war  though.
So in 1938  you moved to Zwolen and then when the war broke out--?
And I had I felt for all the people that that were against the war and all that  although you know  I was sort of a military something or other  nothing serious.
