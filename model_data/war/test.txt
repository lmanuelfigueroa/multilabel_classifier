But this was a very special time  yes  that -- that his profession was very good  in the peaceful  when he was working in [indecipherable] army  where you have the [indecipherable] in -- i -- i -- i -- during the war.
Now  how long was that after the liberation of the camp?
When I see that  I get very upset  because it does remind me of World War Two  and of the killings  but you can never compare it to the Holocaust  never.
Our childrens will be saved  we after the war we will have our husbands  we will have th-the childrens.
A lot of them went to Russia  you know  the war when Germany invaded Russia.
We went to the synagogue  we saw it was rebuilt just like it was before the war.

Do you think because of what you went through it has made you more religious?

When  at the end of the war  there was a beautiful  I think most beautiful part of the Warsaw  as a meeting area  like a n -- those were not big houses  small houses.
I do remember at the end of the war Ustasa being marched through the town looking totally bedraggled and being led to whenever.
My parents had come there as children to Germany and we didn't speak anything except German.
In other words  unfortunately  most of these people were then in a forced ma rch toward Germany at the end of the war and somewhere in  probably western Hungary  they we re just either killed or died of typhus.

One of the side elements of the air war was an effort by the Allies to disturb the German communications  and for a time they would drop lots of uh little strips of black paper with aluminum foil attached to them  which I guess uh disrupts radar and what happened I guess uh fly through a radar net that otherwise might detect planes that were coming through  so we kids made a game of this.
And so I had -- its on the level of friendship  not to talk about the war  or not to talk about anything.
When I came back to town  I -- perhaps several months later  either it was the second part of 1940  I got married.
But about 600 of them over the course of the three  four years of the war did do service in the concentration camps.
You see  the war did not start seriously while the Germans went ahead.

I feel that the Nuremberg international war crimes tribunal  wh ich was signed by 23 nations who had been very directly  and some i ndirectly involved -- Right. --
1950  after the war  there were stories  there were children and also no children and all kinds of things.
To a young Israeli-born individual whose parents also came from Hungary  but they were in Isra el before the war  in the '30s.

She's still living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to communicate with her because she is number one   old  and number two  I think that she has some mental problems that she developed since the war and  but she certainly is the heroine of the whole story and my surviv al  so I try to keep up with her but it's very  very difficult and I'm very  very sorry about that.
And I 13 had a stamp collection of German inflationary stamps from post World War I  and I asked my father if we couldnt buy these guys off with all these mo millions of marks that I had of these little stamps.

Tell us what it was like in those first days when the Germans came in and what life was like before you were forced into a ghetto.
They were fighting World War One  they were loyal Germans  they got iron crosses  it didnt make any difference.
We had the s-sense that we were all very lucky to be -- it was like a -- an oasis of peaceful living while our relatives were in Europe  or in the middle of the war.
But even then  before that  go with the World War goin g on  in particular w-with France collapsing  many people were thinking that Lithuania might not be able to survive as independent country.
It was quite a  there were quite a bit of Jews  in fact I think most of the people who lived on our block  the 21 families  I think most of them were Jewish  so the children had a lot in common  when they started Hebr ew school and things of that sort.
And they were bombing and we had to go down to the shelter.
At that time  the United States was in war with Germany  but I do not remember whether there were any news with -- by -- by relatives United States.
Did you know what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
I was lucky after the war  for the first child I had  that I still am able to bear children.
And  uh  we travelled across Europe  uh  for  uh  weeks at a time and towards the end of the war was just a continual pack  pick-up  pack-up  dig-in  pack-up and go  go  go.
So yes  there were such times  and there was that sadness  and that those feelings of insufficiency  those feelings of somehow being second rate that were that was somehow planted in me in the war years did not disappear Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.

And all together was relocated  and was losing -- before the 1939 was 35 million Polish people  after the war  1945  was only count in Poland 18 million people.

It was a nip joint during the war  where the guy wasn't -- didn't have much gas to sell anyhow  it was rationed so he used to sell bootleg whiskey  people used to come out  buy by the shot  and he was  they were afraid of the reputation and Daddy said  never mind the reputation  it's all I can afford  it's all I can do.
Fear was the constant feeling that accompanied me since the war began until the war ended.
We had a very nice first teacher  who I -- got very friendly with me  and even after the Nazi ti -- time  she kept in touch with me  and I kept in touch with her even after the war.

I know there's no brief answer to this but as briefly as you can  I was hoping you could elaborate a little further on life afte r the war in between the time of August 1945 and when you emigrated to the United States.
So now  we all came back and we started seeing Germans in the street.
But most of the people were prior to the war  prior to me  that immigrated to Israel and to Australia and to Brazil  they also came.
The prisoners of war was over 2 500  so you can imagine what the situation was like.
And they did find her and they gave her my address and si -- we started to write each other.
As it happens  my father has a ve ry close associate  a fr -- an old -- an old friend who was from -- from Warsaw  Jewish doctor  a woman who survived the war  whose parents did not.
They were happy that the war is over  that Was there any kind of celebration?
And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss Intelligent Services  how he  personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of politsiato  political politsiato  never to be trusted  that he would give some help when it was possibly beneficial for him in the future  in the political settlement after the war.
I see it all as now as not as significant as she thought it was  but it helped survive the war  so I cant even fault her.
Salomonawicz.ﬂ He wanted to be a physician and he became one after the war.
If I wanted to look up the Second World War  I had to read the you know  the my account.
>> Bill Benson: That was 1940 when they got to the United States?
Then came the war and in 1942  I enlisted and within a month was again back in England  as a sergeant and later a warrant officer.

Now after the war was over  we had coupons  and we could only buy food with these coupons.
So what happened to you and your family once the military operation started on the border between Romania and Soviet Union?
She was an orphan after the war living with a great-aunt that was very mean to the three children and her conditions were really -- compared to his–. Okay  I understand.
after the first World War and I remember him well b ecause he came to our house once and I remember him on a Sunday morning listening to the radio and because in his own home as a rabbi he did not have one in those days and he was an enormously tall beautifu l looking man with a long beard and the long kaftan and a remarkably sophisticated for th e position he was in.
But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how some people are liberate during the war and before the war  how some people change the color of their shirt.
And Chamberlain came home to England  he says peace in our time  the memo in his hand  and I remember next Saturday  next Shabbat in synagogue -- I still went to the [indecipherable] synagogue  Mr. Jacob saying  ﬁI dont like this whole thing.ﬂ And of course  there was the famous speech by Churchill in Parliament  where he 33 told Chamberlain y- you had to -- you had to choose between dishonor and war  you chose dishonor  thats why youre going to have war.
>> Bill Benson: One of the things you didn't talk about is that she became very ill right after the war ended  and you had to strugg le with that.
I had a couple of friends  but I wouldnt say that any of them  as I said  I mean th-they were all had been there during the war  in Brazil .
Even now  all my life Ive been like th at  after the war too.
So  commmitting a war of aggression is the most serious crime that any head of state can commit.
This...everything went to the gas chambers  but my...when the...when...1939  when the war started  we were in Krakow.
So -- Were those the barracks that they had been living in previously?
In the meantime I had decided I wanted to go to work at one of the war crimes trials.
Then the Germans came  and then I was Yeah  well talk about that.
Theres also Marietta  Ohio   which is a very historic ally a very famous town  because after the Revolutionary War  they handed out the G.I. Bill of the Revolutionary War  was 106 160 acres  you know  in o in Ohio [indecipherable] Illinois.
And so a lot of Poles  depending on the historian  but their calculation at least one million Poles worked on the farms in Germany during the war and were obviously all forced.
So they become and when the Russians took them over they become prisoners of the country  like enemies.
Q. Tell me  how much did you know about Hitler and what was going on in Germany before the Germans occupied Poland?
The building is still there  the congregation no long but the i-it was a fairly active synagogue.
But  as I said  he brought his family from Germany  some of his cousins  you know  before the war.
There was a number of of uh pr isoners of war who especially wounded and 88 and heavily wounded who were exchanged as through the Red Cross  and there was a great number of Palestinian Jews amongst them.

>> Leon Merrick: With the understanding  when the war is over  we're going to take it back.
Our Polish co-workers really didn't show any sympathy and given that it was the town...the factory was in the town in which I was I I was born in  the town in which I grew up (coughing)...excuse me...every once in a while I'll meet someone whom I knew before the war who was maybe...they were they were not my age because I was too young to to really be there  but they were maybe older brothers of my friends  and their reaction to seeing me was  are you still alive.
There was a war on that the United States was involved in and th-the draft was still in full swing.
DL] And when war was  had been declared  um  where  where  where were you sent? [
I -- I just got the impression that you really did a lot of homework on reading up about the Holocaust.
Quiet in the phone and he comes to the phone and he said your father wrote us during the war and we have given back all the money.
Not yet  at the very beginning  but it wa s under heavy pressure and bombardment because Warsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid on Wars aw before the war was declared.
They were respected because my father was an educated man before the First World War.
But those first days of the war  you see these terrible sights  and you no longer have a place to work.
Which might explain that after the war he was worn out.
My husband was in concentration camp and I was in a concentration camp and after the war we meet each other.
But before we left  he told us he he and his wife were in the in the zir in Basel the whole we the the time of the war.
Did the did you and the other workers in the camp have any sense that the war was coming to an end?
I think in my hometown I heard later that sometimes things were discovered  and there was a group working had a book laying and was edited the anniversary  75th anniversary of the paper that my father founded and there I read a lot about what people did during the war in my hometown  but I didn't know it in those days  but I was not living there.
And then  from the high school  I was drafted into the Army.
So you lived in ive in Germany after the war for a good five years.
So  then  of course  it came out that there were such camps where slave labor was not required.
Interview with Robert Max July 14  2015 19 Oh  that would have been well  surely after war was de -declared  so the early It after 41.
Interview with Arlette de Long 7 Do you remember the war years in this village?
Theres some among us that block out the -- the happenings during the war  although it was just a few years  but it left a big scar on everybody.
Did you have any thoughts that the war might end soon?
Can you Because that was that was what I want to say  its the beginning of war.
So  did you  were you 13 already when the war started ?
I didnt know the war was over until three days after it was over.
They said  for goodness sake how can he be...t hey didn't certainly know which location it was because it was a military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war.
He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us.
In June 1940  when the Battle of France -- when the French Army was defeated in the Battle of France  the French government resigned and a new government was formed which was a collaborationist government which meant under Petain -- the first hero of the w ar.
When you were in the camps  did you pray and did you connect to God?
Jews lived there 400 years  they have some property  an d for them  the war was a plus  because they got in in a minute -- lot of people was poor Polish  too.
When the war started he tried to convince his family to also to move to +.
We didnt wa know that the war started  but they were flying to bomb Warsaw  so they had bombs underneath it.
And they both survived  not 10 together  separately  as prisoners of war.
But did you suspect that maybe Ge rmany was going to lose the war?
And you know how late in the war that is because the war ends in 1945.
Im just trying to establish what your -- your life was like before the war.
We had a wa carriage stolen before the war  and Lithuanians  when they came  policeman Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 44came and he told us that and my father told them  you know  they were asking  anything stolen?
Of course that view of myself uh changed very quickly once the war came  because my Christian friends reminded me very soon that I was not one of them.
We have more stuff  the information we had after the war  thanks to him  and due to him.
Dont you know that the Jews have b een arrested  and in addition  dont you know that the Germans executed some 200 Christian hostages because of the war that takes place between the Germans and the partis ans.
Did -- do you not know what hes doing during that period of time  because the war is over  and then he starts up immediately to -- 136 to -- to do something  do you know what I mean?
I dont condemn him any more like I us ed to during the war  and immediately after the end of the war.
Now maybe you know this was a result of the war.
Then the war started and we had to leave that city  so the hat business was dead anyway.
So  the guy looked at him and he figured like this - its almost the end of the war  what they did now  the Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against Russians than the Germans.
I mean living under...a little meager piece of bread and the so-called soup  that we broke into this warehouse and...where...all we could find at this point...I mean there was...they had hardly anything themselves because as I explained  you know  everything had to go to the people who were fighting the war.
And then we moved to Bari to a transient camp which was internment camp during the war for German  Austrian and and Yugoslavian Jews under Mussolini  and there we stayed for about two years.
My fa foster father and mother made a pact that if the war is over and one of my pa rents would survive or both  they would give me back to parents  but to nobody else.
Because specially those of us that were born during the war were so young and we re given as babies  we didnt know our families.
The war was going to end  and we were starving  for starving.
But then when they found out that we are not Czechs  but they didn t know that we speak Hungarian. [
Are there any other memories of the war  that you remember  that you think is important for people to know about?
My mom  my older brother  David  Zachery was already fighting the war with Germany.
You see  the following day the war was over too  and how I found out about it when we went to the...they was making a hospital out of a school house and uh I remember the incredible things.
So  when we came back to Holland  the head of the police in my hometown say that all the people from Poland had to go back to Poland.
And at some point or other  the city of Am sterdam took it over  and for a brief period of time they had orphans living there after the war.
They walked back into Hungary  back into Hungary  back into Budapest  before the war ended.
Before we get to the war  what was your life like outside of work?
And so  by some miracle  I got over this very dangerous illness and then my father had found a job working for some movie company bec ause before the war he worked for MGM and Eva Edmands 5 [Date not labeled] Page 5 he was writing subtitles  German subtitles for American movies.
63 I should -- I shouldnt have jumped ahead  I wa nt to go back to the last few months of the war  d -- were you beginning to expect a liberation?
>> Frank Liebermann: Well  I mentioned Munich  which in order to underline the threat of war from Hitler he called back all German ships at sea.
Was your mother extremely protective of you when you were young  after the war because of what you went through?
My father again thought it would be like World War I and that in the Flanders  the Belgian Army and the English and the French would hold on as they did in World War I. >> Bill Benson: Stop the German advance.
In war in Warsaw   to train to going to   you know  there was Yeah.
And he stated  after having served as a Trawniki trained guard -- and I cant remember wher e he served  he stated to his interrogator after the war  to his Soviet interroga tor  that it would have been better for me had I died in that prison camp.
America was not at war then and they used to ship from Switzerland or from other areas  they used to ship food  so there was no scarcity of food  but I appreciated that because between the time I got into the orphanage and I lived in a room somewhere with my brothers and sisters  we had no food.
At the end of the war  or -- See  I -- I didnt stay too long there.
After the war  we found one man who crawled out wou nded from that mass grave. [\
Okay  what does that do to you after all you had been through during the war  to have that?
I started school  I f -- well  I -- I was going in first year of high school when the war happen.
Oh   my gosh  I remember them  they were saying  that is the best thing since green grass that we were at war.
And I remember from my school years during the war that Hindenberg made the first peace with the Russians in Bresleytos .
12 Now  you didn't really have to leave during the war because the orphanage stayed together  but were you at an age where you were ready to leave the orphanage?
The second or the third day that the war broke out  that they were fighting in Holland  we tried to leave.
We were saved because my father was a veteran of World War I. I can give you a long explanation.
In Holland before the war you had including 25 000 Jewish German refugees you had 140 000 Jews in Holland.
She died when she was 79 years old  I believe  a-after the war.
And the war industry was going full blast  and the fields need to be worked  and there were no of that age group.
Their holocaust  which people dont understa nd  they dont know  which I have documents from the second Wo rld War that I copied  and its everything in the archives.
I was given the honor of lighting a candle for those who resisted during the war.
Even after I was transferred from the immediate area  I would still come back a few times and later on made it possible for her to be nearer where I was and uh I found her some lodging...her and friend in in Munich where I had been transferred after the war.
See  I thought throughout the war  when I heard grownups talking  I thought that Hitler hated people  and he hated Poles.
And then the war broke out soon after this  three days later.
>> Bill Benson: Then  of course  your father returns in 1946 and it would be another three years before you would get to United States.
I think it was in Bad Andernach that we uh our prisoner of war camp was when we encountered Schuebbe.
When the German guard left the camp  they all took off in a cloud of dust when they heard all the commotion of the war coming on  artillery and sound of tanks and so on.
I don't think we ever tried to make any evaluation of how many German Jewish assets there were in Switzerland  say  in 1932  at the beginning of the war before things really began to get terrible.
Of course  I was Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12  2002 35aware that the summertime  especially the summertime in the Amer -- in the American camps  I -- I found out were located  most of them in -- in the beginning of the -- the war  in -- in the south.
So we were -- and then the war started  and the Germ ans first were -- and ther e were refugees in the station all along the stat ion.
But  we played war so much  you know  when I was a child  thats the game we played.
They went through the attic and found my husband's letter to them to the parents after their son had died   who got wounded and died during the war.
They couldnt imagine to a -- Yes [indecipherable] -- foreign country  that just fi nished a war.
And she was born before the first world war and that was Russia.
between 33 and 39  before the war -- 18 Yeah. --
So even during the war we were lucky  we had all that we needed.
So that we will be able to look whether any of our relatives returned from th e war.
So when the war started and they started bombing the city  people from the city  they went to the countryside.
So  in the beginning  it must have been much tougher  because the war is just over  or not quite over.
Pleas e come with us  you know what happens.ﬂ And my father answered  my father told me you don t move anywhere during the war; Im staying here.
And they began looking for me all over  of course  after the war.
He loved what he did because he was a veteran  he was wounded  he had medals from the First World War.
It was only after the war that they changed it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 34 and the war board finally acknowledged that -- that we could come over.
They were absolutely petrified  you know  it was immediately after the war  and I was basically a political officer.
>> Bill Benson : You were liberated in April 1945 .
You mentioned that during the war you just didnt cry and that now you can cry at little things.
>> [Question Inaudible] >> Bill Benson: Was the system disrupted after the war?
And a great many actually  I think  World War II World War I killed a lot of people  and that World War II people  who felt that they were safe  because of the big to-do that the Germans always made about their World War I soldiers.
And these pictures I got after the war from my brother  Arthur.
Now  that wasnt during during the war  because I had not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet  and I I didnt know about that.
Matter of fact  I dont think even the free world heard anything about it be cause n-nobody otherwise we would have known the BBC we listened  sometimes at nigh t they ha talking about the war  and we didnt hear nothing.
The Russian soldiers  wherever they were  when somebody wanted to come this way  the Russians said go back.
But they  like Barbara said  my daughter says  you 28 never tell me anything about the war. [
Our father always told us how great the U.S. are and someday were all going to move to the U.S. after the war is over.
They were talking about the situation -- about -- or the rise of Hitler.
And then of course  the war probably wipe d out  if I had any doubts.
This was...he was in Shamisho   I remember...this was a big event in first war  first of all.
Did you have a sense of what was going on in the war during that time  for example  that the Germans had lost at Stalingra d?
And they  and th e war  early in the morning we heard the Germans marching in.
The family was in part very pro-German  very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that France had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on Germany and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light...with a light-heart  light-heartedly  .
And several of those exceptions were British who were brought in and made presentations on aggressive war.
In the 30s  as I understand it now  a lot of young Jews  pioneers  went to Europe -- to Palestine  settled there.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  we're not yet at war in this country.
They made money available to us a nd their two daughters survived the war.
Has it been– is that something that you really think about a lot  about the Holocaust era and about your family and about– maybe can you just talk more about that?
And he had this he came to Poland before the first war in 1914  I th ink  and he built up to he was a very comfortable man.
So uh we philosophized that the war would  would be over and we would never have to leave our homes.
We e nded up we ended up in Trier and thats where I was registered as a prisoner of war.
Why I say about my father and about the his experience  because when the war started  he had to go to the army  and with his army  he was going back  back  back Wait  excuse me  Im going to interrupt.
So when we were trying to fight the Soviets when the Germans attacked  it was desp because Lithuania didnt resist then  now we have to fight.
So he got a nice apartment  so I went this to his apartment  and I took in my friend was still sleeping in a hallway after the war in Poland  but the rain was coming to her bed  and she was so sick .
So that meant he fought for Polish independence during and after the first World War.
So sh he has a a wife and two children before the war.
In fact not only World War I  the Second World War he was sh ot in the lungs.
There was some military that they tried to fight  the Germans.
After the war I told you we were in this small town on the Elbe River  the Commandant made me a translator  you know.
I dont think the argument that most of the guilty dont get tried is any reason not to try the ones a-a-and obtain convictions against the ones who you can try.
USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 18 And is that how the war ended for you?
When your father got back home  do you remember seeing him for the first time after the war?
And he was brought up in the German language  because obvi ously he went to school -- he was an educated man -- he went to school pri -- prio r to the f -- end of the first war  prior to 1918  which means that  depending on which sphe re of influence you lived in  that was the language in which you were taught.
Did these people that you knew from befo re the war help you in terms of getting food once you were in the forest?
We already have guns  because during the ja -- the war  I hired few different guns  and I hired few different radiopera.
And before the war  his mother...he didn't have a father...his mother used to be the one...she wished to work in the public baths.
I mean  basically poorly on -- comparing to how I lived in Europe before the war  but everything was good because of the fact that we were no oppressed  and -- and discriminated against  and so on.
You were busy working and raising your children  but I wanted to know what your thoughts were about  you know  things like the war in Vietnam  an-and the Cold War.
All -- w-well the last one we kept c onnections until far af ter the war  yes.
And when the war broke out -- and I was born in 41  in October  it was very difficult to hide with me as a child  and my father approached him.
Polish radio started to broadcast the third or fourth day of war  urgent appeal all men should go in direction of center of Warsaw which is about 120 kilos  that s from Lodz.
She became pregnant after the war  which to her was she was terribly upset about  but she only told it to me la many years later.
So that they came out just bef ore the war broke out.
I went back again and thats -- actually we saw each other for the first time  even though we double da ted in England during the war -- or  after the war  I didnt know him during the war  after the war we double dated  we were engaged to different people.
SB: Tell me about the actually start of the war: what you saw  what you heard.
It looked that she was searching for me and I was searching for her  and we walked 01:05 somehow going towards the same direction  and with all those people and all the war and everything  somehow we kind of ran into each other and I can't tell you that feeling to be able to see my sister and her black coat that I remembered with the white fur around her head and find my sister there.
They were sweethearts before the war and it was quite  you know--as a matter of fact  she lost her husband in the '67 War.
After the war and you were back here in the United States and word came out about the camps and there were more and more pictures  how did you respond to that when you saw the magnitude?
Well  that's a long story  yes  I had a very dear friend in Sweden with whom I corresponded for 12 years  and he explained to me that this young man went to the king and to the foreign minister and said that this woman would be my wife already  but the war came  and therefore she should be Swedish.
And  as I told you before  that when I finally got the -- the book knowledge about the war and put it all together  it did not change my original understanding  which wa s personal and on a lower level.
When the war was finished  the day war was finished  we have to walk to the camp.
So we finally decided that we must find the right moment to tell Antonescu that he has to stop this war  or make an armistice.
And my mother said yes  and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War I already  and so we had a little party  and he brought this boy.
Poland had like 3.5 million Jews so they had a lot of people to put in the ghetto.
But you see even after forty years after the war  when you have married and children  it recovered; it restored only to 10 000.

Q. Do you ever have nightmares about your experience in the war?
In certain cases they were successful  but I would say between eighty or ninety percent were not  and then you had the situation that when the war broke out  you could only communicate via the International Red Cross.
I just knew that  if Im going to have a good time  its going to be with my parents or with my own peers but certainly not with Chris and Miles  and that was even true during the war  not  why did I say?
Before we turn to the war years  tell us about your family  your life in those years before the war began.
Just one week after the war started  it was a 39 Sunday  it was -- the war started on June 22nd  that was June 29th  we were on the house and we saw that there are columns of people moving on th e street.
>> Bill Benson: I want to make sure that you are able to finish telling us what you want to in our time.
44 written  written in Russian  which I had written by Russian prisoner  war criminal who we helped and he said  he said  \ Yes  I decided you have to come with me \  he said.

But it was still part was Hungary and part of was Czechoslovakia at that time.
That they could not live among those people who were responsible for their having suffered during the years of the war in concentration camps.
Im wondering how you felt about meeting with them after the war?
And then the thought was that we cannot wage a war warfare in the ghetto.
You know  war but I see now it just comes back.
There 41 are very very few who are able to to walk through the war without the ultimate degradation  the dignity to human to humanity.
Well  after the war  of course  I -- I worked for two years in the Ballet.
So I was there  and I worked there  and then later on I found out about my -- not relatives  but I found out about my frie nd whom I knew before the war -- not before the war  but actually during the war  before the concentration camp.
This was the first time we realized that maybe a war.
This and that much I know .ﬂ He said  ﬁLet me try something.ﬂ And I said  ﬁIll pay you for it  if you find them.ﬂ He sent into the police department in Detroit  Michigan  a letter that said these and these people are looking f -- they are sur -- they survived the war and they are looking for their relatives in the States and within a week or two weeks  I received a -- a response  they are not in Detroit  Michigan  but they are in Washington.
Larry Lebetsky became one of our staff people in Munich  I guess  after the war.
When your children were the age when they could really seriously study World War II and the Holocaust  did that elicit anything from you?
I went to Russian school there two years  I learned Russian and -- and -- under the Germans  you know  I learned Germans a little.
I probably still am  however I think I did my bit in the war and I did a bit in Greece and I feel that I  you know  helped in some small way.
In general had it been  aside from the war interrogation -- Well  I didn't like and don 't like the Army system of taking orders from -- you know  you take an order from the next higher up  and very often the people who gave the orders didn't know as much as the people who took them. {
The moment the war broke out  Mr. London told me that he and his family are going to evacuate  but since I'm working  I should go and look for a place to stay.
Archives are terribly  terribly important  and I only hope that people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during 67 the war  before the war  after the war  which might be useful  to find out from an archivist where they might be useful.
I really think there were a lot of volunteers  and most people understood that that was a very necessary war  although to me  no war is -- is necessary.
And actua lly  it was such a sudden war  you know  they called it a blitzkrieg  you know  thats [indeci pherable] nobody expected it.
He always picked me up in Munich in a car  which had a Wankel motor  that was the -- the -- th e -- the alternative to our engine  yes  our -- yes  our motor engine  and that he developed in the war  yeah  yes.
And little by little starts up and [indecipherable] What you were just saying  was that a reference to before the war?
Q. Were you active before the war  were you involved with any political authorities?

Then we were told the week before Liverpool had been bombed and also that the Arandora star  it was a ship that had taken prisoners into Canada had been torpedoed and shot.

But no one believed it was going to happen  what happened  because during the first World War  the Germans were the better friends than the Russians.
Then he was re-drafted in the army because before the war he was an army chaplain  yeah  he was a mobile Benedictine.
Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 63 Lets now talk about what happened to you after the war  summarizing on how you got to this country and so forth.
We me t after the war  and she was like a part of my family after the war.
He was later found by his father who survived the war.
My father was called to the armies  when the war broke out.
That was the only place we were allowed to go  and the war wasn't even over then.
We tend to think of the expe rience of Polish Jews as being in ghettos and concentration camps  very formal places  but of approximately 3 million Jewish people who lived in Poland before the war  about 250 000 survived by being in the Soviet Union.
But they were young women  healthy  and they survived the war and died later of various other causes having little to do with the specifics of the war.
Because from when the war started  wh-when the German came to Poland  we were sent -- they send us to a ghetto  to Shilladula.
And that  to us  we were beginning to feel that the war  that we were maybe winning.
And I when the war broke out  I saw the the mobilization  the the Belgians were trying to defend the country and they were mobilizing the people on the street  and were mobilizing the horses  everything.
And this was end of 42 - 43  and then Stalingrad happened  and then we became happy  and the Romanians  and the others peopl e there started to understand that the war is turning.
Uh  I did find uh a few wounded in  in a German field hospital  and made arrangements for uh  their ev acuation  but because uh we  it was getting dark  this was late in the day  we felt we had to get b ack to our lines  and the war was not over yet either at that point.
So  at that time when they went to sign this contract  declared king and it was on March 27  1941 on April 6  Hitler was already declaring war.
So but when we used to come and used to play soccer  be so all of us we have to play soccer between school in schools  the Maccabee and na against the the Christian  so bra it was a war.
People are getting killed  there is a war going on  you got it good here.ﬂ So we told him  we said  ﬁWe will have to return those  we cant even touch it.
After the war I came to Vinnytsya  and they found the family  th e mother; and she did not allow me to greet her husband  the father of my friend  because not to disturb him.
What can you tell us about that period between the war beginn ing i n Europe in September 1939 and the events that led up to the fall of 1942?
One of the difficult things that also happened at Fort McClellan   is that it was a a it was a cu a prisoner of war camp for German soldiers.
Did he ever go back to his home- town after the war.
And  you know  we'd talk about  you know  about the war  and you know  Army.
>> Bill Benson: But you ended up deciding to not stay in Poland for very long.
I would have never considered– What about after the war when you were in Budapest  were you thinking a lot about Sandy?
Do you have any recollection of the impact of the war on life for the Harrisons or in the community that you were living in?
After the war  after the collapse of the government -- I'm sorry.
Your father  I believe  was a World War I ve teran.
I graduate in foreign languages just -- in June 1941 when we went -- the Germans came  when the war began.
He certainly didnt tell me during the war  when I was growing up  when I was 10 years old  15 years old  because it was too dangerous to know that you had a Jewish ancestor.
Well  I described to you the earliest war crimes investigations which were killing of hostages in France  in Belgium  Malmedy Massacre 2  for example  which is better known one...shooting down of Allied flyers  and then we ran into Buchenwald first.
This guy  I found out from the guys  after  after the  the war was over.
He did survive  uh after the war  and uh  in fact  I visited the monastery  uh  there is a  I brought a  a plaque  uh commemorating him.
This period is very dark with me because ther e was a war on you know and we had--there was no possibility to talk lengthy with them  or see them or anything.
There were quite a few people who  who were benefiting by the war but most of the people were just struggling along and  of course they  they did not see too many Jews because the  the  the Jews were either in  in the Swedish or no  the Swiss Protectorate buildings.
So we bit them  we sh -- you know  it was -- it was predictable  they couldnt win the war with the partisans  actually.
It would certainly remain neutral in the second World War since Hitler probably needed a neutral country in...in that part of the world.
And then he worked in Vienna and s -- after the war -- and he was a soldier then  in th e first World War.
And there was a lot of prisoner  Russian prisoners who were -- came home from the -- from the Germany.
The only thing was the pay  and and then the when th e war was over  why the prices started climbing  you know  and so I my wife an d I talked it over  we thought its time I got a raise.
So I was able to talk to Captain Harber   he said well  we are having problems with this man  and I dont know whats going to happen  but it doesnt look good  because some of the senior officials in Eisenhowers headquarters are concerned over the fact that you took th is general in Third Army territory and brought him to Luxembourg   when according to army rules  which you didnt know and I didnt know  you f all prisoners of war have to be cleared through the prison camps.
the start of the war  those first few years  being Jewish... Absolutely not.
Well  you see  right after the war  I beli eve that anti-Semitism was pretty dormant  but the regime  which was under great attack from the west  for violating democratic institutions  for forging the election  in a way that they want to -- to compromise the Polish people  and there are strong suspicions that so-called [indecipherable] was instigated by the political police in order to  you know  compromise the Polish people  but in fact  th-the sad part of the story is that this kind of provocation is that there was a provocation  did find a fertile ground.
They didn t. And what I found out  a lot of people that they were so religious before the war  friends of mine  they became the biggest thing  they eat everything not kosher  they wouldnt even go to a synagogue  not even on Yom Kippur.
You have to reme mber Britain was the only country left in Europe  alone  and a -- a -- America didnt come into World War until 41  after Pearl Harbor.
Our furniture  even after the war   had holes in it.
Well this was the very last phase of the war when we were on this death march  which started on the 29th of January in Greenberg  in Silesia.
And the -- that voyage  that ship that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left over from World War .
But then  of course  with the ha whole thing in between from the war  you know  you saw each other not many times.
In the second World War  it was the place where the American army deposited its World War II records  temporarily at least.
And he said -- and he said  ﬁI felt that the guy  what he really wanted  was the little flashlight.ﬂ Now this wasnt an ordinary flashlight  it was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war.
But until the end of the war really we didn't differentiate much between the Germans and the Nazis.
But the war soon came   which I have to skip also.
indecipherable] war in Lithuania  yeah  the ger the Germans attacked Soviets  and we were looking for weap ons  we wanted to fight Soviets.
Did you experience any anti -Semitism when you were young before the war?
My uncle came to pick them up  and then my aunt went  and...with a baby  little Jakov  who was born in May of '39 just before the war started.
Maria was a gentle  wonderful soul  with whom we kept in touch through the war -- not during the war  but after the war.
the war broke out  but previous to th at  the in the the previous year was Kristallnacht and it did you know about that?
There was -- when -- when in it -- when I made an attempt to ac -- to  ye ah  explain something sometimes  about the war  or about the war [indecipherable] -- th ere was such lack of comprehension on the part of people I was talking to  that it shut me off.
While he was in the middle of the Atlantic  September first came along  with the outbreak of the war  and clearly  if he had listened to his parents rather than his wife  I wouldnt be here.
When the Germans passed by they were going and there was no war there actually  the Russians they we re running  in the Russia and the Germans just took it over  that's it.
His family  his father was here before the First World War and then he came  he went back.
On the way to Spain  this was already during -- this was in 1940  during World War II had already started  but there were ways of getting out  he got sick and rather than to be taken to a hospital he was sent to 25 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD Theresienstadt  where he perished.
What do the -- what did the soldiers say to you?
In other words  even as a  when I was  right after the war in Sweden  you know.
This boy went through the war  etcetera  lost his parents  etcetera.
>> Bill Benson: Nat  you were not yet 3 years old when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 starting World War II.
When your children were the age that you were when you had to leave your parents  did that bring up memories of your war time experience?
When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody else in town  and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes.
There was a building which was a theater before the war  a movie house  so all the neighbors gathered and we slept in that building.
And because I was every time so excited that  in that way about it  when I was speaking with somebody  I wanted to  didn't want to speak too much about it and I didn' t visit Terezin 40 years after the war.
Of course right after the Olympics  in 1039  Hitler started World War II when he marched on Czechoslovakia  that was the beginning of World War II.
But as soon as the Germans lost the war  they pronounced the war  they pronounced themselves survivors and they were placed into displaced persons camps.
So uh our first reaction when we saw that Holland was uh going to be lost from the standpoint of of the fortunes of war  uh my father tried to pack up the family and we went  we jumped in a taxicab that he managed to secure somehow  and uh drove across the narrow neck of the northern part of the Netherlands to the harbor city of   where uh we heard that they were sending refugee boats to pick up people  but we came just an hour too late maybe.
When the German took over there  they first of all  they -- they fight to get all the Jews to work.
So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.
When we were in Germany after the war  I mean after I got married  my husband was stationed in Germany in Munich  and we went up several times to Dachau and I looked and asked  but there is no way to verify whether or not my father was murdered in Dachau.
Did you ever get the feeling or did your pa rents tell you after the war when you had grown up that they lived in fear that they would be discovered?
This house was occupied during the war by Germans  and later on Polish authority -- the city or town  village o ffices were set in this house  and my father just left it the way it was.
I can't remember what it 39 was  but this was a national costume that we were wearing  and we had a great time in the village before the war.
>> Manny Mandel: In 1942 in Berlin  in a place called Wannsee  there was a conference called by the chief SS officer  a general in the Eastern Front of the German war.
But at that time she was uh less than sixteen years old and but there was things to do for everybody during the war.
That was ki -- we didnt know until after the war. --
For example  we have -- we -- I organized the office to help people from con centration camp in Germany after the war.
Uh this food was still in the wa rehouses in Paris  was appearing in the French black marketŠin other words the parcels were being stolen from the warehouses and uh this uh American officer said to me if you go to the Quartermaster General and ask for th ese parcels for the prisoners of war  they might be given to you.
I mean  in what ways did the war touch your life as a child?
And  uh  the  the  the speed of our work was dictated uh also very strongly by the fact that uh  uh  we had to t-try to comp lete the job before uh  uh  uh there would be uh  uh this terrible thing called war.
And after the war he wound up in the Jewish archives in the Vatican  in the library.
I says  your kids were playing up in that camp during the war  the whole time  the kids were up there.
All I knew her during th e time  during the war  she has taken me -- sometimes in the evening she invited me for di nner.
Ive had the friendship of so many wond erful -- I discovered after the war that I was working with all the top people of the Committee of National Libera tion  who  in their turn  were so helpful to our work for Amnesty Internationa l development.
He survived the war about Bensky and I met with him after the war.
And he had  his mission was to uh fight the war.
I already -- you know  because on one le vel I was very mature after the war was ended and on another level I was totally ignoramus and stupid  probably.
Anyhow  next thing you know it was World War II and sailors would come home on the weekend and you couldnt go downtown to the movie houses without the sailors were and soldiers were lined up on the street like four deep  trying to pick up any girl that walked by  screaming after them.
Although a policeman guarded the car  it was possible to jump out  at first  when the streetcar still operated as it did before the war.
W-Were -- were there partisan s ongs that were sung [indecipherable] 58 No  the only Italian  or foreign partisan s ongs that I -- I learned was from a captured German soldier  who turn out to have been a -- formerly in --in Nazi prisons  but as the war is progressing  and manpower is lowest  the Germans began to free -- free  I mean let the prisons out  and sometimes eventually incl uding criminals.
During the war there was nothing for shoes   especially in Europe.
The new government -- the French government resigned and a new government was formed under Marshal Petain  hero of the First World War  a notorious anti -Semite and collaborationist.
>> Bill Benson: You would remain there until the war ended in Belgium which was in 1944.
Because during the war again  I only had eat with the ration card  masquerading as a Gentile.
And as I mentioned be fore  he had been in America before the war.
I must have been at the window for a minute or maybe for two  but to just watch that like moving bodies  you know  a group  a chain  an unending chain  and we were I dont know whether we were five thousand Jews  or - usually it was like ten percent of the population in a small town like ours was Jewish and Wierzbnik and Star achowice were two communities  separate communities until the consolidation.
The war wa s going on and the Russians started losing the war already by that time and Gens   the head of the ghetto  had a feeling  a conviction that he might save the ghetto.
And so they survived as a -- as a community and the whole community after the war  immigrated to Israel.
Nobody knew about this  what does it mean at that time  but for young people like myself this takes  you cannot nough of study and knowledge what tragic situations like the war like the memories of human beings treated worse than animals are treated  quite o fte n  have impact on the psyche of young people Interview with Wies 37 August 15  2018 shak e about that because it just disturbs me so deeply and that takes me longer time then to get back to my normal ment al and psych ic so to speak.
So  I was there at the war was finished  and I did have to get out.
Before we turn to the war years and what it meant for you and your family  tell us first a little bit about your parents and their life  what it was like before the war began and for you and your siblings.
When the war started  I was working in that millinery  and one of the girls said  did you know that trouble had started?
My lovely wife thinks that it is still something which is from what I went through during the war  which I dont know.
>> Bill Benson: But you made it and served in the Israeli Army  saw combat during the War of Independence  went back to Panama  and then came to the United States and met Adele.
The clear indication that we are young we will survive  as the war is coming to an end.
So you remained in Terezi n until the end of the war?

After a few after we were a year with the Germans in in Lwow  but after the first two or three months  my parents too sent my brot her and me to the country  because by coincidence  the chauffeur that they employed before the war  his wifes family came from that part of of Poland   and they had they we re farmers  they had a farm  they were peasants.

And if he did live  he would come back after the war and get her.
So when  when did you finally talk to your daughter about the war experience?
How did you understand at that point what the Germans were trying to do in your country?
And then he couldn't because with the war he couldn't get out.
Part of the ghetto yes  but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was a big bridge.
When you were lit tle  during the war -- In the village?
And that - you know  it seems  in that whole saga of this war experience  it seems that there were already a little - there was a little interval that allowed us a little breathing space whic h restored the soul and the body before we would face the other horror.
And they both had been in hiding during the war  right?
Her parents converted during the first World War or right after  so she was born  you know  as Christian.
Not in all  because before th e war  the Jews from the smallest places were forcibly relocated in the bigger towns.
And then I do remember after the war was over that they sent packages over there for my aunt and he r family every week.
And that was not liked by the American attendants  because they had their husbands in the war  here was this one Jewish female  and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty  and messed up situation  I was in between vics.
And then we came down to town  and we were already -- we werent liberated because th-there was still going on  we went into wi-with the civilian  with the German civilians  because they were running into their  how do you call it  what -- you know  not the bunker -- it wasnt a bunker  it was a -- they were hiding from their -- from their -- from the war  you know  from the -- from the guns.

These Berger s are interesting people because they used to have a restaurant  kosher restaurant in Amsterdam  a very elegant one apparently  before the war  and they had pretty elegant dishes  and cutlery  but after the war their apartment was gone  all their belongings were gone.
And uh I had this little picture with me  that he had given me after the war  that was taken of the two of us; and he had put his address in the back.
I was thinking  because I -- as I said  I worked as a farmer before I came to Sobibor  I thought maybe I go in this direction.
Let's start with start with you telling me what it was like to hear that the war had begun  and how everyday life changed  wearing the yellow star  all the things that changed.
Presidents Tru-Truman passed a law in Congress admitting 50 000 deported people from the war to the United States on top of the [indecipherable] the -- the quota.
So up to 1939  when the war started  you just had a regular childhood  and playing with friends and so forth?
So your father tried even from right at the very end of the war.
The only ones that I know -- well  one died during the war because he happened to be on the line.

And she met her husband there on the ship  which they got married  they went to Palestine  and of course he went right away to war there when he arrived  cause he was a officer in the Russian army.
Well  how do you think that  having witnessed what you witnessed  what kind of an impact did that have on you as a person  after the war?
Dont mix crimes against humanity with war crimes or crimes against the peace.
So I was thinking and I will li -- I -- I lived through the whole war during every day.

Your experiences in the war Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13  2015 32 Yes.
and then and then the war experience  and the fourth part was going to be put it all together.
I dont know if I ever mentioned it  before the war they wanted me to marry some body.
But  as a child I at least fanaticized right after the war and whatever I could  I did.
I mean I can't separate the war years from my recollections of my mother and my father and so I certainly was  I guess I've made USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 46 that clear by now that I  I find my  my mother's memory to be a very important thing to me and I had no intention of glossing ove r her life or my recollection of her life and  and that's part and par cel of those years  so I have never had difficulty thinking back  cause I have always wanted to remember her and that's part of it and I've really not ever had a problem discussing it  I've never found that I broke down or couldn't talk about it in any way.
First of all  on the da this place  before th-they call it Rishu  it was Austria-Hungary before the first World War.
Ive heard stories ever since I was old enough to understand what they meant  about the war.
And when did you well  from Israel where did you go?
And I couldnt feel sorry for them  because they continued the war  they were warned  and the only thing that stopped our conversation  there was dead silence  was one mans name was Mr. Maneeshi  and he was the only Japanese I disliked in my six years in Japa n  because he was doing certain things that I disapproved of.
But at that time  for whatever reason  there was a lready some anti -Semitism in France.
World War II began in September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland.
We were 250 men  there must have been 100 SS people with machine guns  everything and we were marched out of the ghetto to a small camp which recently used to be a prisoner of war camp for the Russian prisoners.
The War Ref-- well  as fa r as we were concerned  out in the field  our contact was the headquarters of the War Refugee Board in Washington.
We played war  and we had tank s and we had airplanes  and we had all sorts of toys.
And after the war he came back  he went to join hi s mother in England  and so did his sister  they were twins  and there were a couple of boys  they were also twins  their mother was in Scotland  and they went to join their mother in Scotland.
Where did you It was a cruise ship when it wasn't during the war.
This -- As you know  a follow up interview  its looking at really  the kind of post Holocaust years.
There were the departme nt of working  and lot of people who after the war immigrated  gave different recollection  different thing.
After that was quiet and -- it was quiet until the -- the World War came to us.
I just was lucky and I was -- you know  I survived.
So they become and when the Russians took them over they become prisoners of the country  like enemies.
>> Bill Benson: So there you are now living in Belgium  your father is trying to make a life there for the family  but in May 1940  of course  Germany invades Belgium on May 10th  1940.
And unbeknownst to me  there were three other Jewish children there being hidden.
All I know is I was told that this is a prisoner of war camp.
And we visited some people w ho my parents knew f r-from befor -- before the war.
So over there I met a girl and she told me  the war is now coming to end in Berlin.
When I heard that Musso-Mussolini entered the war  I -- I had to go home  I was sick.
So the question of war crimes really gets down partly to the worlds ability to feed more people  on the one hand  and to curb population growth on the other  so we dont have these tremendous cases of people struggling to stay alive  in terms of limited resources.
ﬂ >> Bill Benson: During that period  I think it was in March 1939  the war wouldn't begin until September.
>> I'm somewhat surprised that your parents stayed so long in Poland after the war.
But I heard all this going on and somebody explained to me and I was speaking a little English  that the United States was at war.
So  since my husband learned -- my husband was actually a businessman before the war  and he was like about nine years older than I am  so he was already a young man  able to work and -- and sustain himself.
When you met up with them again after the war  wh at did you talk about then?
She said  ﬁYou know what  Ill go to the place where she was living before the war  maybe somehow she went out of here.ﬂ She went to th e place when -- where I lived  and she find a letter from my mother  that she gave some money to the policeman and he let her out.
I came across  myself  before the war  cer tain episodes like  when I used to walk to visit my father in Abarrov.
Its hard to know how the war affected us  because by the time I ha ve any memory at all  you know  that was all I knew.
Left f said goodbye to my grandparents and we went to th e airport  Schiphol  I think it was  pretty sure  and we boarded and this was during the this was already during the war  during the Phoney War between England and Germany  because in 1940 England was drawn into the war because the Germans had invaded Poland.
And the war did end  V-E day  its -- the European war only.
And the same thing happened in the Second World War beca use the Hungary allied the Germans .
Did it change your understanding of why you were fighting the war?
But it creates a tru -- an -- you know  Ive often wondered -- you know  people have asked me  in this country  what USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 16 made you do what you did during the war?
You did a video in terview about your experiences during the war -- Mm-hm. --
And in this part of -- of war -- of Warsaw  in Saskacampa  my father build the five homes.
We did not eve we missed even the end of the war.
I think that the differences in where we spent the first 12 - 15 years of our lives -- I mean  her notion of the war was that they had air raid alerts in school  and they crawled under the desk.
Right afte r liberation he and Shia  this person who had been his employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with him and had been in the orchestra in Auschwitz actually  my father wa s just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth.
Birkenau  you were waiting your turn basically but this was the end of the war.
Now  that is utterly different than Nuremberg  where we -- the allies that occupied the country  they not only conducted war crimes trials  but they assisted the democratic elements  which were latent in Germany  to slowly develop and to come out .
He had very bad legs  he had broken legs before the war and he couldn't do.
In high school the current affairs magazines  the teachers were visiting about it back and forth  even though the war was still in Europe  of course  basically.
In 1940  before America joins the war  my mothers father develops cancer  and he was  as I say  a neurologist  way back.
04:13:08 Well  everybody was involved at that time  really  because we started to shooting -- most of the war.
No  no  Im going to go back to the war cr imes.
Did do you have memories of going to school before the war?
And we knew that the -- we just were praying the Russians would win the war.
When you fou nd out that the war was on  your mother and your brother and your sister you stayed inside the house?
You know  the war wa s over by that time  and the Army still hadn't been demobilized but the war was over  so this was a miracle that we had survived  it was a miracle that he had survived.
CIC  yes  after the war  I finally w-wind up in -- in Munich again  and I lived with a lady in Borsty  and I got a job to -- to Jewish -- Jewish -- some Jewish organization.
Because you know  like Kennedys father  he wanted to be on German side  you know  a lot of Americans  they didnt want to be in a war.
But afte r the war he was able to reclaim his butcher shop  which he did  and he worked there for another two years  waiting to get a visa to come to America.
So h-he was then optimistic too  hey things are going to get better soon  he says -- this time he couldnt tell you nobody advances  the war was over already.
Interviewer: Did your father ever talk about World War I or the Revolution.
Over the years  especially maybe when your children were a bit younger than they are now  did you talk about your experiences during the Holocaust?
Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17  2001 17 What stands out in your mind about th e time from 39 when th e war broke out in Europe until Pearl Harbor?
I remember it was Rozias birthday and I wanted to give her a present and I there was nothing to sell in the tim e of the war and my sister had a beautiful manicure set and she got it from her first boyfriend.
Well  what we have in New Jersey  near that Chatham place -- as a matter of fact  it was built exactly where the nightclub used to be  which burned down during World War II.
I want to ask you first of all  whens the first time you ever went back to Germany after the war?
But at that time you also had to wear -- Jews had to wear a yellow star.
And then they went back to France   and they assumed their -- Their old -- Their old whatever that was that they were doing before the war  right  right.
Matter of fact  before the war  he was a engineer there  from the bridge there -- they was build up the bridge.
So I walked and I saw a young man follows us  because after the war the po -- the Polish people killed the Jews what they came back from concentration camp.
They were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 going to have several things.
We re mained enemy aliens for the duration of the war -- >> Bill Benson: That was because you were German by birth?
Tell me  did you -- Because the important -- the whole important part of that is that we both were in the resistance during the war.
But that might be the Yiddish name of the town or the village and sometimes these names 8 A I think there was a time that the Jews were accused of treason in the first war corroboration with the Germans.
A nd even if they were my age  then they were children during the war  so then I started telling myself that you cant you know  you cant hold think a bout that all the time  you just cannot.
A-And also for my aunt to give them refuge there for -- that night and -- and also the people in -- in -- i-i-in Milan  if Arnold wouldnt have been so a fraid for -- for -- for his son  probably nothing woul d have happened  because Fierst came back  went to work in Genoa after the war  and  you know.
It took that many years fo r some people to start confronting the torture of the war time experiences.
A Greek ship  the father named the ship after the son who got killed in the Air Force.
See  you couldn't get out of the house after six o'clock they call it at war time.
And all business had been fur brokering and after the war and his family went back to New York  which is where I ended up.
Uh the the signs of it were there and in the turmoil of that world and quest for revenge that the average German had at the time...I just knew that it would come to another war in which I no doubt would be involved.
ﬂ I saw troop movements and everything  and where they are building fort and quarters  and so then thats that stuff that they gave me for instructions  and I did that till the end of the war.
For a different reason I was in Germany with the United States army.
A war with Germany  a war with Germany  and we didn't really know what it means.
But generally before the war  they started making trading organization  and you know  the and that was different.
They went through a series of harrowing experiences  being moved from one camp to another  especially as the Russians were advancing  but they managed to survive  ended up in Italy at the end of the war  and with my fathers help  started up a feather and down business and subsequently emigrated to the Unit ed States  and of the two brothers  one passed away a long time ago from cancer  and the other one  the youngest  Norman  is about 83 years old  still alive  and except for hard of hearing  is in good health.
We could never  during the war  after the war  we could never find out what happened to him.
How did your detail wind up from th at part of the war  at Mauthausen?
Because those changes  you see during the war  it was  it was totally different but after the war  yeah  she told me after she came to  she came to visit us in America as a matter of fact.
And when I attended the Conference  I went with mixed feelings  thinking  you know  the war is over.
Because one war brings upon another war   like it wa s in  in Germany.
And there were others who kind of felt the same way I did  that prompted me to start a little movement  which in reality  after the war  it was called a political movement  but at the   it was nothing but a gag.
Of course  the war begins with Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939  but the following spring  in the May of 1940  Nazi Germany attacked what we often call the lowland countries in France.
Well  let me ask you a couple of questions about Kovno after the war  if you don't mind.
I mean  to now there is no war  but there is also -- you've lost your family.
They started to speed up the gassing and they wanted to destroy everybody because even though he is losing the war but he still was carrying on with the plan of destroying the Jewish people.
make it from from the beginnin g  you know  so I work for this Lemmler til the war broke out  and then I Did you still go to school?
Were people celebrating the end of the war  and you know  what what was the general feeling?
When the war ended I tried to sign up as a Polish citizen to go back to Poland.
Then we f -- about a week before the end of war  we heard that American troops had -- were within -- within about 50 kilomete rs of Kometau where we lived  and the Russian troops were still 300 kilometers away  and we knew nothing of the Yalta agreement.
There were lots of people that were dying laying around and some people started leaving and me and five friends    the one that I mentioned before   and another was a man I knew from my town who was an older brother of that young man back in the ghetto who had a certificate on his on his identification paper that he had some physical ailment and should be excused...we decided based on the stories we heard from the...from our parents on what happened in the first war when the Russians and the Austrians keep moving back and forth  so the Americans left and the Germans may be coming back.
But Haim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and he left Poland before the war.
I lived in India until the end of the war and came to the States in '46.
He was born in 1886  he must have had some sort of profession before the war  he certainly didnt have any profession afterwards.
Joseph Goebbels  the Propaganda Minister  spok e in German and he said  While Im here on the radio  we are marching into Russia and in the name of God  we will be successful  we are going to destroy the system and the Jews  and then we knew that we are at war.
Interview with F red Goldman November 19  2001 42 So the war broke out  des -- on December seventh  and then you said you went to work in a factory making uniforms.
She carried on when th e war started because I was doing other things.
Stalin did not believe that there was going to be a war  that his friend Adolf was going to attack him  and apparently made no preparations for such a war.
During the War and after the War he was friends with -- he made friends with a guy named Sam Spig -- Sam Spiggel.
And on top of that  after the war  when she went to school  she became very ill with whooping cough and pneumonia  and she had to spend several months in the hospital  several months before it all cleared up  because we were all undernourished.
And he dressed in his army uniform and I said  well  I have to take you to headquarters to for them to decide whet her you are to become a prisoner of war  or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian.
Before the Russian occupation  you mentioned in the first interview that you had been attending school and that you had dreams of becoming a professional and -- tell me a little bit more about your -- your educational experi ence and your hopes before the war began.
Indeed  during the beginning of the war until 1944  when the Germans invaded  he was part of what we called the working group.
They built for us barracks and it was a slave labor camp.
I promis ed myself that if I survived the war  I'll help them -- let me compose myself.
So tell me  how do you have to wh at are some of the rules in interrogating a prisoner of war?
Did you have discussions with friends of yours that were Jewish  do you remember them being concerned  or their parents?
I believe 1940  I cant say when the phony war  as it was called  was over.
He happens to come to Poland right after -- maybe the next day when the war started.
So  and say  but you know who is liv ing there is this person  Kornblum his last name [indecipherable] he is very much involved in keeping the the the people who were in this orphanage together  you know  and following who is living where  having the phone number to get in touch  and he also pub publish a boo a little book  memories of the young a young boys memories  of his period of time on during the war.
Well  I havent really made up my mind about that  because Ive had a number of crises in my life since the war.
A nd the the camp in which we were was actually an unfinished factory  tha with number of buildings that were built by the Germans  because Germans had the very good relationship with the Iranians before the war.
And when the war broke out  I was back in my town with the grandmother.
Instead of just  you know  ﬁWell  you cant get into Cambodia  you cant bomb this  you cant do that.ﬂ You cant fight no war that a-way and win.
Then when the war broke out...the Russians  when they went in  so they took us from this camp and they sent us a camp a few miles away from from there because they brought in the Russian war uh PL... No.
When they made the little ghetto  that was where the Jewish quarter used to be before the war.
07:16:00 But as you read history  and study the whole the whole scene that has unfolded in the second war that was never even contemplated  or one step from the next  was the more horrible step from the next.
When you were with the academ ies in Europe after the war -- I mean  you were concertmaster or whatever -- Yeah.
So no country really w anted the Jews whether it was during the war or even after the war.
Probably after the war  because how else would be my sister?
As far as  you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your school and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitis m was not going to be as much of a problem any more?
If I were -- if there was no war and all these conditions I lived through  I would probably be  as you call in Russian language  Mami kin sinook.
The war ends in May. And so not to antagonize him  so he shouldn't do any damage to the coal mine.
Now as it turned out  during that search I also found a Nuremberg document  2176 PS  which was a collection of records that Mauthausen camp prisoners secured from destruction after the war  upon liberation  and turned over to the U.S. army investigator i nvestigating crimes at Mauthausen from the day that the camp was liberated.
And the only way that I was abl e to save tha t  because you know  we were stark naked all the time so we couldn't save an ything  but this was just nine days before the war and I must have learned from my mother to hide my bread  she hid the bread near the bosom and for th ose nine days I kept that there and somehow it wasn't found.
These are the last days or weeks of the war  and if you can remember the last concentration camp you were in  and what the Germans told you when you had to leave.
You know  but the majority of pe ople in Pratique did not agree this war was going  with what happened to us there.
Well  the family life...until...before the war  everything was  you know  normal.
But they obvi ously dont want peace [indecipherable] You think they want war?

I would have probably achieved a little more than I did achieve on my own  a-after the war.
Before the war  he worked with the canalizations from all the -- so he kn ows the road  through the canalization.
Can you ask him  when the war started in Se ptember of 1939 when the Germans invade Poland  was he in Bucharest then?
Okay  well my name during the war was -- I had several names  but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936.
By the time Germany invaded Poland in September 1939  launching World War II  your community already experienced profound change.
And that woodwork factory was taken over by the Germans to -- and transferred to produce articles and you know  for the war.
We met in May 1939 for the first time  the war broke out at the beginning of September.
When the Germans came in  real young children were separated from their parents and taken away first.
There was a Mrs. Stamos and at that time it was not called middle school  it was called junior high  who had lost her husband and a son in the war and she used to come in earlier and give me instructions in sentence structure and grammar.
And when you were on the march  towards the end of the war  you were liberated March  1945  near Gdansk .
You see  I actually si gned up during the Spanish Civil War  I would be a volunteer and I was going to Spain  but the war ended before -- before I got an assignment.
Throughout the war  my father went back to Hungary during the war.
And she says why dont yo u go  I says I dont want to have nothing to do with Germany  she says  look  this is already 50 years ago and she said  you know  the people there are young people who dont even know what the war looked like  they dont even know what happened.
I would rather be wrong at the end of the war than not be prepared now to do something about this.\
Te ll me about when the war first started and how life changed and what people thought was happening.
Interview with Leona rd Zawacki 34 Do you read about the war experience.
And -- well  we were just outside of Paris in that place where we spent the first two years of the war.
Do you -- would you say you learned someth ing from this experience in World War ?
76 No  because they weren't -- th-they were stri -- it was strictly -- there was a war going.
And for a number of months in those early days after the war  the JDC did what it could in Feldifing and I think a similar effort was mounted in a Jewish displaced camp in the British zone of -- of Germany.
Before 1939  had you heard a lot about Hitler and the Nazism?
After the war [indecipherable] but probably was the first vacation in Europe   went to Switzerland and we rented a car  my wife and I. My wife also came from Germany  but she came to the States earlier  with her parents.
Lord Mountbatten  who was in charge of combat ope ration  who was -- you know  hes -- is the uncle of  you know  Prince Philip  the husband of the quee n  he da -- his -- I thi nk his parents had gone through some sort of experience in World War On e  and he was in combat -- in charge of combined operation  which consisted of the units of the army  largely commanders  Air Force  and Navy.
So the Yugoslav Army was just whoever was there was taken to prisoner of war camps.
What really USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 9 happened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a train and I went to some kind of resort  to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole world situation and then brought my grandm other back to Strassber -- the following year  when the war really was going to get started  same thing happened.
When you're in the middle of a war or anything  you don't realize what's happening to you.

What were the interment camps like at that point  after the war?
I have met people who have been in the Czech Air Force he re after the war  and they said they -- they -- they were an-anti-Semitic.

World War II began  of course  with Germany and Russia invading Poland until September 1939.

So he had the easier rap -- rapport with the people -- with our school friends  and he saw some of them and -- and he found out that some died during the war  were killed during the war and other survived and they just make a bare living  whic h I dont really care about the ones who survived  truthfully  as far as Im concerned  even thou gh I didn't have any bad experiences during our time in school  they were -- they were fine.

Did you know  by the time you went abroad  if not before  what was happening to Jews in Poland?
So after liberation on every corner like in the depression y ear  do you remember the American war was  in 1929 in the depression?
And that's how I ended up with an Indonesian family for the rest of the war years.
During th e war I was convinced I wasn't going to live through it  and I decided I wanted to be buried as a Catholic.
Yegendorf was a lieutenant of the First -- in the Austrian Army of the First World War.

But for us  even when the war was finished  the war wasn't finished for us; for us  it wasn't.
Did you stay in Europe much longer after the war ended?
Uh what...to what was then the unoccupied zone of France uh to a to a camp that had at one time served as a refugee camp for the civil war refugees that came from Spain  because it was near the Pyrenees and and the Spanish border and uh they were they were simply dumped there with with without blankets  with...without adequate  with without anything and and and uh the Germans told the French to take over and uh so we we...of course  it took a long time until we then established some direct contact with uh my parents because they uh at first they couldn't write and when they did write it it took...that...those things took weeks and weeks in those days.

In terms of who I am today  I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these th ings bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them  but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps ab le and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past.

Back in– in the immediate– the time immediately following the war  how did you learn about what had happened  or– to your father and did you ever– I knew that  right away  what happened to my dad.
I remember that the newspaper  the first newspaper after the war in this part of the world  has reprinted in two...two hundred copies.
There was no big concern except war bonds and some rationing  things like that were going on.
That marriage did not occur until practically before the war because whether for reasons of different religions or other reasons  they had been friends for a very long time.
From my husbands family  his father and mother came to Przemy l during the war  we got them there.
Those people essentially spent withŠin Brimlitz the last six months of the war and survived that way.
And when I saw Hungarian  a lot of Hungarian Jews  not all  a lot of Hungarian Jews  even during the war  a lot of the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish  and they were doing things to them that they were Jewish.
And I came to Bialystok  and Bialystok was already a temporary capitol  at least while the war was going on.
I -- it was very difficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war  there were pogroms in Poland.
The last time I would say a year before the war ended  maybe less.
And  \ this was not normal girl\   and \ everybody was laughing about he r\   and before war  I was the one  I was every time telling  \ why you are la ughing?
Lets go back then  at one point you did go to Palestine -- or to Israel at that time -- Yeah. --
And I'd like to ask you to describe for us the conditions of arriving in Hui immediately after the war.
I became friendly with two or thr ee of my fellow Polish students  but strangely enough  at the Polish student home in Munich  no one spoke of his war time experiences  and we were so touchy and respectful of one another that no one asked the other -- well  we might ask where you're from originally -- no one asked how did you survive  and I'm talking about non-Jews.
And they only find out at the end of the war  because coincidentally  Ilia Aaronburg  the Russian author  had been to a tour of concentration camps  and w ho had been a -- obviously -- apparently to Treblinka  and who told the survivors  67 out of 3500 Bitola Jews  that all were 64 exterminated in Treblinka with no survivors.
Did you experience any anti-Semitism any time while you were in England?
Yes  yes  that I was different  that my folks spoke Polish at home  which bothered me a lot  we -- Were they learning Hebrew?
And he had been in World War I. So he pretty much kept us up to speed.
My father's best friend came back from the war  and so we asked him what happened to my father.
They didn t like the Jews at all  because they were afraid that the Jew take everything back  what they had  because they stole anything and everything during the war.
The Germans were ex-soldiers too  or had military training  or had the -- were -- for example  we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish Civil War  amongst the Germans.
And the condition was deteriorating by the day because the tide of the war had turned and as bad as it was before  now the Germans were letting the anger out on the few remaining Jews because they were  it was clear to them by this time they were loosing the war.
But then dur ing the war it was a different style.
And when we met a week ago or two  she didn't believe that I don't get money from the Nazi war because we went through so much  we said  \ Ours was our daughters\ .
And her son was a career soldier in the Belgian Army  was taken war prisoner  and when he came back  immediately joined one of the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her  from us  because he had to come home occasionally to get  you know  clothes and that sort of thing 12 and he would come at night  sometimes after the curfew  but he never got caught there.
Did you have Polish friends  did your family have contact with Polish people?
And that I remember distinctly  that I always used to say  ﬁGee  I really would like a war  because I would know what - you know  new things that are happening  you know  how they do it.
Four years he served in World War I. He was wounded  he was practically buried alive in the -- in the shell hole  but he made it th rough and he came home 1918 or 1919.
A few of the results I remember  the youngsters -- the people that were being interviewed were youngsters  teenagers at the time when the war broke out.
But there were other Jews who did come in from Poland  probably  I'm not sure how it was  but I'll presume that during the Austro-Hungarian empire  at which time Galicia was part of the empire  there was no Poland  it was partitioned  people from there  probably for to improve their lot economically or somehow  moved from Galicia into Carpathia or maybe even into 28 Hungary proper and naturally these people could not prove their citizenship and the Hungarians knew who they were  they always knew who it was  who  I didn't mention to you that already at age 12  the same as I had to belong to the Leventers  I had to have an ID card and since I was Jewish  on it was in red letter Z  for Zido  so they had track of everybody and they knew who these people were who didn't have citizenship and one day  again backtracking  the war broke out in 1941 with Russia  Germany attacked Russia and Soviet Union and the Hungarians  which were closely tied to Germany and the military especially  the officers and higher ranks  the staff  they were all completely pro-German.
And I think it just grabbed my attention perhaps because of my experiences during the war as it was Nazi power  with the Nazi Germany as a great power  that perhaps  Anita Frank 75 [Date not labeled] Page 75 perhaps I felt that understanding the Soviet Union better might help me do something worthwhile or some  something like that.
He was in World War I. He was not a hero or anything  but he had served in the military.
So when there was a ghetto– Ghetto was already open and second arrest by Gestapo was I was across the border to ghetto many times because we buy some small part of the machinery what we own and before the war all the supply was in the ghetto area and we was forced buy something because we cannot work with this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto.
And -- What -- what -- where in Poland  do you know?
My father had visited him several times after the First World War  before he was m arried.
Probably after 60 years [of the] war  I sort of [became] convinced that my anxieties and my fear were probably not justified as far as the Jewish people in America or other places were concerned.
passing by with our Mercedes in Poland   a burning tank  a Tiger tank  which I know  by chance  because the driver said  this is a Tiger  was was the biggest German tank  and one of the last inventions in in the war  it was built up.
And he was a handicap  he got he got he lost one hand in the war  sit the first war  and she married him.
And it so happened that in my car was a former German officer of World War One and somehow or other he caught the attention of the SS and they came to him and said  ﬁYou are the transport chief.ﬂ He didnt ask for it  he didnt want it  but you are the transport chief.
It was the year after the Six Day War when Jerusalem was returned to Israel.
SL: Well  she came back  her husband got killed and she came -- she was in -- they were in Russia during the war -- RL: And she came back with her child.
One day it seems 15 years before the war or something like that  Grandfather de cided that the way to...to really go was to become not only a merchant but a miller because the real money to be made was in turning the grain into flour.
Before the war  $10 000 was like a capitalist was very rich.
And I tell you what was when I was twe twe twe seven seven eight years we come in this war in this fifth place  in fifth place from my from my from my childhood.
So this was at a time when Hitler had come to power in Germany but before the war?
And then a historical pattern of extreme anti -Semitism  then youve got this great combination that when things go bad  as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation  well  first the defeat for Germany in World War I which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then  this  this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people.
We didnt know about it  we found that out after the war  of course  about the boat.
You don't ever dare -- nerve to separate me and her after the war.
>> Edna Friedberg: You mentioned that your entire conscious life  aware life at this point  is in the chaos of war.
When the war began then  you found yourself with which organization?
So so we so finally she went to India  because when the war broke out the as an Italian citizen she had she was for 10 years in India  and she became a f-friend with Rabindra Tagore   the first who got the N-Nobel prize [indecipherable] Indian  he wrote books and poetry and he was very much involved in peace.
This event was terrible  this the beginning of the war thing.
How -- what did you do immedi ately after the war  and what -- I -- -- what arrangements had to be made for coming to the States?
Our landlord  he was the head of fences before the war.
We were so surprised at the end of the war  he got a special medal.
But when the people from camps came  and it was towards spring  towards the end of the war  there were no -- No place to stay. --
I come from school as a liberated  feeling liberated after such a war  you know surviving Hitler and all of a sudden in the hallways they are talking about the Jews killed a Polish child and there were about 200 people standing in that hall entering that house where I was living.
>> Bill Benson: Before we return to after the war began  you've told me that your family was very assimilated.
Prior to the war  their parents could see the handwriti ng on the wall  what was happening to the Jews.
So they so we not only got the usual tours  but we actually me t with people  including my former ne nanny  and some other people who had lived there for during the time when my parents were still there  although most of the people were much too young to have been anything but children  or even some of them were  of course  obviously not even born til after the war.
But that developed during the war  and he was so good to them  and far and above what was safe to him -- for him.
I became bad because I told you that I was in the time before the war.
Holland was also invaded so people from there  too  were trying to get into France  assuming that the French and the British -- because before the Germans invaded Belgium and Holland and Luxembourg  the British had sent hundreds of thousands of troops to France  had declared war on Germany when Poland was invaded September 1944.
My mother left her hometown  Rymanow  for Berlin  which was the big center that attracted a ROUGH DRA FT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 lot of Jews after the First World War.
He is not the war criminal and he didnt do any atrocities.
Old people that had been...had escaped  especially after the war ended in 44.
So but what happened when in the last few days before the war ended was they also didn't give us any food any more and there were food riots because we were actually starving.
But I went through the whole story and I told him that -- that they had survived Bergen-Belsen and they are in Switzerland since the end of the war  and that my parents had been killed  and that -- that Im living with them for a year.
He was just  probably waiting until the war is going to be finished.
What do you remember about the ending of the war in Ludbreg?
>> David Bayer: Well  there used to be a big military camp the Germans had called ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 Foehrenwald.
I bought right after the Interview with William Luksenburg 19 war a big junk yard.
During the war you had to either -- if you had some money  you could try to get some food on the black market.
We were there and when it started more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they started little by little to liquidate that camp.
One we sent  we addressed to Basel  Switzerland where my mother had an aunt by the name of Miller  Tante Miller  and she always  my mother always drummed the address into our heads just in case we will be separated during the war that after the war we should meet over there.
As I mention ed before  I was not quite 15 when the war broke out.
Marcel Drimer: Heirloom and he promised he would buy him a cow right after the war.
They put them in gunnysacks  they brought them back to the United States to the Treasury  and on the basis of those and then there was intensive work on the documents  because some related to war crimes  some didn't.
I I I was asked so many there was be-bef-before before the war there was [indecipherable] or something  a newspaper  which also has a section for the young  and for teenagers  or whatever.
So there was kind of a balan ce based on communal interest  the Danish wanted to run the country safely out of the war the Germ ans wanted to have as much peace as possible to concentrate their efforts in another front.
When was the -- where were you for the end of the war?
The war still 46 was.... We were living - and I came from th e Engligh soldiers - use to be English soldiers.
The Russians after Stalingrad  the Battle of Stalingrad  began to win the war.
My v-very best friends came to the United States from Germany in -- before the war.
Was he in Germa ny during the war or was he in the US?
But  any other memories -- I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like living there before the war as much as  I know you were quite young  but as much as you can tell me.
It was -- if you look at the pre -- pre-World War II map of Poland  the only time Poland existed as an independent country was from 1918 to 1939  after which it was dismembered again.
And he said a -- he said right away [indecipherable]  he said  ﬁI told you the Americans are there.ﬂ I said  ﬁYou told me Americans were there six months ago.ﬂ Of course eventu ally they have to come  I mean  because we knew that they would -- the Germans would lose the war.
You didn't think anything after the war that man is hanging.
But for your community and for Jews in Hungary  the full effect of the war didn't really happen until the spring of 1944.
Among them was my future brothe r-in-law  Hanias husband  who was able to make it and he joined the partisan group and he survived the war.
But it was like when the war  no when we were liberated and we all got together again as a family  I remember very distinctly my sister saying nothing happened to us.
After the war when we met he ...found it) Where did you get the paper TL: (Russian--Our friends Rushuski wanted to leave the ghetto  got passports.
At this point there was a mixture of people because the war was ending and people were hiding.
How much did you talk to your family  to your wife  to your sons  about your experiences during the war?
Myself I had uh uh at the end of the war uh I ended up with uh two front teeth had been knocked out  the uh the reason for it not even clear to me.
Lets see now  no  I know that during the war my father got involved in marquetry  wood marquetry.
Before the war  in Lithuania  the flashlights were sheet metal around flashlights  very similar to the ones we have here.
There was one fellow actually  he was an interesting fellow  unfortunately I lost contact with him after the war  his name was Heinz Jacobius.
Now -- Now  these were Germans who were coming after you.
But finally we found her  and she lived in the same house what she did before the war.
So when we had nothing to do  because the Germans had a war to fight  they needed transport wounded  they needed transport ammunition.
I remember film where they were showing us the effect of a certain poison gas and the person was vomiting like a white foam was coming out of his mouth  I mean I knew about the effects  I mean like simulating things and things of that sort so I couldn't understand how they made that person vomit or how they could make that white come out of his mouth but they were showing films of that sort and so it was war time even before there was a war.
No  she did not  but she went back to her small town of Tarnogrod just after the -- 1939  war broke out  you know.
One name you were born with  a name -- certain -- several names that you used during the war  and a name now.
It doesn't make any sense but this is the way I am after the war.
I understand you are a highly decorated first world war general.
And this was the time when the Germans were losing the war  1944  losing the war.
These pacts all had loopholes written into them  and th en Jackson was certainly aware of that  but he said  \ Look  the time has come and there's nothing unfair about trying these guys for the crime against peace  of committing aggressive war  even though 'aggression' was not defined.\
And  you know  we been crying and and and be happy like like always  and and the war  when it was end.
For instance in the Hajda case  we could talk because we had  through a three tier ed level of documentation  contemporaneous documentation of individuals who were in the Traw niki system  and who served at the Treblinka 60 labor camp  individuals who afte r the war testified in western countries  where there was -- where you didnt have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like  that they had indeed been there  and done this  that and the other thing  and then of course  the Soviet protocols  in so far as the information contained therein was consiste nt with the original documentation  and the testimony in the western protocols.
And but when the war  we started moving from ghetto to ghetto  he took the birth certificate out you know when they started moving us around.
Do you know what happen ed to him after the war?
Some people in other places over there  they  behind doors  they were torturing for information  and um  and we were very  very frightened  and that's how we arrived in Malin  and we stayed there in a big room and um  I found out afterwards that uh  Malin before the war was a  a Cassern??
He was a prisoner of war in Germany and Morris gave him a first job.
He was in the Russian army  then they transfer him to the Polish army.
That probably was a lot better th an a German prisoner of war camp.
At the end of the war I guess because of that my father was not -- not very old.
And after the war  Horsts father said to his two sons  who were now teenagers  ﬁWe have belongings from a Jewish family  the family Cohn  and Im trying to find them  and if I dont find them  I want you to promise me that you will always look for them  and we have to return these items to that family.ﬂ So I couldnt belie ve what was happening.
You know after the war we came and when we–were t elling the story they told some reactions were from people  Oh  they feel like they are in a movie  watching a movie.
So  it wasnt like he wasnt accepted totally  and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe  and they knew what was happening  they decided to get married.
How did you feel about the war in the fi rst 10-20 years after it s conclusion?
They didn't believe...and somebody used to used to uh uh...even even  you know  some...we had a lot of Communists who were before before the War  you know  Communists  but after...and they used to on people.
And when the German co -- before -- when the war start in 1939  in September first  when the German attacked Poland  that I start working for the organization which take care about fire and houses in -- in Warsaw.
We went together -- >> Bill Benson: They came back much later than when you were liberated?
During the war I was  uh  a Marine Corps lieut enant.
I could tell in the Jewish speaking  I find out that they were Hungarians.
She says  okay  before you go to the Korean War  I go out with you.
But then unfortunately we got the news from New York that my father was dying of lung cancer  because he had been a smoker all his life  from the time he was 15 and the only time he couldn't smoke was during the war  but he started right after and he got lung cancer a nd he was hopeless and then we got word he was dying.
The second time I saw this this exactly flowers  the wa purple bougainvillea  it was in in another war.
After the war  when there was a great shortage of food  and my father had to work very hard to get milk from peasants near Nuremberg  because you couldnt get enough for a baby.
Berlin was already it was almost to the end of the war.
Because we really did not know the progress of the war.
So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews  the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.
Poles were not there  but there were -- they had a group of Russian prisoners of war which turned on the Russians.
And I remember a-after the war there were each -- children were dying.
She was -- my sister was very small and a little sickly  and the war was coming on then when -- when '39 came around  when we knew that the Russians were coming  we knew that the men would seem to be in greater danger than the women  at least that was the understanding.
Do y ou remember the food that you ate before the war  during the war  and right after the war?
But then on June 21  when the Germans invaded the Russian part -- Q. 1941?
And my grandfather on my fathers side died just before the war and was buried in the Jewish cemetery near the ghetto.
Gr andpa died right before the war  about two or three years before the war  and grandma un -- when they came to live with us  she sort of took over the kitchen.
My fathers resentment against Poland   which he held until his death in 1993  wa s really centered around Polish anti-S-Semitism that was displayed after the war began  and during the war.
I really feel I was very sick and tired of learning all these religions  because all my mother had done right now was  since the war over  she told me I was Jewish and that was it.
What we had in the war  this was a good life.
What Im wondering is  were there a lot of people after the war  who were just traveling around  like you  lost?
He told me that he waved to them and were still there after the war.
Yes  also in that  uh  period  uh  my uncle--who was a war veteran from the First World War  and  uh  was on the Russian front  lost one eye there and was kept for six years in Siberia.
But you know  these pictures  zillions of pictures  you know  I mean every single picture she grab and saved  you know  from the war  from different So your your c was your was your closest contact with Poles the the maids like the Christian Poles Yeah.
I think very early ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 7 during the war  and she is actually buried in Zagreb  and I can actually visit her grave.
Because the war...the war zone  it was very close from Hui.
Interview with Sabi na Berggren January 30  2015 127 But anyway  so we we remain  and the few families without fathers and so on  the s the war  or civil war between the Jews and the Arabs starts  and were in an Arab settlement  and there are prob you know  Arabs go on our roof  because theres flat roofs  and just Shooting.
Sometimes we knew that there would be ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 another battle.
And both of them were in armed servi one was in the army  one was in the navy during World War II  and we became quite friendly.
How do you think your -- your past experience as a Holocaust survivor affected how you viewed that war?
I hate that  because we were so hungry we Interview with Tole Madna April 18  2002 43even ate tulip bul-bulbs in -- in the -- in the last part of the war  because there was no other food.
And they were picked up from the Polish foundry in our city  which the locomotives for the tanks were built there for the war.
This was when the Russians started to come in  and the Germans started to move out.
This was something that he fought for during the first World War  was for not only for Polands independence  but also for give everybody the opportunity and equality.
Well  she was shrieking and she came storming out to the police station protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason whatsoever  but obviously it did not do any good.
So that if captured or something it wouldn't be clear to the Germans that I was German originally.
It was very tough after the war  one forgets  its not just now.
Its called ﬁWeapons of the Spiritﬂ. Ad its this very stirring which Ive always been so moved by that this particular translation is of a man who was a French Swiss who worked at Le Chambon during the war  helping numerous children  carrying for them  nourishing them  helping them escape.
All right  so now you hear that the Germans have attacked Poland.
Did you find that people had an understanding of what had happened during the war  and the history of what had happened to the Jews in Europe?
So -- and -- but his parents  my grandparents  they came to ki -- they was also in Kazakhstan during the war  in different place.
Interview with Alan Kalish October 24  2003 78 Are you also hearing rumors about the war?
And little by little  when they got married  you know  they always provided the rest of us with money and we all su pported the family until the  the war broke out.
But after the after the war  when they went back to that home  they could either reclaim their home  or find any other home  they went to another home.
One of them survived  I met him after the war  I couldnt believe it  but  the rest were all killed.
He was on the other side of the river and before the war my mother would get  many times she would get dairy products  milk and cheese and butter from this farmers place and it sounded very logical to me.
And my uncle  see I had a few relatives who left Hungary 25 years before that.
They had participated in World War I and they kne w that war is not only s ongs and marches.
Okay  now  after the war  when I was come back home  I found everybody survive.
So we realized continuously th-the inc -- increasingly realized the size of the -- the numbers we only found out and learned after the war  the total numbers.
I dont know whether it was just a sort of simplistic optimism  it was the kind of optimism that she had throughout the war later  in much worse circumstances  where she felt that we would survive.
I mean that  we lived with that throughout the war  and I also - you know  now when I think about the horror of it  it blows me away.
Later on  I go to New York and there I really don't do very much of anything  but subsequently to that I go to Chicago and there I get back into cerebral palsy and I become the chairman of that organization for three years  which takes us now 01:14: to 1967 at which time I go to Israel and the Six Day War.
Because by this time in that -- immediately after the war  the first thing that --that we got right after the war  after we had this incredible jubilation on the Hooftweg  was that everybody hauled out their clandestine radios and their record players and their hidden Dutch flags  and the orange streamers for the House of Orange  and o -- sudden ly this stuff came out of nowhere  and we had 88 three day block parties  essentially  the whole city that I remember  everywhere there were loudspeakers running  music  and there was dancing in the street and there was just unbridled joy.
And then I found out about other priests and their heroic deeds and all the wonderful things they had done  so I came back with a whole collection of stories of just  you know  sheer heroism and what I was pointing out is  the h eroes during World War 2 were not the generals  you know  and who won the war  like MacArthur and so on  because that was their job.
A lot of Jewish people before the war went to Australia.
28 We had friends that  before the war my mother us ed to help them a lot  they were poor.
They were hanging out from their windows and they were with such love and I figured  if people can have so much love for their president  thats how much I knew about you know  it somehow I always say  with g all going through all that war  I still  when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna  what they used to call me when I was a kid  that I could never see any bad in other people.
The -- did you -- when the six day war was happening  were you -- Oh  I study -- I studied history  so I still do -- I still do now.
On the other hand  I go back to the people -- if people are going to kill in a wartime situation  and theyre going to kill illegally  at some point its very important for all of us who survive those things  and who might have to undergo them in the future  that we know that that wont ever go away  that there will be some consequence for that action duri ng the second World War  that there will some consequence for those who commit crimes during the Yugoslav civil war  that there will be some consequence for those who committed crimes in Rwanda.
And so it -- it -- S-September  and therefore  I was so afraid and so unhappy because I thought that soon we will be in the war.
About 20 years after this past war  lets say in 1965 or so  the French government offered French citizenship to my mother.
It was very much the center of the war and food was hard to come by.
So he came to the Sawinskis and showed them the ring and said I'll give you this diamond ring if you'll hide us  take us and hide us until the end of the war.
Then when when they brought us to the barracks  to the little place which was called [speaks foreign language] I dont remember exactly  and there were barracks  which they had kept many years ago they kept over there like prisoners of war or something  I don t know.
Q. Do you remember how you heard about the war being over?
It wasnt the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasnt.
and suffered by the Nazi regime  and they signed an accord  an agreement  an authorization  that a trial should be established  and these people should be indicted for crimes against the 116 peace  war crimes  crimes against humanity.
After the first World War  he was sent -- French troops were occupying the Rhineland with the British.
I worked  made hand grenades and befriended some Italian prisoners 0f war who refused to fight on the Leningrad front.
You know  you could get othe r stations too  but they didn't--they spoke some French but not English  but my mother's brother was an engineer and he was  of course  able to do all of these things  but he left for Spain and unfortunately he was killed in the Franco war.
By the way  after the Second World War  he was tried and executed as a war criminal  one of the very few men of cloth which was prosecuted and found guilty.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0026 50 I was wondering  before I knew that  whether it was difficult for you to be in a place with such cold winters  after what you experienced during the war and the coldness.
And I dont where I had the chutzpah  that I -- I was devoted to flying and -- and planes before the war  already.
And after the war she married that son  a physician who had a successful practice in Syracuse.
In high school  we had one girl who was of German decent  and as before they would taunt Jewish girls  the year before the war  they started taunting her.
Did you get any medical care  either dur ing the war or immediately after the war for your back?
So many  many years are -- many  many decades after the war  I wrote him a letter  and asked him exactly why he had decided to go to a work camp  and then he wrote back that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure for him.
And that created quite a stir  evidently  in the United States and President Turman as I said appointed the Dean of the Law School of the University of of Pennsylvania  Dean Earl G Harriman  Harrison   excuse me  to umb examine the camps and to report to him to see whether or not the reports of the umb war correspondent were accurate.
So  there we will work  we will do what happened in Poland  so that is and maybe we can survive the war  maybe.
You know  remember Pearl Harbor and so forth  and of course Germany declared war right away too on this  as you recall as one recalls.
My parents came from Pola nd  but my father was a prisoner in the first World War taken by the Germans and that's how he got to Germany.
And then it wasnt til after the war that we found out that they had died  but heres a picture of them.
And  after the war  there were fewer and fewer  and fewer bricks because they insisted on rebuilding it unnecessarily for my taste  after the war  and the peasants needed to get their houses fixed.
Okay  you know  this war time  it was very  very hard in the in the post with all these things  but we got contacts.
Well  we got there  I think the war ended in May and there we spent some times in Czechoslovakia  because you were in the te -- terezin -- Theresienstadt  and we were getting ready to be like -- there was like a resettlement place to go -- some people went USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070 3to their respective countries  and some people refused to go back to their own country  bad memories  you know.
So its -- its -- there was still an ti-Semitism after the war  certainly  in -- in -- in Holland and in Belgium.
Okay  I would like to know what happened for the rest of the war. \\
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
Joe DuBo is can be canonized for his devotion to the Jews  for the fight th at he made in the face of people like Rabbi Wise  60 who wouldn't approach the President during th e war to tell him what was goi ng on.
And we put on the radio  and this was the invasion of the second actually the the Nazi part of the second World War started.
So you feel like your time in -- in those years in Berlin right after the war  it was almost like there was a timeta -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 4 Yeah  it is -- Some sort of reconciliation?
And its funny  because I said that to my husband just recently  and it sort of -- you look at some of these old war pictures  how people were going to concentration camp with suits and ties and hats.
I was at that time  when the war broke out  I was just under 17.
Why they did that I don t know it -- it -- I know one -- one of the 13 after the war met a guy  a German policeman -- shortly after the war  you know  and this fellow said to him  are you still alive?
And a letter included that came from the Vatican  which I have a copy  a document  which it went to General Clay  which he was the governor of Europe from the American army  if you are going to kill those 45 people  you are not any better than the Nazis  because the war is over.
and they want to know whats going on with the Russians  and they ask me  how do they treat the other Jews  and he said wait until after the war.
So by the time the war ends youre only nine anyway.
And we ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 did so much together.
Let's talk a little bit about your family life  your memories before the war  what was it like living in Ashoshok ?
I was -- war was declared 10 days Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 14after my 16th birthday.
Well  Gleiwitz Gleiwitz radio station was a German radio station on right on the Polis h border  and just before the war broke out between Germany and Poland  there was an attack on this German radio station by Poles and Hitler gave it as one of the main reasons for attacking Poland.
We were -- you know  was after -- well  after the war  no it -- it couldnt have been.
The reason being that after the first war  when Poland became independent in 1918  the -- the marshall pusitski who was then the -- the head of the Polish government -- it was decided that Po land has to arm itself  so they carved up a -- an industrial complex within the heart of Po land and they started -- there was ore to be smelted and big factories went up.
So  in some ways its a miracle that in many ways its a miracle that you survived the entire war incarcerated  whereas most children would not have survived.
When did you first start hearing about a man named Hitler?
And I went to the Polish school to the Jewish school.
Germany had declared war on Poland  but our part  there was -- which was a long distance from the German/Russian -- from the German/Polish border T Russians just marched in overnight and took over half of Poland.
>> Bill Benson : So it took until 1946 before your family was back together.
This was from early on  when the Germans first came in?
And I put the that together with the postcard he sent us from Dachau saying that that was his thanks from the fath erland for his service in World War I. Well  thats enough to make you bitter.
The war was over basically in October 2nd  1939  and I returned home in about November.
And for a lot of people  especially Auschwitz survivors  there really werent a lot of photos of Auschwitz taken during the war  so it really was proof that in-incredible proof that people could point to  it was all over the news.
An d then when I came after the war  that woman and that man that were with th e American who saved himself and worked underground  they say they had moved shortly after my parents were taken away.
There were many difficulties once war was underway in Europe in the fall of 1939.
And we got cards; after the war was finished  her boyfriend had received a card that she had smuggled out on the day of Yom Kippur.
There was a large family before the war; your family were your friends.
And then how do you find out that Germany has made war on the Soviet Union?
And then  after the war  I was so serious and old  compared to 15 year old kids  because I had -- it -- it -- it takes its to -- it t-took its toll  you know  being away from my parents and its tension.
They got the military units  and they got this Polish this there was ye before the war they had young teenagers  at least 16 or 17 years old  they had about two years or Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 79three years.
Some of them were active during the Kaisers regime in World War .
I know that my Aunt Cylli tried to tell him : look  the war is almost over  why do you go there fighting?
About  for example  the invol vement of the war: how it was possible that in the name of the same religion they were placing the Austrians to kill the Italians.
One monument was done very soon after the end of the war  and all the years what we were knowing from Moscow to Vilnius  and then to Serei to this place  once a year definitely  in the summer  there was a monument.
And t hen she told me that she had a boyfriend before the war  that she had a boyfriend  and they were kind of like childhood sweethearts.
The political leading came mostly from the place where we have been working because they knew everybody and I think that the organization of the communistic party was nearly the same as it was in the pre .. .. war time  but not with the same people.
There is a war raging there  and you don't know if you would even be permitted to land there.
>> Bill Benson: In September 1939  of course  all that would change when Germany invaded Poland from the west.
She was born in Germany  and she was a war bride.
You mentioned earlier that by the time you got to Auschwitz you were hear ing more news of the war and of the outside world.
But I never thought of myself other than as an American  and the experiences of the war was  I would say quite honestly that I [indecipherable] thought about it until this interview  I suppose I repre ssed them.
And they had a young son  and they lived their life in the main house  and I lived my life in the wooden shack  and you know  like everybody else  they also thought that the war would be over by Christmas  and that the Tommys would be coming.
Because the Joint  I think  sent until the war ended  I think maybe... I don't have the amount.
I was visualizing all these peopl e that running away from Vietnam  being more or less associated with our problem that we ha d during the war  just history repeats itself all the time.
And the choicell be ours.ﬂ It must have been  I mean  that -- that -- that -- the Cold War going on for -- for decades with -- with the -- the -- the Soviet Union.
And a matter of fact  one guy who survived the war from Berlin -- from Minsk ghetto  and he was killed when he -- he came to his hometown to visit.
But you know it better than I do  that the world we live in now is probably going to be very easy to declare thats a civil war  thats a civil war  thats a civil war.
And it would remain that until Germany invaded Belgium in May 1940.
And we were expected to be taken by the Germans also.
And so so yo u know  then  towards the end of almost at the end of the war  in July of 1945  because everything was being liquidated and  you know  the British and the Americans were going to move out of there too  we were taken by train to Baghdad in Iraq.
>> Bill Benson: And later we'll come back to what you would find out much later.
The guy was idiotic to say that they were going to win the war  when the best that they could do was a better part of the country.
So when the war br oke out in 39 in Poland  -- Yeah  after Hitler invaded Poland and th inking that the Russians would be with them.
And your father begged her to stay  and he said  the war is coming  the war is coming.
So I went with him to Poland  to the occupied section of Germany  what became Poland eventually.
I was born during the first World War and we were evacuated into the hinterland -- German   by Austro-Hungarians  which operated this sector of the front.
Now  Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 52 when the war was over  he found out that I am alive.
But at that time  for whatever reason  there was a lready some anti -Semitism in France.
And then they put Chinese  but they requested 34 interpreters in China of to Japan  because they thought Russia was going into the war over there  too.
Did you get did you go to synagogue  did you get religious instruction?
Now tell me about before the war  how life changed for you  what you remember.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually  when did we know the war was over?
And eventually we got these young German prisoners of war to help us as ward men.
Of the four young women  she was the only one to survive the war. (
Did you witness any anti-Semitism at any time in the military?

So  heres what Im under heres the impression Im getting  is that at some point in 1936  or 1937  because thats the time of the Spanish Civil War  and it is a topic that is discussed  you remember being in your bed area  you know  the separate from the living room  and lying and hearing lying down in your bed  and hearing others in your family  behind the curtains  talking about politics.

If I could just ask you  you were saying as you were making your way to your home town you would see Jews coming out of hiding and you know after all you had gone through in all those years of the war  Im wondering if you could de scribe a little more  do you remember how  you know how you and your husband would react when you would see that.

Before she was incapacitated totally she made uh an atte mpt on her own to get in touch with the American Consulate or the American Embassy in Holland again to ask that...my father had made application to the American Consulate back in 1939 when we first entered Holland for a visa and I have much correspondence from th at time  form letters from the American Consulate saying this by no means says that you' re going to be allowed in and we make no representation  but you better supply us with such and such documents and then follow up things of the same sort  and uh after the war my mother uh made contact  uh wrote to the American Embassy and asked that we should be reinstated for visa uh but nothing came of it.
B ut he wasnt even given that because he had been a conscientious objector in the war and he had been a fire fighter  a paratroop fire fighter in Color ado.
And was your house in the ghetto at the time or did you have to move?
And then when your your first memories of when the war started  can you describe Interview with Joseph Koplewicz October 7  1993 10 That first memory?
He was instrumental in assisting Truman in the preparations of postwar War Crimes Trials.
Did you have any Jewish friends at that time  any Jewish acquaintances.
But he was active in a Jewish choral society  which after -- where he was the secretary  since the end of World War One.
You were going to the music school all the way up to the time of the war starting?
Such as  you know  Hitler came to power in Germany ?
A bet for a quart of strawberries and cream to be payable after the war.
I dont think its re -- its related to the experiences I had during the war.
About the Dutch  I dont think I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch  as about the Germans  but I know now that the Dutch  as a whole  could have done a lo t more  including our queen.
Well  somebody that you work -- happened to work with before the war even and -- yeah.
Here was the only one German was here since the time of the war what I knew that he was righteous.
Never  never after the war  I never went to a church  a a Catholic church I dont even know from inside  I never because we were Protestant where we lived  yeah.
And my brother  of course  was more panicked  like he was writing letters  oh  you have to get out now  the war is about to start  you know.
So  cause you know  sixteen year old girl they all wanted to have in  during the war  they wanted me to sit in front with one and the other  my mother and the other and the Matulskis were in the back of another truck  but we were all together.
As it happened there were quite a few Hungarians there  Jews and non-Jews.
for me who was still a -- a teenager  was a child  it came very suddenly  because all -- in our y-younger years  you know  we heard stories about the atrocities and suffering during the first World War  which was still reasonably close at the time  so -- so we were frightened  but we didnt know what we feared.
But of course  that -- that period of time really led to Hitler  we all know that.
When I when the war broke out in Israel in 1940 se end of 47 fighting  I was already trained good.
Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 18 You had no idea that all those horri ble things were happening throughout Europe concentration camps There was there was no radio inform ation about whats was going on in Europe other than people who had radios and then had war stories  but they never said anything about the killing of Jews.
He remembered the World War I and he said the German is a cultured nation.
And...uh...always said  although I maid  I always had to do thing myself in the house  and this was a good thing because ...because when the war came  I...uh...I wasn't lost.
But then we found out about the others  who also were killed in the camps  and for whom -- my mother thought that they were disappeared in the war  or in the evacuation with the Russians  and they were war casualties rather than Holocaust direct massacred or killed people.
And again  even though Im hateful to the Nazis  Im not hateful to the Germans.
So I go to Wa shington and I told them  \ I came here on this passport that cannot be extended and I'm studying  I came here as a student and I cannot return to Canada because I didn't gain domic ile and I cannot return to Germany because they are at war\  and if I can stay here longer.
It was after the First Wo rld War when I was a small child.

And we came...we came back to all the way...to uh  to Poland.
I dont know exactly when along these 8 months  but they were told not to pursue crimes against other people other than Americans; that they should pursue war crimes against Americans  which basically meant war crimes against the American flyers who parachuted down and then were killed by the local Nazis.
Well my  the  the greatest influence of my war experience certain ly is to apply for the job at the Holocaust Memorial Museum.
01:30:40 Can you tell me what happened when the war started  when Germany invaded Poland?
I kept on doing the same work  then when -- when the war broke out  I got a job in a -- in a uniform factory.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if at that time if your mother and the other adults  did they begin to have a sense of the enormity of what had happened during the Holocaust  what had happened to Jews throughout Europe?
Nowitz was one  I was one  and later we got a few more people in  but the total number was never more than half a dozen or a dozen  who were comp etent to know what represented a war crime and to prepare a report which would stand up in a court of law.
We stayed on the ground  just on the ground so but I remember this and so this man later on and during the war.
We had the old World War I Im sorry  not two  one  World War I  correction.
Then  si nce we live not too far from the airport -- I told you that last time  many times  I dont know what  but suddenly theres that noise  and that noise reminds me  after the war  for about one year  maybe a little longer  the Germans used to come in like 30 - 40 planes  to bomb the city where I lived.
How did it feel to be traveling in -- in countries that -- in H-Hungary  or in Czechoslovakia  or Yugoslavia where -- where th ere had been so much destruction  and - Was just -- we felt -- we want -- you know  I wanted to prove to the world  and I -- thats -- thats probably why Im -- we are -- Im successful  that we are not stupid people  that we have ambitions  and we ha ve knowledge  and -- and underst -- we have intelligence  and whatever -- ever did it in my life  after World War -- I did only things -- not just to make the money  to -- to show that Im a decent human being  you know?
I would say he was 40  and he had fought in the -- this war that was brought to Yugoslavia  in 1941.
When the war began  they took him right to th e front.
Because during the war  I had some kind of stability  I mean for the last couple of years when I lived in that house in Exleba  as I said  I was in terror but it was  to some extent I had accommodated to the terror.
So I 12tried to talk to -- I met in libraries in the Silver Spring area was Jewish War Veterans.
Now my father was in lumber business but I think two  three years before the start of of the war  it was nationalized and our part by the government and it was called .
And I I think its important  because if you dont practice that  well always be at war.
But certainly  its only from a German viewpoint  the average German viewpoints only -- its necessary to -- to connect that with the question of the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war  or the murder of Slav people  and Gypsies  and others.
After the war they took him to Sweden for two years  my husband  and then he came home and he opened the store and then I get married and I was in the store  till 52.

I di d not see a dead person  all during the war.
So they gave him Turkish pris oners and German prisoners and Austrian prisoners from the first World War  and they used to work in the factory helping to smoke the fish.
So tell me then  what was how did did you have a sense that the war was coming to an end?
He was driving a truck or something there  you know  delivering  you know  ammuni ammunition during the war  and he he did did his good good job.
Austria  Czechoslovakia   and it wasnt that much longer til the Nazis invaded Poland   and -- but the -- I think the invasion of Poland  that to me was  for all intents and purposes the beginning of World War II .
And they wo And later I dont know where that was already  on the Germans.

Some of the housekeepers were really very interesting and educated people who  after the war  had lost a lot  lost their fami lies.

Had your war experience an impact on your faith in any way?
But the pogroms were sanctioned in you know as we know in  in Germany and in Russia and we know what happened you know to the Jews you know during the last war.

I didnt even mean -- didnt realize what it means theres a war.
My father had people working for us and they were Gentiles  and we got along fantastically  but when the war started  they started robbing us.
Dont forget  it was 43  so the tide of the war had already turned against Germany  and it Interview with Gert Silver March 30  2006 31didnt take very long for fellow prisoners to tell us where we were  and I asked what [indecipherable] wheres my mother  wheres my si ster.

Uh my father's family even though he was born in wh ich was the heart of Prussia  uh under American la w after the after the uh 1st World War it had been ceased to Poland and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polis h quota  which ca used all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to America before the war.

The issues which youre raising  whether my life is today different than it used to be right after the war and for the following years  my gosh  the war is 60 years ago.
A. I was fortunate I was there because the two Jewish homes  on May 10  1940 when war was declared in Belgium  all the Jewish children we re evacuated to Nice  France and many of them did not survive including my cousin.
Even though th-the the Christian children had als you know  also had gone through a war  but a totally different experience.

Well  this [indecipherable] but -- but it was -- for me it was too late  because there was no war -- We -- well get there  I want -- I just want to -- to -- to -- Yeah. --
The Germans were there and the Russians start to come in.
Matter of fact  I had an uncle  a brother of my father  he died in World War I. What was his name?
And they got themselves false papers too  and thanks God they lived through the war.
So they were -- I can see -- still see that tall German officer who was  I believe  a ma jor or something  who must have been a hero of World War I. He must have been in his 50's and talking to the other one  and the NCO and they were looking at the and they were looking at the identity card  and they wanted to find out what was in my mother's suitcase.
And actually  after World War II he came back -- we came back to Paris and he had a whole -- not a trial but a whole judicial fight to get his apartment.

And at that time  it was becoming  because it was the Cold War era  sort of stereotyped many times.
But people worked  as I told you in those defense factories  and the illusion that we will surv ive the war became much stronger.
One more thing in the involvement in terms of the Jewish community in -- in The Hague; I mentioned  you know  attending services  but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly after the war.
When I -- when I had the permission to go down perfor m my job in the factory  my brother set me up  that I should get in contact with th e employers who used to work before the war  and tell them if they come to work  they will be able to earn three times  or four times as much as they earned b-before the war.

You said you mainly had bad dream s or nightmares after the war.
But I took time off and went down the road to Cooks on Southampton Row  Kings Way  which was five minutes from my school  and gave her  as as a matter of fact  a going away present of one of my little Ashanti gold weights that I had acquired during my six months in Africa at the end of the war.
because you were advised to -- No  I -- not that I couldnt stay  because my family told me  and this time was that center -- I dont know if you know  there was a question with food  a question with war  and the same.

He used to share with me my my pi ece of bread  you see  or offer me his piece of bread  but he would never never have any connections with smugglers which we thought 73it's...the underground...it's the...what we are trying to fight  just to keep the standard of of human of human behavior  of Jewish heritage   to keep alive even under these terrible circumstances of the ghetto  and this is only th anks to Dr. Elkes and to those leaders who were known as community leaders before the war and they were elected by...elected  and this was the difference  the big difference between the ghetto of Kovno leadership and the leadership in other...in other ghettos.
I want to ask you in a minute about the war crimes  but just one other thing.
Another war like that  and another not quite like that  but horrible things could happen  sure.
Uh and one of the...we were  the prisoners of war contingent was there at Buchenwald but so was our uh MP outfit  a platoon of MP's that had served virtually from the very beginning  had accompanied all us all through France and Germany uh and we had of course worked very closely with each other because when you uh interrogated you needed the safety of of the prisoners uh the the guards and you told them what you were doing and there was a real wonderful working relationship.

I looked - I kept my mothers address  but not the war time  one  so I -- I really dont know.
When it came that I had to leave  I was deva stated that I couldnt study any more  that -- that was  for me end of the world I wanted - but then burns  my father said  ﬁThis will -- war will be over soon [indecipherable].ﬂ You know  all this -- Right  thats what everybody thought -- six months and youll be home.
And I knew that the business in the preceding months before the war was very  very dead  was virtually at standstill.
I don't think they would give me up or what  they wanted to adopt me after the war because they had a sick girl  retarded  they wanted to adop t me and my uncle didn't want me to become Catholic.
So I always said  ﬁWell  after th e war  youre still my friend.ﬂ But see then  an NSB-er would not approve that.
We were there with soldiers  with war brides  all kind s of people.
And I think she lived with them during the war  in England.
And  so I still have quite vivid memories of the First World War.
And by that time  of course  in 1950  summer of 1950 the Korean war brok e out  and 50 or 51 yeah  50.
>> What has the significance of Judaism been for you since the war?
And Except that my grandfather  my maternal grandfather came from a family that  before the first World War  and I think it was at the middle of 19 th century  they met my [indecipherable] through Turkey from Macedonia   and through the through the Carpathian mountains  came to Silesia  Shlunsk   and then and but my mo my grandmother was from Vierkapolska   the up [indecipherable] Poland.

Did you know that there had been something like the Holocaust at this point?
What happened to you and to your business as war approached?
Three things I think must be mentioned: Number one  the law we established  which provided that a head of the government could be prosecuted as a war crimin al  was brand new.
Talking about the United Europe  in terms of post World War II  I mean  thats was not thinkable.
Did it represent at all a place  I mean obviously  the  some of the attacks following the six day war were  you said were very scary.
1 Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.
It was only duri ng the war that I dreamt about some people I knew an d I didn't know what would happen to them.
And being...having been in business before the war  it was a little difficult to get a job.
But I got -- as I said  I got to know quite a few Poles over the years  including the Pope  and so my view of the Polish role during World War II  quite honestly I would say  is a lot more nuanced and quite different than my fathers -- what I regarded and still regard  I suppose  as a one-dimensional view that all Poles are bad.
>> Bill Benson: So in the eyes of the British  because you were first and foremost in their eyes German therefore you were considered enemy aliens.
And I remember when I came back into my town and it was the end of the war  when it was a big celebration.
What was Germany like right after the war for you as a child?
I started to learn Hebrew again  which I had  I had Hebrew before the war and during the war  and I studied the Torah  and I studied Jewish history  and I really became  I  switched.
Like  like  like I say  I was hungry before the war.
After the war  if Im going to survive  no Red Cross for me.
After this brutality  after...after this horror  after this inhumanity  to come to a civilized country  that three hundred years didn't have any war.
indecipherable] to Drancy   from Drancy to Auschwitz   I mean  whatever thats Interview with Paula Blue August 7  2009 48 And when the war ended  Im assuming th at at one point you were reunited with Leo.
I remember that in 1939  they were talking about a war that looks like it was going to be a war.
So that  and so thats what happened they put us in lorries and carted us all down to the coast  and dumped them on the Italians [DL] And you were then sent to an Italian Prisoner of War camp  er briefly what were conditions like for you at the Italian Prisoner of War camp? [
And it through all those years I did lots of growing you know  between the war and between my work  you know  I became extremely much more tolerant and and a much better person than I ever would be  even not all those things.
Actually my last relationship was w ith a Jewish man  who also had the  well  had some background during the war but his both pare nts lived and he really didn't have much hardship except he understood what it means to be a Jew and confronted with anti-Semitism and so on.
So that was the lucky part  so even if he wanted to survive he could have gotten killed after  after war for different reasons.
You have to -- and under these circumstances  during the war  du ring occupation  you had to stand up and show that you -- [indecipherable] things  that well not -- well be bound of -- and especially because the ideas they wanted us to believe in was all against our ideas  against our belief.
After the war my motherfirst of all  this was impossible to continue a religious way of life in Russia  in my time.
And then of course the World War II is World War war was there also  but this was a really traumatic thing for them.
And you want one more  the one you have at the end of the war.
I was part of the group of people who went through the war  some went through in hiding  be -- people in groups  some we re in hiding.
Mean  and so she would be tried for war crimes of course.
Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25  1998 24 The unfortunate thing is that after the World War II  which is now of course  in Germany [indecipherable]  it means war of distraction  because that was the whole purpose  more so than winning the war.
I said  \ In order to get me into the Army to go back to Germany  you have to declare war on Germany again and be losing.\
So when you -- when you s -- after the war  and the information is flowing more freely  were you -- Yes. --
The male teachers were a ll gone to war  and from then on its a whole different story  because we had to leave Volos.
Only in the beginning of the war  there was a -- what you call a razzia   and a -- a German -- German soldiers were going from door to door to find men to work in -- in Germany.
You were 3 years old when war came to Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941.
This man came through the war and this professor still and so forth. (
They all had to work in factories for the war machinery.
And I just simply did not have any fear at all because I felt that what I went through during the years of war and concentration camp  and especially prison  and after escaping  then I had nothing to be afraid of.
And he did a degree in glass technology which is an unusual subject  but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought his parents over to England becaus e they had  in fact  they lived in Krakoff and as the Germans marched in they marched out towards the Russian si de and eventually the Russians sent them right deep into Russia and although they had an awful war  there were no worse off than of the Russians because nobody had any food  so th ey were discriminated against where they were and they came back to Krakoff right after th e war  and then we brought them over to England and they always said they had been the happiest years of their lives.
The part of the Slovak Jewry which was -- was Orthodox but not very Orthodox .
It's war time and it we re sanctions also in the city but the Lithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in.
But I figured the war is closing and closing and I had enough and I wanted to be liberated.
>> Bill Benson: This is happening while Germany is losing the war.
As a matte r of fact  was a fat one named Vincent -- Vincent Cheni  who after the war was executed.
What what's the first thing you remember about World War II?
Mm  well I s -- feel that -- well  I have so me -- I got my cousin here in Kazakhstan  so I did not feel that it -- it will -- I -- I wanted this war will be ended because I -- Right.
Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of  and his name was Gorajetski.
I had finished fifth grade in Yugoslavia  and during the war like three years I hadn't gone to school  so five grades you don't retain very high education.
I mean  either they're all too or they're gone; I don't know what happened to them during the war.
I was when the war started  I was 12 years old.
We got to Stockholm at the end of the day  stay ed in a hotel which we called the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 16 conteenantalb  this is Hotel Continental  across from the railroad station  we got there late at night and my Uncle Charlie was there and we  we  we both remember this first meal that we had there because Holland was still pretty bare after the war  you certainly couldn't get a whole lot of e xotic food products and for us exotic was pretty well everything  like oranges  you know  were very exotic.
Right after the war began in September 1939  you were called before a tribunal and a notation was put in your record that said -- I'm going to read this -- \ The holder of this certificate is to be exempted from further order from internment and from the special restrictions applicable to enemy aliens under the aliens order.\
I wanted to go back for a minut e to the first declaration of war  when Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany and then is also attacked by the Soviet Union.
Butand then my father joined the American Army when the war broke out here  and disruption again.
So Hitler said  well  if you don't give it to me  I'll go to war.
The Germans and th e Poles  when the Germans invaded Poland?
My uncle  my mothers brother  also had come  in 1941 to visit his parents  and stayed  and actually joined the American army  and came to see us in Budapest after the war  part of the liberation.
As you know  we were refused admission in 1939  and at the end of the war it was very easy  the sympathy for -- for the victims of the -- now known as Holocaust was -- was very much -- was very acute.
Were any other -- did you stay in touc h with any other members of the underground that you associated with during the war?
He would say to my father  ﬁShe was so bad to me again.ﬂ ﬁSie war immer so schlecht zu mir.ﬂ She was absolutely wicked  and the ki -- my father said at one point to us children  and he had also made it known in Doorn that he would not even go take her for a wa -- go for a walk with her  because she is capable of jumping into the moat and tell the world I pushed her in.
just after school  10 12 ye ars old and when war came in  they had a middle class position and I was born in '29  th en I had a brother  a sister born in '31 and a brother born in '33.
So  this particular case  whenever they met a Jewish family  there were many Jewish families in this area here  especially poorer Jewish families because it was at that time before the war restrictive  not so  no quality housing  I would say to put it mildly.
And my father took some ve ry big risk because only one country on Europe during the war German sugges t if somebody hire Jewish be killed on spot  what happened thousand  thousand times.
So the Jews had to wear the Jewish stars  even children.
Did you Interview with Erika Eckstut January 16  2002 17have anything that happened to you during the war  any illness or accidents or any kinds of problems that presented you with an y health issues at the end of the war?
They said  ﬁYou know  we have a lot of feathers a nd down accumulated.ﬂ During the war years you didnt do any exporting.
And during the day  she stopped over somewhere on a farm  and only nights she walked until she -- by the time she reached the border from Poland to Germany  the war was practically over and she just walked across.
Uh  the first time that have seen German soldiers was when Germany was invading Poland  September 1st  1939.
It Its partly  you know  German anti-Semitism  Holocaust  but its not just a story of what somebody went through  but how it affected life and affected the families  and Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 204affected every-everything; how it changed things; how it showed I I I also noticed that in my own family  that my mother was the much more  somehow  resourceful person during the war than my father  who had a tremendous position before the war.
We didnt even know  for the time being we didnt know that there were concentration camps.
We need guys like you cause you never know about the Cold War.
I said uh  \ I'm glad that I learn a job for after the war.\
Eventually I had found out that this was a man who joined from 13 day one  which was very early at the beginning of the war the SS  and that he had become one of the favorites of Himler himself and that he ended up as a general in charge of intelligence of office four in charge of security and intelligence of the Security Head Office.
And then came a call to this room of disabled war vete rans where men and women slept together and the three of us slept on the top bunk bed and we stayed there also some time; a few months more and then we were sh ipped out again.
They said the war will soon be over and everybody will go home.
>> Bill Benson: The question is when did you find out really what your parents went through  and did they after the war talk about what they went through?
the...the radio announced that we better stay in the air raid shelter and we all...we slept the whole night during the four days of war  we slept in the air raid shelter.
Anyhow  coming home from the war  about -- mu st have been six  eight years later  I said to myself  Im going to Brooklyn to visit the fa mily.
What were conditions like at the time that the war ended?
Now  when the war started he had to leave the whole bank like that.
Tell me a little bit about your family before the war?
Eight years before the war we built...over there wasn't...wasn't...uh..that you can...uh...uh..for...for th at you can pay off...only you had to have money to build so they put together penny to penny to be able to build a new home because the children started to grow up.
And she had it in Kabutz-ya-no-ga-high   which was taken by the Egyptians in during the Independence War and they to ok the negatives from Ka-butz-ya-no-ga-high to Egypt and then they published in Egyptian papers during the six days war actually showing that there are lines of people for bread and water and Stars of David.
We do know that the people who are foremost in making that decision aside from the President himself  on the United States side  were John McCloy who was the --well he was really running the War Department under Stimson in that time period  and MacArthur of course had a voice in it as did Joseph Grew who had been our Ambassador in Tokyo.
Were you in hiding essentially for the rest of the war of how long?
Then we got orders to go south  directly south towards Nuremberg  and we put our headquarters at Grafenwohr  which was a major German training base then and  in fact  was used by the American army all during the cold war later.
She said well  after the war  maybe hell come back and -- Yeah.
Tomlinson who went down from Nuremberg to be one of the colonels in those trials  and they got orders from the Pent agon [that] we're ending War Crimes trials and so the presiding judge said \ The War Crim es trials are over  everybody go home\  and the trials were over and the criminals got up and wa lked out of the dock.
While Im at while Im at it  what what are your first memori es of your mother  as a little boy before the war?
All right  my mother  when I went into the Korean War  my mother eventually got rid of that catchers mitt.
September the 1st  when the war broke out  and my parents thought that if we move from Katowice to Krakow -- you know Krakow?
Right after the war we returned to Warsaw  my mother wanted to get that briefcase.
This is tape number one  side A. Okay  were picking up a little bit  on where we left off  the last time that we  that we sat together and  and did an interview  and– and you told me about  about your war time experiences  and some about afterwards  as well.
But look at another reason that I was not eager to get involved at the last gather ing last March was because I know from the work that Belle was doing that they were busy writi ng resolutions concerning the es tablishment of th e International Criminal Court at the Hague as well as Bosnia an d the apprehension of thos e war criminals  and so on and so forth.
And basically all the children in the school were Jewish kids.
I guess that if he knew that we were still around  maybe he would have had the strength to live through the war as well.
Before you leave Europe  is there anything else about the years after the war  while you were still in Europe that you would like to to cover  to talk about?
And when I called my aunt who is older than I am and she was in Germany and after the war  she stayed for a while.
Any family members who had emigrated before the war  or after World War I or before  to either United States   or to other parts of the world?
She was born after the war  and was her parents' only surviving child.
And he suggested prisoners of war in German and practically everyone they don't like  but would liked to have work for them but not propagate  so that they don't endanger the German stock.
They were destroyed.5 And they  uh... After the war  in 1947  Max came to Shanghai  where I lived.
And who was the third s -- you said there were three people survived -- And a -- -- the war.
No  we yeah  must have been in Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 53spring of 1941  because we were already there when the war broke out.
And he was the oldest one  so he went to World War I. He was in the Army.
>> Bill Benson: Were you ever able to learn what happened to your parents once you and your sister left?
I remember many things before  during the war and I dont remember anything after I was 12 or ten.
So I was very -- then -- then the -- the - the story with Israel this appears  that I didnt go to Israel  which I wanted.
Once again guided  escorted by train and finally through the Pyrenees and under the Pyrenees  the tunnels  and we got to Spain which was just shortly after the civil war had ended and I remember a very down-trodden  down-beat uh poor Spain.
And so we slowly but  slowly but surely many times  we the  the train had to stop and  and  and the Russian soldiers came and identification and  and they used to select some young  young people for  for the war effort  you know.
We had no idea what would face us because there were rumors fr om the east  that is eastern Europe  that the German Wehrmacht could be brutal as they were in the east  but in France  in the west of Europe  at this stage of the war  they weren't so brutal.
So we knew him  and it was nice nice people  but after the war I never I never heard from them  you know.
Of course  we shouldnt have a war which ther e is no purpose to it.
So he wou I I was we were living in Kovno at the time  or the the suburb of Kovno   called slub Sluborda .
This was when my recollection came about how the war ended for example  how I went to the principal asking him to keep me in school without paying  all those small things that I thought I've completely forgot  but most of all how much rage is there  buried deep.
We had the collapse of the stock market  [indecipherable] by World War One  and there were many pe ople without jobs  and many upheavals.
But before he started going to war  he decided to invite the English prime minister and the French prime minister to Munich without inviting the Czech government.
My father was as a Gentile in Lviv -- Lemberg  and my brother was there too  Oss Bridotsky  and an -- an -- on Irish paper  and I found them after a year and a half after the war  through friends.
He was one year older from me and and when the war broke broke out  th-the second war  theres janu September 1 st  1939  the Germany came in Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 7 Well get to that Yeah.
I always say it's a blessing that he died in 1939  because his wife  my grandmother -- [Inaudible] >> Bill Benson: After war broke out in September 1939  you left Paris for a second time  returned again to Paris.
And that is that when I sit down and analyze what happened to me in my life and what happened to my brother  although hes had a much more difficult life  that our lives were probably better in the long run  and more exciting  and more fulfilling because of those things that happened  than they would have been if nothing -- if there had been no war and we stayed in Vienna.
You know  I think its interesting  people dont necessarily think about how difficult it is after a war  what it means to clean up and repair and at the same time take care of individuals  so the picture is very graphic when you describe it this way  and you describe people sleeping in the streets because there were not enough beds.
He said  \ After the war \  he says  \ I have a farm.
That the Hebrew University was built on originally  and during the '48 war between Israel and Jordan -- Was lost to Jordan. --
No  even the universit they were ne after the war  you know   were still in displaced person camp  and the camps are moving  moved around.
What was school life like  from your earliest memories now  going back before the war.
>> Bill Benson: And do you know what their life was like in those years before the war?
It was only founded after World War I. And before that it was part of Hungary  third largest  Hungary.
And after the war  they came back to Kolbuszowa   becau se my mothers mother was in Kolbuszowa   and the father  too.
Well  the war comes in 1939  and youre in -- Colmar. --
I wanted you to to back up for just a minute and and tell me  during your time after the war  but before you came to the United States  in those years  did you follow the Nuremberg trials?
The beginning we were talking of every kind of socialism  democratic socialism  or radical socialism  theoretical things  and what we have to do after the war and what is the best way to become democratic  or undemocratic  many theoretical things.
After the war  a year later I was just shooting in my studio  and a detective came with somebody.
And there is corollary to that  that if the war is not over by this Christmas  then it surely will be over next Christmas.
You know  they they tried very hard to to provide the pe food for the people  but the war was raging  and I guess the the front got the first aspect of it  you know.
He had fought in World War I. He had gotten an Iron Cross  second class  for a an incident that occurred on the on the trenches.
S-Sc-School was started over in 1939  w-we just started to school when the war started.
Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 30 Were you in Lodz when the war started or were you We were in the country but we had to go to Lodz back and my parents were in Stree or some place   I dont remember the city.
There was a lot of hatred  and I didn't want to survive the war and then something happen to me.
He married in 42  43– But during the war  he married?
H e said   when we met him after the war  that the torture was not that bad .
Can you tell me about your earl y days in school during the war?
>> Bill Benson: And likely  as you just said  the last one that took place during the war.
And we always thought  during the war  that nothing would happen to my parents because we 52 thought our friends  our neighbors would take care of them.
And  so my parents decided that they would establish the fact that they survived  and claim Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 138property in Vienna that they had before the war.
That was Did you feel this That always gives a always was after the war.
They were my father's brother and his wife and two daughters and my mother's two sisters.
So thats early in the war  when they capture the Soviets.
And I couldnt wait to come home  but it took a long time  because the war was still going on.
After seeing Buchenwald  after seeing the concentration camp  did it change your attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?
What -- wh-wh-what was it like for you when war broke out again in the 90s?
Having been a history teacher before the war started  I was selected to do that.
Before the war  I went to school  which was a public school  but there were very few Jewish kids in our class of 55 kids  there were about six Jewish kids.
It's...uh...my friends that were killed during the war and....uh...even some of the what I saw in Europe with the dispersed persons and...uh... Later on in Israel  if I may add that too  as I became a tourist driver guide  there was a kibbutz by the name of .
I spent my childhood in a little place north of Vienna which became a part of Czechoslovakia after the 1st World War.
And the city was vibrant  but it was first really emerging from the horror of war  which you could see.
They didnt look back to World War II and what happened then.
And I did this gradually  I mean from -- during the war  everything was permitted  but then I did th is gradually.
And was a cra and I said Im never again going to know any language  Ive seen enough of it and I-I-I-I d-dont mean to interrupt  but I wanted to ask you  you were in Germany for five a-almost five years after the war.
Well  that was -- that was immediatel y after the war  you had refugee camps.
He heard the story what had happened in our town  after we got through the war  after we got survived  and why did they do it no w to us?
When she got an extra piece of bread she would leave me some.
Not all the teachers were Jewish  not all the professors as we called them.
So he knew that we were going to be safe because  you know  Hitler wasn't at war with France at that time.
Because of we've seen...they took us  and then they told us  \ We're going to kill you even if you loose the war  or we win the war.
So  in 1942 that's still your there's three more years of war left?
Yet for him it was very important to give as many things as we could in order to make us feel that yes we live a normal life  and we are human beings  and we are just like all the other girls after the war.
Well  tell us what that lesson with the Russians was  when the Russians had come The Russian was when everyb ee you see  to me  it was the first occupation  the first army  the first war in my but to the parents  it was the second  at least their second.
And after the war  the father came   the first one back   and stayed with us.
I didnt have that  and I was alive  and I was -- I was with a family  a nd I guess I was hidden  but -- so -- and -- and I remember the first time  the very first time that I saw any movie that related to anything having to do with the war.
And when I resumed school  which was one year later because it was also the -- the pogrom and the massacres started  the war started  a nd I lost a si -- a year  I went on the last to the improvised school to finish my education.
And a year before then  Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany .
She invite me to her mother always - Her husband got killed in the war - to eat over there.
We had used this type of freight train in World War I  and we called them 40 and 8s.
They didnt want to go back after the war because there were the bi ggest pogroms in Kiev and they didnt want to go back there.
I think the American Consul and even the Am erican Embassy uh were not re-established in Holland after the war.
I dont know  because he did not know me before  you know  but sh he knew he told me  Mother  you are talking too much about about the war  and about what you experienced.
No  except a sense of desolati on when I see the way we seem to have -- still use war as a method of settling -- maybe that also has an argument in the fact that the third -- the Second World War didn't solve problems.
I became  actually I became very quickly a radio announcer  a sportscaster  learned enough about sports and met enough athletes to ha te sports and went in to disc jockey and then into television and then by accident in 1956  standing on the corner of 69th Street and Ma dison Avenue  I met my company commander from Wo rld War 2 and he said to me  \ Wha t are you doing?\
So one war brings about another war  so to bring about peace you see  that's actu ally what our intent is  the intent.
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 18 You know  war Warsaw was actually like an international sort of a metropoly   and we had the majority Poles  okay  that was about 800 000 Poles at that time  and 400 000 were Jews.
I can -- wards were never full  whether they shipped them back out faster -- like I said  the war was waning down and they could get them moved out further -- they wanted to get them to general hospitals as soon as they coul d. And then back home.
I decided the deferment was well and good  but I didn't feel I was contributing to the war  during the Korean War.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 >> Bill Benson: You would later  of course  go into the US Army and find yourself back in Europe.
In other words  even the ones who converted were considered Jews.
We will work for the war effort but we will be treated well.

You said that you  that wh en you came from Kobe it was after '41 and the war had started . . .
We discover our good friend who's  her parents  my parents were friends when they were single yet  came from Sweden  she survived the war in Russia.
And then after the war  my parents had two more children.
The war is over  why don't you let those poor guys back home and run away somewhere?
71 When you met them  did they ask you about your experiences during the war?
You were not quite 6  I think  when D -Day occurred  and you were 6 1/2 when the war itself was over.
Anyhow  she felt that after surviving the war  there was really nothing for in Brazil .
And the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners  German prisoners.
Nobody never heard of -- I mean  never heard because we didnt bother  but we never heard of many -- during the war you didnt hear of people anyway  because foreign countries  you know  they were occupied countries.
Maybe you can tell me very briefly how you -- you know  what you did after the May 1945 end of the war.
And that's how it changed  and we had this call right after that because they were  no  the war started last fa  five days--Rotterdam was bombed  and 5 days later we surrendered  and the refu--suicides began.
Before we turn to life under the Nazis and your family leaving Germany  let's start first  tell us a little bit about your family and you in the years before Hitler came to power.
And then he realized that there must be German prisoners of war on there.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 I said  What do I want to do?

>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: Do you remember the invasion when that happened of Siauliai  because of that course -- >> Nesse Godin: That I remember very well  because one day my parents said  especially mama  she says  You know  we think we have a war coming.
I remember it was not very good but it was still better than the dark bread that we had during the war.
And a-after the war only who survive it was my mother and her sister.
This was from western border in Poland and they came to our to wn and they opened a little store in our town in the beginning of the war  and became very fr iendly.
Let's start first with you telling us what your life was like  what your community was like in those years leading up to the beginning of World War II with the invasion of Poland in September 1939.
We were attached to the 20th Corps of the 3rd Army--which was [Gen. George S.] Patton's Army  and at that time it was very close to the breakthrough by the 3rd Army forces and we we usually during the war attached to an armored division and they were the ones that moved the fastest.
I opened the door  uh  and I saw those 3 Germans  one in the green uniform of the German SS  and the other one  uh the  the 2 other ones in black uniforms of the so-called Volksdeutshen  which were the local Germans who sympathized with Hitle r before the war  and they were traitors to Poland  and when Germans uh occupied Poland  th ey all joined uh  uh  uh the German army or whatever unit they wanted  and the German in the green uniform said  \ You are arrested on political grounds  puts uh together  a few warm clot hes  and all the valuables  your jewelry  your money  put on the table.\  (
And my father remembered the Germans Austro-German from World War I. Then the next day  or days later  he took a wa gon with horses  and he put this all  everything of of ours on the wagon  and we head to the Russian border.
The living conditions in the ghetto were a hundred times better than the prisoners of war.
On one hand  I understood why  because I was contemplating doing some thing like this shortly after the war.
I remember that  pretty much to the end of the war too.
Cough) Another thing...a thing happened to me which is one of those incidents that uh that reoccurred over and over during the war where something happened over which I had really no control or or when it happened I had really no way to project what it will lead to that allowed me  that that that saved my life and gave me an opportunity to continue  you know  with my struggle to survive.
When another war should come and try to kill everybody  just because they are a race.
So this was your business after the war  here in the United States .
And uh... So then we... Oh  and then in the meantime  my youngest sister  Margot  was seeing a young man--a soldier  American soldier--who uh... In fact  he or iginally was born in the city of Auschwitz [Pol: Oswicim] in Poland when he was a young child  and came to America way before the war when he was 8 years old.
And this is also an interesting story how coded documents which have not been found  you know  tells the stor y how he was arrested -- no  first of all  how the foreign office in Moscow according to instructions which all foreign offices in the world were following; namely  the Swedish government had before the war  before this happened in Hungary  given a list to the foreign office with all our names.
He had two sisters in United States from before the war.
They used to be participating in Spanish civil war  and they were -- but of course involved from the very beginning was created by Hitler for communists  German communists and communists from all over the area from the European scene.
Only after the war wh en the concentration camp came back.
They were the people I became friendly with eventually  were actually children of Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 160people from Europe  not necessarily survivors  beca use I didnt know that many  but people who went to Brazil in 1940 or 1939  who got out  were able to leave Europe before the war  and came there and lived extremely well.
I went to school  for example  in 1940  enrolled in a Jewish elementary school.
Uh our parents saw to it that we had a good education and though uh we we longed...belonged to a called...would ca ll it here to the middle families  uh and things were tough in economical terms uh after the war  during the inflation and later the Depression  but uh as I say our parents saw to it that we had a solid education  a solid uh general education and also a solid Jewish education  so we all...my sister a nd I  we went to a to a to a upper elementary schools to high schools.
The moth er took in laundry for people before the war.
FEDER: But it's also true that of the large number of refugees at th e end of the war  maybe 10 000  the vast majority  the vast majority were repatriated.
And -- but w-what she told -- and the story what she told my -- my son  why he became so [indecipherable] were Jewish life in the -- and the story which she told me about how they lived before the war  they were happy.
And then in 1938  '39 or '40  unfortunately the war broke out and everything became like turmoil  with the bombardments of small towns and some children started to come into our orphanage.
Even when the United States won the war on an unconditional surrender  it couldnt force upon Germany all that it may have set out to force upon Germany  and then think of -- any agreement is a compromise.
If you're working at a municipal or a federal office that register s people to leave the country  and now you have have a German occupation  a Nazi occupation  and it's war time and pe ople are no longer allowed to leave the country  what happens to that office?
The Pogrom in 1946  Kielce  after the war was over  ok  some Jews came back from concentration camps  from hiding.
After the war my mother died -- [An internet crash occurred.
And  in fact  most people Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 13felt it would blow over and wouldnt last  pa rticularly my mothers parents  who had celebrated the hundredth anniversary of a wholesale leather business with a tannery in 1933  and survived in very good shape through the hunger of World War I  when they could always barter leather for food at the local -- from the local farmers.
Well  when I -- no  when I joined the army -- when I went  and I volunteered  I alre -- I took back my own identity  and I took my own identity as Naftali Salishitz  where I figured the war is ended  thats it.
And because  you know  it was after war  you know  lack of money and this and that.
And in 1942  he was stationed right there  there was a camp just for war prisoners.
You see we did not know whether the war was ending  where the positions of the armies were.
Then the war broke out [indecipherable] in 41  and the Jews were told  we were told that we would be evacuated and we had to be ready within 48 hours and we could only take whatever we could carry with us  whatever was on our backs and in a little knapsack.
And I still insist today that actually the real winner of war were the Russians.
And at this period of time  just as the war was ending  were you able to communicate correspond at all to your brot hers who were in the Jewish brigade?
So was a way to  to find more and more information what you want and to help and she  we gave to her to keep books and to give some other written material which were uh some leaflets for example I remember was at one point against the Germans  against the war.
Yes  we had an apartment  and I even saw that apartment after the war  when we visited Poland   and I remember the address  it was the Slovaski Street  house number 14 on the second floor.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your sister  what did he do?
They brought in Jews and Poles too  and they worked there for a certain time.
Indeed  my parents had no concerns being in Ho lland  Holland was a neutral and nobody expected that they would be involved or be come involved in a war.
As the war -- o-or as Hitlers power progressed  more and more Jewish boys and girls who origina lly went to non-Jewish schools in Germany were expelled from those schools  a nd wer -- had to come to our school  they were a year or two behind us.

He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsbuttel  which late r became a concentration camp  and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home a briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks  but Poland lost the war for all intents and purposes within two weeks.
Can you tell me a little bit about Kore tz that you remember before the war?
We knew one thing  that Hitler will not give up Czechoslovakia unless there is a war  we wanted that war.
And h e was also in the Afghanistan as a prisoner in the – in the First World War.
I mean there are psychological dimensions to all of this that I dont even know if they re important to speak about whether this is pure quote unquote history or -- there are people who to this day suffer because of what happened to them during the wa r. There are others like myself who have problems because of what happened right after the war because denial was the order of the day.
And two were living here in the United States very before the war started.
And my father was still allowed to join the army there  because it was after the war.

And what happened between the end of the war and '57?
inaudible] Well [indecipherable] In -- in the -- in the 1950s  the Cold War  during that period  did you agree with the sentiments there  with the strong feel of -- of Communism   and everything  or did you have -- No  I didnt -- I didnt feel commits -- you see  I lived under Communism.
And if he lived through the war  he wou ld come and get us after the war was over.
The Germans uh had...I guess there was some sort of an organization that was uh formed from the Jews or appointed as a leader of the Jews and the the intermediary between the German command and the Jewish community where the Jewish community was taxed because I remember having to give up some valuables to help with the war effort.
>> Bill Benson: You and your family existed under those circumstances.

Had she left for Russia In 1939 in August  just before the war.
So at that time people were running away from the war.
They were hoping  the Germans  that the war would take such a long time  or that they will be enslaving us for such a duration of time  or just this is the way of the Germans to educate all the time  it was amazing.
And of course eventually  everyone was killed anyway  but this was one of the terrible things that went on as the war progressed and as the war against the Jews progressed.
Did -- Did you make a conscious decisi on after the war to not talk about it?
And in all of the DP camps in which Jews lived after the war  they lived together  surrounded by a fence  whose perimeter was often patrolled by Jewish police.

I can only tell you that the war ended and my mother fell apart.
Now  I graduated in January of 43 because of the -- the war  they accelerated certain [indecipherable] so we had two graduations  one in January and one in June.
Well  the only thing we knew in 44 really  during the war years Israel did not know...or I did not know...I don't know whether the powers to be in Israel knew very much  but we were very concerned in Israel about our own survival.
But where was his wife and child during the war? ‚
We were almost at the end of it  almost at the end of it– So in September 1939 German troops marched into– September 1939 was their original–Oh  youre talking about– Yeah  thats what I was refe rring to  when war broke out.

They built a house  which was very rare  but he was given a place  and sh -- they were -- they built a house  they had two girls  which I ch -- consider myself much older than they are  th ey were born after the war.
Later on matter of fact  I think when the German war machine was slowing down and they called up some of the German prisoners  the German prisoners were called up to the German Army and they apparently formed some special units.

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 >> Bill Benson: With your sister.
But before the war  where I was raised in a house  I never heard of this non kosher things  or to do something on Saturdays.
He had two sons that went to Russia when the war broke out and they eventually joined the unders army and went through to Herron and Palestine.
At that time  OSE  the war years  their mission was to -- Jewish organizations to save Jewish kids.
But if there was a private individual in Germany  who had a bank account in New York  th at bank account could not be taken by the United States government and used for reparation payments or war claim payments in the United States.
We met  my new wife and we traveled to London where my parents were and my uncle said something about  I guess we were watching the news and he said you know there might be war or something.
But what I remember from the second apartment that we lived is the war started  there was no school for Jewish children  none whatsoever.
As a matter of fact  after the war I went back and never find the Goddamn stuff back.
So thats for that  he -- Was it terrible for you to be in Bergen-Belsen for three years af ter the war  or wasnt it so bad?
Germany and the Soviet Union attacked Poland in September 1939 beginning World War II.
and took those and after the war returned them to us.
So -- well  they were saying that farm is for sale  a farm  but the house is very bad condition because that woman died and that house was just standing there  and the son  he was in a -- in a war  and he came back and he promis ed God he gonna go for a minister  and he did.
After the war  a lot people got married yes  because you know  life was  people were lonesome.
But she said  Mr. Menn  go back because the war is coming.
Interviewer: And you did th is until the end of the war?
Did she do much talking about what she went through during the war  and before the war?
After the war  about 1945  1940 si 1946  I left the Yeshiva in Baltimore  the [indecipherable] Yeshiva Rabbinical college  I left them.
And the Soviets took themselves part of Eastern Poland for themselves  which was part of Ukraine at the time.
He was able to get out and meet his wife in Marseilles -- she had been going all the way through -- from Belgium  all the way to the south of France  they were able to escape to Cuba and spend the war in Cuba.
The Russian prisoners of war were marched -- that's what she told me  to the town and even when some of the non-Jewish -- well  the Jewish population couldn't but the non -Jewish population would offer them water  they would hit them with the rifle butts and would n ot let them accept the water.
And in 1950 then decided to go to Stanford University in order to I wanted to to do some research on the Grynszpan case and the Hoover Library of War and Peace had the best materials.
Let me ask you so -- clearly  youre -- youve had a great deal of success with -- with your undertakings in -- in life  and -- and I think thats not a -- many Holocaust survivors have been very successful after the war.
Uh his younger brother had fallen for Germany eighteen days before the end of Wo rld War I. He's buried somewhere in France.
It killed my feet and one of the first things that I did after the war I mean when we were walking  we were walking from Malchow for eight days  and finally somewhere in German farmhouse I found a pair of shoes and this was the first thing that I threw away.
Our  my  my mother  because she came from a very wealthy family had  had  wed lived Anita Frank 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 in this house and my mother had all these gorgeous things which were all mostly taken away  also by Dutch people who didnt r eturn them to us after the war.
And -- and by that time I have seen enough also what has been done economically and so we talked about in the -- in -- in -- in war crimes  etcete ra.
So it wasnt until I came back in December of 45 that I began to realize  began to hear and know of what took place in the years  the closing years of World War II Did you rethink at all about your partic ipation in 1936/ I mean when you started learning much more  did it make you think about it all in context?
Thats the only thing I can say  stay away from war.
But still   from my grandmother  she had another sister and she went to Israel.
The owner of the store was uh was Jewish family and they was very very friendly with my my brothers  so so they was live only one block and uh almost like uh live together  you know  until war start.
And this led to the Munich gathering  which -- in which France and Germany agreed -- France and England agreed that Hitler could go into -- could annex the Sudetenland without Fr ance and England going to war.
When the war was over we just said  I told the pastor I think we are liberated.
Im looking at some so-called criminal elements in the German army  and enabling them even to come to the United States on behalf of the mo -- of defending democracy for a greater cause which might prevail over the presumed war cr iminal tha -- d-during th -- This -- and they al -- they allowed -- they allowed -- -- mind [indecipherable] -- inveterate Nazis to come in  so -- -- you see.
I didn't learn until after the war that they had strict orders not to put the fire out until the fire threatened the adjoining bui ldings.
When the war was over and it all came out what happened to the Jews and the camps and stuff  you were beginning to be a youn g adult at that time.
But at least I have the knowledge of knowing that my father was in the military fighting against the Germans.
So because of that in the end  when the war came  the Germans demanded from this general that the ambassador  the German ambassador to Romania that they collect the Jews from the little towns  push th em in the other centers so they will be there available for them to take until then.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 106 Yeah  yeah .
87 And -- and my sister  who was trying to run around and -- and take care of the bureaucracy stuff while I was in the hospital  and getting pass ports  and papers signed  and so forth  broke out into the -- first of all  she had terrible  terrible stomach problems right afte r the war  and Im sure that they had to do with -- well  Im not sure  bu t I think they had to do with all this suppressed anxiety and fear  and trying to walk this delicate line between things.
That was -- after the war  I went to see that woman   because I was still a kid and I didn't understand.
Well   it so happens  although this was a criminal act -- the commander of the crew was eventually court martialed after the war.
Well  the ranger -- my rangers are completely -- we're still at war.
I don't have really too much time to tell you why not  but bottom line is  to make it very short  the reason we were not sent to a gas chamber is because my father was a veteran of World War I. Don't ask me where the Nazis got that honor code that they suddenly honored refugee -- I mean Jews who were veterans of the war b ut they did.
When -- when life was so hard for you during the war  and when she reached that age  did that trigger anything for you  when you would look at her and think what were you doing when you were her age?
Whatever it was group he was talking to as a speaker  a good one  and he was a I think he was a lawyer for the war too.
They brought us to Ha dara  and they wanted we should go to war  you know.
>> Bill Benson: We're going to  I think  close out now.
And I think we knew that the war is going bad for the Germans.
The war was not ove r. They put us on a jeep.
We were  I sensed that my parents were very disappointed  because  apparently  our papers were almost ready for our immigration to the United States I remember  I'm not quite sure  but I think it was in 1938  that we all traveled to Warsaw for 9 interviews  and I guess we went to the Consulate  you know  getting ready to immigrate to America  but  of course  the war interrupted all that.
I immediately presumed that he said that to make her understand that if she does this  if she takes the risk  that she would be rewarded for it  after the war.
>> Bill Benson: What did Israel mean to you after World War II?
And we must confess  those people who were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 41 in the camps  those people who were in the partisans  they were the front lines  who immediately joined from those illegal ships  when the war broke out in Israel  be that it was not fully recognizable  but in 1948  when Israel got status as a state of Israel  at that particular time  you saw yesterdays camp inmates  yesterdays people who came from hiding  or they were fighting in the partisans.
This was this was Soviet Germans  not German prisoners of war.
I think  for me  the war might have been like thunder in the background.
Did you talk with Sandy about your experiences during the war?
The Lithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years.
When I was 11 years old and when we start second war  they they have problem because they wanted to have mo-model for the German people  for the army  to to make for them for me it was I was not interested in th in this problem  for I was too young.
But I do not feel  frankly  that I have a copyright on either the 1930s or the war  and that if someone else would like to do this  they are welcome.
And already on the 30th of January 39  before the war broke out  he threatened the Jews  whom he accused to want to push for the war  and he threatened them th at if -- one thing is certain  he said.
So from war to war  and the again  I think that I was on my own.
Now  we had heard since there were women from the Baltic sea among us th at women from th e eastern state would be sent home because the war there us over alre ady  but the German Jews would be shipped off to Siberia because they didn't really the German Jews and  you know  these soldie rs must have notified the Russian authorities  so 24 they were constantly after us.
So  when youre finally the war does end  had you had any knowledge or contact of what what it is that that yo u eventually saw  or was the were these flights that took place Im no Im not phrasing this correctly.
What did it mean  did you know then that they had been sent to Auschwitz?
But after the war they told me that the man who owned the shelter had told my neighbor that he didn't like this Jewish girl in his shelter anymore and they never told me that until after the war of course  but my step-parents were a little worried because if word was going around that I was Jewish the Germans would come.
And what was your first impression of Germany when you got there?
Do you feel that the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?
Even when the Germans came in  we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit  but they closed in every time  there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 3 account of the Holocaust.
After a remarkable year in Panama   David went to Israel as a soldier in the War of Independence.
I can tell you my self not killing him from time to time when I had the opportunity  but I had two other people in the jeep and war or not war you just don't kill people who surrendered  so that's the story of Julius Streicher.
There was a Russian prisoner of war camp before we came there.
My parents slept this was a the office of a cousin of my fathers  and he this cousin had imports of watches  he was an importer of watches from Switzerland  and before the war.
Well after World War   we did have American occupation troops in Luxembourg because the Un ited States -- the Americans had liberated Luxembourg from four years of occupation by th e Germans.
He was recommended by Mr. Russik  who knew him from before the war.
And when I was about three and a half years old  you know  the war started  you know  and the German occupation of Poland began.
And in -- in Germany after the war  a Catholic priest  a good friend of my told me he knew  and -- and everybody knew this is not the case  but this was the cause the church used.
The Lodz ghetto was one of those that existed the longest during the war and it was run by Hiram Kofsky .
And there was in charge  he was a Polack  not a Ukrainian  of our  he was the engineer of the whole project  and one day I noticed that his  he had a girlfriend  which lived in our city  and I knew before the war  very beautiful nice girl  and I used  when she saw me in town  she would say hello  and ask me if I need something  and we became  not friends because  who am I to be a friend to her  but just  like  acquaintances  let's put it this way  and then  from there  from this place  they took us to Stafnovushulke.
After the war we knew he was alive because my mother got a Red Cross telegram.
When did it sink in for you actually  the magnitude of what had happened during the Holocaust?
So we had this feeling -- this sense  you know  that bad things were happening to Jews there.
But he and then one very bad day  he passed away and my brother  the oldest one  which unfortunately died in the first World War  took fa ther's part.
And he picked up what happened  historically there  in the war or so  you know  with -- so that were cooperative effort.
Thats what Im saying  they had some teacher s  I guess  who were  before the war who were teachers.
I have in our mill  when we went into the ghetto  for seven months or for a year  I worked on a farm five miles from our home  early befo re the war.
The -- the Vietnam war was affecting my friends  and I didn't see it as a corollary to World War .
As you well know  war broke out on  on the first of September uh  uh Germany said that they declared war.
How much information were you getting about what was happening in the war?
Because he happened to be dur ing the First World War and the Germans were in Poland too  they came there.
When I wa when when when the German pulled they put the bombers outside already  we went out no more  and we went out in after a war  like  people  young people  children  and with blonde hair  they mostly blonde there.
Did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews?
Uh...one a pilot and another a...uh...a military man who fought in the Warsaw uprising and died after the war because he was an invalid  wounded  persecuted by the communists in turn.
Speaking Non -English Language]  Major Philip  his war name  and they give the date.
did you and after having served in combat did your attitudes about the war change at all?
He was slightly wounded and was taken prisoner of war in Germany.
Did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe ?
And a friend of mine from Czechoslovakia wh o was not in the camp  I think she came to th e United States before the war  no  maybe after the war  but I didn't ha ve the details really  but she was not imprisoned during the camps  and she said that there has been a law passed that all the former inmates and survivors and so on can get restitution.
When I saw them  well  they were prisoners who hadnt been fed who worked for the German war machine and given  not even  minimal rations.
And so we had we had to s oh  wed become more informed about what had happened to our families that during the war.
Then you -- of course the war had meanwhile broken out.
So I never understood that he predicted that theyre gonna lose the war  this this ger this German  the big German officer  he predicted like  theyre gonna lose the war.
Im wondering if -- if your experiences  and -- and the things that you went through after the war  the depravation that you experienced  and -- and the danger that you put yourself in to help save people and yourself.
First of all  the war  you know  the some of the things  the commerce became affected.
And he made a very emotional and very memorable speech at that meeting  and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in Bergen-Belsen  where his parents ended up at the end of the war.
And the period in between the French called the Phoney War because it was a war without figh ting.
Can we talk a little bit now about your feelings and reflections after the war?
About Germans  war and  and when walked  some boy -- Jewish boy -- maybe 10 years of age  and the other boy was not a Jew  and the other boy start to a little yell at this Jewish boy.
And  oh   ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 the rifles came up right away.
He was very active in  in the Jewish community and he was before the war very well respected.
The Vietnam war after all  was only a decade earlier  not to mention the McCarthy period here.
As the war is coming closer to an end  how do things change for you  or do they?
And -- and thats why that time when Stalin met Churchill   he says to him  ﬁYou know ﬂ he said  ﬁyou cannot win this war.ﬂ He says  ﬁYou always tell youre going to attack when you dont do anything.ﬂ He says  ﬁIf you want to win a war  you have to go into combat with the enemy  otherwise you ca nt win the war.ﬂ And he was right.
There uh in 1917 my brother was born and in 1918 when the war ended  we came back to our town.
I wanted not to hear it this way  but...so we get a little breathe  a little better feeling and even we began to very optimist  very...that the war must be finished.
So you were very directly involved in production for the war?
When we came back  afte r the war  we were the people that didnt exist.
As they were still thinking in the terms of 1930s when the Spanish Civil War -- as a war of where the classes sort of got mixed in.
And other interesting thing I guess  now talking with you it's in my mind  a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the land  and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some land or farm  two  three  four  five miles from the cities  they come everyday in the city to market.
They managed to get to England in the late 1930s before the war started.
He survived the war and lives in Haifa no w. I spoke to him during my visit to Israel this past October.
The total Jewish community of Yugoslavia before the war was about 70 000.
I didnt live with with with my father and my parents during the war.
So during this period before the war  between -- before the war comes to the Netherlands  between 35 and 40  what is your memory of that household?
She took us and we were hiding in the barn and we would have survived the war there  but Simon Pollack ran out of cash.
And  uh  till of course the war came and that's another story.
It wasn't popular in those days  post World War I  to teach German because of the World War I situation.
INTERVIEWER: Let me just stop you a second because I want to hear about all of that in your single interview  but let's just talk about the period right after the war -- MR.
At the time even though Hungary was in war  the government was a democratic government.
There was a German interpreter whose English was more fluent than mine.
We went on that plane as all Greeks from the war.
So -- but now  after the war  n -- everything what has to do with the connection  with -- with the -- with the God  we let it go a little bit  because we each were asking a question  and we dont have answers.
So  after the war  when we were liberated  and my father had come to my ho use where I was hidden  he -- he took me along up north  where he had been living all that time  because we really didnt know what we were going to do.
Well  after the war at one time I read in the paper that somebody is looking for me  that the the.... It was to the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that \ Boxer.\
In  after the war  those Barbara Farkas 36 December 9  1995 students who lost years because of the fascist  I mean they lost it because they were Jew or they were political persecuted  came out a law by the name Boy tech Law  who give the right to these students to don't give a admission exam to be  to enter in the  at the university  not giving that exam  without that exam.
And this German -- ex-German corporal  I think he was  who was a regular prisoner of war  worked in the kitchen  served -- came in.
You matured after the war  you were a kid before that?
How did it feel to be in Germany  and -- and presumably dealing with Germans  after what you had been through?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 88 Did you feel that anti-Semitism was very strong after the war  or?
Sh e felt that its very important  we have to have it after war.
>> Bill Benson: Soon after she came back and you were reunited she would take you and move back into what had been her home in June of 1945.
Now from the 47 six  two from my people before the war  they were Rabbinical students and they were very nice boys and they were very capable  went back to our town  to Kolbuszowa  because they said we are now free.
What are your thoughts about the  has the world learned anything from the Holocaust.
In our family as it happened in many families after the war when there were hidden parents and hidden children the main story in the family was that the parents were hidden and survived the war.
But if I talk about Sweden  I think we could have sort of brou ght out this to the public in  say  in 1943  when yo u could see that the war is not going to be won by the Germans  and after Stalingrad and all th at and so on.
Did you become more religious because of your experience during the war  or less religious or the same?
After the war  when it's over  we'll come and marry you and I give you my word as a prisoner of the of the of the English uh soldier that I will never forget you and so so that was that was that was uh uh with them and and I must say this this helped uh tremendously  because it it kept us ...at least kept me...I couldn't communicate with everybody in the camp but with the close circle of friends I had  what we had heard and what what what the progress were and one one of the most was...emotional days was when first uh there came the news...you must remember that by e rror a girl had played around with a telegraph in London and the the news had gone out that th e Allies had landed in Normandy  and then it turned out it was a hoax  but on the day when they did land  uh somehow there was an electrifying atmosphere in Auschwitz and the Germans became very nervous  and I immediately went to my friends and said what what uh happe ned.
I mean  he just survived a war  and now he had to go to the army  did you talk about that?
It doesn t do anything to fight the Germans– er– to help the Germans to fight the war.
Was it influenced by the fact that the war had started?
And those papers  that I ha remember one of the most frightening moments of my war was that my mother told us that from now on my name  or for me  and my brother too  my name was  since I was always called Ria  that my name was Maria  and the last name was Wolinsky.
When you met them  did they ask you about your experiences during the war?
And did he know that you were a prisoner of war?
And after the 14 war his best life was for him when he was in Israel.
One thing I didn't stress much but one of the problems in Yugoslavia that was different from elsewhere during the war  the Serbs were persecuted in the camps.
But before the war  before 39 and before 41 when it really affects you strongly  do you hear about the Nazis?
Well  you know  as they were growing older  they heard about it  and then I would occasionally tell them  ﬁListen  I was in Europe and there was a war and this is what USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 80 happened ﬂ -- you know  happened here and there  but I didnt really go into details.
The war was still going on and we settled wa -- in Bialystok because Bialystok was already liberated  and Bialystok was assigned the temporary capital of Poland.
Well  now  that's part of... [inaudible] Well  the war finally came to an end.
And unfortunately for him  after the war ende d  he went to the eastern zone of Berlin  maybe he was sympathetic with the new move ment.
The barracks and tents  where the war industrial production was taking place was all taken down.
Was a good teacher and I was in that school  you know  to to the war.
We kept in touch after the war for a little while but not that much.
So they shipped him back to Germany  and thats when he came back.
This is after I recovered  after the war  I believe in  late in '46.
Did you have much information about what was happening in Germany with Hitler...before the war?
He  you know  actually you know  he won the equivalent of the Medal of Honor twice in World War II World War I  and fairly well educated  and and  you know  was one of the members of that 20 group who was more upper middle class than most of the people there  and he had this commanding  almost charismatic  personality that you knew who the most powerful guy in that room was.
We make d signs that they wasn't aliv e. To come to in one place  after the war.
Did you talk to any friends or family about your experiences in the war?
The badge that you see was given to all members of Jewish Relief Units who volunteered to go overseas during and after the war.
When you went back to Vienna -- what was it  seven  eight years ago you said -- Yeah. --
And after that   they said to themselves  \ Never  we are not going to be active any longer in this war.\
Then to eastern Nigeria for two years  which at that point was on the verge of becoming Biafra   just before the civil war.
By this time it was April and we said oh well  if the war expands  maybe well never get out.
Lets talk then about the work th at you did once you came back to London after the war.
When you when you  after the war  had Josy back  did you feel like you were distant from her  or were you I dont think so.
Interview with Doriane Kurz May 13  1997 Well  I'm Dorian Kurz and I came to this country in 1946  after the war  with my brother  we were orphaned during the war and we were brought over here to America by family that was living here and the first part of my history was recorded by the Holocaust Museum a few years ago.
We wondered  you know  how theyd made it through the war  but they were in the Soviet Union during the war.
But because many clerk were away in the war  it was a terrible war.
And by June of 1943 I was thinking  gee  I'm here on a training base and there's action elsewhere  and if I don't get out of here  the war might be over.
Im speaking of some remains of the skilled Jews that were used for the war machine  that were separated from the rest of the Jews in in Shufka   and these were the Hungarian Jews that were kept.
And so many had lost somebody in the First World War.
By that time  the war was over  when we picked the potatoes  so it wa else  was just about ending.
My father -- My father realized  you know  that it was dangerous for the men to be in the house because they were collecting men to bring them to the war zone for labor.
The two little ones  here it is  you know  close to a year after the war  and the quietness wherever they were that was droned into them  hasn't yet enabled them to blossom out.
Not a big ship  but there was a quite a few people there and they were throwing slices of bread to their relatives  so th-they -- th-the situation -- the [indecipherable] situation apparently was very bad after the war.
And the little boy  43 Herman  that was my so-called foster brother  he was the first German student to enter the United States after the war.
They were thinking that it was a war like in 1914  '18 and not for 1940.
And coming back to our town and founding  finding the town unscathed basically - so that was the first memory of the war.
>> Bill Benson: I wish that we had a lot more time because Bob obviously told us only a little bit about what happened over the course of all of those years  but then Bob ends up in the United States Army and eventually he goes back to Germany and he ends up interrogating German prisoners of war and ex -former Nazis ; a lot to be said about that as he worked for our intelligence service for a good number of years after that.
But they said the Germans did it  but it really was the Russians.
I reunited with her after the war  when we were liberated.
Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 13 What was your awareness in  before the war started  what was your awareness of what was happening to the Jews  lets say  in Germany under Hitler?
They got their papers but they couldnt leav e because it begin the war and it stopped everything.
And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother  who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship w ith my fathers brother  is after World War   when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother  they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo  who obviously had a very good military record  and said  ﬁWhy dont you come back into the German army?ﬂ And he said  ﬁWell  you know  Im Jewish.ﬂ And - and apparently they said to him  ﬁWell  w hy dont you just say youre Christian  it wont any difference ﬂ and -- and left it.
Do you think about the war years a lo t now?
That was the first tragedy that hit us during that war.
So it was kind of unnecessary and so the war went on.
Now we lived there  the apartment has been divided and was given right after the war by the Sovi ets  was given to their two Generals so  one of the Generals still lived there  he didnt want to let me in and the other part belongs to a widow of the General.
And it turns out that he survived the war  and so did his mom  whom he did not know was alive  and he lives in New York .
There was a the we had all the chauffeur  of course  wow  you know.
Anyhow  he got out just -- well  in the meantime  the war started.
Especially at the time a popular thing was gold coins which Jewish people always collect after first World War  gold coins because they thought it was the safest thing to have.
They survived the war in the Alps  but her husband was taken and killed.
The whole -- they also were working for the war effort.
Im very much in favor of attempts toto punish more current (you know) people who commit these war crimes  as defined now by the Nuremberg trials.
So  sadly enough  I was brought up in the German language and German wa s the language  but certainly I spoke Polish later and  with my girlfriends it was always Polish.
That means they...they brought in people for further transport to Auschwitz.
We could already hear the sound of war by hearing guns  artillery  tanks or whatever  bombings.
We didn't really want to go back to Poland we heard some bad stories about Poland what was going on in there.
From my -- no  the housekeeper that worked fo r my aunt  she saved Zula during the war.
Very strict and during the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to  you know  to share what food they had with everybody  including the Jewish girls  usually girls  who were hidden there.
Greeks who lived to the with the the war period are very familiar with lice  it was pandemic  it was [indecipherable] Well certainly when you talk to concentration camp survivors  they talk about lice all the time.
So eventua lly  after the war  thats all I heard from him.
So he wrote them letters before the war yet because he knew something is coming.
Some Russian soldiers brought her  and he ge t reunited after the war with my wife.
I learned to teach first in the war  when I was a part of the program which trained occupation troops.
And ever ybody was so involved emotionally a nd I'm involved emotionally  too  but I cannot escape from the politics of the situation a nd the difficulty of deciding to take these indicted war criminals out of Bosnia and deliver them to the Hague if you are in e ffect the United States of America.
Norman  I want to get back a little bit before the war.
They found me in Czechoslovaki a after the war in --not   Prague.

The the war made it impo ssible for us to think of any return yet  because the war was still going on.
And I had this very romantic idea  the United States  by that time I had seen a couple of war movies and I just  you know  I had thought everything American was just wonderful so I said  \ I want to go the United States.\
Did you know what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
They took the position that a-and a correct position Hitler was again and again reminding Germans that there wouldnt be a war  except for the Jews.
And the British took the position that focusing on the atrocities would only reinforce the idea that this is what the war was all about.
Do you think there could be a rise of Nazism in Germany in todays world  all the skinheads that you read about?

This is tape number two  side A. I was just asking you  cause Ive heard from -- from other survivors who felt very leery to be around Gentiles when they -- when the war was over because they had been turned on by all the Gentiles in their life prior to that and -- and so they had a hard time trusting that it wouldnt happen again.
And even....as a  as a student I was interested in theater  and just before the war...ya  just before the war  many artists from the cabaret  from the state  from the film  fled to Holland and as I said  some  some went afterwards to the States  but some of them stayed here and I  I've seen all the big names of the...of the actors and the Cabaretiers from Berlin  in Amsterdam  which is...which I would never have seen in my life and it was unbelievable because they were really top people  and I remember that they had the theater where every fortnight they brought a new program.

Okay  and this is a photo This is a photo right after the war  before after we were liberated.
Its a recognition of many years of work and struggle for the common values  because since the beginning of the Cold War  United States goals and objectives were identical with our asp -- Polish aspirations.
And that was four weeks before the end of the war.
And uh in in my case that was all the more understandable  because  you know  it was a very personal crusade  the war  and a very personal uh involvement with my parents and my brother and my sister over there  and uh I didn't know their fate at that time but I could surmise and but this  for generations we had talked about our uh heritage and the like  at one time this Sergeant Hadley and I  and he was for generations in in Ohio and uh his family and but and he was not personally involved but he just uh uh broke down completely and I I was told by other members of uh who came to Buchenwald at various times that the same thing had happened to uh General Eisenhower when he came there.

My husband is American born  was a Marine on Wake Island during the war.
This mo ment I have to tell you  first of all  I went in a girl from from my house gave me an address  she got a starv a brother-in-law in Poland after the war  he was a very religious man.
Because I -- I -- I told her during the war th at I will divorce her the moment th -- the war would end  I -- I -- yes  she didnt believe me.
I found out this long after the war -- long after I left.
But now youre talking about the time when the war is over  when you can leave.
We  who were the absolute victims of the war  right  from whom everything was taken  the property  the inheritance  the families  the rights  our father  everything.

I had one friend that I did not know until after the war who lived in the parsonage of a church and there was running water  but nobody knew.

End of Tape #1 10 Tape #2 Before you tell me more about your family  after you got to the United States  and the war got really into full swing  and the United States got involved  tell me what you heard and what you knew from the perspective of what you knew then as well as you can remember.
You heard about the fifth column in the Spanish civil war  where they put civilians to infiltrate a place  and then they take over the place.
I was originally I was drafted on October 7th  1941  two months before Pearl Harbor.
Interview with A. Zalc  L. Ragin  J. Mizrachi July 23  2009 17L: Mm-hm.
My sister  which spent her time in Israel during that period  obviously did not suffer as a result of the war  except she was mentally very distressed because she did not hear of her parents or her brother  being me  and she suffered terribly because of what she knew the people in Europe were suffering while she was living in Palestine during those years.
Now  my cousin  th -- ma -- Marilyn Petranka  she went  and she was a nurse during the war  and she met a -- a young English doctor who was Jewish  and they fell in love  and they got married  and they live now in Canada .
And of course they took her to the clinic where the doctor was and the doctor confirmed -- I don't know how it works but he confirmed that she was infected and she was sick and she was put away to be seen only after the war.
Was very different Have you ca after the war  before the war  you know.
The war ended in in last several days  because it was like a .
During the war they also did some kind of experiments because ther e were a couple of operations done on him.
When some of them -- when they saw the number and this is now early fi -- late 50s  not that far from the war -- should know what -- what the -- nothing.
And it was  for sure  the Treaty of Versailles after the war  which made Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 118 Hitler possible.
And they spent the rest of the war in Cuba with families.
I mean  that was the only recreation we had during the war  you know  the only time that you dressed a little bit  whatever you had and it was a social occasion  so it was very hard to -- you know  not to do it.
And so this -- Do you remember dealing with a civilian  Austrian population  non-Jews after -- after the war while you were there and were there any incidents?
Well  the fellow who was the head of the camp got hanged himself eventually  after the war.
This was the time when Germany was in ruins and defeated.
She sent me food packages and money and so forth So your Uncle managed to survive midst the ruins of Warsaw until January 45 and then he was liberated by the Russians and then at the end of the war --?
And when war came and we were ra tioned  there was no way -- she would trade her bacon coupons for cheese or eggs or something  or butter.
They declared war and they were in town the same way.
We had f -- about 40 or so ordinary German soldie rs who were ordinary prisoners of war.
It was like  it was like  that was  I think  the horror of  of the war years.
After the -- the war when we came back to Waszkowitz  there was [indecipherable] whom she -- my aunts had worked in real estate for him  but when the Russians came he became a banker.
So were you sure -- after the war  and you were in Italy  were you sure that your mother had perished in Auschwitz?
And specially this aunt of mine  who survived the war in Israel  it was not Israel  it was Palestine .
>> Bill Benson: When the war for you is over  it' s August 1944.
So -- but -- and she was just as a -- before the war  slowly do it  one time  think of another and so on.
Can we talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts about your experience during the war?
And then when B ill was in America he sent an affidavit for my parents and for me but the war had broken out and it was not  and my mother had died and very shortly after my mother died  my father died.
I dont know whether by this they meant that Poland will win the war or there w ould be an armistice a nd the newscasters were very bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports.
So when the war  I mean when the Japa nese came in  we had taken  we had gotten a few furnitures of course  and all the people  the Amer icans had left.
There was only three girls before the war  and no boys.
And my mother saw Polish soldiers coming home from the war  every and she knew a lot of the a lot of the old customers of my father.
For instance  when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to show their loyalty  especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky  there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to the Polish air force as a show of patriotism.
It was very expensive  so I had to earn money to pay for the high school  help with my sister  and...uh...I was very much alr eady involved in...in...uh...organizational life before the war because mine generation grew up in a...ge neration of idealism.
You had -- you had reunited with some of your friends from -- fro m the war.
And Aunt Helen was a very troubled woman and it was very hard for her to take this child who had come from a war torn country and who was a granddaughter of this absent older brother that she idealized.
My mother kept a kosher home to to her dying day.
And he was very popular  and he worked very hard  and give also dancing lessons in the hotel; also before the war.
You are a guilt -- because we don't want a war.
Because when my friends from Venezuela  we only 18 Dutch families  and I knew them all because those women married mostly  they ha -- they were engaged  and then they got this great job after the war from Shell  so they quick got ma rried and they had their first baby their  and the doctors only spoke Spanish  and they were scared stiff  because [indecipherable] they were expecting their first baby  so I was called out for every delivery  and they all became my friends  and they were like brothers and sisters.
As they came back to Balti  my cousin Zioma went in to the army after a little while  because the war still went on  and lo and behold  he appears in Bucharest in the uniform of the army which freed  you know  so you can imagine our -- because the la st we knew was -- of him was when that doctor found them and brought them the -- the blanket.
They were both in t he Army and they were both taken prisoner of war by the Germans  when the Germans attacked.
We ca -- we called them Valosoftsi  General Valosoft -- Valosoft went  the first day of the war is the -- two more -- they surrender to the Germans.
I didnt have much religion all during the war and after the war  oh God  I was bitter.
He had a sister that she got married before the war  and she went to Israel  and shes now still in Israel  in Tel Aviv.
So what for you needed the Germans that your own people could kill you.
I was much too young to understand that  however  after the war  there were a few members of course who were in my group  they were kind of glorified as the ones who resisted Hitler  but .
Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.
Did you talk with him about your e xperiences during the war  as a survivor?
They made a conn ection through someone they knew who knew someone who knew someone to two people whos e names are Cory and Jan Van Nomberg who are people who I now know as my aunt and uncle who live in Tilburg who we have been very close to since the war; people who Im very  very fond of.
Before the war began  were you aware of events in Germany ?
But the war left scars  and in 1945 I fell ill with typhoid fever and hepatitis.
But Japan was  for most Jews  a -- a country to wait til the war ended  or a pl ace to go through to some other place.
Much later  but you did eventually come  and at that point  the Germans pounced on the Jews.
because they were somehow they were together in into in this war.
I started to look around and see if I can find a place where I can hide out and be sure that I can maybe live through the war.
We stayed all the time til the end of the war together.
In fac t  June 1940  when Hitler attacked France  leading up to that  did you feel that war was imminent  that you were in peril?
And has very traumatic memories of his childhood  but he has made contact -- That were related to the war  or -- Oh yes  all related to the war  and then he was alone in boarding school in England and then he came here and -- but fi nally -- weve talked about this a great deal.
It was in 1941 -42  the heat of the war already  in France  and next step was Pithiviers  trains  cattle cars and murder into Auschwitz.
The one thing which kept our morale up and that is true of this period and that is true of the...of Auschwitz later on  was the war.
Before the war started  already feeling that it was coming  we were diggi ng on order of the government  we had to dig shelters in the 6 street against bomb attacks.
A-A-A month or two after the war  and they come back to their homes  and -- Th-Th-This week that all of the activitys going on and -- and yo ure very busy  did you stop going to school that week  and tell -- and were you working pretty much all the time?
What--were you conscious of the fact of what was going on in Europe  and did you see a likelihood of the United States entering the war?
and a little bit of a life  did you go to synagogue?
I mean  you saw you had an im age of of German soldiers marching in a parade in town  you have an image and a memory of a Polish lady ran running and and saying Yeah  the war is the war is here.
Did you have any insight or knowledge about this  either during the time you were there or after the fact  after the war?
And then there some escapees from prisone r of war camps.
That war broke out in September  and the -- the children were evacuated  and the place closed down.
It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over  and when you know  when they sought out the collaborators  he came to me begging for some kind of  you know  \ See what I did for you?!\
One most terrifying things were the  the ambulance sirens  I mean  because they sound just like our sirens during the war and that was terrifying.
Second time  when war was over and I came back to Warsaw and I found my wife   I decided to go first I went to Kielce back no  no  to Warsaw.
I should have  you know  but things were was very important  yes  I would say I would know wh ere I was  but from there we arrived to Germany.
I was going steady with a girl  so war or no war  and maybe I was reckless  or I didnt realize what Im getting into it  but all these ordinance I took -- Ill say -- I say okay  I can live with that.
And during the 17-18's  during the war  coal supplies became very short and I still remember when we had to have a pushcart and go to the harbor at the river where the coal was brought in.
And the same guy came here after the war to see us in Richmond.
I-I -- I would say I-I cant recollect if sh e was talking with me about the war  and these other things.
Somebody in Rome has told us if it war is breaking out.
When the war ended for Belgium -- the war was still going on elsewhere in Europe -- your Aunt Theresa was abl e to find you and she brought you to her home.
>> Bill Benson: As you said to us  of course the war is still going on and these Jewish resistance groups were making plans that they might have to fight the Germans if Ramullah was to come into Palestine.
Non pasaran   then the No  thats Spanish civil war  non pasaran .

And this wa s basically what she did most of the time throughout the war.
Did your attitude towards religion change as a result of the war?
Well they went a different wa y  they went to Flossenburg  fou nd out after the war  Flossenburg and the one who survived en ded up in Da chau.

At that time  when you were a child  before the war Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 9 Yeah  sure.
And since hes in the American occupation zone ﬂ wh-where we were located  ﬁI feel I should go to the American liaison officer  and have him take care of it.ﬂ And I just -- with a smile he said  ﬁI know  because of your background  youll do something about it.ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  frankly  youre right  but my general told me that Im not here to find out who the Nazis are  who the war criminals are.
Also uh uh shouldn't forget that this November's events came after Muni ch  the all...I remember that I think it was September...thought we were somehow on the br ink of war in 19...September 1938 under these four  Hitler and Mussolini and and and Chamberlain got together in Munich and hammered out the agreement selling out Czechoslovakia to the Nazis and this also uh somehow gave the Nazis the feeling that now they were very powerful because actually uh Chamberlain had submitted to them and then he was so foolish when he got back to to London to to wave this paper saying that in the morning before he left Munich for London he had another meeting with Heir Hitler and this is to say the proof that we have peace in our time  so when the November events came  certainly Germany already was in a much stronger politica l and military situation  and for us uh uh it was the indication definitely that that uh the end of the Nazi regime we had all hoped for  because we had thought that for econo mical and political reasons there would be...it would be only be a transitory existence...that this was not true.
And May 1945 we entered the place called Dachau   right outside of Munich.
And the reason they were prisoners of war because they had been in the Yugoslav Army at the time of the occupation had occurred.
So we were only liberated when the war was over  and I remember  I think it was the fourth or third of May?
That was shortly after the -- after the war -- Right. --
And while being here -- I didnt mention to you -- while being in Prujena   some from the concentration camp people came to Prujena   beginning right after the war.
But -- and even af ter the war  they helped us out with white  good bread.
And again  this was war conditions and we all heard about bureaucracy  how it moves very slowly.
But you didn't feel singled out at school after the war was all over?
World War I. When you were growing up  did your father tell you stories about America?
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12  2002 49 Well  its -- ma -- in my profession the war still continued as a civilian  and we were just as busy as we were during the war years  working long hours.
So my parents after the war  as I said  my mother never really spoke too much about her family  up until the very end.
And uh I often uh thought that my long conversation with uh with Monseigneur Montini 54 in 1945 when the war was over and I was asked to plead with him the Catholic aut horities should help us to recuperate the Jewish children who had been hidden by Catholic authorities or Cat holic individuals and when I argued with him...this was November 1945...and said that we had...we were very grateful to the Catholic Church for what it had done in order to save some Jews  Jewish children especially  but we had lost in the war one and a half million Jewish children  and we couldn't loose one more child.
All I knew that I was a child that really be that came in 1923  so the war was ove r in 1918  so this was a very difficult economic time  and I not very much was talked about on ho w they met  and I really never found out.
Well  of course the when the war wa s over  the the people changed pretty rapidly.
I was already and the war ended se-seven of May  I think  45.
I was supposed be dead so many times in the war  I came out of it.
All of a sudden war in Korea broke out  they were federalized and there was something like 3 000 of them cadre and they had to find 10 000 cannon fodder meaning northern boys to become privates and all of them were upgraded and this as I found out they were taking out on us northerners still the vengefulness of the civil war.
After all  you know  to be 12 days in a war  being all the time on a on a aerial bombardment  you know.
So When you did your retribution activities  the blowing up of the truck  whatever  did you make it known that it was a a Je wish activity in retribution for what happened during the war?
In the meantime  a lot of people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people  and so my father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just about six weeks before the war started.
He was in World War I. He was he was injured  and he an -and he kind of had some physical suffering and pain  from broken ribs that he he had not not not in a in battle  but he had to take care of some horses  as a soldier  and one of the horses Kicked him?
Lets ha lets before we talk about that  want to move back to life before the war  though.
That place  the Germans took over  three weeks or or two weeks or three weeks after the war  everything is quiet  the gover it civil German civil government  there is Nazi regime.
When we got to Poland  Poland had several million Jews  now they have  I think  5 000 Jews in the entire country of Poland.
Wes  we ended our last conversation talking about the end of the war but we want to back up a deported to Auschwitz and then spent time in different camps.
He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army  but thats the image I picture him  and hes told me heroic war stories and the like  and thats what comes to mind when I think of him.
No Jew would ever s-serve in government or a thing like that be fore the war.
After the war  and -- even though what -- what strikes me as outstanding is the fact that even though we had gone through all this trauma  my parent s were not selfish to the point of trying to hold onto us  to stay with them  where th ey were making a living  where they were rebuilding themselves  but had sent me on to the bigger city where there was my s -- me and my sister  to Stuttgart  where they were -- from Amberg to Stuttgart  where there was a Jewish school.
What did you -- what was your -- your reaction when you saw your first German soldier?
When you were in tight s pots during the war  did you pray?
Did your mother at that time  or ev en during the war  ever talk about going to Palestine?
And then its only at the end of the war that you find out what had happened to your parents?
When the real war came closer  I still...I had my kindergarten.
This case  they had lost the war  I now know 79 that Sudeten Germans  thousands of them  were actually killed during the deportations  the others had a pretty rough time getting out.
Given to Barbara after the war by her aunt in Arad. (
General Eisenhowe r  the very same day  re plied to Secretary of War Stimpson that only yesterday he had turned down the suggestion to appoint a Jewish liaison officer.
And I think th at he came back also  and I saw him a few times.
Well I (clearing throat) after the war I...I became a tourist driver guide  licensed by the government and...uh...I had one of the blue license.
I -- I remember I -- just after the war I went with two friends on a cycle tour in Holland  and we came in the middle of Holland with all farmers country.
My sister  the one who was supposed to come over with me in 39  vanished during the war and thats the way it was.
It was a different world  and one thing that came out of the war experience was ad aptability.
When -- on trips back  you -- so you have been in Germany? [
Going to Sweden was a wonderful feeling  because going Sweden we knew was a neutral country during Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 149the war.
As ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 the Nazis were being pushed back  as the Army was retreating  the group started to organize themselves.
Well  the only explanation was that -- that simply because he was not only young  absolu -- in absolute terms  but that -- that in that period of 13 or 14  there was more elasticity in -- in -- in somebodys mind and character and emotions than there would be -- we only had four years apart -- in a ny -- in any case  it -- it -- I was much more affected by the -- by the war experience  all the events  than I saw Sam being affected.
In the first year of war  we had to now livings and there was a tremendous shortage of food so everybody was smuggling food from the countryside  from peasants.
The -- the war in El Salvador lasted for 12 years  but we were asked after the -- the peace accords had been signed to investigate what had happened duri ng those 12 years.
As a matter of fact  uh  some of them  I met  I met after the war  uh  two of them or three of them I met when I give evidence in Nuremberg against -----.

This picture was taken way after the war  behind the Dohan Temple  which is the largest temple in the eastern Europe .
The reason Im asking is did you sense a di -- a difference in attitude toward the war?
I didnt know at that time that the Holocaust was coming.
I have a sister who was born in Holland after the war  and then a brother who was born in Fort Wayne  Indiana.
Did you -- did you feel sort of the op -- before the war  and then when the war broke out  sort of the -- the feel in the village or in the communities about the situation in -- in Europe or about the persecution of -- of people.
He said  ﬁImportant as is the con cept of aggressive war and beneficent as the Hague and Geneva conventions may be  we can hardly expect much further judicial de velopment and interpretation of crimes against peace or war crimes  except of co urse in the unhappy event of another war.
Im very much against war  because I lived through it and its -- its so scary  its so horrendous.
I didnt know 3 this until after the war ended  when they were printing these statistics.
No matter what he did and all that  he is still [indecipherable] you know  they did [indecipherable] When the war ended  your Majesty  you faced another huge challenge here  and you had begun to talk about it.
The FTPF  for instance  had some of the Spanish Civil War refugees.
And during this war  underground army cannot do mu -- much more.
Mr. Ziferman  Mrs. Ziferman came also later and after the war  they liberated...were liberated  came to the United States and they only su rvivor they brought died alread y  but the surviving is the son 22 Novak...Adam Novak.
I tell you I had an opportunity after the war crimes trials ended to become a control officer in Berlin in charge of radio and press and talk to my superiors about that possibility.
12)] And this is a certificate which says that I was allowed to work there during the war  which permitted me to go to the...back and forth from the Creche to the Schouwburg.
So thats the – And I was a lot out of the house; then when the war broke out  and I was not much ho me.
Many of them were not Jewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this place was very close to Spain.
And you know  if you read  you know  about the book  ﬁAll Quiet on the Western Frontﬂ by a German writer  Remarque  who describes the first World War in the west.
They came in at night and took all the Jews to kill more  whatever the survivors that was there after the war  after this.
By now the trains were running  by now the electricity was on  all the gas  water and that wasnt too long after the war ended.
But after that I couldnt tell you any of the real camps because then we ended up in Wurzen and that was– And then finally you were actually liberated dur ing that time of wandering  the last two weeks of the war  you were liberated by American Army in Wurzen  Germany  where you stayed for about three weeks.
Yeah  that wa they were just always and he came over here and visited with her and her husband  and This is after the war  yes?
And they said during the war  they drew swastikas in the s -- they vandalized synagogues  but we didnt make too much fuss about it  even lately.
And we s we we had my parents rented a house there  and although my father expected war  he didnt realize how soon it would happen  and just as soon as he got got us settled in Kazimierz   the car came from Warsaw from President   taking him back  because the war started.
But anyway I made it and now Before that or up to that point  Hitler had been in power.
And that proved very interesting  because its really about the only anti-partisan campaign the Germans ever had in World War II that was  from their point of view  successful  as opposed to all the other anti-partisan campaigns that my colleagues worked on  Bryansk   o-on other parts of Belarus   on the Ukraine   on the Caucasus   and so on.
That he was a policeman before the war and he was the only Polish family what lived in this village.
And then I  I was anxious to get in the war  and I  uh  I applied to the Marine Corps.
These were just airplanes or whatever because the war was on already  1943.
And there was a lot of prisoner  Russian prisoners who were -- came home from the -- from the Germany.
And he fled when after th e war  and he was condemned to death  because he has denounced many non-Jewish Belgium people in Belgium.
One of the most the things I remember most distinctly  and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming interested in history and politics and so on  cause I remember when when the German Russian non-aggression pact was signed  I prin I announced that this means ya war in Europe .
Well  as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through  were driven through the town and the treatment of them.
Comparing to other people  my life  my war experience was --.
Because Eisenstadt where she was born before the First Wo rld War it belonged to Hungary.
Even today I talk to school kids if there's any occasion that they would want to know about World War II.
What happened before the war  how we survived  and then what happened after the war.
We took them there  and I made arrangements for Anita to come down to -- to visit us in -- in London  and we went to the -- we went to the war -- to the Kindertransport Monument.
The Germans were the ones that told us the war was over.
And until we read your book just now  the family did not know what happened to him beyond the war office telegram saying that he was killed in action.
But that was a -- we say six millions Jewish people losted their life during the second war.
He thought he could protect us if he would come with us  a nd ironically  very sadly  he is the one who did not survive the war.
Before the war  he and his neighbor  there is such a Jewish holiday as Succos (Sukkos  Sicchos) in Yiddish  Sukkot (Succot); they tried to make a sukkah (siccha).
We have all  even us  we were in the ghetto we were lucky not to leave the home  but we all all we had before the war  but we felt the same.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: So  he's asking -- you were saying that you were in this very integrated community before the war.
Oh  the people that we had  it was very interesting after the war when I found those people coming out of hi ding  and we all stayed together.
And I had a whole album  bu t during the war I gave it to our maid.
And once they landed  the war started  so they never were able to get th eir children.
called his book published in United States during the war \ The Story of the Underground State \  and it was the underground state.
The priest said you stay here as long as you want  until the end of the war  but after a number of days  we realized that it was too dangerous  not only for us but for the priest.
Ca use...so  they told us all of them left 4 or 5 days ago...you know  3  4  5 days ago cause they knew the war was coming to an end.
But she  you know  th was smart enough  but she was we survived there from October til January eighth  where it was the end of the war for me.
The first time I was in jail for 3 weeks  by the way I was together with somebody H. Brownstein who had been expelled from the United States  had been married after the war to an American soldier  left for the US  was living in Brooklyn and she was aware of a guard of the Maidenek Camp and was in the samw prison (Osendorf)  she was an elderly woman looking very friendly  she was knitting for a service in the prison  you would never thought of her as a guard in Maidene k  she was sentenced for life in a trial in Germany to push another case  but in order to attract public opinion  the fact she was in jail at the same time I was in jail.
Well  we were an average family in L ithuania before the war and...uh...my father  mother and a brother.
They still -- they could not -- we couldn't even talk about the issue of the war.
And it was -- we learned how to interrogate prisoners of war.
He was an assistant General Counsel  he esta blished the War Refugee Board  whichŠ and administered it.
He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the first world war.
My grandfather  in 1918  at the end of the First World War  when Yugoslavia was created  the language of the country went from Hungarian to S erbo -Croatian.
No  I do not remember when the war started  I only remember when the Gestapo knocked on our door  and said get out  at gunpoint.
I mean  we Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18   1997 37lost all these people in the war  and now their only son was going into the service.
So she -- she -- she lived the war too  you know   she knows about the war.
We don't know how close we are to the end of the war.
A So actually only after -- only when Lithuania became independent people started to come back.
All the time my father work  and you know -- we were expecting that war will be over  we all are going to go back and life is going to be the same as before.
And during that pre -war time  economic circumstances were difficult and I think you told me his business was having a tough time in those early years.
It was either 89  or se 80 I [indecipherable] 88  but I heard on the television that there theres a new office  Red Cross office that looks for translators  cause theres a new office tracing the Holocaust an war victims tracing office of the Red Cross and is looking for a translato r. And since I was al-always a champion for the Red Cross  I was even a president of the Polish Red Cross  had a certain [indecipherable] junior Red Cross in my school  so I always thought very highly of Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 141the Red Cross  so I jumped to the Red Cross  okay.
My fathers brother  who survived the war  this was right after the war.
They were losing the war and they couldn't possibly commit big forces to destroy the camp.
Oh  there cus -- there came a -- a period in Czechoslovakia  after war  who let all the Jews out of Czechoslovakia. [
SE: [indecipherable] he was ook in German and -- and prisoner of war  in Germany.
They were from the from apparently also  they were former Russian prisoners.
Ah  I dont know what the problem– I only went to one grade  okay  before the war started.
Vernet was a camp erected in the 1st World War for Austrian prisoners of war  for Austrian prisoners of war  for their Austrian soldiers at the German front uh front uh in 1914  1918  and when they were captured  they were imprisoned there and in 1939 the camp was used to imprison dangerous foreigners  and these were primarily Germans  Nazis  Nazis who had been caught in France and who hadn't returned...returned in time and then also foreign communists because they were also considered dangerous in view of the fact that uh communists were against the war at the very beginning.
Well  we subsequently found out and when I mean subsequently  I mean many years later after the war that the selection that took place in Starachowice was destined for Treblinka  and that is where my mother perished.
And one day  on the second day of our marriage  the war between Russia and the... the Germany breaks out.
Then when the war was over  he came back for me and he said he wanted  would I like to come back and live with his family and I said  \ oh\  and he said well  mother and I -- I think that's how he called her -- mother and I talked about it and we have the sons but we need a girl.
Were th ere a lot of people studying World War   and the Nazis and the -- the Holocaust  or the structure of the Nazi regime  or were you an oddity at the time at Columbia?
I have some idea because after the war  I was asked to m ake a deposition about Cunsa  and I said what he did for us and it's my understanding that he was executed because he signed execution orders for some partisans and maybe for some of these deserters as well.
They never succeeded to defeat the Romanians but after the war they took it.
The Germans came first to the border with Poland to the west of Poland  this border.
And so I I would assume that Streicher was there more for public relations purposes than the fact that he was one of the perpetrators of starting the war or even what he did during th e war  you know.
That was the thinking as  of course  we learned after the War from many  many writings on the subject both from ex-officials and others on the outside.
Well  he managed to get some other Jews that were survivors and some Gentiles that knew him based on before the war and during the war and he had to convince them that they were -- that he was not a collaborator.
What else kept you going through these terrible time s of the war?
And I was always dreaming about it and at sc hool  I just looked at my classmates who were  of course  Christians and could wear the uniform a nd just  I dreamt about that one day  Im going to have a uniform and the sad thing is that after th e war  when we met for the first time  those who survived in our group  and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden  to most of us  it didnt mean anything anymore.
So whats the first experience of war in 1939 for you  do you remember?
An d I wanted to ask you if there is anything that has come to your mind that y ou would like to add that you haven't already told me about your time duri ng the war  and then just reflect back.
And he was already in the army by the time he did?
Well  then  of course  the English got defeated and the English and French got defeated in a hurry in France  and there was Dunkirk and then everything came to sort of a standstill you know  sort of the English were in England and we were in Holland and life would go on until the war was over.
Now  during all this time  how much information did you have about the outside world and what was happening in the camps?
I remember when the Six Day War was  how I cried.
In 1938 when the Germans occupied all parts from Czecho slo vakia then Prague  so Poland went to war  because they claimed Szczakowa belonged to Poland.
So they had some difficulties  all the result from the First World War.
Out of a population  of a Jewish population of over three millions  only 240 000 registered after the war.
It was after the war and I was already a little bit older  then we really started realizing what was happening  and about killing the Jews and about how we actually struggled on what they did to us and thats why we were persecuted running from place to place  and we just couldnt wait to be able to come to this country.
In May 1940  of course  the war began in September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland  but in May of 1940  the Germans attacked Belgium and France  Holland  what they call the low countries.
Judging from my experience in cattle driving before that  Im not sure I would have contributed very much to the Swiss war effort  if it had of come to that.
And  of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war  because the -- we were always going along or through some hedgerows to get to our -- to find the German alliance  so [indecipherable]  a-and th-this was a -- a -- oh  of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience  but we managed to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols  and usually I had to go out on every damn patrol there was  because by na -- by now the troops  the Marines would hardly ever go out 64 unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present  Morris Latimer had been injured on the radar stations and he had went back to -- to England.
They didn't have to go in the  in the war  fighting on th e front when they went to a concentration camp  so they went by themselves to the SS.
And that was the last time we saw him for a long time.
So when the Russians left Poland  he went back to Poland.
So when my Aunt Rebecca  who was my fathers youngest sister  and she and her family survived in Egypt  see  because they lived in Alexandria during the war  then after the [indecipherable] took over  and they had to to leave Egypt  they came to Paris.
>> Bill Benson: Which was an occupied city by the Germans.
And this girl  her name was -- now she [i ndecipherable] after the -- after the war she get married.
It was only 8 kilometesr from our house  and we were scared to go that they will kill us  because they killed many Jews after the war  the Pollacks.
You know  when you think about  you know  what went on  the  you know  the Cold War and  and  and the Soviet Union  McCarthyism  Civil Rights  the Eichmann trial  anything?
He said that is that priest who fought us during the war.
I wanted to find out  right after the war  when you started going to Italy  how was your health and were you in this hospital because you were not well?
And oh  we were so happy  not because the Pearl Harbor was bombed  but because the Americans were -- entered the war and if they entered the war they will win and we will survive and well live.
So when the war began  you were able to converse in German?
Were you members of youth groups  were you involved in anything as the war approached  '39  '40?
Some people had some ancient rifles from the First World War.
Tell us what you can about that period for t he family and what happened with you and your family during the period right before Germany invaded Poland and war began  September 1939  so between the anschluss and the beginning of the war.
What I remember from my reading of the US military forces in World War II is that before it had been much more of a professional army  and World War II brought in civilians  and in many ways was a great leveler  or people from totally different backgrounds were thrown together.
Not only that  some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had  during the war  connections with the British.
And during the war it was very difficult to hide them.
After the war  especially later when I was a tailor then I tried to find the doc uments so I wrote to Red Cross  everywhere.
My father's prayer shawl which amazingly -- I don't know how my mother managed to carry it with her all through the war.
How old would your mother be at the end of the war in 1945?
And then it became time for England to enter World War II  at which point it was said that its a crown colony  an oil colony and so they clapped every last refugee into a detention center with Interview with Erica Laufer 23 August 19  2012 barbed wire all around it.
When you arrived in Europe for your military service  how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews?
I went to sc hool such and such before the war  gammer school  who cared and the rest of it was being suppressed.
He was now a member of the war essential work force  assigned to work far beneath his qualifications  at wages set arbitrar arbitrarily by the Nazis.
So Irving was And we kept our friendship right throu gh the war  and we were very close while we lived in New York.
His brother-in-law was a Director of American Joint in Warsaw  prior to the war.
They hadnt been Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10  2001 44in the first World War and they were cert ainly werent going to get involved in this one.
But in 1938  life started to get a little bi t easier already  before the war.
There had been a strict State Department rule that foreign service officers should not serve longer than two years at that time because of the Cold War situation.
It was un -- it [indecipherable] found out this after the war  it was mindboggling.
Do you think you would be a different person today if you had not gone through what you did  what you experienced during the war?
Now  between 1939 and 1941 when the war started in Russia  did you hear what the Nazis were doing in Poland?
All the Gestapos  the --------- against the green police  were all called up for active duty  and there were less raids  and then  we had more stable population in our house  4 or 5 people  who stayed until the end of the war.
She says  ah  the war is almost finished  she says  the war is almost finished.
They had left Poland around when the war broke out  1914 -- no before that -- 1913  they went to Elsass-Lothringen  which is part of France now and was at that time also.
And did your father ever describe his emotions after the war No  not really or discuss this photograph with you?
She was a very loose woman  and during the war she had a lot of German lovers.
And the Russian -- the war with the Russians started at that time  when I was in that office.
And this uncle  my Uncle Bernard  who goes now by Dov and lives in Israel  he survived because he was prisoner of war.
Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war  but about my concepts about working with people and children.
I had the -- this cousin  who before the war  came to United States  he got killed in France  has a grave there in a military cem -- an American military cemetery  and I visit his grave  send the picture to his parents.
So  does that mean towards clo clos er towards the second part of the war?
Other recent works including a translation of a booklet that accompanied a 1942 anti -Semitic exhibit in Croatia and photographs gathered during the post -World War II trials in Yugoslavia.
That the war started in Is rael with Syria and Lebanon and Egypt.
Eventually  my mother and my sister joined us  joined me in Kielce  and the rest of the war was spent in Kielce  living first with one and...and then with another  having a room in their crowded house.
We used to think that she s a very old women  in those days she was only 54  or 53  you know  at the -- in the war.
But it's not a war against Jews  this is all war for humanity.\  \
Bunks -- it had been just sort of a -- a military camp with bunks from the floor to the ceiling and -- and it was -- there just wasnt enough room.
After the war  we discovered that he led all the Communist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023 8 of an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk  which was about 10 - 15 miles from our farm.
And in those days before the second World War  this was a beautiful profession.
The taste for you after the war  is a very bad one.
My father was of the opinion that he had been in the first world war and earned the Eye of the Cross  and a veteran  obviously  and nothing could happen to him.
What Celene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark haired Jewish children would go to the south of Holland where most of the people were Catholic and were darker and the lighter skinned  lighter haired Jewish people would go to the north because there were Protestants who were lighter.
And  so in order to do that  I couldn't stay in that  see that school was  as I said  in shambles  it was the remnants of a pre -war  very  very fine Jewish school  but because  so the system in Belgium was that if you went to public school  you could get into univers ity after graduation  you didn't need to take a special test.
The next thing you know  they know that you went through the war  because in [indecipherable] figure out your age and so on.
The work we had to do in England was to find to meet the conditions which the home office had laid down which was having a guarantor 50 pounds for each person which they designated as being money which would be used for the children's eventual repatriation at the end of the war  of course there wasn't a war to start with.
He always give us hope  all the girls; and the girls took care of him after the war by helping him.
So  we should wait at least a year til -- til the war will be finished.
Af ter the war  you know  and th-there was so much typhus and everything.
Did you have any idea what was happening in the camps?
What did she think when she went -- got to Auschwitz?
And the she knew that the deportees from Poland lived in this camp  not too far away from them  but she could do nothing for them  and she heard that ultimately they were allo allowed to go back to Poland after World War II.
Their job before the war was like federation  we have it in America.
Did you speak  or do you -- did you speak German at the time?
I thought we were talking about the Russian p-prisoners of war.
Nobody came  nobody looked into it  until it came the time they shipped us out from there and the main reason they sh ipped us out is because the war was closing in.
My father was away most of the time  and my mother is the one that took care of us for the most part.
The Germans were going up  and we were happy when Germany invaded Russia because we thought that now its going to that the Germans are going to lose the war because Napoleon did and so on  and so on but it was upside down.
Now  I understand from Radu that later on they recognized those schools  you see  after the war  you see  in the they went back my brot her went back to the regular state school.
I was 20th Congress which was the last Zionist World Congress  before the war.
This was sort of a major health issu e that kept following you around after the war.
did you talk amongst one another after the war  about everything that you had gone through  about your unusual family  that you came from a mixed marriage  and so on?
That was called death march  and ther e were many of those death march in Germany at near the end of the war.
When my mother died  in my heart I took responsibility for my younger brother and maybe he did that in his heart for me too  I don't know  but I did that  I took  I became a grownup and I took responsibility for maintaining my life and my beliefs in a way that my mo ther would have wanted to and I  I  I took on grownup responsibilities  indeed I had done that even during the war.
Of their immediate family   only Irene and Serena survived the war.
Well  I got a teacher from the conservatory in Munich who would come home to me   but I hated him  because every time I would say something about the war  he would say  we didnt know anything.
And I pretty much stayed with them for the entire duration of the war.
Its still going on  they -- they still didnt learn from the fir -- the second World War and its still going on in Bosnia and previous Czechoslovakia and in th-the African countries  they kill each other.
I -- Im wondering what kind of affect the -- the war experience had on your faith  and on -- on your spiritual outlook.
You were sort of contaminated uh  you know the Nazis  the only good Jew is a dead Jew  and in a way  after the war immediately I belie ve  that was also a view of others.
They retreated and then they came back after the war ended.
We need to know what happened to you and your husband as the war drew to a close.
But some of them -- I mean  I -- we didnt have a lot to do with Germans people -- with German people.
At that time of...of uh  the war  uh  there were slave labor camps.
Did you speak German at home with your family after the war?
Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 179 Okay  because when you were reli when you were freed  the war was still on.
There were four  when the war ended  there was the English  the Russian the American.
We had no fear because we had  at some poi nt– The British had bombed a few times  but we were not afraid because we were thinking that th e war was about to end.
clothing  so they were sewing machine  and for those job women were hired  and women did that before the war  too.
Now  you were not terribly religious  although you observed certain holidays  prior to the war?
Now  the Swiss knew at the beginning of the war  approximately how much gold reserves the German central bank did have.
Did you ever feel anti-Semitism at that time in -- in America?
5 Well  I would say by the time the war br oke out  yes  when we didnt  yeah.
So so whatever what whatever was promised  didnt happen  because United States didnt want to I dont know didnt want  didnt have ships  or whatever  the war was  you know  in in Going on.
Frank Liebermann: There was war in the east called the Crimean War in 1920  ended I think July 1921 that led to establish -- the establishment of Poland which changed certain borders and Gleiwitz was right at the border.
But interestingly enough  this has always astounded me that through all the times during the war  even after there had been transports and a fair people were deported  that those who still remained  as much as they both worried about their friends and relatives who had been taken and as much as we all worried what would happen to all of us eventually  that we all --I think there was a tendency to try and maintain a semblance of normality as much as possible.
You know  I think the Dutch has sort of faded  although  you know  I -- I -- I still pride myself on being able to read Dutch -- Dutch newspapers and being able to converse in Dutch  but I -- I dont really feel -- and my mother did not have a ny -- any great affinity to Holland after the war.
This war  if it breaks out  will not end with the defeat of the German people.
Not in detail  but only in titles  or summaries of the Jewish suffering in Romania during the war.
I dont know what it was before the war  whether it was a factory before the war and who owned it.
But I almost feel ashamed that I lived in a culture where coming back after such a horrible  horrible war  that our neighbors truly didnt want us.
And in 1943 -- in 1942 the Hungarians  as I mentioned  finally joined the war and they were told by 6 Hitler to put together an Army.
The Pesach I remember most di stinctly was in -- in 1948  and the reason I remember it is because my mother was telling me the story about the Egyptians  and then at the same time there was the Arab Israeli war.
We knew that England  France declared war on Germany  and we thought two big powers  Germany won't last long  we'd be able to come back.
And then I get my own apartment and went back to school  and when I was 17 I married  and that's also the story after the war.
And when the big bombing in London started  it was impossibl e to get to work because there was glass everywhere  water  and you couldnt just go anywhere  it was -- and things were burning and that really brought the war very close to you.
At that time  do you remember  did the people fear the German at that time?
Sooner or later something happened to yo u. >> Bill Benson: And by now you're in early 1945.
>> Josie Traum: My dad couldn't come back -- war ended in 1945.
This is tape number three  side A. You were talking about the War of Independence.
And when the war broke out I was in Kolomier   the city that my sister lived and my mother was there because I left her there because I was going to Palestine.
After the war  I met some of my friends  we used to work together in those areas and they told-- nobody knew exactly why.
This was very strange because American was not at war with Germany at the time.
So lets turn now to your own  you know  smaller fa mily  that is your your mother  your father  got married after World War I. Is this correct?
In Krakow   it was a other  naturally we couldnt go out  we couldnt kill people any more  it was after the war.
He was very eager to get away from it and he served in the First World War and had a chance to see the world  a little more of the world.
So as the war went on  she worked as a live -in housekeeper for a retired Polish engineer and his wife.
Your after the war was over  you had a long life  very long  a good long time after the war.
You see  when the war -- on a Sunday morning  the Germans were commencing to drop two bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.
Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 20 They were our neighbors  so we know about the war  the first World War  with the was going on.
And I gave them the message  happy knowing this is the end of the war.
I was born in Vienna during the war  and stayed in Vienna til 1919.
Do you  what else do you remember about  what else happened during the ‚56 war?
There was one whod been heavily wounded in World War I who survived.
Q. Do you remember how you were aware that the War was over?
So Germany invaded Poland and that is when France and Great Britain declared war on Germany.
So I know that my father was there  and I know that my uncle was there and that he managed to survive that period of time with some people who were fairly kind to him  who ended up in prison after the war.
The main focus is  of course  what happens during the war and the Holocaust during the war.
We thought maybe we were going to be liberated by the Russians.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 17 No  I dont know if they was fighting  but that was the -- after the war  that was after the war.
So Did you think in those first few years after the war  did you think of your war time experience as often?
And the reason that the camp was there was that the French had to accommodate all the Spaniards that ran away from Franco when the war was over  the Spanish Civil war was over in 1939  so the French  they came over by the hundreds of thousands  so they have to put them up someplace  so that they ha d to build barracks in a hurry.
He had here  after the war in Germany  when liber ated  a German big doctor told him to remove it because that might take can cer.
So they they just get all were born on German soil during that war times  you know  just the same way there were a lot of children who were who were born in concentration camps  in women camps.
When World War I started  he was  himself  an Austrian citizen  meaning enemy citizen.
I remember that the war was over everywhere  absolutely scared to find out what happened to the family.
And the idea came up  I dont know if my father initiated it  Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 151or this his name was Landau  Mr. Roman Landau or whether Mr. Landau initiated it  but I my father had very good connections in Switzerland in the in the watch industry  because he financed first of all  he was there during World War I  and and so he somehow knew many of the people.
When the war ended  I walked to liberation with two different shoes.
She was working on a farm in Germany  as a Polish girl and she married a Polish guy  you know  and her father was killed  and -- during the war  and her mother was killed  too  you know  a nd she was the only one there  you know.
And almost immediately we were ordered to go back to the United States and prepare to go to Japan.
I was one and another Jew who lives in Chicago right now  found him after the war  he survived the war in Russia.
But  we decided the Germans are not going to catch us.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 >> Bill Benson: As recently as late 1990's?
But they didnt do anything either  and so  I just knew that they were Jewish and what had happened during the war  and eventually  their daughter  the younger daughter  is five years older than I am.
And indeed there was an announcement telling that Poland is in war with Germany.
So that really stood me in very good stead during the war.
My father was -- by the time that we left Hungary  he was no longer in territorial Hungary  he and his group went into Ukraine for similar work.
When the war was over  they came and they said  \ You know  we were sometimes very mad at you.
I was thrilled  I was absolutely thrilled  because you know  to me -- I did not know American history  but I just learned  during the war  that America was this great  fantastic country and President Roosevelt was God.
And I was the one who was taken into camp  sent into concentration camp.
We were in a camp where the Nazi soldiers were trained.
We had people who had valuables were - and who came back after the war  tried to get their valuables back from friends  or from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 26 a-acquaintances  and people just didnt want to give it back  they sa id  ﬁOh no  that was mine.ﬂ And they were so used to having those things that they didnt want to give it back.
And  of course  this is where -- by that time  I was 12 and - Do you remember when the war ended?
6 >> Bill Benson: You would stay in those conditions in the ghetto until 1942  almost three years.
Verdanes was a famous town  of course  a cemetery of France in World War I  over 10 000 casualties.
When you say you were when the war ended  do you mean the americ the European war  or the Pacific war?
Did you yourself experience again  before the war started experience any anti-Semitism?
To me  the tyrant was when I remember one day during the war when I was with my grandfather from my mother's side.
And he would watch what the war is doing  and he was very optimistic.
In wha in it in before the first World War  yes.
Before now  do you know that Germany was divided into four parts after the war?
And I remember seeing on that paper  the whole  the whole front page simply in bold letters that said war.
And no -- and the -- the -- my oldest uncle  my mothers ol dest brother  he inherited this fabulous castle  the Rimburg  which is on the border from Germa ny to Holland  to the Netherlands  and the n -- Holland claimed it after this last war  and my uncle was very happy about it  but then the 5 Germans got it back.
I was a refugee  went through the war  whatever that meant  no parents.
>> Gideon Frieder: After the war there was an epidemic of marriages n ot only in Europe   the baby boom in this country.
And the people  where they left  maybe a hundred Jews came back  maybe.
The war broke out September the 1st  so I was just in the middle of the war.
I guess the Germans didnt want anybody to know about this.
Unfortunately that was the place where we find that neither one of our parents  and not our brother remained from the war.
And the Germans looked at my mother  and let her pass.
>> Bill Benson: Paris -- after that  Paris is liberated in August 1944.
There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were Interview with Harry Ebert October 16  2010 32there  and later on I got into the war crimes trials in Dachau in Dachau .
Nobody  uh  even if let's say they didn't have Jewish friends or uh  there was one club in  in the city that I know didn't take Jews at least before the war  but they didn't  wouldn't ever think of harming anyone  or doing any harm to someone.
And then I-I was on the convention plat -- conve ntion arrangements committee for the American Society of Newspaper Editors and I arranged for the editors to have a separate and -- tour of the museum when the museum first opened  and of -- also for Ted Koppel to lead in a very interesting discussion at the museum about Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 60Holocaust denial by the American press during World War II  and particularly the role of the New York Times.
When the war is finished  hes released.ﬂ And if I have a problem with the morale of the troops  my job would be that after the battle is over -- during the battle you cant do anything  youre in the heat of the battle.
The beginning of the war  theyd come and stay there  then go up to the fr to the front lines.
The rest of it was unbelievable because they 03:37: survived the camp life from before the war.
That morning was the first time -- my mother was dressing me to go to synagog ue  the first time since before the war.
The people my age  I asked myself  What would you have done to me had you met me  you know  before the war?
Th ere were certain things  some are forgotten and some things come  some remind you of whatever was during the war  certain incidents.
He was also a decorated war veteran  he had the Iron Cross.
And so he was able to come back and deal with the post war Germans.
And then  afte r the war  sometimes there were relatives who were never interested in picking up those abandoned children.
We knew more about Freder ick the Great and the German generals staff back in the 18 th century  but we didnt know anything about the relationship of the German generals staff to the 91 rise of Hitler  the role that they played in his coming to power  or the role that they played in execution and planning of the war.
So  eventually  I got drafted and well  I got drafted in the month that they declare end of the war  in January ‚55.
The war ends  th ey undertake this incredibly ambitious ) Very.
I wrote to them and I researched it  I Googled it  I did everything I could  re nobody they said that from during the war years it was just totally cut off and the company now is a different comp with the same name  but its a totally different company.
And it was until we stayed there the war started September first  and were still in Vienna  and things got to be worse.
Ultimately what followed was Pearl Harbor and the entry of America into the war.
They were killed during the war  they were buried there and then these barracks were built  you know  before we arrived.
Do you remember any incidents of anti -semitism before the war?
But this was was this before the Germans were there  or Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14  1997 89 Yeah  before the German  before the So this is the Slovakian army Yeah  bu-but it was because as soon as was the uprising August the 29th  actually the whole  especially in the middle Slovakia   and western Slovakia   the so-called the freedom fighters  and the democratic like organization of they called  like the first Czechoslovak  like a government  took over all the the actually they they were they were they took over the power there in Slovakia most of the Slovakias [indecipherable] most of the part of Slovakia .
Yes  he was he was very much alone   and and if he didnt get what he wanted  he his father oh  by the way  his father was a prisoner of war  taken for Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21  2015 23labor.
And again  these names of camps  same way we didn't know about Auschwitz  we never heard about Mauthausen  we never heard about Ebensee  I never knew about Gusen and the way this guy pronounced it  I thought it was Kuszen or something like that and many years later I saw it in print and it's Gusen and there is the date on which he died and  but I managed to obtain that date about a year  or two years after the war when I came to this country  somebody told me about an international refugee organization and they gave me the date then  which again  I did not know until then.
When she retired actually  after the war  she Yale is still closed to her  she moves from Connecticut College  to Albertus Magnus   a Catholic college here  because its right nearby  and its not as fancy.
It's like as soon as we see in war movies  literally  as you said  two million people fleeing  on foot  on bikes in carts  in the truck that you had rented.
And he said  ﬁYes  please.ﬂ He said  ﬁAnd can you do my sister  too  Rosa  sh e is so scared.ﬂ And I said  ﬁWhat about your parents?ﬂ Because I knew -- he said no  my parents say -- and this is really ironic  ﬁGermany is an -- an civilized country  and it wont be so bad  we probably have to work hard  and how long will the war will last ﬂ -- we all thought it would be short -- and then come back.
Afterwards  they made it Interview with Inge Katzenstein October 17  2001 18mandatory that the men help the war effort  and manage the ranches of the British that had gone to war.
What had become of most of your Jewish friends from before the war?
And these black market operations were not of course only Jewish -- everybody was participating in them because Germany was vulnerable  its economic system was vulnerable  because of the war  to that kind of activity.
What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later  we are reading an obituary in the New York Times about the right hand of Mr. Brandt 22  who was German Prime Minister  and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war  he came back to East Germany  eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities  was in Siberia  somehow when he was released managed to get to West Germany and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt.
Because he was in camp from the beginning of the war to the end of the war.
Eventua lly in 1948  after the war  when the State of Israel was established  where ...where else would I go?
Yes  yes  not I  because what happened wa s the dissolution of the Boy Scouts -- and I still remember  you see 25 March is the national hol iday in Greece  because its when the war of independence in 1821 started against the Turks.
And we want to get a sens e of who you were as the war began and how old you were and things like that.
How your earlier experiences changed your life after the war  influenced the decisions you made after the war?
Did you know  by the time you went abroad  if not before  what was happening to Jews in Poland?
Do you remember where you were when you heard that I think the war ended May eight h or ninth  didnt it?
So my mother  before the war she taught  she was a teacher.
When we...we...when we got the message when the war was close to Vilna  we got an order from the main command.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 73 Zlatyn   yes.
So -- So this is anoth-another kind of very broad and very difficult question to answer  but can you tell me at all about how this whole compendium of experiences  both the horrible things that happened in the war and the wonderful things that have happened -- how they have shaped your -- your view of humankind?
But there were about later on I found there were about  probably about 50 000 prisoners there  you know [indecipherable] 78 000  but they were dying off so fast  and I later fi learned after the war that from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months .
And they were tried on slave labor using large numbers of slave labors  using concentration camp inmates  and going into occupied countries as Flick Enterprises and...and profiting from using the property of occupied people against the laws of war.
We were taken they took us to death march  and at that time was almost end of the war.
You would help  on some corners they had what they called the   where they made soup for something like a nickel  you would get a bowl of soup  good soup  good soup and you would help there by firing the cannon  or by cashing the money or something like that  you would help to collect raw material that was used for the war effort.
And quietly I was thinking to myself  ﬁWhy would a war be so bad?
We will we will teach you a trade  and after the war you will be working for the Reich.
You still believe maybe you -- I mean  you have figured -- its - maybe youre going to -- the time will come  maybe the war will be over and maybe something is go -- going to happen  yeah  a miracles going to happen.
When you so youve been back one time to Germany .
I was on the fourth floor with helping mentally disturbed people in the ghetto  as a result from the war.
And during the war -- in 1939  when the wor -- war broke out  he got a certificate for three people to go to Israel.
And I dont th ink we even contemplated the end of the 23 war or Poland losing the war.
And he was a survivor also  who lost his wife and two children in the war.
Was there still  in the early 50s  did you feel anti-Semitism?
Well  my nieces were born  not just after World War 2  but a long time after World  World War 2  World War 1  what do they know one from the other or the Civil War  the Revolutionary War  the Crimean War  I mean it's all one to people who weren't living at that time and I want them to know the story and I was anxious for them to have a c opy of it.
If you'll tell me a little bit about your life before the war?
I have heard of one fellow  I dont know who it was  made a big friend of one of the Ukrainian women and actually went and visited her after the war and they got married.
the sa -- the Soviet -- After -- -- the German Soviet war.
And we -- but you know  the war was going on -- Right  right. --
World War I. They brought over settlements; Poles  Czechs  even German villages we had a couple  Germans  strictly German.
He became an engineer  and he worked in the Polish corps of engineer in when during the campaign in in Italy  and there he met a British engineer who was working for the British corps of engineers  and they formed fre friendship  and they decided that they liked each other so much that ti after after the war  they opened an office.
And did you have any other name s that you used during the war time?
and very -- my  of course my -- my fa vorite child  Niemoeller child is Hammon  after Joachim  who fell in the war.
She married a man during the war  and they both died they were both taken to camps and killed.
I met Mr. Frankowski after the war  you know  and he treated us like we were children.
I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One.
And a lot of people even if they didnt have that yet  they got themselves a number  and a lot of them did have the affidavits  but the war broke out So they were caught.
Anyhow  she lived in the outskirts of the city  and subsequently she turned out to be one of those who did not prove herself to be a true friend  because she took things from us during the war that Mother wanted to give her to save  like a sewing machine  you know  things of value  and she absolutely denied.
Illegally but do something for yourself because here you are al ready surviving the war.
And that turned the war into the battle -- and that turned the war into the battle for England.
So your son Joseph  a nd -- he went to Israel in the late 60s  and -- Yeah  when the second -- when the war was in Israel.
By the way  we couldn't get out after the war because there were no  there was no transportation.
What Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16  2014 29 it was  was lemon meringue but it was war time and she got confused. (
This is the 50th anniversary this year  of the end of the war.
I found out after the war there were three other Jewish children being hidden there  me and the three others.
And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy  both i ndividual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war  but the experiences  the feelings  the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period.
Before you turn to the war years  please tell us what you can about your parents and what their ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 life may have been like in pre -war Paris knowing that because you were so young you don't have memories of those early years but you've learned some things in the years since.
And when the war started  he took a ship and he went to ton -- to the States  America.
Also because of the three people that I told you that had escaped our ghetto  word came that the underground was being formed  that the Russian prisoners of war that escaped and a few Jews who managed to escape had banded together and became a resistance.
Then after World War II  after his accident was healed  his superiors said it was okay for him to go back into the army.
So  that's some of the earliest -- and then suddenly a great deal of the war started intruding.
But my father served for four years in the German army  in World War I. Got the Iron Cross  and the whole deal.
One was killed in the first World War  in the German army  fighting for Austria.
I could have gotten  probably  a great deal of money that way  because of what happened to my family in World War II  and all this  but I never had  for a second  a thought.
And after the war she asked if I might -- would like to co me on vacation with her and her parents  they were going to a farm.
From Germany  I went to Austria-- [The war was finished  right?]
And what were your thoughts when war was declared in England ?
38 I was a German  though  th-they thought I was German.
Anyhow  there were three Secretaries of State with the War Re fugee Board responsible directly to the Presiden t. So we were in th at channel with the War Refugee Board.
I read a book before I come to Dachau it was in the western something new  it was for the World War I. I forgot who wrote the book  in World War I. And the guy that escaped from Dachau went to Switzerland and he wrote about the concentration camp and it was something new  and there was a description of a Dachau book about concentration camp in Germany  and I could not imagine at all before I come in  you understand.
Did you did you  as children  know what was happening to the Jews of the country?
Th-The German there  the -- the HakenkreuzHaakencroise has been put by -- put down  but you know  I was in a very bad   then I was [indecipherable] in very bad health  and a couple of days are missing  so you know that I remember of the days  a couple of days are missing  because very probably I was in a kind of coma  and instead of -- I -- I -- I didnt die  [indecipherable] a had a big chance  because on perhaps the 10 th or the 11 th of May  I asked a -- a ge -- a German soldier  who became prisoner in the meantime  ﬁHow about the war?ﬂ And he said  ﬁThe war?
Belgium declared itself neutral  like in World War I  but in both cases Germany didn't expect that.
>> Fred Kahn: Oh  after the war was over  of course.
This my two brothers  my mother  and me when...this was be fore the war.
I was at that time  when the war broke out  the biggest problem was to get gasoline  you know  to have -- so we had -- the Polish army retreated  and there was -- two officers were in Poland with a car.
My mother actually was most of her time in just the family and then the war started then.
They were they were soldiers  thats all they c-cared  you know  they wer they were fighting their the war  and no politics  nothing her-here.
There were non-religious Jews too  but I didnt know them  I found out after the war.
How much did people ask you about what your life had been like  for instance  in Auschwitz  and did you have a feeling that they were tryi ng to find out information perhaps for later  for war crime trials or pe rhaps just to comfort you  to see if you'd experienced any trauma?
Right before the war  some taxis us ed to pass through town.
And number two  I came from war-torn Europe  which had fallen back beyond the time when the war broke out.
So e-ev erybody who came  even they came from lo -- they start coming from the Soviet Union  people whos e -- who stayed there through the war  they didnt want to stay in Poland because the Soviet s are -- the Soviets are over there and you cannot -- you dont want to -- you know  its a -- its -- its a state which  y-you run away from that.
And during the war I went to  to city hall  and I made papers because I need it.
They th-they believe in God  but my mother very seldom used to go to church  and and my father  right before the war  I think  he went to to confession  and so on.
Basically that's the end of that story except that we didn't know what was happening during all of World War II because my grandparents were in Theresienstadt until 1944.
I'll put you in a staff section where you can have the opportunity to get promote d. So at that point  he put me in what was called G-5  Military Government Civil Affairs Operation of the Corps  and I continued in that until the end the of the war when I was reassigned to the G-2 section  which is intelligence.
Occasionally when I -- I do go and give talks to schools -- high schools  colleges and places -- groups of people  Ill talk about the Holocaust -- about the war time  and so on.
He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself.
She was a b eautiful woman and met her fiancee from before the war in Tel Aviv and they got married but she passed away a few years ago.
Effect on you from the war  that you  th at you can piece together.
I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war government in Germany right after the war.
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: Well  before World War II -- I was too young to really know too many people.
When theyre about 12 or 13 years old  and they were living with us in Ohio  we I used the occasion when their history in school  when their history reached World War II  and I used that as an occasion and said  ﬁI want you guys to listen to something.

>> Bill Benson: And then  of course  10 months later  September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland  launching World War II.
And these words were in my mind through all of the war.
A lot of people were also physically exhausted because they were not used to heavy labor ; the doctors  lawyers  people who did not physically work before the war.
I'll keep on fighting it as much as I can  and for a young person it's a horrible feeling to have like a death sentence  not knowing what's going to be and especially we did not have no inkling that how how the war was going.
So we didn't go to the war until December [1941]  so it was all right for us to stay in Lisbon  and that's where we were goin g to make our new headquarters.
Carla and I didnt talk about the war with each other.
The Cold War that came later seemed so so different  so difficult a period when we think of  we knew what the Russians were going through  that millions were being killed by the Germans  millions and millions of them.

He was a small slight man  older than the rest of us  he was in our mid to late 30's  a nd we didn't see him until the war was over  and heard that he had lost tw o fingers and part of the palm of his hand.
Uh...I had two sisters  and a little brother who was born in 1933  so he was 6 years old when the war broke out.
Then I went to cheder  to the Jewish school  you know  I learn Hebrew and Yiddish  writing  reading.
So that's my husband  af ter the war I married him.
Yeah  he was he went into the army after the war.
But one thing was certain: when the war was over and the people who survived from the community got together and they kind of gathered 51 all the information that was available  everybody knew that the transport from Starachowice wound up in Treblinka.
But I'd also like to say that due to World War II that was not the primary focus of the United States government  which was essentially to defeat Germany.
You had to learn during the war that everything which is legal is no good  and everything which is not legal has to be done.
But [indecipherable] the war came  there was no parade or anything  so -- So his problem was solved.

Can you describe how life changed for you when you realized that the war was entering your own little town?
Interview with Annette Fein November 7  2008 11 When you got what I guess Id like to try and trace is  when you got to the United States  or even if it was earlier  even though you were a child  a young child earlier  do you remember conversations coming up  about the war  about the Holocaust  about murders?
All of us were weak already  but we knew we did not know where we were going to go  but we knew that it was the last days of the war.
Now  during the war  you were not able to correspond with your brother?
And it -- we could take 50 000 over to Sweden during the war.
She  she went away from me  and she was staying with this guy until the war ended.
A nd this guy in and the Danish political leaders  to want him  they said  Mr. Hedtoft  H-E-D-T-O-F-T  Mr. Hedtoft  later became the prime minister of Denm ark after the war.
So it took two years after the war to get here?
They have no food they have no clothing they have to leave suddenly  and thats when we realized that a actually there is a war and that we are going to be involved  by probably being displaced also.
And because the Germans lost the war  in the First World War also  it became Romania .
When the war was over  it wasnt over for me yet because you know the war is over  you dont pack your bag and you go home.
Im saying aft at the war  during the war itself  there were other people who were taking these photographs.
He said they should have chosen death rather than work for the German war machine.
And they said  ﬁIn your -- with your background  you got yourself education after the war  which we consider college education  [indecipherable] military [indecipherable]  and you -- so -- so you entitled to it.
My parents went back to Holland in 1972 because they wanted to retire and they could do it there rather than here and it was also the year that I went to live in Vermont during the summer and ended up staying there and ended up actually having left New York City and shortly after ended up in a farm situation and I do wonder now how I had replicated my war e xperiences.
Well  the war intervened  and it must not be forgotten that Hitler put aristocrats in the first row of soldiers in Poland.
24 We were scared that theyll find us  you know  where can you --- Did your parents also read a news paper in the town before the war?
And did you still have non-Jewish friends otherwise  at the time?
Soldier -- or -- or -- or -- After the war? --
So that would be Š yeah; I think it would be 1940.
Well  I was called up by the draft before the war began.
There were groups of allied soldiers  I mean British and French  who were obviously prisoners of war and which you had seen throughout the war  always in groups  but under heavy German military guard.
Did you have any idea then  how the war was going?
In the me I-I guess they were losing the war  too  Germany  and the bombed the bombed areas everywhere.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 32 It took me until 1995  50 years after the war  right in this building  on the fifth floor  that I found out what happened to my parents.
My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War  and its horrors in Monasteer  but it was so far away that it didnt yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940.
Those  what difficulties I had as a result of gender  religion  perhaps age  I had after the war; I had after the war when I tried to get a job at Chase Ba nk in their foreign exchan ge  foreign trade section and I couldn't even get an interview.
When the war broke out -- when Germany marched into Poland  the German Army marched into Poland  France and Britain declared war on Germany because they had broken their promise not to go further  the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 Munich conference   so they declared war.
And we found out after the war from people we never saw our father again after that.
He came back home for six months and the first war world war started.
And her husband was actually at the Worlds Fair buying machinery when the war broke out in Poland.
We we had a we my parents met soon after I think right in 21  soon after the big celebration after the the victory of the the Bolshevik war.
And when you are when I think of the Spanish war  they did it in South America  killing  slavering  everything.
And later on  after the war we went to Russia because I went back to my hometown  which is another story  which Ill tell you about.
Between right after the war time I had a lot of professors  a lot of pr ofessors.
Then in 1939  when the war broke out  we went back to Lipsko because the house was burned in Zwolen.
These soldiers that were on the other side of the camp had been the prisoners of war  and they were now being repatriated to Italy.
And then I told her the war is over  don't you want to come to the United States?
I found out later on that he also sheltered a family in an attic thro ughout the war.
What  we found out of course once the war had ended.
They lived through where  during this 1992 war  there was a lot of talk about where the majority lived  and it was mostly on the border between Bosnia  Serbia and Croatia  going much further east.
In Germany the civilians dreaded that word  the Germans themselves  as I found out after the war  they called in \ Katset\   which was the letters KZ  as the Germans pronounced it and it was just  and what here?
And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there with his troops  holding out.
And this agrees comp letely with the description to Ezergailis book  which was taken from quite another source  namely from some of the executioners themselves  later they would test -- they would give depositions -- they were in -- in Russian custody and they gave depositions for some German war times -- war crim e trials.
I know that was a very busy place after the war.
The war was over  they knew they had lost and they were still carrying out orders of -- of making us obey.
Are you -- are you religious now  or have -- di-did you raise your children Jewish?
Then in 1939  declaration of war  my parents decided it was dangerous again.
What -- what did you hear  and what did you know about what was happening back in Germany?
And I tell you  when you went -- you go through a war like that  you become very selfish  too.
They said  we have a deal with Israel really has a deal with Jordan  war or no war.
Informati onally  as another one of the homogenizing elements in my life  at Penn State  it be ing a land grant institution  it required all freshmen  and sophomore men to participate in reserve officers training program  ROTC  in World War two uniforms.
So they took a lot of prisoners of war  and they were still in uniforms when I saw them  because we were guarding them then.
When did it sink in for you actually  the magnitude of what had happened during the Holocaust?
But I no have to tell you what happened after th e war  you know  there was a big mix.
And (inaudible) is sticking her nose here and there  and we're fighting for everybody else  and there will always be war.
In this time  and we were all classified since...since the war as...uh....neutral aliens and  of course  the English were...were not classified.
And that included the -- the -- the ones that ran away to Russia.
Literally days after the war in Israel in 1967  they went to Israel to visit family  after the six day war.
You know  Berlin had a pretty large Jewish community  and Jews were really liked.
And he was also from Vilna and they had a lot of prejudice against Lithuanians because for them -- I understa nd it also  because after the war I was even asked by people  how can you live in a -- in a country which is soaked with blood  with Jewish blood?
I dont know why he decided  probably ha -- asked for some prisoners of war  Soviet prisoners of war from Austria  he was from Austria.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 82 Yeah  yeah  was.
We dont need your help  you worse than the Nazis because its after the war and we walked out.
He had been a leader of a -- at home  before the war.
She hoped and hoped that maybe my father survived and he was taken by the Russians as prisoner of war and sent to Siberia which wasn't a pleasant place to be.
Are you more religious because of what you went through  less religious.
You know  war very frequently is  except for hand to hand combat  which we did not get into  war is very impersonal.
In this time when it become the war prisoners  Russian war prisoners  run away from the...from them...from the Germans.
Tell me about your parents and your family  before the war.
Because she is German and after the war  everybody said that all Germans killed the Jews.
I never went back to Poland   even though my fath my my husband show you the picture was a a lieutenant in the army during the war  and was injured.
You were in Copenhagen all together how long before the war ended?
We did a lot of war production in here  but there is nothing doing.ﬂ And I said to him  ﬁBut you know  but Seki Consol sent me here and said come o -- go.ﬂ That wa s before the weekend.
I really have no idea where or what or how  but I guess she's one of the 6 million Jews that vanished and that died duri ng the war and nobody will ever now where she is.
01:26:46 So  I'm just telling you the atmosphere wasn't any good  even before the war; and when the 16 Germans came we knew that the Poles  they c ould never defend themself and just against  because they had -- they prepared for that  for the annexation of  you know  without one shot.
Meanwhile  while I was there  the Soviet-Nazi pact came down  and that drove me even further from the party  because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler  and suddenly  suddenly the party people were saying that its just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English.
My mother-in-law -- my mother  for instance  prior to the outbreak of the war  was being courted by a -- a physician  because my dad passed away co uple of years.
Now I told you be fore that we worked in Ausc hwitz for the factory was building there  but that we never got a penny from them paid at whatever...that we just uh uh worked in order to keep...to stay alive  but that paid a certa in amount of money  small money 50 to the SS which considered us as and and and had a profit out of our work  so when I saw that statement in in papers sa ying that...and after the war when you had a West Germany and an East Germany  the of uh uh wher e the records had had been lost somehow and they wanted to register the stockholders and cl aims which certain people had against   so they published that statement and there all of a sudden I had a brain-st orm  and I said if they ask for claims to be registered  I think that we also...I also have a cl aim.
And being in the German hospital was kind of They were Germans  you know.
So after the war he actually came to to to Germany to take us  but we left early to friends.
Those who survived to a great extent owe this to this concerted action and I uh...this is really the only political effort undertaken during the whole war in which this was tried out from all uh sides.
Believe it or not  as of today I'm talking to you  Germany does not recognize that they were the ones who started the war .
He was drafted in the mili towards the end of the war  and went like everybody else  and was assigned to the navy  and became a cadet  to go to officers candidate school  and then the war ended already. (
Uh as as I said before  un...unfortunately we we found out after the war that uh uh my parents along with so many others had been deported to Auschwitz and so I certainly knew if not first hand at least I had an understanding for what uh had gone on during the war.
How -- now once the war broke out  again I got to use somebody elses dates.
She was actually married before the war and had a baby  but she lost her entire family  and she survived by herself.
They dont want to -- they saw another war coming without anything  at that point.
And then -- yeah  an-and -- and then you -- you -- and you -- were -- you were still interrogating German soldiers?
Did you  when did you ever hear of a man named Hitler.
Did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?
We had a feeling unlike the prisoners who were sent by Stalin to Siberia  who had no hopes that Stalinism would ever end  we had a great hope that the war will end and Nazi Germany will be defeated and we had a feeling that the others  our friends  people fight for us.
You know [indecipherable] I hope  and this was happen [indecipherable] hoping  and when the war was over Did it feel like a prison?
What were those war years like for you and your family?
When the war was over  did you make any attempts to find any family or friends that were left behind in Vienna?
My brother was nineteen and  of course  everyday you know  that we knew that England and France declared war  you know  that we knew right away.
Have you done very much reading and studying about the war and the Holocaust since then to try and get more understanding?
Yes  and then at the end of the war did you think y our father was still alive?
There was no question about it if the war started (?)
My father was a soldier in the Imperial Russian Army in World War I. It was a terrible war.
So theres always -- the war is a very important part of our life.
So did you really stop thinking of yourself as being a Pole and -- and just think of yourself of being a Jew after the war began?
It was in 1991  after a gathering of hidd en children in New York  that I learned of others in the United States who were saved by Father Bruno and I learned th at there was a book out that was assembled on Father Bruno and that Father Bruno's nephew  Michelle Rainers  who helped him through the war  lived in Denver  Colorado.
Well  you know  my father had the gr eat experience of the first World War.
And he had a contract with the war department to work at the military government in denazification  and I happened to be in that department.
And  as I say  you learn very fast during the war.
It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler too much either  but he always every day  he knew what was going on  brought something in  like an apple sometime  a little piece of bread  but he told me don't take it until I go out from here  because if they catch me I'll be in trouble  and he put it away at a certain place and then I left  Sam Spiegal 46 May 3  1995 before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come home  you know  back to the barracks  I used to share it with my friends.
So that is and the widow of one of the brothers  of Henry Batlaj   did survive the war with two children and ended up in France  where my parents never really contacted anyone after.
Oh  you move then you left Warsaw  and I left Warsaw immediately in January  and I moved to Lodz after the war.
Did you know  or did people in your family know   about the Germans; what the Nazis were doing in Germany at this time?
So  you dont -- you dont perceive any lasting fallout from your Holocaust -- your experiences during the war too?
Probably  among this Nazi girls  there was already awareness that the war is being lo st.
My father and my mother  I was told  during World War I  was a lot of smuggling going on in Europe.
`This may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a war veteran --- Is that really ---? --
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: Can you tell us about what you remember about war breaking out in your hometown?
When England and France joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English national anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio  there was literally -- the newspapers were hysterical.
There were also some escapees from the prisoner of war 39 camp.
Uh you two have a have a love story that goes from before the war.
Also  it will probably seem pathetic  because those two people who helped me the most  spent time in a concentration camp also  or else a prisoners of war camp and those two people  Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski  who was a camp commander -- police commander in Ashafenberg and also worked in a policer in Wildeflecken  was very sympathetic and very helpful.
But they got  of course also co -- caught by the fighting of the war.
For example  Pastor Niemoller 4 was saying in that connection  after the war in one of his big 4 Martin Niemoller was head of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church from 1937.
Because otherwise  you know  thats a big problem af ter the war  people were homeless.
From jail my brother was sent to a concentration camp that was set up for the Spanish Civil War.
18 During first of all the war  my -- independentl y  my father and my mothers family went to Vienna to leave the city because it was dangerous to stay in the c ity  and Vienna was in Austria  so -- so they were used to the notion that -- I see. --
The top of the boat  the better deck  was reserved for German war brides.
We have pictures of my father right after the war   not right  right after the war but in '46 where he looks fine.
You know  like a song or something  which I have it  and so -- Do you remember -- again  you were very young  any experiences in those early years after the war  of any anti-Semitism?
When they came back from Russia  so they came to Poland  but in this time when they came to Poland  I was already out I escaped before.
He was inducted into the army in 1944  again  as an enemy alien and became a citizen in the army and then was sent back overseas to Germany  first as an infantry soldie r. He was wounded  and after the war ended he went into mini -- military government as an interpreter.
Starting to go to a German school initially was a major problem  but as time went by  I made friends among the German kids in class and I was in touch with at least one of them for quite a few years.
I wish we ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 actually could take a lunch break  come back  and then have David tell you about what happened after the war when he left Panama  went back and joined the Israeli Army.
Thousands...thousands of Russian people were waiting for their sons to come home from the war and meanwhile they were laying in that ditch.
And then a few days later  the war was -- Wars on.

And here we are  a year after the end of the war  and these people are still homeless  without fresh food  I have in one of my memos an indication of some officer in some group situation  in a court or something  suddenly arrests a Jew who's 25 there.
First they wanted to get rid of all the Jews and after the war began.

And uh  we stayed there  we  we stayed there for about  about two years  and when the things were getting strange and difficult  I mean  I had this place called Le Chambon  which was actually the resort above St. Etienne  and no more than about 50 kilometers up  maybe not even so much  and uh  this became really the  the  the  the  the save  the saving uh during the war because I mean  you could always go there and  and put the children there  they had two little children's homes  and uh  you could  you could hide them there.

>> Bill Benson: So as difficult as those times were for you  your family  other Jews  under Hungarian rule  it turned suddenly dramatically and tragically worse in 1944 when Germany invaded Hungary.

My father was drafted into this  but because he had a medal for -- a bronze medal for heroism during the first world war  he went in as a company commander and was in for -- my guess is for a couple of years.
I wondered  because you've met so many other survivors  what the average effect was on their religious beliefs before the war  the effects on them  and how they felt afterwards about their faith.

My father was a soldier in the Army in World War I. He fought on the Austrian front.
But then after the war  you know  there was some -- there was some discussions [indecipherable].

Did anybody know what was going on in Europe at the time?
Laughter] >> Bill Benson: So your mom and dad did get here together in 1946.
And when the Germans came in  we tried to run away  not to go with them.
We saw more or less the victorious aspect of Germany  that means coming up with something new in the industry and designing a new airplane and being number one in this and so on  and eventually of course came the war.

Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 48 No  no  no.
It was wa rtime already  war started September first and I left the end of November.
How different were conditions in during different years over the course of the war?
And afte r the war  when I have been sitting in a -- in a official bureau  taking care of all the disabled veterans  and when we discussed this  if a man had -- had a very bad destiny  and needed a pension  for instance  a disabled person pension  then this would mean something  because of his nerves  that he had been through that.
Uh well  first of all  I was given a dinner here by the Jewish War Veterans for all the service uh found out that I had more medals than most chaplains who served in the service.
After the war Churchill had written five volumes  the second world war and in one of the volumes he showed how the precarious the situation was in England and the Britts didn't get scared  they got panicky.
Tell me  how did the war how did you learn about the war happening?
I worked in the coal mine till the end of the war.
Did you talk to any people who knew very much about  who were in this country  who knew very much about what was happening in the camps in the ‚40s?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 51 [indecipherable] l-l-l-legislation  but th-t heir excuse was that the Council of Freedom  in 43  had said  if that and that are done  its an offense  and it will be punished after the war.

So I do not recall from before the war  anyone by name  or so.
This is tape number three  side A. Before we move on too much into the post war era  I wanted to ask this question  and y ouve certainly touched on it many times  but why do you think the rescue of Jews  fellow citizens  but they were Jews  was so successful in -- in your country?
When...this is now two years after the start of the war... After the start of the war... Go back to the very start?
You know what the President Roosevelt did say at that time?
Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10  2014 40 When you were with these people  did you tell them about what you had experienced during the war?
I had four uncles in America  and after the war they were looking for family.
So in and then he he was kicked out and then he came back to Israel.
And you know that i-i-in 41  they started -- they became enemies  you know  Russia and Germany  in 1941.
But then it was the first World War  14 to 18  and Austria was  up to then very big  and then it is -- became a very little country  because Hungary left many Romanian born a -- so many countries were taken  were occupied by the -- by the [indecipherable].
In the first months of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews.
Here as you know dressed in only in rags and that was uh...but I was appointed by the uh American Joint Distribution Committee to travel on my own through all the south from uh Rome south to Sicily to look for Jewish refugees and we found...we found quite a few who were hidden and uh they didn't know that the war wa s over.
And  by the way  that job lasted from the e nd of October and until the middle of January  which was two and a half months  and that wa s two and a half months in an environment that was working under the roof  in the comp any of very intelligent Polish women  and after the war  I found out that 50 percent were Jews  Jewish woman under assumed Christian names  that showed you concern and care and shared with you the packages they were getting from home and created  not only a home environment for you  but a kind of an intellectual environment  as well  where after work  because we were a small group of 50  it must have been 25 women  because we were a small group of 50  we didnt have to stand and Zahlappel.
Interview with Hannah Kalman May 20  1999 11 No  but sh very shortly before the war  came dont remember the name.
Was your fi -- did your father go to war in 1918 -- 1914  or not?
We got together o n one of our first trips to Europe after the war.
I thought that he was dead but discovered only a couple of years ago that he was tried in Poland sometime after the war and was let go for lack of evidence  He would simply assault patients who came to him to be examined and he also conducted selections on his own  sending Jewish prisoners to the gas chambers.
But he was -- Did he become more religious after the war?
Well   what do ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 you have to lose?
Okay  on August 23 rd  1939  when the Soviets and Nazis signed a non-aggression pact  there was the fear of war in the air in Poland.
Actually her real name was Sarah Biderman  Krysia was he r pseudo name during the war.
We were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 maligned.
Can we talk now a little bit about your feelings and your thoughts about what you went through during the war?
Like I mentioned  the war was going back for the Germans.
So that  to sum it all up  I was lucky enough to be young enough to survive the war as a youngster  and to still be able - even though at the beginning  I did feel a little imbalanced  you know  my head was a little bi t further away - higher - not higher - more progressive - my head progressed a little better than my other emotional  but eventually  it evened out  you see?
Let me see what else I have on th e war.
And USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 18 we had  if the war  incidentally  had broken out maybe two months later  we would have been in America  because our -- our quota number was due.
But then we get used to it  people get killed  its a war.
Do you remember the circumstance of when you sort of first became aware of your mothers experience during the war  when you realized she was a Holocaust survivor  although at that time you would not have thought about it in those terms  probably.
They ended up in th e town of Bride -les -Bains in Haute Savoie  where they would remain for the duration of the war in France.
01:11:16 I remember that the war broke against th e Russians on June 22nd [1941].
We didn't know where they took them until after the war.
And and after the war  my niece went to stay with their kids in England   you know  so I mean   Ive lost track of them now  but its  you know Yeah.
Not during the war but when we were  when we went back. (
And then the war started  they 88 didnt do anything with it except they rented out the rooms.
>> Gideon Frieder: There was not much in the pre -war.
After the war  when my husband was dismissed from the military  we went back to Poland.
But this is the danger that he was -- he was denounced by somebody in -- in the district and after the war they got ma rried this -- and had a son.
And so when the war came -- when the - not when the war came  when the invasion came  we were in the war  but nothing was going  it was the phony war and in the phony war  nothing was going on and we were waiting for something to happen.
But they just didnt believe  you know  they were And when when your father found out about his sister how much after the war he learned?
We knew that the prisoners of war were killed  but where they were buried  we didnt know.
R: Well  after the war  I return ed to Prague becauseŠ because we had some friends who had some documents and pictures of us when were much younger  before the war with our parents.
was that camp  a tremendous pr isoner of war camp and against the rules and regulations of the Geneva Convention  they brought of these prisoners of war to Auschwitz  not to work like us  I mean like inmates  but in their uniform.
And from Munich we went to the Polish prisoner of war camp.
But the -- the context of the war at that time was that  you know  we -- we have to get into that European war because the ja -- the Japanese have already attacked us and were already at war  and that we have to go ahead and then do something just as my father did before.
I didnt know the operation  the secret operation  but after the war I was engrossed in all kind of reading books  whatever I could find  because we were  lets say  eager to learn what was happening behind our backs  you know  at that time.
So but they had my name  so thats where I went war in hiding and so on.
And eventu ally  in early youll have to pass something called a JMA  which was a this was during the time of the Korean War  there was a freeze on federal hiring  except if you passed this exam.
And then as -- as the war broke out  and particular it started first with the anschluss of Austria in March of 1938  the Deutsche bank moved in and took over the largest Austrian bank.
And so we did th by executive order  ba ba the president  and when the Korean war broke out all reserve officers were frozen  they had to stay in the a-all commissions were extended.
First  in...in...especially when the war was going on  you could have walked around in every home and do anything you wanted.
So I didnt know the extent of what the Germans did.
You know  you had people who came out of the concentration camps.
And later  in the 1945  when the war was -- was up -- finished  you know  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 56was exhumation on these people from this -- from this place.
It had barbed wire  or it had a wooden fence  whatever - it was surrounded by a fence  and it had guards  guard towers  you see  because that was very  this was so near to the factory that this was really probably war production area anyway  but they had guards  and they had Ukrainians in them.
They  after the war  I had problems conceiving and my brother told me that the  the obstetrician that checked me out  a friend  said that I need a miracle that I will never make it  they exper -- because of the experimentation.
Im just wondering if you remember the -- if the war was still going on or -- Yeah  the war was still -- I dont think Berlin -- I dont remember exactly the dates.
>> Erika Eckstut: We moved to Romania because my grandfather married a Romanian lady  and my father was from five brothers  and one of the brothers was killed in the Fir st World War  and my father was shot very badly.
Sometimes we knew that there would be ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 another battle.
He was overcome by emotion and I learned about that only long after the war.
He went to Holland too before the war  and he was in hiding  and later on he moved to Amst erdam.
Things went on [indecipherable] inside  you know  and and we see ok you know  like we used to see was groups of Jews being escorted from one place to another.
As a young child growing up with the Holocaust  I really -- I was about 3 1/2 years old when the Holocaust -- after the war  4  5 years old.
We have many arenas of war and people talk about peace and it continues.
Once you were under Russian occupation during those first few period of the war  what was life like under the Russians?
And Mussolini at the time was very nice to Jews there.
Well I  you just remind me on something  I joined the Hage nah too and naturally I participated in the war of liberation.
But he said  ﬁNo  you go with Mama.ﬂ And I said  ﬁBut I dont want to go  Papa.ﬂ And he said  ﬁI swear  we should live to see your brother.ﬂ Cause  as you know  my brother was studying in Kiev  he was not with us during the war times -- war  you know  period.
Well  my mother -- until the war  my mother kept fairly kosher.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 That left my mother and her two children to take care of everything that had to be done  to leave a home and move somewhere else.
So you said you communicated to your children about your experiences during the war?
Now uh the the situation prior to our being incarcerated in the ghetto behind barbed wires  the uh terrible attacks and killings of uh Jews in the streets of Kovno  right after the outbreak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto  called for immediate resistance because we had a...also even under the Soviet occupation  1940  June 1940 to June 1941  we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zionist uh movement or leadership let's say it was  but this is entirely different character.
I told you  they have a big  before the war  they have a big mansion.
they immediately activated that  an-and they were trying to give some kind of a priority to produce the machinery of war.
How much information at the time did you ha ve about what was going on with the war and what was going on with the concentration camps?
And then with the war coming along uh  I decided that rather than be drafted I would uh  join the Army.
And  you know  there was just always nerve wracking -- the circumstances were just that way  they w -- a nd they were serious people  but the war just made it that way  I think.
And then  after the war  the ones who returned  returned to practically nothing  and they -- they left Volos because there was hardly anything for th em left  or to do.
There were  there was obviously a shortage of food  although we were not starving yet.
And there were people that went th rough combat in World War two  who saw some of the camps.
If all of them wants to go and then the war broke out and I had to get go and  you know  and then we didn't Interview with John Truty 5 now how long the war was going to last  whether it was going to last a year  two years  five years  ten years or a hundred year war or whatever it is.
I mean  you  as a kid you -- Well  you hear war because of the sirens  you know -- you know  and bom -- they were bombarding already.
Bruno Lewy and Alma Shunam i. She married a man who became quite well known after World War II  Alex Shunami   because he was sent by the Yeshuv to Europe.
Which is something I di dn't know until after the war.
Were you very close to your brother from the very beginning?
I don't thi nk that...uh...more than 20 were remaining in the woods  and then from the 20  maybe 15 survived the war.
So tell me  how did it feel the first time you were back in Germany  how did that feel?
What did you see of what was going on with the Jews?
If that is the case  then she died after the war  though.
The first Friday when Germany declared war  they bombed our city.
I was assigned to a unit of antitank artillery and I took part in the defense of Warsaw  and on September 27 Warsaw surrendered  and I was taken as a prisoner of war and taken out first  out of Warsaw on the 28 of September to the west  and near a small town of Prostejov where we were kept  you know  thousands of soldiers in an open field and meadows and then divi ded in four groups; south  north  east and west  and since I came from the north I went to the north group  and we were loaded then on tanks and taken to the north  and we came to the town of Torun  which is a town some 40 miles south of my hometown  and there we were taken and unloaded and then taken to the other side of the Vistul We came  arrived at the western part of th e Vistula River and the two bridges which were across the Vistula were both damaged  and we had to walk single file to across the other side of the river.
But anyway  I started telling you before that I wrote this poem after the -- the -- the Yom Kippur War  and I -- I wrote in that poem that -- about how all -- all the energy and all the emotion that you put into bringing up a child  and then so mebody can pop that child o ff in -- in one second  in a war  on a highway  whatever  a nd I -- and -- and th -- I think most people dont -- dont think about this.
As I said  he instilled in me tremendous confidence  self confidence  and I think that helped me a lot during the war and after the war because he was a great optimist.
But what he told me that his dream was  before the war  to import cars into Poland and develop this -- this -- this whole idea of transportation.
And when I was in Poland  she show -- show -- show me this inscription  and -- and [indecipherable] if you said it was some preparation  yes  there was a -- a mobilization  and the -- there is a -- the soldier had to go  you had a certain no -- documents to be in the certain military units and so on  and slowly Poland prepared to do war  but anyway -- and this came to us as a big surprise  yes.
After the war  they dealt in - they eventually ended up manufacturing ladi es sportswear  actu -- skirts and blouses.
My mother had to go to work because it was bad after the war.
I wanted to get more of a sense of your relationships within your family and if you could state your fathers name and your mothers name and say something -- and -- and your sisters name and say something about your early relationships as a child before the war  with each of them.
And because there were so few German soldiers  they left at that point.
The Germans acknowledge what happened and made moves to get over it.
And  and the reason we survived the war was not because my parents had any money but my  my aunt and uncle in  in Ossin  my fathers sister and her husband who had been very close to my parents.
I remember her in Belgium right after the war and some years later  even the United States  her waking up during the night and screaming  having nightmares.
And at some point in the Ukraine sometime in the fall of '44 before the end of the war  when the Germans were going backwards.
In the barracks there was no schoolhouse  in the barracks  in one of the barracks and they had  there were some teachers from  that were teachers from before the war that started to teach those children.
Did you have -- Not maybe as much as the guy that predicted the end of the war  but in a certain way I was.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Iron Cross in the First World War because didn't serve in Germany.
During the war when you would see a German soldier  was that a frightening sight for you?
If he was born in 1893  then he would have been of draft age at what point  17 - 18 years old in the middle of World War I?
I mean  not the war [indecipherable]  but there was liberation for a war.
She didnt do it for money  because after the war  when Julian joined the army  and the first money I got  I went to her  and I gave it to I wanted to give it to her  she wouldnt take it.
Before we turn to life under the Nazis and your family leaving Germany  let's start first  tell us a little bit about your family and you in the years before Hitler came to power.
So  what was happening with your stepmother and half-sister during the war?
As as youngsters   I was involved with the Boy Scouts  the Boy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum  s-scrap aluminum to get for the war effort.
Well  I think I have covered what I wanted to cover about your time in the Resistance and Im probably going to move on to the post war ins -- I thought we could maybe take a break now.
It wasn't right after the war broke out because first I was really quiet and nothing much happened  although there was an area allowed but right after Mr. Chamberlain had declared war on Germany.

I do not think that I was bothered by it  because during the war  I was about a half a year or eight months  hidden under assumed name in -- in the parish of a Lutheran minister  so that somehow I was used to Christianity  as far as that goes.

And uh  so  my faith  that I want to talk about  I lost towards the end of the war  my faith in God.
>> Bill Benson: Go back a little bit when you got to Israel.

And uh  after four or five days  the Germans came back.
Just before they were shipped out  all of the disabled war veterans had to go the SS headquarters and the selection took place.
As youre pursing the enemy deeper into Austria  at some point  relatively soon  you get word that the war is over.
So the war was over and independence was in the works.
And we were supposed to move to Warsaw  but the war interrupted it.
When I say prominent  is people who got positions back after the war.
What we call Hungary now is only 1/3 of the area of what was before the F irst World War.

I don't need the world to learn anything from the Second World War  from the Holocaust.
I wasn't blond before the war; and during the war there was a lot of peroxide (laughter) and.... And you dyed your hair?
Let's go back then to the period of time before the war.
But  there were 29 no children now because of the war.
When you went back to Germany  what was your impression then of the country of the Germans?
The farmers had -- they would talk about the war  but they -- they didnt know what was going on.
Well  I dont know  but there was -- there was a lot of jokes during the war.
So they headed for the war  and after the war was over  they discreetly brought it back and just left it there.
Henry Greenbaum: After the war we were mad at the whole world.
>> Bill Benson: And your father had frantically been telling you to come earlier.

>> Bill Benson: As difficult as life was under the Hungarians  as you described a little bit of it  it suddenly turned dramatically and tragically worse when the Nazis came in and invaded Hungary in 1944.
Then he was--in the war--in the war  he was released from Dakow and put in the army and the uh--I happened to mention that I have a child--he don't live in the ghetto  so--so he brought--one day he brought me a bag of sugar and he brought some flour  I think like that.
I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war  and then he began writing short poems  and I think there are eight or nine of them  and they were written to me.
By the way  I had him arrested after the war  but he was able to escape so they asked me for help to find him.
But what happened was as soon as the Hungarians came in  my father was old enough -- he actually served in World War I under the Austria Hungarian empire.
Uh of course the the war doesn't look very good in '42  so uh the whole notion of going into any sort of resistance is totally utopian except under very extreme conditions.
So of course we knew then the Russians were allocated that territory  which included the city of Berlin  and as soon as they moved in front of us and on up to Berlin  they captured it  that the war was going to be over very  very soon.
01:09:46 Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 30 And then you were -- 11 months. --
Well  you know  for many  many years after the war  I was always dreams.
I mean I think that we  they were all part of our foreign service and I dont think that they knew much about it  but it was all very separate from the war until more rec ently .
Well  after the war  we came back to Dorohoi  and I hated this town.
It star t and came the Russian and begin the war and stopped my education.
She got married after the war  with this same man I told you about.
During the war years  when you were here with your parents  did they have any communication with family back in Europe?
As a matter of fact   the last -- on New Years Eve in 1944  we decided we will party  this is the end of the war  we -- two months and its ended.
And he said well and he said [indecipherable] So what was his role then in in Poland during the war?
In Bratislava they took us to the gendarmerie where  as a forma lity  we were arreste d  and interned in the synagogue  they took us to the synagogue that had already war m rooms  straw on th e floor  blankets  good food  everything  and we were told that next morning we are going on.
And then he came to Poland in 1938  and he wa s stuck; 1939 the war started.
Now he wanted -- as a -- Id said yes  I love him  but you should not marry in -- y ou -- in war time and as all what you can say and what you can say -- I talked about it.
By that time  perhaps what went through their mi nd is  that  since the war inevitably is coming to an end  its not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet troops come.
How did you learn that the war was over in Europe?
Were sent to to the United States after the war  I imagine to go to Japan eventually.
He was 57 years old and didnt have to be in a war  but he insisted on being there.
This is tape number three  side A. You were talking about Saddam Hussein.
All right  and then comes September 1939  what are your first memories of that  when the Germans invaded Poland ?
I don't know if they were compensated after the war  but not during my time  and I didn't tell them that they were going to be compensated  no  nothing.
Thats happened during the war in Poland  organize and you know  and the top was mostly the officer -- army officer who was not killed  who was not in -- in a camp  and organize  and the other thing was very good prepare  you know  thats life.
As I mentioned my -- my -- my godfather  Jusef Kameeta  who was before the war a -- a - a mayor of this Slominiki  yes?
And my mother wanted  on top of it  she wanted the awards that my father had got at the First World War.
On some level  he must have thought that he w ould survive the war  because otherwise  why would you do it?
We  the town we lived in before the war had a synagogue  had Jewish life after the war  152 in the Jewish M useum in Amsterdam.
You know like I know that the Germans lost the war.
But its I find it amazing that you we dont have dates for it  but it sounds as if your beginning of darkness happens fairly soon after the war breaks out.
These were Russians and this was the main even t that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews.

They tunneled themselves under the fence and escaped and there was much excitement and the Poles living in the neighborhood villages joined the Ukrainian guards in chasing them and they were caught by the by the two  by the Ukrainian guards with the help of the Polish peasants  brought back to camp  badly  very badly beaten and uh somehow the the authorities  the guards sent for the German Gestapo man who incidentally survived the war and was not not punished very much but that's another story...sent for the Gestapo man to come to deal with this breach of of order.
There were three kinds of -- for the Germans  they were -- we were already some what restricted because was a war economy.
This was the beginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war.
Were they concerned that the Ge rmans were going to come on in to the Soviet Union  or were they not very concerned?
All the problem start with the Second World War  where start the Hitlerism.
And I remember we were sitting not sitting  standing  because they were playing the  the \ God Save the King \  and the King was announcing that the war is over and on the radio in Lubeck  the Officers Mess  it was May eighth when the war was declared finished.
Anything else that reminds you of -- of those ti -- or -- or even of times before the war  when you were -- Pardon? --
It became a hot war in 1933  but I think German history is  is full of war against Jews  cold and hot and in between.
I was happy there despite the war  and despite the difficulties  it was a better time in my life  and so  the -- the loss at the same time when I was eight  after the war ended my grandfather died and that was a tremendous loss to me  and -- and I have very  very few memories of -- maybe the two years before he died and none -- none at all between eight -- eight and ten and a half.
I didnt -- it -- you know  it came  19 - in 1939 the war broke out.

What did -- what did you know about the treatment of the Jews by the Germans then?
Now  when the when there had been the first Soviet  lets say occupation  before the war started  did your parents talk about this at all  and was there any discussion at home about what was going on?
I was very...I want you to know that when the war ended  I...I weighed the equivalent of probably what is 70 pounds  and I was skin and bone; and I do remember that when that British soldier came  and asked me...he said he's...can he do something for me?
You know  there was a group of Jews sent into our ghetto.
He ended up then as a law professor at the University of Wuerzburg after the war.

A document after the war  orders when they came for the Jews  Pastor Niemoller didn't speak up because he wasn't a Jew.
On the 22nd  was Molotov told a bout  the war began.
In this photo  we see Marcel's mother  second from the right  and three of her sisters taken in Bride -les -Bains during the war.
So yes  she remembered me as the child when she left Poland.
02:14:42 Did you know about what was happening in the rest of the war  with the Japanese and that?
Now  when this becomes true  when this becomes public  when this gets out  this is the most crucial moment in the whole history of the war for the Jewish community.
Was a big pl -- you know  the Lodz ghetto was -- there were ca -- a lot of Jews there.
So it was not uncommon in the community my parents lived in that these things happened after the war.
I mean  they  my my uh family didn't feel it was safe for me to sit there and discuss the war with the Germans for one moment they could say  oh maybe this girl is Jewish and that would have been the end.

Did your father ever tell you about his World War I experiences?
02:09:05 I mean  you can tell from the way I spoke a few minutes ago about Roosevelt  that I had absolutely no question in my mind or emotions about the purposes of the war.

And then when the war started in September  after a while  when bombing started in Manchester   like many other British children  we were evacuated to the countryside.
When they found out the prisoner of war was Jewish  they sent him to .
Anyway  I went to the Jewish school now because in 1930 -- in 1938 -- in 1935 Jewish kids were n't allowed to go to the German school.

So to that extent maybe I have a certain amount of paranoia that I can trace back to the war.
We were  the only thing we knew how  when the war was bad  when it got worse  it got worse for us.
Before the war I think my father was transferred from other place in 1937  so we were not able to know too many people but they accepted us.
Beca -- Its hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts  and youre a 13 year old girl  and the war ends  and youre an adu lt on your own  and theres no one to turn to for advice  what to do  how -- what to do with your life  or how to -- to associate with people  or whatever.

And it happen ed that after the war he was in Gdansk and my one of my aunts was there  and they met.
And they -- they spend the -- the war in Russia.
Now uh...I spoke about this but then connected with this and we should perhaps speak about this in in this connection is the uh the ac tion which became also possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board  that is the effort of the attempt to obtain certain...the liberation of a certain number of Jews by bribing some of the uh responsible people  who in the year of 1944  of course  were not so cocksure as they were before and they had their doubts whether the the the war would be won and they had their doubts what would happen to themselves  and they were afraid what would happen and there were all kinds of uh attempts to to save thei r own life  or at least alleviate... alleviate their situation.
We found out that he was alive  so this was a -- th -- actually the Russians kept him two years after the war was over as a prisoner  and they accused him of being a German  so they kept him with the German prisoners.
Uh what were the most important actions of the War Refugee Board as you see it?
And then there were no boats to be had because there was war and there were submarines in the Atlantic ocean .
So  while that went on  the war finally came to an end and I came back to Washington with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law for the labor board.
Now  when we were in New York after the war and my parents and I were called to the German Consulate in Manhattan and we were asked if we knew anything about a German whose name was Tomachek.
I wanted to take the medicine  and also the most important thing I wanted to take  I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war.

So after you left Iss oudun  after several months  your parents  as you said  decided to go further south to Villefranche  to the town of Villefranche  where you would stay until the end of the war.
That was before all this happened  before Hitler came to power.
And Germany turned out to be a prison camp for you.
Didn't she have an interesting experience in Germany after the war?
>> Bill Benson: I guess in part that followed the Normandy invasion in June of 1944 into France.
One of the teachers was the wife of a man who was executed for being a criminal   war criminal.
And they were all bombed  and there were about 8 000 people who were killed in during those last few  few hours of  of the war  because that was May three.
Before you were occupied in 1939  what did you know about what was going on in Germany with Hitler?

And there I worked all the war until 1945  until I was called to the army.
My grandfather  by the way  died before he got to Auschwitz.
Music was playing  people hugging one another  people dancing in the street  there was nobody discriminated  like one family happy that the war ended  because everybody suffered.
Again  I know you were very young at this time  but when you were -- in the beginning  those first few years after the war  did you ask her?
And so in essence he became a soldier  fighting for Germany in World War I. Tell me your parents names.
At tha t time -- well  before the war -- the war starts September.
And of course  when we came back  we were get we were came back from from the war  we were all still in the reserves  and we all got called up on the same orders to go to to Korea.
Can you explai n  in this time before the war  from your memory  after the second world war  obviously even after the firs t world war  can you explain to me what a typical Shabbat night or yom tovim night  if you can  in your mind  put yourself When?
So  he promised jobs  and he promi he didnt say how  but what he did  you have t again  Im talking about history  after World War I  the French and German were not always friends.
So  he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people  mostly people without beards  and that shouldnt be  again  the Germans shouldnt dislike them and also  people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war.
Interview with Brigitte Freidin March 12  2001 25 Because our number came up to come to America and we went to Southampton and got on the SS Volendam and -- which was the last ship to cross the ocean before United States went to war then  in 19 -- what  41?
>> Bill Benson: Dora  when Germany launched its attack on Yugoslavia on August 6  1941  which  of course  was roughly 18 months after the war had begun elsewhere in Europe  you were away from Zagreb on a visit with relatives in Ludbreg.
Tool makers and whatever other tools th ey had that came in handy for the war effort and for that reason I be lieve that they had preferred treat ment at work.
The third category  War Crimes  that was a cinch: the Hague Agreements of 1899 had defined what's permissible in warfare  what 's not  any violation and devastation beyond the needs of military necessity  rape  plunder  poison gas -- things of that kind -- these were well established crimes  they presented no problem .
And I reproached him  and after the war when I met him  I said  \ I could never forgive you for having said that.\
Yeah  the prisoners of war  or did any of them suspect why your German was so good?
When the war ended of course  on the other hand  we started to see the first displaced people  displaced persons  survivors of the camps and the brigade as you probably know.
So that were very happy to see us come and help them out.
And a seamstress and a laundre ss  I believe  before the war.
Was the name Hitler ever mentioned  do you recall talk of Hitler or of war  because after all war has broken out during these months?
I know about the crematory in Bergen-Belsen  but most of the people -- the crematoria there were -- were Russi an citizen -- occu -- pr i -- prisoners of war.
Even during the war  when there were rumors of an aktion  and we came to them  they let us sleep over  me and my sister.
And do you remember when you re realized  or started to realize what the trade-off was there  that It was after the war After the war.
It happened to me the same thing in the war  he said  the 1st World War.
He was a down to earth soldier who was in World War I already  and he was a regular fellow.
He obeyed the business with a building and that product was a good friend before the war and they say he's going to save him and his son.
Because of my experience politically and because of what I saw in Czechoslovakia and feeling that it was all so inevitable that the politicians could have done other things  I started the war as a consciousness objector and I was in the Red Cross on the continent to start with.
And I said  well thats what we did  that Mussolini went to Abyssinia to re-vindicate the destiny of Italy  I mean all that rhetoric  pretending the Fasci romani as if he had become -- a-and naming the king eventually  when the war was over  and [indecipherable] it was 12 such a -- such a awful thing  that I was -- I learned that all this parade was -- was a charade  and although you couldnt speak in public  among fr iend  that was discussed all the time.
And youre saying that theres a sense that the -- the -- the -- that theres a lot of movement  and -- and -- and really maybe that the war is winding down  or -- or going to peak  I guess.
But in September of '39  when Italy entered the war  I came to my office and I found a note in the typewriter: \ Do not come back.\
Everything  you know  after the war  they put us in cellars  in the walls of the building  whatever it is.
And we had Russian prisoners  and you know  all kinds of prisoners walked alongside of us .
So you stayed in that situ ation until the end of t he war?
And for the young people now growing up that don't know what World War II meant  what they do not learn in books and high school.
That was a serious question because the -- I thought of newspapers as being wa r news  I didnt equate it with any other kind of news  and I didnt see any ne ed for newspapers after the war.
And the next day Britain and France declared war on Germany.
And having worked during the war  she wasn't going to despite the fact that we tried to disabuse her of this  it never worked.
I don't know if it would have been bigger if no war took place.
They didn't kill when there was a battle picking out Jews  but the Jews were the refugees.

>> Gideon Frieder: Many of the things I know came to my attention by reading the diaries.
But before the war  yo u had a pretty nice life?
That now is a war; and war will finish  and we will be all again friendly.
What -- what about the summer of 1940  the -- the first summer?
Months later in May 1940  the Germans invaded Belgium along with France and Luxembourg.
Well  we went back to my husban ds hometown  which originally was in Germany  but after the second World War was given to Poland   and the name  in German its Gleiwitz and it was changed to Gliwice in Poland   and it was under the Russian influence.
This country had gone to war with Korea and then again with Vietnam.
ALFRED SUNDQUIST: There was  strangely enough  I have  in other places in the war I had been in confined areas where there were bodies and there was a sweet smell of death  but there wasn't that  at all in this camp.
I felt more I was German and I acted like a German during the war  living under false or assumed names.
When I came home -- my father was dead already  I lost him right after the first World War -- and I said  \ Mother  you know we are Romanians.\
Many sea battles of the type that took place in the First World War took place there  and that's where Horty earned his spurs and was a legitimate admiral.
And they said now that the war deprivation  finally it got to me.
And I don't even go to any war pictures of any kind of war.
And he went to Coventry  I think  as a volunteer after the war  and helped to redesign the town of Coventry  which had been destroyed by the Nazis  including their cathedral  the famous cathedral in Coventry.
I come from a Orthodox home  but after the war I was an– an atheist.
And some people asked after the war  said  could you make it for me?
Without a positive outlook  you would have never made it through there  because you always -- you -- y ou did not try to get overly optimistic  but you -- a little bit you would say  well maybe the war is going to end soon  we going to get out and all that.
The house was built before the war  originally it sold for about 6 000 dollars.
But there were Frenchmen and Belgians there who just ran away from the war zone and finally wound up somewhere in the south of France because the south of France was then considered probably the furtherest and safest part.
Unless -- I -- I was just -- I wondered as I was reading it in your book and I read it somewhere else  that unless the sounds reminded him of so mething during a -- the war  or -- World War and that it wasnt thunderstorms so much  but something else.
We were not considered on the poverty level  but  uh  we were comfortable before the war.
If you would m eet the tram  if the tram would be coming  or if the person No  simple  simple this that was my own I was all the time thinking what will be when it end the war  I will find my parents  or not.
And they got married and they were leading a sweet life until  you know  th e war came.
In  I think from 1871  after the FrancoPrussian war  it became part of the of the Austrian-Hungarian empire.
The first days in the war we decided we had -- we have to deal -- there was an emergency  and the grea t -- the great danger is for the whole Jewish world.
Yeah  thi -- in fact  my father  what he did is he changed his appearance from the way he was before the war -- Mm-hm. --
So  he said  I became a soldier before World War I  and served in the Austrian army  and he told me the different battles.
Always when I have a dream  its always a dream from home  before the war.
And all of a sudden Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 65 the war  he found some way how to make a living  he thought he took over the whole thing  you know.
So I have a question about the beginning of the war.
What happened the day the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and eastern Poland ?
A-A-All along  you know  the feeling was that you know  we get togeth we we we meet again  and we you know  they when th either th-th-they leave Interview with Norman Miller April 15  2013 48they are able to leave  or once the war is over  well get  you know  join each other again.
SL: No  but he beca -- He became a -- He became a coward after the war.
What was going on in Poland  you know at that time?
And uh  then uh  they came back the next day and the 82nd airborne division got involved in this.
And  uh  the  uh...this man who took all our things  we had a contract with him that he had bought our furniture and that he had paid us so much for the furniture that and he got a receipt from the Germans that they had taken out the furniture that belonged to him  and when the war was over  he got the money.
Before the war [indecipherable] decided  because -- that he wants to go to United States.
We took the children there  my granddaughters and my kids there to show them where we were bor n. Was there any trace of your family from when you went after the war back to Boppard with your children?
And here too  they had announcement of things that happened in the Jewish immigrant community   and people -- also after the war -- I want to go ahead on that now  when people came over from the camps  they would have long lists of newcomers  where relatives could meet again.
You know  when Vietnam war first started  when it when it was first started in the 60s  late 60s  I was for it.
This was the after the war  we tried to to make a dress and we tried to to buy shoes  but the the United States send us the Joint send us shoes  clothes.
Well  they they had they had the allies put out a an order at the end of the war  they they had first of all  they had an automatic arrest category  that meant if a German  a Nazi was more than something in the Nazi movement  it required that if you found him  that you arrest him.
He came back after the war and he survived  but he was dispossessed of his company.
But that was really the last incident of the war  as far as I remember  other than going on guard duty in Star and Read  and eventually up to Nuremburg to supervise the destruction of German ammuniti on by German POWs.
There was a prisoner of war camp not far from Soly and obviously the Jews were all eventually  they say eliminated and Soly was sent off to Pona ri near Vilna and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated  but none of them surviv ed.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 117 Yeah  you see  you know.
They were  these were what the French used to call 40 and eight in the first war.
You overhear  so at -- at 44  when I was eight plus  I was kind of understanding a little bit more about war  sides  Nazis  Germany  others.
The east side of Poland because maybe still the Poland will win the war with the Germans.
Did you go to war -- did your parents and you go to Warsaw first -- Yes. --
>> Al Munzer: How did I get the photographs after the war?
These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany needed laborers  and they joined us.
Because my father went for a war and there was no information what happened to him for long time.
The company that I was with produced medical supplies  which were being used in the war.
So Roosevelt was sitting smoking the cigar  and he said  ﬁAfter the war  we will punish the guilty  after the war.ﬂ But during the war he didnt do anything.
So  we went  I think originally it was supposed to be for a month  but no sooner we were there  my mother took off and she went to Antwerp because there were many people who were getting married who had been separated duri ng the war and got together and she went to cook for weddings.
Do you feel that youve lived a normal life after the war  once you got settled?
We didnt find out the war ended in the spring of 45  so we didnt know what was happening.
Im very happy to come and tell you what could happened during the second war.
This is Fritz's war  and I ordered the apprehension of the guy who had been responsible for sending the remaining Jews after the Kristallnacht.

So this was a natural extension of your interests from before the war -- Yeah. --
Because the Russians were pressing from the east  and here was the government  and -- who had to be bombed into submission  and bombed to -- to accept the -- the ca -- Thats quite an entrance afte r youre trying to escape from -- 90 Yes  and we escape the war only to -- to fall here  and mind you  what happened after that first bombing  the raids continued to the point that they came every single day to bomb Bucharest.
After the war  my mother contacted him when he visited Cincinnati.
I remember one day shortly after the war  a man totally knocke d at our door.
Tell us what you can about the circumstances for you and your family once the war began and then about your father being conscripted into the Labor Battalion.
After the war  you know  my aunt first gave me out to the Red Cross.
After the war there was a book published of survivors  and nobody that she knew was in the book  not even my father.
She had a new child after the war  wonderful child  very devoted but that woman didnt even dance at her own daughters wedding.
So tell do you remember when you hear heard the war is over?
We knew all these things  there was  forgot the name   Polskin  gosh how could I remember  forget these names  anyway it was war preparatio n  that every high school student had to participate in.
I do know that for a time period  I was fortunate enough to to live with an uncle of mine for a short period of time  and and then I got moved around  and ultimately I wound up in as I said  in this town called Kettering  in two and a half hours away from from London as as war war came to to pass.
Beginning of '44 and so on when it wasn't very much -- you didn't not ice very much of the war then in Budapest at that time even if Hungary was an ally to Germany  you know .
I keep on finding out either from the Archives  from the many books that I read  from the history of France and World War II.
It is  but I   but I think that is so common to most of us women and to most people that Im not sure where thats a remnant of the war years Anita Frank 80 [Date not labeled] Page 80 or whether that is  that is a  whether  whether that is just part of being  most  few of us sort of like to be corrected or  or criticized or disapproved of so  I think  I still  theres part of me that still wants to please others even though intellectually I know thats not what I should be doing.
I mean in Poland but they were Germans who emigrated to Berlin righ t after World War I. And my grandfather became a banker in Berlin and my mothers father.
And there is a very large cemetery which I visited after the war  and uh  I assume that most people are buried there.
They -- they took two hour lunch breaks and they lived like kings and the war was over for them  they had all th e time in the world to straighten out  to -- what they -- their how -- their main job was to check civilians  who was a party member  who had to be denazified  who had to be sent away to a camp or something.
And they -- I think we -- it's unbelievable today that th e unit of the Jewish people and the joint action of Jews is such a normal thing  that we have es tablished it  how this was bitterly fought in the three years before the World War II started.
And then I was transferred to the War Crimes Commissi on.
And they knew of a woman by the name of Tolla Wasserman -- her maiden name was Ashkenazi  who had been born in 1909  in Lvov and who had gone through the war  was hidden by her maid  she had a Polish maid who was able to cordon off one room in the apartment  very much like Anne Franks thing  and they remained there for 18 months.
Instead of allowing the remaining survivors there to be liberated  the Germans decided to evacuate the camp.
Did you tell him after the war  that you had left  knowing that he was coming?
One of the brothers immigrated to Argentina before the war  and three other brothers stayed  and then two sisters stayed in Poland.
We had 500 high ranking German officers  who had spent their time in Norway during the war  who wouldnt believe all these stories that were being circulated around about concentration camp.
Then little by little when all the arrests came and the war came  then when the Germans invaded Norway and Denmark  I had already my exams at that time.
The rest of the war  he spent appearing extremely loyal to the Germans and at the same time appearing as Šacting as a friend of the Jews and inmates of the concentration camp.
And we -- if they want to waste it  thats up to them.ﬂ Were you more sensitive to this because of what you experienced during the war?
And then when the war ended  they had to liberate us because we were not aliyah63  you know  at our request  because nobody wanted to be there; it was bad  there was no food  and I got married there and I couldn't find any occupation in the situation.
And when the war started  there were no more letters from my parents  though -- the contact between Germany and England  there were no mail -- there was not the usual mail service  was completely stopped.
This is tape number four  side A. -- in December  1944  the war was over in France and she still died there.
So you met your husband when you were about 16 years old  before the war.
When the war started he saw that he can speak to the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard.
I understand that according to German plans they were supposed to -- to occupy my hometown the second day of the war because it was only 70 kilometers away from the German border.
The war  oh I think we didnt understand too much of the war  and -- and we didnt understand particularly na -- the general catastrophycatastrophe e of the -- of -- of the attack against the Soviet Union .
With a broken heart I went up to the office and the mining engineer  with this smirk on his face tells me...Miss Felecita  what will you be after the war?
But I don t remember any any Ukraines being happy that the Jews were So other than the fact that your father couldnt hire Ukrainian laborers  for the first war of the occupation  Im talking before the fall of 1942  during that first year of end of 1941  beginning of 42  were there any other changes in your life  or is it basically carrying on as before?
And now like will have his and after the war we want to take his body out but the town didn't allowed us.
And whoever appeared not employed in a meaningful way that involves supporting the German war effort was being singled up  put in a truck  shipped to the railroad station and put on a train and shipped to Germany.
And then eventually we wound up in this lovely  lovely little town  shortly before the end of the 103 war  and the people were very nice.
When you started learning mo re  realizing that theres a war  and hearing the guns  and somebody saying that the Nazis are doing things to the Jews -- wh -- however you heard it  did you start getting afraid then  or -- No  it came in a good time  because it was th -- Because it was at the end?
But even after the war when we took off the star  the clothes were old.
But that makes me think of those young  Jewish women  who sounded as if they were so materialistic just after the war  when their -- they -- [indecipherable] -- they go after the boyfriends who could provide well for them.
Yes  I -- Im a citizen of the United States  I have all my full rights here  but somehow I feel like I belong there becau -- and -- and I think thats as a result of having survived the war  not having a place to go  thats all. [
At 12 0clock that day  the  Molotov at the time  announced that there was war and attack on Russia and there wa s war between Russia and Germany.
After the war  when I tried to search for them  I found out that she committed suicid e. You know  they experiment with a beautiful young woman.
>> Bill Benson: So once Paris was liberated in August of 1944  your father pretty quickly made his way back to Paris and then came back to get the family later.
So the card said  Agnes  you are  you should help your mother with your sisters and you are now old enough to read Tolstoys War and Peace and it is on the shelf and he exactly explained where it was located.
On the other hand  I remember exactly the exhilaration in the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 town  in the little town about the end of the war.
And especially in the last ter -- months of the war.

He studied first at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville before he left and then when he was wounded toward the end of the war in 44 and came home  and ended up teaching military government at the University of Michigan.
I remember before Hitler when I was a young gi rl  there was Shushnick and Dorfus  I remember the night when Dorfus was killed and they were shooting in the streets and it was like a civil war  but it didnt last too long and then Shushnick came and in a few years  Hitler came  right?
And that's when the war ended  Fi rst World War  1919 or so.
But eventually  towards the time close before the outbreak of war  only the main store remained functional.
Is there any ex pectation that theres going to be a war?

I dont know if he was a communist at that time  or if it existed  but he was fiercely anti-religion.
So  I went to these friends of my mother's who lived in Lodz before the war  and there were several families there that they all lived in Lodz.
So -- but when a -- when it comes -- you know  at that time  I didnt pay my -- m-much attention  you know  oh gosh  there was a first World War.

He was a very interesting guy  spoke English fluently  had married an American girl whom he had met when he was attendin -- attending our army war college in 1928  and he -- he was a very 64 helpful individual.
So thats really what the war crimes trials were all about  you know  just actually it was just a ha it was really a farce when you really think about it  because they just wanted to get rid of these people that were guards there  of the of the inmates  th-the pri the prisoners.
He was injured during the war  and he wanted to become a a how do you call?
And then a little later on  another cousin who had survived in Bucharest that I didnt know about then for for some time  til after the war  quite a bit after the war.
And how about the Holocaust and the war  does that seem remote or is that just with you all the time?
ﬁThe war is going to finish and we're going to see your mother and everybody is going to come together.ﬂ My father wrote to Stalin a letter that he should let my mother come and if the war wouldn't have started my mother would have come with the children.
And when the war started  the Belgiums and the French  uh  arrested everybody that was German  men first  uh  mostly men  in some cases some women  but my mother and I did not get arrested because we were German.
You said your husband was from Iasi  just tell me what happened to him during the war.
Q. Did you ever experience personally remarks or any anti-semitic attacks before the war?
So I have to emphasize that I was a little too young  even though after the war  we were considered political prisoners  but really  there was no real ideological reason because I didn't understand national socialism as I woul d understand it today.
Its not USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 83 end  its still going on  but it was already very late April and they said th-that the war was over.
This was only a few months before the war started in Krakow because we were then in Krakow and my mother came to...to visit us so we made a picture.

Did you feel Jewish in a different way in Israel than in America?
And I will tell you why  of the various possibilities  which I wont go into  I decided to do a World War II history.

She told one of the neighbors who had deci ded not to go  to wa it out the war or whatever was coming  she says  if my Charlotte come s  please keep her for us.
There were  you know  af ter the war  I suppose there are some statistics.
And the nephew  a young soldier tells me that we lost the war at this time.
After the war I saw a lot of paper money around  bags of paper money  and I knew that thats where the money went.
And that year my parents went to a spa and it was the last months before the war broke out.
If I had remained in Austria  and there had been no war  I would be a German hausfrau .

>> Bill Benson: Especially  as you said  at this point we were losing the war.
Interview with Brooks McClure July 7  2011 63 Well  when youre young  and the war is over  it sort of it can go with the territory.
Fourth om -- of May  I think  and people were running thr ough the streets  the war is over.

Interview with Jacques Ribons 31 And later on  we found out ther e were labor camps  after the war.
in those days  it was shortly after Worl d War Two  the people were born  the G-Germans -- You mean World War One  th ey were born shortly after -- World War One  correct  sorry.
Uh  well  then I also remember  I remember that about perhaps 10 days after the war broke out  that the Germans and that was a treatment that was apparently meant for the Jewish people.
I would say if -- after the war  I did not believe in God.
Did people pressure you after the war to rem ove it or tell you that they think you ought to?
In th-this  the war went on  and in 1920 -- 1920  Pilsudski came to power.
We did not leave September first  we left September third  because my father insisted on staying three days in Krakow aft when the war began  because people were coming to the bank to get money out  and he felt he couldnt leave and disappoint them.
And...uh...of course  many people had from World War I w eapons that they brought home  souvenirs  sabers  a long saber they carried these tremendous sabers  and some had guns and many had knives and a law was passed  ﬁNo Jew is allowed to have any weapons  any knife over a certain length  etcetera  etcetera.
I was called on stage  and we supposed to complete the prize to have the bars pinned on by a general because it was stated that I was the first naturalized citizen after the war who became an army officer.
Athens before the war had a population -- a Je wish population of approximately 2500 persons.
Or of this innate insensitivity to Jewishness  or anti-Semitism  whatever you want to call it  people were brought up with this sort of thing and even though the war was over and done with  it was still there.
>> Bill Benson: Before the war began  I think you told me your father eventually joined your mother in the business.
So there was an uprising against the tsarist regime before World War I?
If you can  talk a little bit about before the war actually interrupted your studies  what were you hearing about what was going on in Europe and how was it a part of your consciousness?
What happened one day  fall 1941 -- 44  we were detached to build fou ndations for a new Berlin after the war.
I didnt know anything about it  of course  until  you know  after the war.
Some of my aunts were members of the communist party from before the war.
Then at the end of the war  it was the fifteenth of May  1945  I escaped from this prison.
And then after the First World War my mother and h er mother and brother and sister  migrated to Vienna.
These bodies were lying along the roadsides where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they were shot because they weren't going fast enough and  uh  it was a terrible thing but  uh  it was practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war.
And after three or four days  it seems like an eternity  they sent us to a camp which was being built by Russian soldiers--by Russian prisoners of war camp.
So the talks were on the subject of military efforts  and an-and Europe at that time was sort of sensing oncoming second Worl d War.
One of them came back after the war and he w as like a living skeleton.
And also  they called those rockets  the rockets  you know  where they to shoot up  and wit that was the Vietnam war  I think it was that.
We were hoping that we can stay til we  til the war is finished  but it didn't turn out that way.
Do you remember the first thing you ate that tasted good  after having such horrible  horrible  and virtually no food during the war?
Well  we only spend a night or two there and after all  you know  the war is over  you cant hold it forever and you know  the whole reasoning.
I would I would not think I would think that Polish cinemas or cinemas in Poland would not be showing German newsreels  but Im trying to get a Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 46 sense of how much you saw the actual did the did you ever see a Nazi  for example  before the war?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 80 Well  you see  after the war -- oh -- oh  after the war was ended  theres -- there was so many widowers  so many invalid s  you know  people unable to work.
And one day one of a couple of Germans came out with a white flag and said that theyre currently name I I cant remember the name  but it was a rather  later on  well known in in in the history of the war.
When I stood alive after this  after the war  I went to see her.
But before we turn to that time  why don't you tell us about your family  your community  and yourself in those first 10 years of your life before the war began.
The staff tended to divide between those who were working on aggressive war  those who were working on the maltreatment of people in the occupied countries  including...and then we had a separate group working on the persecution of the Jews.
His wife  and family was evacuated du ring the war  and they were living in the countryside.
I -- I -- I know at that time I had no thought of the war ever ending.
The Russians came in  you know  1st World War...it looks like 1st World War  but the Germans are running away.
They felt that the war come to an end soon and decided to build an underground factory  and this was someplace in the woods which was where we were digging  and there was very stony ground and wheelbarrows and carrying stones and digging ditches  mixing cement.
Did you have any knowledge of what was going on in Germany and Poland ?
Can you talk about those  trying to reconstruct your and rebuild your life together in those few months after the war  in Paris?
Any war is horrible  but it was done by an intelligent  educated  bright people  to take a whole nation and say vermin we are going to make the earth clear of you and have everyone pa rticipate.
I didn't know too many people before the war started and so I couldn't find many people and they ca red for us very well in Bergen-Belsen  but it was all after the war.
And then  even it was so far that Stalin send advisors  his advisors it was like secretive  what knew only later on  civilian advisors  not even to the government  but ev en to into factories  and it started the end of 1949  that it started a trial against people  against communists who were in high positions even before the war in Czechoslovakia .
But I didn't  I couldn't because he was accused in Austria and convicted of war crimes against Aust rian refugees but he was also in Holland responsible for the deportatio n of Anne Frank  who  my real desire  but without him the whole thing wouldn't have worked.
When the war started  I was fifteen and a half years old.
And they started to get lists of people who survived the war  to be able to match them up with children that were collected in the -- in -- from camps.
When the war ended  I was in the vicinity of Dachau  near Munich  where I was liberated and met the American troops  who liberated me  actually.
Just Germany occupied by Poland  a piece of Germany that Poland took.
And we -- of course  we didnt know then by what brutal means they were being killed.
Prior to the German occupation  did you know much about what was happening in Germany?
Do you think you would have been a different person today than you are if you hadnt gone through what you went through?
Do you feel as though you and Earnest have sort of a bond or a connection because of  your experiences are different during the war but you  you did have  were persecuted?
But  when the German army retreated  it -- it was no different than -- it was same as the Egyptian army retreated in the Negev  you remember in the Six Day War?
Even though the full brunt of the war would not come to Hungary until 1944  4 1/2 years later  you felt its effects almost immediately.
You were just turning 11 when the Nazis overran Poland and World War II began  but the war came to you and your family in Belgium less than a year later  in the spring of 1940  before you tell us about your journey to safety and what you experienced during that time  tell us first a little bit about your early years  about your family and your own life before the war began.
Invaded by Hungary in 1938  but returned to Czechoslovakia in 1945.
Im Dee Roberts and I wanted to know what was a lot of times people have expressed that liberati on was a sort of an almost anticlimactic because the war the feelings and the survival was so heightened and you know was so the day to day survival was so intense that afterwards there was a sense of not knowing what to do with your life.
I mean it was sort of bizarre because here were German Jewish refugees.
She went through the first World War  and she said this was just equalizing things out.
We went to Israel in ‚67  right after the six day war  and we stopped in Rome.
So  what happened when the war came  and you end up serving in the war?
You know  three bunks  I dont remember if I was in the bottom or middl e. I think I was in the middle bunk.
And we were brought up religious as I said earlier and I had some  not long  it was a very short period after the war that I thought maybe it be better to just throw up any sign of religion  just live as a human being  period.
I just felt that the Germans will probably eventually come around to understanding in their own way  what a horrible  horrible thing they did  that was unprecedented  that was unimaginable  that was beyond and -- above and beyond the human un -- human understanding  you know  that -- because  as I was saying before  this wasnt a war like the other wars  like the Crimean war  like this war  there -- where there was shooting USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 171 between soldiers and there was armistice and the war was over.
The Germans still feel this was a war crime  it was done with the British and th e Royal Air Force.
Its obvious that they didnt believe They didnt believe that they lost the w the wa the war.
Well  unfortunately it didnt work out  World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered.
And in -- during the first World War Denm ark was neutral and came through without any problems  so everybody was hoping that itll be the same this time.
In 2 years if the Russian fight that way  2 more years the war won't be over.
from CNN approached me  I  by coincidence ri I get the this magazine  ﬁWorld War II History .ﬂ In that magazine  showed the nine scientists that Germany had.
His family  before the war broke out  came to Odessa to visit relatives  and the Germans killed them.
But how did you feel when when it sounds as if  from your telling  that there was no punitive interest at all  in from the U.S. military side  and the OSS   at least the arm that you were involved in  or the unit you were involved in  in catching anybody who would have the word is war criminal  but who would have been involved in  lets say the persecution of of of Jews  of civilians  or anything like that?
And so far  Hitler was taken from out of that criticism  while certainly all the soldiers would say  after the war  then we will change the regime.
Look in the eyes  and I thought my gosh  he said if you will be afraid  how could you live through this war  she tell me.
And then the woman below us  who was a fascist during the war  she said  \ I saw you got on -- you know  it was dangerous for her -- dangerous period for her.
And finally  do you feel that there have been things in your life  decisions  or the way that youve approached things in your life that come directly from  you know  the experiences  what you went through during the war  what also  in general  the Holocaust  you know  that experience?
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 101 Not too long.
My father said  \ If you go into this war  and you get injured  you come home I beat you up like you never have been. \  (
I used to play chess when I was young  you know  before the war.
So that when you talk about those people who were put into the concentration camps  especially before the war  there -- and Im just wondering  is there a connection betw -- because the United States is not letting in people who said they were homosexuals at a certain 46 point  and that -- so it didnt matter that there were homosexuals who were being persecuted in the concentration camps.
It so happened that Interview with Guenter Lewy 7 March 18  2013 he was a war comrade of my uncle.
I'm curious how your parents spoke to you about what was going on in Germany and the world during the time you were grow up there and then ultimately why you were coming to the states.
Maybe I saw it before the war  but I dont remember it.
After the war I worked briefly for the JDC and the UJA  about a year and a half.
They used to bring us the news of the day  where the Germans are and where the Russians are and I think the war is ending is because they weren't real soldiers either.
Edy  when she was in the Army  after the war was over  went back to Adelsheim and she was walking down the street in Adelsheim and people came up to her and said -- [Speaking Non -English Language].
She lives now in Washington  D.C. Survived the war  of course.
You see the dir ect link of this action with the creation of the War Refugee Board.
Q. Were there periods before you were married and after the war where it was lonely because you didn't have any family?
And then every few years we went back  because -- I especially went back to the ci -- be side the cemetery  I have this friend over there in Budapest  they moved to Budapest with a big family and they always waited for us  you know  with so much love  and -- and just like the war time  I remember she was always so nice to me.
I have letters that I wrote to my mother as a young child of six  seven  eight  in which I tried to comfort her and assure her that my father would be found after the war.
War crime is what Viel did to th ose seven Jews  thats a war crime.
Now  your life was difficult because your mother had so many of you to take care of  but perhaps you have good memories before the war?
Absolute -- Go straight – So  after spending part of the war in the U.S.  you returned to Europe a few months before the end of the war  I think.
Had you heard anything about what was happening to the Jews?
She survived the war and the boy went to pales -- to Israel  and she went with him to Israel.
And di So we made these people feel pretty small  you know  thats and they if and the worse they behaved during the war  I think the more afraid they were.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 >> Bill Benson: That was the first time you saw that?
Did you -- while you were there  did you see any people -- any Gentiles you had known before the war?
He was taken to th e war and he was close to Leningrad  Stan .
After the war  I found a poem where she writes about it  that they thank for their life to me.
But after the war my parents stayed in close contact with her and in the early fifties she came and spent part of a summer vacat ion with us.
And then I'd like to you tell me a little bit about your childhood and background before the war.
They were running short of soldiers  so they took all the soldiers who were doing the dome stic duties in these occupied countries and put them in the front  i-i-in the war front  and they replaced them by drafting the Dutch boys.
So  when you get to meet your parents  its actually right at the beginning of World War II  because September first  Germany invades Poland .
And I think hed -- Im not sure whether he was still wearing concentration camp pajamas  but then we -- when I went to work for the JDC  of course  that was in the early days after the war and that was -- those first -- those six months between May -- if thats when I went to work for the JDC  in -- no  we said I was in Paris first.
So if he was able to gather intelligence  and pass it on  being an himself an intelligence officer from the Soviet war  he knew how to do it  and he was able to maneuver it  and fortunately  a-as as I said  Leist was the one who saved many lives  including my fathers and my own.
Do you remember after you marched in or were dragged into the Plaszow camp  do you remember what it was like that first day?
It was a learning lesson in politics  for when -- I made up my mind that I would ha ve never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I would have to do something with protecting huma n right  and freedom of expression.
You said when the Korean War broke out  there was an effort to re-mobilize you?
Then they sent me to a place to unload shoes and confiscated merchandise from Belgium and France that raided during the war.
So  tell me a a little bit about what happened to your family on September 1 st  1939  when Germany attacked Poland .
Although I went back quite often to Chalus to see friends and distant relatives there  I really spent my time in Limoges in 1933 into 19 -- I mean the end of '33  December -- from the end of '43 or beginning of '44  until the end of the war  in Limoges.
I was thinki ng one thing that came of the war.
He of course was nothing at the end of the war.
I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem when all of a sudden I  war would be overŠwe were always optimistsŠand I could go to  instead of the first form to the second form a nd Latin would create the biggest problem.
>> Bill Benson: Nat  although World War II began with Germany and Russia attacking Poland in September 1939  it wasn't until 1941 that the lives of your family and other Jews in your community near the city of Iasi changed dramatically.
Then ther e was a brother  the youngest brother and he came through the war.
And -- during the war and so it affected them in many different ways.
Unfortunately  when they married  it was in 1914  the war came.
War broke out September 1 st  1939  which means Kristallnacht was ni November 38.
I didn't know what he had in mind  but that group came into the Ghetto under SS supervision and under supervision of a man named Cukurs  a Latvian war flying ace.
I stayed in camp a while   until the Germans were losing the war with Russia.
It was -- It was a very bad area where the war was concerned  near Jerusalem and th-the location of our kibbutz wa s very vulnerable.
How could the war be over if we are still in a camp and they are marching?
Do you remember the first day of the war or when Poland was occupied  do you remember what was happening?
And thats why we lose the war  he said to me.
>> Bill Benson: You described to me that that time after Ljudevit came back and it's the three of you  until the end of the war in May 1945  that that was a period of just constant fighting between Ustasa and the Partisans .
And during the war you know  World War II was partially par -partially financed by the American people .
I mean  my father was a soldier in the first World War.
You were not yet 5 when Germany invaded Poland September 1  1939  starting World War II.
So they just couldn't believe that what the -- what these women are thinking  and  of course  they -- the y were not how -- they were too honest  too straight to know how -- how to live during war time.
So our experience is war related more so than Holocaust related.
Then  there was  after the war  in Ukraine  near my town  a family that I told you they were hiding  four kids in [indecipherable].
Some of them younger  but -- Did you go to the large 1983 American gathering of Holocaust survivors?
When I was a little girl she took me on a trip to visit her uncle  her paternal uncle who had lost a leg during the First World War which I find very strange.
And also  the windows were taped because we were afraid of gas war fare.
That day  luckily it was in 41  and the war started.
The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned  the wa r started  in September of 39  so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of 39  its the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didnt touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy  at least -- I have to use a French word  insouciance  that we we re not bothered.
After the war when I -- I had to search for her again  I found her  and she was then very sick.
She had an aunt who and a husband and family  and they went to Paris from Warsaw  and right after the first World War.
We -- this what happened just after the war  and I started to think independently  was that I started to understand the great effort of my parents  and parents of my friends  that they fought to reach this independence.
That was -- NATO and that European movement was in order to avoid war.
They would have found us  or we would have found them  but nothi ng happened after the war.
But this was this was the real war  and this was I my life was saved  because of different good people.
This camp and this camp Jewish inmates were together with Soviet prisoners of war.
And the children knew  I mean  they knew what was happening  they knew the -- the danger of air raids and [indecipherable] during war time  and after what theyd gone through I think that they were just prepared to do anything that had to be done.
And eventually you know as we know now there was the Cold war.
So  I wasnt invited  but I do know there is going to be a war.
But even that passes  and if they dont inform themselves and dont reach back and read the history and in get involved a little bit more closely into what perhaps into peoples lives  or into there have been some wonderful books written about World War II.
Back in those years  which goes way back  I do n't remember when those children were born  but this was before Hitler.
16 Why is Denmark different from other European countries in regard to anti-semitism and what happened during the war?
Now  are you beginning forget the Je wishness part for a moment but  are you beginning to feel the harshness of what war means  and what occupation means  or is this you think because theyre communists and so- Theyre communists and we were vitriolicl y anti-communist  and in my class  almost everyone joined the Communist Pioneers.
Anthony: You talked about your reaction to the end of the war  the loss of your brother and family members.
Then  like I said  my friend  the one I spend the war with  he found himself a job too.
The re were thousands of people who committed these war crimes.
Before the war started  while my father was ma king arrangements to go to Israel  he sold his wholesale store and we moved to Krakow.
Well  whenever they had something they le t us do something for the war effort  but I don't remember right now what it would have been.
And I said thats when I won the war  I was triumphant.
He had been gunned down by some people in retribution for his service to the Germans during the war.
For some years  it had very little effect  and then as war crimes were committed in ce-central Europe  particularly in Yugoslavia  and then later in Rwanda  world attention turned much more to what international law was  that international law USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 12 was being violated  and that there was no established structure to deal with these crimes  and that no court was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these matters.
You were afraid they might go to tell the Germans that you are there.
I mean  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 38 when I go back  and have gone back  I have very fond memories  including the war.
Before the second world war  my name was Lily and this how I was known by all my friends.
And she she got him after the war  after Ludwig was killed  but at that time  he was live for whatever reason  he was living with the father  and Alexandra Sokol was the head of the international couriers section  womens courier  and they were also responsible for also attacks on German criminals.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >> Dora Klayman: We're shuffled between the grandparents  aunts  uncles and so on  until 1942.
And it was my Interview with Erica Laufer 15 August 19  2012 fathers turn and he said he went up and said Herr commandant I am a veteran of World War I. I fought on behalf of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.
Did you have any idea what was happening in the camps?
He's dead now  but we became frie ndly  too  after the war  and I never even discussed with him later on.
He escaped Poland when the war started went towards the east.
Why dont you tell me how the -- how you learned that the war ended.
Do you think -- during th e war years -- do you think that m-made an impression on your Jewishness?
When did your family realize that the war was over for you?
Do -- was there any -- did your father ever consider going to Israel instead of the United States?
And evidently these were Madagascarans who were in recruited to fight and then the war was over  so they didnt come.
And when the war was over -- Now  at that time  it was a problem  too.
Not only did he survive from having been in Auschwitz from the earliest days  but he was sent to be a slave laborer  all though Germany during much of the war.
So I make it  my father was in the First World War; and he was uh invalid.
>> Manny Mandel: As I remember these things as a young child  the war was a much larger issue to us than the Holocaust.
Did you feel comfortable  or were you always sort of scared of any German at this point?
So  but it was certainly the thinking Germans  for the most part  had some idea of what was going on.
I asked my brother Fred  who did all the interviews  he said  ﬁYeah  something like USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 69 Boscamp  or something like that.ﬂ Anyway  I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec -- documentation in Amsterdam  and said -- described the hut where I had been  and described Oskam  and I sent a little picture  a little photograph of Oskam  his wife  and their son  who was then three and a half  four years old  and sent it off to war document -- and asked them  is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp  or whatever his name is still alive  and I described him.
They have pi cked it up a lot  but at that time  ten years after the war it was just total denial.
And on the 4th of September  I was already a prisoner of war with the Germans.
When do you remember beginn ing to feel the war closing in  or things changing?
But very soon after the war began people who opposed the regime went into the mountains and created an Army essentially eventually   which was very prominent  actually  in my area.
Oh yes  but she when it happens to you once  twice  and you become conditioned and you become less sensitive mentioned in the beginning  children are maturing during the war much faster than you ever imagined.
My participation in the second World War was complete  without the At that point.
>> Josie Traum: Well  my mom  actually  she was part of the underground.
>> Josie Traum: Well  after the war -- first of all  fr om my mom telling me what had happened to her parents to my father's -- one of his brothers  his whole family.
Yes  yes  he left with the army  he joined the army.
I originally was supposed to go to Braunschweig and not that I had any knowledge of whether Braunschweig is better or not  but the people that I knew from before the war and some of the people I knew for a long time were going there and I just wanted to stay with people on whom one could count as a little bit of support.
They came went into they were then taken prisoners of war or they just retreated?
So we stayed in the big city and the rumors were that we found out later that was true that the Poles were killing the Jews after the liberation just like the Germans were killing them during th e war  the pogroms.
It has to be Hungarian because he was in the Hungarian Army.
It was right right at the end of the war  yes.
We left over there the things what we took back because my husbnad...my husband went with me before he was sent away  he went with me to take back some things what we gave to hide before the war to the Pollacks.
Then the Americans actua lly after the war the Americans they took over the .
Orde rs  nobody checks on these orders as the war is over.
We were waiting for that because we knew that Hitler is dead and the war will finish very soon.
But the head of the Jewish organization -- there was the HIAS  and the Joint Committee  the head to -- was -- not the overhead  but one of the heads was a Mr. Muntzbah  who wa s in the internment camp in France with my father  and I knew him  and he survived the war  and beca me an official in one of these organizations.
And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in -- during the war  and she found herself now in this new country without a language  without any means and -- and having these children  and she became -- basically she -- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and ju st taking care and cleaning to the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning.
The only nice thing in this camp was that there were German war prisoners and other British were walking outside.
And he found his mother 22 years after the war  my husband.
Did you meet any survivors from -- th at you knew from -- fro m -- from the war  or from even before in -- in America?
The war ha d been over for two days but this was still 64 unoccupied territory  and it was scary to -- to see this man still completely self confident  as if he were on top of the world.
Do you have any memo ry of your life before the beginning of the war?
Because he was one of the few with experience s of World War I. He had been an Army rabbi  especially in in France  so he was famili ar with with with the military...with military practice  so he could teach us or could enlighten us if the bombs were deadly close to us or the ones were far away so we didn't have to worry about it.
Do you know what beca me of him after the war?
I remember that the war br oke out in 1940; that he was there  and he helped my mother a lot in the ho tel in that time.
So there was a consultative arrangement agreed upon among five major Jewish organizations in the United States and the Department of War that whomever they would designate as a candidate whom they all agreed upon  the Army would designate that person  give him the simulated rank of a Two-Star General although he was a civilian and remained in civilian clothes  but for purposes of access in the Army Two-Star General puts him up there.
Lets -- I guess lets -- lets go on to after the -- after the war  after liberation.
And we were counting on the war to...I know that the France joined immediately and England joined the war immediately  and we also hoped that the Russians will and we felt that this is a period which we have to come through and survive.
A2: Okay  so during the war  what happened after you left the hay  and after you left Olga?
So after the war we went...we return in our uh uh flat.
And then a year later  this was 1939  when the Germans came in.
So -- and we stay here  mom -- it was very difficult  but no one knows -- everyone knows that this is a war  no one knows if your father will be alive or not.
We didn't talk much about getting married and raising a family and all that  but I'm wondering just in general  if you could quickly talk about if there is anything over the last twenty  thirty years that you think  were decision you made  were things that were directly related or effected by you're experiences during the war?
No  I must say honestly  I do not remember any anti-semitism before the war.
But it start I started relax a little bit then when I got there  because the war was over then.
So this was beginning of the war  the first day of the bomb of the of Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 64 Did you hear anything over the radio  or was this bombing No  nothing.
So they were very cooperative in working with us  and if you did come to a point where you were discussing war crimes  or tried to weave them into the atrocity aspect  their answer was always  hey  I was just a soldier.
Even -- Even when he lived over -- He lived in -- After the war  he didnt want to be with people.
I found out after the war when I went back  I found out subsequently that the Belgians  th e fire-fighters were given strict orders not to make any attempt to contain the fire unless it started touching buildings.
Do you remember wer where you were when you learned the war was over?
I think I explained before why I -- how I came to speak Dutch  I picked up a Dutch -- [indecipherable] Dutch was very inposit.
I think that whats going on today as we speak   in -- in the -- a-as Bush calls it  the war against terror  but i-it -- its basically a -- a wa r against terrorists who hate America and hate Jews  is very much involved in -- in interpretation of facts of the Holocaust and how the state of Israel came into being as a result of the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. [
Yes   because the like I said  the war was ove r a long time ago and I remember they have certain laws when it c omes to Jews.
And I was very close to Hashomer Hatzair because my father was the head of the Zionist organization.
For instance  one o-o -- was the man who distributed cigarettes for the city and the vicinity and that does -- that was a position which you could get only when you were an invalid  a veteran after the first World War.
And they gave the Serbians an ultimatum which they couldnt accept  and thats why the -- how the war started.
>> Susan Taube: My father made it out  just before America went into the war.
I looked for a job -- You said you were 19 -- -- ve-ve-very hard at that time  that was after the war.
And so I attended to people who were involved in the war activities.
In 1939 when the war broke out  September 1  the Russians -- the Soviet -- I mean at that point  now I know that Hitler and Stalin had an agreement.
There were very few children at th e end of the war in Terezin.
Q. I wanted to ask you  all that time during the war  during the time in the camps or when you were going up to Sweden  was there any time for romance?
You were  you know  a -- a younger woman during the war when all this happened.
Or did you talk about the Germans among the other boys?
And she had -- in -- on the end of the war  murdered her three children  strangled them and -- and wanted commit suicide  jumped into the river.
I think in many ways  the war is still going on.
One thing was good  the whole family was killed  and she was aliv e. And she worked very hard  and in -- it was the -- the patriation from the -- the Polish citizens after the war.
But 8 jewelry and other kinds of things of this nature amassed into significant dollars in those days  the reward that he received from the many others that wound up after the war -- if you recall  where was Eichmann?
So one morning  he got the call  and that was during the war already  maybe in the mi d around 1943  I would say  which was close to the end of the war but we didn't know that then that the ne w Secretary of War will be coming.
And if I recall that -- my recollection after the war  when I came to Deggendorf  which was mostly occupied by survivors of Terezin  I think the Blaus told me  because you know  I -- we were not in -- in Terezin the whole time any more  that Freddi and I forget who else  somebody else who was very prominent  knew when the Familienlager was going to be eliminated.
And he said to my mother  \ I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a hospital and you cannot be moved out of your apartment 3 Funny war (French); The Phony War.
She was a widow because her husband got killed in World War I. S he and three of her children went to Brazil.
We don't want a big war hero from World War I  who got the congressional medal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there  musicians.
So you really understood this was the end of the war  this was it.
What do you rememb er about hearing that the war had ended?
Interview with Renate Fischer Chernoff June 23  2005 71 Well  thats a very interesting question  because yes  they tried to have and they have letters to their mothers until the war broke out  which was only a year.
from way back  from World War I. He had been major or lieutenant colonel  or whatever in Romania  and there had -- they had some problems with guerillas there in World War I. And he wrote to somebody that he [indecipherable] requests permission to hang a lot of Jews  he thought the Jews were behind these guerilla activities.
And you began to hear about that later in the war.
The Jewish workers were outside  the British war prisoners  10 of them  outside.
My father was in World War I from the first day till the last day.
War began September 1  1939  when Germany invaded Poland starting the war.
In fact  after the war a lot of people from Zagreb used to come and just try to get some farm products.
He had to write an essay that described his experiences during the war  I guess  so he wrote  I have part of that essay  part of it is missing.
Well  uh  when the war broke out in Poland  I was a Polish soldier.
And before before just before war war broke out  my parents were able to come extricate.
We saw the trains coming from the Russian border and there was a lot of trains with soldiers and some of them wounded soldiers or German soldiers  so we realized that the war was coming to an end.
After the war  did you did you go back to practicing Judaism?
That photo was sent to me by my aunt  who had survived the war in Chile  and she told me thats my father and me   when I was very  very young.
And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle  which he somehow had gotten hold of  and he was firing this into the German strong point.
When I...then I met my husband in 1951 and in 1952...it's a funny thing...on June 22nd  the same day when the war broke out between Germany and Russia  and we are in 1952 on June 22nd  we got married.
In that time  did you know  was it spoken of  was it known about  of what was happening basically to the Jews and others in Europe?
It was the end of the war  end of the First World War in 1917 and they went through a real terrible poverty.
And shortly after that  I was called by the museum  and they said there was a woman in Vienna   she lived in Salzburg   but she was doing research for a paper on children who left Austria during the war years.
I was doing bricklaying and painting a lot and I learne d the trade very good in the war  I was very good  young  and I kept my mouth shut  because I was afraid.
My brother and my sister-in-law  they lost a son in the war  in the Lebanese war.
And I you know  Im I I was still in the army for  you know  military o-occupation  after the war in Germany.
So the Russians attacked Poland and most of the Polish defense forces were on the western side fighting the Germans so the Russians just went through the eastern part of Poland.
We s -- we di -- we wanted to ask how the war is going on  but he wasnt home  because when he saw that it is already so bad.
We didn't know at this time that  for instance  Jewish leaders were stormi ng the chancellories in London and in Washington uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't kno w that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL  saying that uh uh the uh governments have to co ncentrate on the completi on of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording  that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners  the Nazis could become more vindi. ..
And -- now in World War One it was called shell shock.
That summer we told everybody not to play  we are going to play war  like we made Polish Army and German Army.
Its a long tim e pi -- we still have a long war ahead of us.ﬂ So people werent -- the discussions were not -- not in any of these abstract subjects  they were ver y  very practical.
Amchen ha d  in private life  and he had also worked for the government during the 63 war.
>> Alb ert Garih: You know  that's something that I very often wondered  whether these people were really hero es or just pragmatic and were realizing that they had lost the war -- France had lost the war -- Germany had lost the war and they were on the wrong side.
The Belgium  the hate the Germans  remembered World War I. They did not...the the the...when I say uneducated  we all went to school until like age 12.
The prisoner of the war  you know  the -- all officers in Polish army  that was captured by -- by Soviet Union 31 were executed  yes.
And then th-the -- the first World War starte d  because he was born in 1900.
And my other brother lived through the war  the oldest one  and when the Russians came in they took most of the boys.
When we went to Germany and -- recently -- Uh-huh. --
But after the war I remember that my moth er was upset about it.
It was just one of those things which happened during the war and you just forgot about it [01:25:00] [RJ] and then you just started to put it on the television and then  of course  all your memories come back. [
Although there were Lithuanians who worked in a in a during the the war in German factories.
>> Bill Benson: And then  of course  all the Jews are brought in?
And he brought all the books my husband wrote down he wanted  because my husband was writing how the world should be after the war.
I think we kept that identification until the end of the war  the by the name of Schmitz.
So if because of the war  he's that little  the nourishment -- Yes. --
My aunt  of course  I didn't even see a -- at all after the war.
Jacqueline's memoir  \ A Dimanche Prochain: Memoir o f Survival in World War II France  \  was published in 2013.
My father had lost a leg in the first world war; so he had a wooden leg  and he was what they call a--I don't know what you say in English.
I mean  if you ask him a question about the war  he gets ve ry upset  doesnt talk about it.
Have you been back to Poland -- Oh yes  mm-hm. --
We did broadcast this  so in fact it was a kind of a substitute and continuation of the Free Polish Radio.
Roosevelt was jockeying like mad to give the British some support and so he was making these funny deals called lend/lease  we will lend you some of our destroyers on lease  you will pay us rent for our destroyers  but we're not going to get into your war.
And what happened to these 200 Jewish families  I think has significant meaning and it explains in my opinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War.
You refer to them as the suspected war criminals and by name and ra nk and you don't describe anything in graphic terms which would prejudice the person reading th at.
And when we went -- it was after the war and when we went to get married  I couldnt because I was too young.
Did you  at that point ever hear of somebody named Hitler?
I know only that the war was  without without pity  without without any they were so the Russians were fighting beautifully  but they had an order to leave the whole city and move back.
So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old border of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian territory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the Germans as I told before  after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland.
Interview with Martin Gaudian 51 I remember I thought that  saying here I am in Germany  the war is over now and I wonder what's going to happen now  what my life will be  you know.
So  you were in the Mediterranean  and thats when I asked about the end of the war.
And that was really the first I ever heard about Jews.
We were young then  and here the Six Day War  with Israelis  what are we doing in South Africa?
Thats 39  thats when the war was supposed to start in earnest  but nobody was shooting at anybody.
He was head man before the war from the bakers  even he could write and read.
Renata meant to say here: ﬁJuly 16  1996 and I am reading here USHMM Archives RG -50.030*370 78 about after the war.
And  we were scared  but nothing seemed to happen  nothing happened until one week before the outbreak of the war.
I then re solved that if I'm going to fight the war for this country I might as well fight it and not get all the chicken feed from the tobacco chewing oakies as we called them and I volunteered for the front line service in Korea.
And after aft when war started  he didnt go back no  that sorry  he was there til chr til Christmas.
I did feel uncomfortable with people my age because I always wondered  what were you doing during the war  you know?
It had come to my attention that there were warehouses  American Army warehouses in Paris full of of survivor food kits that had been dispatched to Paris for forwarding through Switzerland to American prisoners of war in Germany.
Now in that time  the -- the Korean War was on a full -- full blast and more -- I would say 99 percent of the people used to go right to -- to Korea.
End of Tape Four Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 104Beginning Tape Five Were you smoking before the war?
That they moved then  after th e war they moved to Prague  the parents and the sister.
The -- most of these people were killed during the war  including my fra -- fathers -- my fathers sisters  and he -- and cousins.
That's a absolute fact that we did not know what was going on uh  until it  until after the war really.
So we dressed up in morning coats  y ou know  that you have when you meet Head of State  as is rather peculiar situation in the middle of the war  you know.
Because so many guys in the war decima ted  they were pulled back from the front  the first thing they did  half dead  pulled back from the front  went to the whorehouses.
So I I think I think in this respect its hard to say that the war was beneficial for me  it isnt beneficial to anybody.
Yeah  this is very unfortunate  because I lived Azonarian through the two years during the war  and also for a certain time when we wer e liberated  I did not want to go back to my Jewish name until I left Poland  for cowardly reasons  I did not trust them.
The one on the right is in which is a town where my mother and I spent the last year of the war approxima tely.
Because we also in Romania  the moment the war started  what was left of the political parties  the national [indecipherable] laborers and myself and the whol e population of Romania  we fully agreed that we have to get back the [indecipherable].
But finally its getting to people in the streets that this president lied to us  and for whatever personal reasons went to war  killing not only Americans  but also Iraqis  or Afghanis  and the -- and the justification fo r af -- Afghanistan  I think  is certainly greater than Iraq.
Okay  before we get to that  I wanted to as k you a little bit more about the time before the war started.
First of all  Im wonderi ng just about you be ing very open today about your experiences during the Holocaust  but did you have trouble talking about that after the war?
It was an attack of Lenin   of trying to take over Europe   so that Polands newly formed army  under the leadership of Marshall Jozef Pilsudski   who was the George Washington of Poland ; together with some volunteers from America the Americans provided some pilots  who fought in the Ko foundation squadron during that war.
Then he was taken to the war and he was actually.
He just doesnt know when the war ended  what happened to her.
What do you recall of how life changed once the Germans occupied your town ?
So did -- was there some part of you that did believe what the Germans were saying?
Well  during World War   were -- were now -- [indecipherable] horses. --
And then April  May – May something  May 8  I think  the war ended .
Suzy Snyder: But she was born right before the war broke out  right?
And this was a time where Washington was crowded with people working on the war effort  and if it hadnt been for that recommendation  I would never have been able to get a room in a hotel.
Can you talk a little bit more about making that transition from being in the war time  to actually then going against your own  as you said  or actually working with the Germans?
And somebody told me after the war  when I came back to Vienna  I had to go to the [indeciph erable] to tell them I am alive.
He was prisoner of war  he had been taken as being the only official left of his entire battalion because everybody run.
I guess did it take you a while to readjust to being a Jew again after the war?
Usually their major interest was in information  people who are work -- working to gather information usef ul to the allies in the war effort.
They had tw o sons  which were the older son  my mothers age.
She lived in New York  and fo r a while longer I was in Philadelphia  for a while longer  but shortly thereafter I joined her in New York and went to high school in New York  finished my high school year  my final high school year in New York and then I left Philadelphia behind for good and then as I say I lived in New York  joined her in New York.
Now  not even the commies in the Spanish Civil War were doing things like that.
And then later we found out after the war what happened to them.
Was it like returned right after the war  or se After or several years later or decades late Shortly after the war.
Mine was to damage the German war machine  to damage the German effort.
So but Thermos bottles in Germany werent that easy to come by during the war.
We -- aft er the war we -- we called it concert of death.
Nine were alive before the war  and one is alive [after].
All day long we were sitting there  not knowing that Germans are losing the war and the Soviets are chasing them.
So the boat went with -- only  as I said  with the pri -- Dutch prisoners of war and Dutch people.
What was going on in Poland  you know at that time?
H-He sm -- his resistance to do something  to be -- to be patriotic and so on  because he [indecipherable] father  but there was one day  when we -- everything was just in one bigs mixture of the army  this army  Polish army  almost like a partisan war.
He used to say in German  a blitzkrieg  because of all the technology and the air warfare  this war was going to end fast  but it didn't.
And we ended up in Warsaw  it was nine of May  which was my father s birthday  and then that was the end of the war.
My aunt lived in the same town we did but in a suburb of it  and they picked her up oh I think a couple of months before they came to us  and I can remember  I mean I have a clear memory of standing in our doorway in the house that we lived in and waving goodbye to her and her daughter  and they were off to a Polish war camp.
Some were able to  when the war broke out  to go east  to the Russian side  eventually  they came back and few people.
Early in the war you and your family lived under Russian occupation.
There was a World War II vet  an invalid veteran  who was in.
Did you find an alternative way to practice your religion after the war or was that not important?
But during the war --I now go far ahead --when the Germans in the camp asked us to send out mail into the neutral countries  so that they would have an alibi that the Jewish people are living in Poland  I wrote to [Mimi ] .
Yes indeed  because I remember them taking me to synagogue  and playing with my neighbors and taking me sled riding  and What are your first memories of the war?
That may be wrong  but -- Have you shared this story about what your parents did during the war  with other people?
She had a brother and a sister  both of them who died in World War II.
>> Al Munzer: This was really at the very end of the war.
So youre now talking now September 1st 1939  when the war breaks out and Germ and Germany attacks Poland.
And it was very competitive  these were -- this was the last crop of World War II veterans who went on the G.I. Bill of Rights to school  and th-they -- they were a different generation  I mean  very serious students  I mean no horseplay  no nothing.
And he said  well where are you headed what are you going to do and one thing and another and I said we were with the war crimes program.
And I got back from the war in  I think it was February of 46 was when I finally got released from the Navy.
Ac tually there were a few not original from Lithuania because all were Kovno Ghetto  Kovno Ghetto  but in Kovno Ghetto the majority were Lithuanians  but then there were certain Polish Jews who run away from Poland during the war and Hungarian.
Wa s there any sense that you could detect from Americans that perhaps the war is over [indecipherable] 31 I detected that with some of the -- th-the yre trying to get some Nazis who are living in Argentina and in South America.
They  when the war came they were very young  they had very little education.
or to ma he was hidden  and even tually my mother ma rried him  after the war  my mother married my married him.
So when the -- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting.
But I was turning aware that most of my family had not survived the war.
I mean  after...after the war was over  there were my friends.
Three hundred and sixty thousand zlotys after being in the war and the ghetto  people starved because at this time people started to starve.
Then I was two -- two or three weeks in the course -- course  and afterwards the Hehalutz movement  the leadership was in -- they felt that is -- theres war  of course  coming  and they left.
The car was standing there so afte r the war and we needed some transportation he said to my husband hey I'm going to sell you that car.
And uh after the war I found out what transport number I was i n. Of course I didn't know at that time  nobody was telling anything.
And is that the time you thought you would maybe go to Palestine?
Is there anything that stands out in your mind from the -- the pe riod of time toward the end of the war and immediately after the war was over  what -- what stands out in your mind about those days aside from your fear?
And before the first world war  it belonged to Alsea which was called Galicia.
And he called me and told me the following  that during the war a German soldier came to visit him and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 11brought a message from my father which st ated that my f -- my mother had been -- had been massacred together with 30 00 0 Jewish women -- women and my father and the husbands and the relatives had to look on.
I would say  Max  what are you going to do after the war?
But after the Romanians took over  after the first world war  the Romanians took over and life turned sour because the Rumanians didn't need any wood and there was no other industry so it wasn't so great for everybody over there.
Believe it or not  the worst was after the war was over.
So  it came out  and in 94  and they had a marvelous copy editor  whom I got to know  who was in the Wrens   the womens navy  British navy in World War II  and who was very good  and did a fabulous job of copy editing.
I knew what I wanted to be when I was 13  war or no war.
Did you witness any anti-Semitism at any time in the military?
Now you mentioned you were with  involved wi th the War Crimes Commission after the war  now what was your contact with Yorgen Strupe  who is  you  do you receive a confession from him  or you... Yes  yes  I received the firs t confession from him.
We had to take care of the elderly people because the nurses and caretakers who used to take care of them had to work for the war   the factories.
That is  the U.S. hadn't entered the war yet  but Germany attacked Poland .
Okay  before So I was in the military when the war break out.
I said  I have no papers at all because all my papers were destroyed during the war.
I didnt want to go to a place where there was war.
After the war you came back and had a family and got back to normal life?
And this the time  you know  like in the -- when they start with the ghetto  with the Jewish  it was 1940 -- 19 -- approximately 1942.
Th-The bottom line is that with the exception of his oldest sister  who had moved to then Palestine before the war  every other member of his family was lost.
>> Bill Benson: You also shared with me that in the year that the war began but before it began in September 1939  your family were able to take a couple of trips.
Prior to World War there was no international apparatus to deal with that.
And then I dont remember who told me that its the -- the war.
65 other non-Jewish lawyers in th e Treasury Department managed to incite the Secretary of Treasury  Henry Morganthau  61 to demand that something be done and the War Refugee Board was set up.
I said Uncle Otto  we couldn't correspond during the war  how could Poppy ask you for the money.
I was born in 1922  and since I spent there almost until  till the War.
But again he also said the war is over and the head had fallen.
See  before the war  when I -- I was in the academy as a student and we had a competition and I won the competition as the best student of -- of the first year of -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 26 of the course  of academy.
Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 4 No  because I was born just before the war broke out.
Like I told you  my dad said to stay in Sweden and I hadnt seen him since the war time.
But it wasnt produci ng what it did before the war  certainly not.
The people who never had to really  they didn't live through poverty  they didn't live through the war  they didn't live thr ough tragedy  they're so attached to their little things  their chocolate they didn't have or it st arts snowing  they don't have right clothes  I mean the smallest thing  they actually fall apart.
And my mothers my mother had a brother and two sisters  but during the first World War  they were evacuated from the from the area of Torzhetz because there was a very serious fighting going on in the area  and they wound up in a southern part of Russia which is now Ukraine  and they were never f-for never permitted to come back to Poland.
She said that he was on the boat that  after us  and the boat turned around  she remembered because war broke out that very day  with the Dutch  and they told the ship to turn around.
>> Bill Benson: You said that your father thought he had tr uly \ Hit the big time.\
And I was trying to use it  but when I and my wife  after the war in '76  when I was writing my war memoirs  we both went to London  to the archives  to Her Majesty's records office.
Did they ask you about your e xperiences during the war at some point  or did you tell... did they know anything about your history?
This is my revenge over war  Nazi  communists and everybody else that against the Jews.
So thats the Russians kind of influence  a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before  and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis  or Germans  and Germans beating up their comp atriots  or so  and with full vigor  I mean  just reversed direction.
Did you know what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
And Wh-Wh-When did you leave Germany and how long were you there?
So they moved out and they got an apartment and it eve n had a bathroom and they did very  very well until the war came.
Can you tell me a little bit about life in Koretz before the war  what you remember?
No  but we were well to do  but not until ju st before the war.
You know  we didn't know about the gas chambers  we didn't know about the Final Solution until after the war  but  I did not have much illusions when these people were called up  so-called for work in Germany  that they would come back.
The President has declared we're going to have war crimes trials.
Can you tell me  do you know how many boys from Paullina were drafted in the end  how many served in the army during World War II?
And...uh...I...I...after the war  letters were written by Dr. Nobliski and Dr. Pepsico to save this man from the gallow because he helped.
Q. Did conditions in the camp ch ange after the War was over?
And the thing is  in World War II  naturally  we had American and Australian  and we had a lot of military people base in Haifa  in the area  in the camps  in the airport base.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Bill Benson: Because of the bombings in the war?
Once -- the demeanor of the Russian soldier is very difficult to describe now because we see them now after all these years of changes  these were people who were fighting the war.
In 1939 German troops invaded Poland starting the Second World War.
They probably could have stopped World War II if they had done so at that time.
She and her sister came to visit us after the war.
And the two majors were for me were -- one was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 111 like I said  a war hero  and a -- and the other was a very fine gentleman too  and they -- they ask me sometimes some questions  but not in detail  and they thought I was an asset.
Well in the end of the war  that was another story.
They stayed in Brooklyn  yeah  through the you know  so I yeah  and And did did the when did the que stion of what had happened during World War II every come up in those years?
You know  no greater contrast than uh Holland--which was barely beginning to recover from the war for the Marshall plan was just beginning to take effect--and going to Beverly Hills  20 California--which has got to be one of the extremes of American affluence.
I don't know if it's true  but after the war  the assumption was that the end of 1944 they were bringing in people for extermination at such rate that the gas chambers could not accommodate them.
And my fath er used to say  ﬁAnd where was God when  on the  on th e  in the war when the people were lying on the ground moaning and dying by the hundreds?
But when we came back we noticed because it was September when the war broke out and then there was the holidays so we couldnt go to pray because they would come and kill the people.
If they would have left us alone  we could have survived there during the war.
because we have to go to the basement because the war just broke out.
He was then put into a concentration camp  and he talked his way out of the concentration and this is all close to the end of the war.
And this is tape number one  side A. Okay  one thing that I wanted to ask you about Mr. Willner  is that in the first interview that the Holocaust Museum did with you   there -- we didnt discuss your -- your childhood at all  before Kristallnacht.
After the war started  my parents knew  and Parisians knew  and Jews knew especially  life was not going to be very good for the Jews of France  and especially the Jews of Paris.
Well it is interesting  I don't have too many friends who had been in the war.
Yeah  then there was -- you were still able  before the war  yeah.
Then in they Ive I stayed there forever  and March of 45  which was two months before the end of the war  they finally shipped us overseas  and Before we go there  a question at two different periods of time.
I want to jump to after September 1939  the start of World War II.
I dont know how he got his name  but I think it was from some prominent figure in the newspapers at the time when  actually  he was born during the first World War.
Moise Weiner: Well  I can tell you one detail of the beginning of the war what the people heard about the Germans.
We put all our packages to be sent  and my father had decided that we we will go as far south as we can  so that the Russians when the Russians when the war is over  which he was certain it will be over very soon  that we would not be in the Soviet zone  but in the American zone.
Now  this was only what  three months after Hitler came to power?
And after the war  as you look back on -- on your relationships as a Jew with Japanese and Japan  did you know when Japanese American were being held in camps in the United States?
And yet facing the war -- you still face that  but possibly your own de -- I mean  it must have been a terrible conflict.
The man was later on the mayor of Karlsruhe right after the war.
She was 90 years old  and so she was away from us for maybe four or five months  and then we took her back because there was actually no war.
Did he have any deals that he did  before the war?
I remember like today my father had a very bad premonition 5 that this war is going to be very bad.
And its Soviet Army telling us: The Germans are losing the war; we are chasing them; we are going to run after them ;a few days later some medics will come and help you.
Now  there were German officers on the train already going I dont know where they were going but there were German officers in jackets and everything going up and down in the train  but the war had not been declared yet  and troop trains going in the other direction towards Yugoslavia.
Do you give much thought to what you want young people to know about the Holocaust?
>> Bill Benson: He made it out to the United States.
When we finally -- the war is over and we made contact with her brother in Baltimore  things happened very rapidly and she said  should I bring my sewing machine or not  and we -- it never got to [i ndecipherable] anyhow  we sold it in Shanghai.
The only thing is I found out afte r the war that nobody survived. {
But we I have no doubt  myself  th at the war would have ended one year earlier  at least a year earlier  maybe even sooner.
And to talk about it as history because you know very  very  in the very right after the  in the fifties  even in the early fifties  in the dictionary  the Second World War  what happened.
And th e Germans were defending it until I think the end of March.
And even though it -- we picked up -- these were the remnants of the war that picked up the pieces  and suddenly you saw a lot of weddings  a lot of babies that were born.
You had such an interesting childhood and you did -- do you -- do you have any final thoughts about what happened during the war and your relationship with the Jewish families that you helped  from this vantag e point of 50 years later?
And so–uh...in February of 1945  I got orders to go overseas and didn't get there until April because that's the war the army worked.
Then I found out that two my cousins survived the war near Warsaw as Polish women.
We found out my mother had a brother who lived there many years before the war in Paris  France.
But with with a a trees around  before the war it looked a lot worse.
No  I still -- I think that my hair -- no  my hair wasnt cut until after the war broke out.
That is -- that what I remember  the beginning of -- of the war.
While you were in the ghetto  what did you know about what was happening in other parts of Poland?
So you were very young at the time before the war.
Now  what were you doing on the day that the war began?
Uh the the change not in the feeling of security but the change in the family life came in - it must have been mid or the fall perhaps of 1944 when my dad uh joined the uh Danish uh Brigade as it was called  the the uh the Danish military police force that was built up in Sweden towards the end of the 2nd World War.
Had they been war victims and they wanted to leave Europe  too?
That the war is goi ng -- th-that the Germans will lose the war.
>> Bill Benson: That was 1940 when they got to the United States?
But in the meantime  we were making Gentile papers for ourselves to live through the war if we decided to run away before it's too late.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  the war is still going on.
And when the war broke out  it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the villages  in Kovno and in other villages  because the fronts were going on fightings between the Russian Army and the German Army.
In a hospital  they had there a barrack from the prisoners of war  about 20 of us or 24 I don't remember.
And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit us and whenever we went back to Holland  of cours e  we visited her until she died.
Th is was soon after the war  very early the summer of 45.
Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War  in 1915...the war was...the the front was standing in our town for about a year so Sov...the Czarist Russia and Germans.
Was a big school in the city and I was learning there almost until the war.
You know  that was my experience in Austria  so that was right after the war.
After the war  this landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there also in the landowners house.
So that was really my life after -- after the war.
>> Bill Benson: Henry  by the time the war began  several of your brother and sisters had already left.
But they -- they -- they were -- they were -- they were with the Nazis.
We didn't have television in those days  and the newspapers and all of the various media used in Japan to bring about the raising of antipathy against the western nations  preparation for war  actually.
But I immediately (almost  within a month or two) volunteered for the draft  because officially World War II was not over on the books.
I felt not only I  the whole family  that short before the war  the antemitism got much more Strong?
And I was right  I didn't wa nt to live that  I smelled it  I saw it in Holland right after the war.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your father in his day.
He couldn't come back immediately because the house he had been living in London was bombed and he spent two years in a hospital.
And earlier in 1939  before Germany invaded Poland  your community had been occupied by Hungarians and that immediately changed your lives.
Did you hear much of what was going on in the Soviet part of Poland?
Thats what we learned at -- that was during the war -- in the war.
90 This is my sister  Janine  with two frie nds  during the summer of 1938  ye -- training as auxiliary women corps or something like this  when the girls were preparing for war.
But everybody in town knew that something terrible was going to happen  because a few months before  there were a lot of people from Silesia running to the Russian borders  and wa and that was even before the war  before 1941  and there were some peopl e that stayed with us in our house  because any you have to offer hospitality to any strangers that c-come through the town.
>> Jill Pauly: Not right away because the war hadn't broken up.
So little by little  we saw that we cannot survive this way because we didn't have no connections with Russia  no connections with anybody outside  and then the AK started to become stronger and stronger and stronger because the minute Stalingrad changed  the whole fortune of war and the Germans started to lose  they became big big  they went into the woods and once they were in the woods  they started to hunt Jews.
When did it become clear to you -- was it al ready after the war  how massive the Holocaust really was?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 So eventually after a couple of hours we got back.
After the war  we will then see what we can do.ﬂ So -- but we had trouble  too  with Platon.
Hes the one who survived the war with my aunt -- not my aunt  pardon me -- Your grandmother. --
And  well they declared them dead at the end of the war  you know   45 sometime  the date o-of May 45 when when the war was over.
And that corner of cemetery  the heroes of the independence war  and of the first war is always treasured  and kind of honored specifically.
A fra -- as a little -- because you were -- 4 Always he dressed nice  even after the war he dressed nice.
But the purpose of the conversation was to try to entice us to go back to Germany when the war was over  because it would people -- it wou -- they would need USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 82 people like us to start building and by go-going back to Germany -- he meant East Germany and this was -- became a very intere sting conversation  because I told him I am not interested in going to East Germany when the Soviets have camps like the Nazis.
Marcel Drimer: So I -- before the war I had a nanny.
Did you talk with your -- your mates and -- and your schoolmates and friends about your experience during the Holocaust -- during the war?
So -- and there was no way of knowing if the Germans wont get back.
Meanwhile the war had ended  and I forgot to tell you  the fourth division  in October 44  General Marshall came over to France and he made the speech in division hea dquarters  I wasnt there.
Then when it got too warm for me I had to go there were many priests home because during the war we wanted to go before the war already to the Mission countries  to Indonesia or South Amer ica.
And I sum that whole thing up when I think of myself and my life and where I am now and what did it all mean  I really believe the following statement  and it may sound strange to you  those three years from 1945 when the war ended until 1948 when the State was established  those three years I think are the single group of any three years in the entire history of the Jewish people  and I mean every single thing I can think of that we've been through since Abraham  I don't think there is another period of three years which has ever been so determinative.
Before I go into the after war story  Id like to talk about the burning of the synagogue.

And -- and this a story I reremember  when the service was in some bodys house  somebody led the ser -- Jewish service for Jewish houses  and everybody was crying very hard because of -- everyone voo -- voo -- lost family during the war.
And the they they perished instead of surviving the war  because of a f fellow Jew  who who ratted them out  you know.
The war came to you and your family in Belgium less than a year later in the spring of 1940.

We met and we used to go to a movie or some other place of recreation u ntil the war broke out and that ruined everything.

Who give to any dollars per pers -- in the golden -- in the gold for person  and go -- can go to exchange for prison -- German pr ison of the war.
Prior to the German occupation  did you know much about what was happening in Germany?
I was with them the entire duration of the war  until Belgium was liberated.
And what did you do between after the war Im a actress.
All we knew that these pe ople were fighting the Germans and only actually after the war we found out that many of the leaders were communists.
He wa s before the war  dir -- director of the internal revenue in -- in Kolbushova  for te -- the text director.
So all things be equal  we assumed that between -- that the Jewish fate in the hands of the Germans is going to be much worse in area incorporated directly into Germany  than in -- into area that is onl y temporarily occupied by the Germans for the duration of the war  with its fate decided after the war.
And I thought  ﬁGod almighty  I will never see here  I went through all these things  the war and everything  Ill never see.ﬂ I was so sick to my stomach.
And my -- at that time  it was war  but somehow  which was now my stepfather  they came from Polish Ukraine  from Sdolbuno  Rovno.
Now I wanted to ask you how much you were aware of the war that was going on all around you  if you had any knowledge of the camps  what you knew.

And thereby enhance our reputation among the prisoners of war  because we would not only interview them we couldn t interview everybody who was being captured  there were too many people being captured.
And a group of scholars operating privately and independently in New York   got together and set up a committee for the study of war documents.
Also   this was probably in 1941  I was inside the ghetto onl y once during the war.
>> Bill Benson: While you were doing that and having time because your mother was so busy trying to figure out how you're going to get out of Germany -- and I think it's important for the audience to keep in mind that war did not begin until September of that year  September 1939   so this is still just a little before the actual war began.
Let's talk about the start of the war and some of the things that you remember from that time.
After the war  when I first met her  she would show me notebooks written by one of my little sisters.
After war broke out  and she came from to stay with my parents  and this is one reason why my parents could not leave  even if they wanted to.
We had saved gasoline coupons and whatever to to make it  because gasoline was severely rationed during the war.
France was still war -- we had everything  food  everything  France didnt.
When I came back  she came back to Wilna after the work -- after the war  and she learned that I am in hospital right after the war.
There wer -- this was a time a -- war time adventures.
People told us that after the war and we only heard about that later.
I always thought I would go back home because I don't think it would have true in the end having lived in England during the war and all these years.
They were starved to death and worked to death  thos e Russian prisoners of war.
And even in the war -- I forgot about that -- but I was taking piano lessons until I couldnt take them any more.
So they forget  I don't blame them  the war is over  why get killed by the Germans?
And her mother came back after the war to pick her up from school.
And was that the He was going with the Russian army.
Then I remember too  there is someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War?
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- your father was a remarkable man.
It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the barracks.
Really  during the war  I co uldnt believe from five sister  one sister  her fri ends Š about ten friends from her class survived.
And this is my sister  and this is my younger brother  who were killed in the war -- like in ghetto.
And ye t  that part of Germany  I think was not as badly off as other parts of Germany.
Then  the Polish situation started when Poland  in 1939 was invaded by Russia from one side and by Germany from the other side.
Sure enough  1941  when the Germans and the Russians started  when they broke their agreement– Just for a while there  they ha d this agreement not to fight.
Did you tell anyone after the war had ended that you were married?
Now  hes -- before the war  he was ins -- in the business in Danzig  somehow in the export -- import you international.
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 152 So she spent the war in in Poland   and was un-until she died  only a few years ago.
I did realize what Interview with Halina Peabody June 3  2002 22she did for us during the war  I mean  she just absolutely used up every inch of her strength and I think she didn't have mu ch strength left in her to fight.
Interview with Susan Berlin March 7  2003 25 In those first years when you were in this country  the war had started in Europe  how much did you know about what was going on over there?
It means the navy blue granna -- the navy blue police  because they had navy blue uniforms  but this was the police from before the war  and they didnt behave so hundred percent like the Polish people desired.
I mean  it was a matter of months  and -- and asked my mother to keep a kosher home  and when we got to the United States  he said ah  forget about all that nonsense  you know  just -- So you didnt keep kosher?
So he gave me  Washington gave me permission for one more year and they waived my passport requirements and every year  only every ye ar I had to write to them for another year extension and that I did until the end of the war.
And the year before my wife got sick  and I had to kind of quit this for awhile  I talked to 46 different schools in one year  about World War II  and the Battle of the Bulge  and this  and I bring it up to them  that if your parents arent voting  then you keep on them  and make sure that they vote for someone  and to study their what they stand for before you let them go.
He brought a form from Internal Revenue Servic e. Did any -- did your parents or any of your relatives spend time in a war zone?
Uh Isr ael was at war with the Arab neighbors .
But the Germans came in and they -- that's the first World War.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 12 At that time?
Q. After the war  as a Jew in France  did you feel any differently.
He was very much affected by his service in the first world war.
But the Germans seemed to have pulled out I mean  I dont remember anything more at that time.
The general story as uh told by newspaper correspondents  the war correspondents and by the movie about General Patton  was that he had slapped a soldier in a military hosp ital in Sicily  charging him with malingering.
Well  after the war is finish  we take care of those war criminals.
Ah  he said    what's the use  the war is finished.
After the war we were coming to Milano and all that.
I think that Gertler  who all at once after the war was he was the head of the underworld before the war.
Well  I guess the most quotable thing wa s that  \ These people are being tried not because they lost the war  but because they started the war.\
I was born in Poland  in the city of Lodz  the second largest city of Poland  and I lived there all the time  until the beginning of the war.
Now  you have to remember  my father was a first World War veteran  my grandfat her  my mothers mother -- father was also a veteran.
Mom said  I don't want you to smoke until after the war.
I don't know what happened to him after the war  so... So your -- your friend  I mean he was in the edelweiss pirates with you.
Then I decided that because I didn't care for what I was doing  checking on products  on the pharmaceutical products  but because I could speak Russian  even though I could not read nor write  I would be a better help to the government during the Cold War.
In the war with some of  so their wives and children.
This is after Franco [indecipherable]  I dont know  its -- this is 1941 -- 44  and the war is over in 39  and they were poor as church mi ce  proverbial.
After a war  the young man appeared and told Steven Schwartz that he was a native of Straubing.
Im not entirely sure whether there was one during the war years  or whether the one that I remember was immediately after.
>> Bill Benson: You and your family existed under those circumstances.
>> Bill Benson: George  while the full brunt of the war would not come to Hungary until 1944  the lives of Jews in Hungary  including in Budapest  would change significantly with the beginning of the war.
The Americans were trying to -- to promote and to present the side on Vietnam war to the Israelis.
I crossed that ocean four times during the war  and when we were lucky  we a we always the Germans always didnt have a their submarines in the right place  because we d go across  you know  like a a whole whole mess of ships would go at one tim e  and oh man  itd be stuf stre stretched out for miles.
But my mother  when the war started war between German and Russian  didnt want us to to be separated.
Before we turn to those years and the war and the Holocaust  tell us first what you can about your family and yourself before the Nazis took control in 1933.
Some I knew from before the war and when I say before the war  I mean before 1939.
There were people who had -- because she and my father had sort of di fferent weigh stations where they were going to meet after the war.
They told me to take my rifle  whatever I had...I didn't have much...and report to the headquarters of this...it was a...called...it was the nineteen  twenty-ninth uh independent battalion  machin e gun battalion  to report to headquarters in the rear and I did report there and they took me in to a place there and there I found some uh neighboring...uh one fellow I knew which was not   was a Jewish fellow from a town near us and I found there many others  Jews and Ukrainians who were from the socalled western Ukraine  that were born  or lived...not just born...lived in in the Soviet...the territory that was Poland before the war  and they took us on the front  with the purpose of putting us in work battalion  because they trust us. .
And the family comes there But no  after the war  this is the when the other brother was alive  the one who lived in Africa .
By the way  she -- she saw my father for the last time in August of 1939 and came back  instead of calling me and telling me to come down to Italy  because we all had passports  and thats -- my mother and I were trapped when the war broke out and we never saw my father again.
But we were very poor  we had nothing left after the war  no money and so on.
And it was a army barracks from the French army from years ago  from the second World War.
This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideol ogical as it had become  when there was no persecution of the Jews.
My father then already came back from two years of World War I in Russia  and after that two years as POW.
Before we talk about the start of the war and the events leading up to and following the German occupation  perhaps you can start by telling us a little bit about your family and community life before the war started.
>> Bill Benson: Once the war was over  May 1945  you and your sister and your family are together again.
I says  ﬁDont tell me  you speak Hungarian.ﬂ And from then on he spoke Hungarian to me.
During the war  I was on i-in the begi nning of the war I was still in contact with relatives of mine in Germany  I wrote them letters and the letters came back.
My grandmother told me in the other war  they came in and they got out.
So so September first happens  and do you remember when you learned that the war is starting?
There was a a German historical commission looking in to the history of the German foreign office during the 1930s  and during the war and the Holocaust.
So some  some  some girls got raped and I was pretty fortunate  but I wasnt much to Sylvia Green 31 January 11  1996 Page 31 look at because all those years already took its toll at a very young age and I was still in the developing age  you know  when the war broke out.
But it is part of  at the same time  a feeling that we had to achieve  because if anything happened to my father and mother  there we were  at least until after the war  and not immediately after the war  but when things started getting put back together again.
And being in the German hospital was kind of They were Germans  you know.
During that time you were called before a tribunal and your record said the holder of this certificate is to be exempted from further order from internment because you were from Germany and from the special restrictions applicable to enemy aliens  because you were from Germany  under the aliens order.
Yes  they was there from Poland  from Hungary  from different -- German  Jewish too  from Germany.
But you were a teenager when you -- when you were killing  blowing up -- No  it was not o -- wh-when the war wa s start I was 16  but y-you see  when you start working  was after two years late r  three years later I was 18 - 19  this year  was  you know  we was -- we d -- we -- we live in  you know  in this condition that we change our mind  because we have to start thinking about our future  about our freedom  a-about -- about ou r liv -- life in the future.
But she brought me soup and piece of bread for it.
And was that in some way difficult for you  because you were supported by the Soviets through the war in some way and -- and -- When I came out to speak  I -- I explained to the kids  ﬁListen  Japan was our enemies yesterday  today they our friends.ﬂ To make sense out of the whole -- the whole thing.
They -- the same thing in Israel  and I spoke in Israel  the children are interested what did the Jew do.
And they run to Russia during the war  but the mother died in Russia and my Uncle Yukel died in Poland coming back from Russia.
Finally we find out that he was released two years after the war.
When Mussolini declared war on England and France  due to the fact that the Germans had occupied France and Mussolini felt it was safe to join to get the plunders of war  therefore the ship went back and we never heard from the two brothers.
Can you please tell me something about this 13 years old girl before the war  please.
Okay  and did you feel like  I mean  because originally you had sort of thought you were going to Palestine Yeah  well. --
So when Yugoslavia was form as a country  was on the end of the first World War  when President Wilson told to Serbia  what do 2 you want.
What did you tell your sons about your childhood before the war?
Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 92 Well  its important that you got your parents stories and what a wonderful -- acts that they did during the war.
However  the coup was suppressed by an SS division  and so came to a quick end  the only open insubordination of the German military in the Second World War.
The apartment in the Balut had all the prewar furniture  rugs  glassware  crystal  and it tu rned out he had lived there before the war with his family as had my co-worker from the kitchen.
Did you ever think that its going to end  or did you think the Germans might win the war?
All prisoner s were -- of war were offered freedom if they accepted to work for the Germans.
A nd you know  given the command structure  once a brigadier tells me its a war crim e  the ones below him cannot say its not a war crime.

This has come back to 19 -- f60 -- I would say to the concentration -- I didn't have this before the war.
And I -- as I st -- as 66 you remember  I said that I was brought up in a ve ry religious home  but unfortunately after the war  you know  when I asked questions  I couldnt accept the answers that were given to me when I asked like a foolish 15 year old  I asked questions that there were no answers to that.

So this was now 1946  I was 11 years old and I came to England  to Newcastle  and starte d going to school there and I didnt know a word of English and I had to learn another language and then -- Which would have been your -- how many languages now  by the -- Well  my native was -- was German and then Polish and then of course during the war  Ukrainian and then after the war  Russian.

No...after the war was over  for your own personal safety  there was no...there was no more problem.
Because those days they called it -- they called up for the army because a wa -- the war was going on already.
The antiSemitism was so great that people expect and knew a war is coming up because they were talking about it  they were talking about it and everybody  Jews already were so depressed because the economy was so bad  they squeezed the Jew out.
And I  I just played and we lived in that apartment the whole in Vastergatan during the war we lived.

He was spying on the town to make sure who was doing what so that during the war we could know the situation and bring them out.
I mean  after I went in the army and so forth  well then I -- I was always politically interested  I -- because I remember  my first recollections as a -- as a boy  because my -- both my parents were extremely interested in political things and we used to discuss it  but my first political awareness was the Spanish civil war.
Were you in Warsaw then  or in It finished the war  maybe a week after finishing the war.
The injus tice of the first wo rld war  which I think after the second world war  people had -- the western powers and learned much more how to treat those who have defeated.

Our landlords daughter  she survive and she–told me that after the war.

So after the war  did you do some reading  or did you do -- was it something that happened during the war that made you -- Yeah  reading and hearing.
Were they glad or were they sad that Hitler might lose the war?
And  kind of threw him or hande d him his Iron Cross from World War I. The next thing I remember is we walked through the st reets  I believe  down to City Hall  where the bus  some sort of bus or perhaps truck was wa iting and they put us all in this truck  with whatever bags we had.
The one couple that survived that we knew from before the war in Haifa.
What what what religious faith did you belong to  before the war?
So it actually had not changed much -- No -- Since the war  or it has?
>> Bill Benson: You told us a little bit earlier that for your father  though  after that he had a tough time after the war.
Or was there anything -- Well  you know  the idea of war  to me  wh en I -- when I -- when -- when second war first started  was that this was just a military engagement  you know  that soldiers fight and soldiers get killed.
No  I remember that distinctly because t here were always dances there  there was  it 's not done any more today  but after the war they danced  everybod y was celebrating  celebrating  celebrating  not drinking  there wasn't  you know it's not like we  partying here  where you have to drink  the Dutch don't do that.
At some point when World War I started  he found himself -- no.
You see  because this was calculated risk  is not make sense  we must win the war.
But you could have -- telephones didn 't work very well  there was a war going on.
Back in Vienna  how did people feel about Jews at the beginning of the war?
>> Bill Benson: Your father served in the First World War  hadn't he?
During the war  during the latter parts of the war  did your family know anything about the camps  or did that come out only later for them?
In the ghetto  when just be-- while the ghetto was being formed  or just before the ghetto  he knew a family from Lvov who were socially or politically active in Lvov before the war  and through them you could get a lot of things .
So they had a selfish interest in cleaning up the  the Jewish inside the country rather than the war effort.
But in any case  they got to Antigua   where they spent the rest of the war  about five years.
If the war would to have gone on further  longer  I dont know what would have happened to that arm.
Tell me  because were talking were going to be talking about the satellite images that were taken during World War II excuse me  not satellite images  but aerial photography Yeah.
She says from -- there was a cantor  before World War Two in Poland  and he -- he survived the war  and he had a lot of reco rds  and she learned it from the records  you know.
It took about two  three years after the war to get rid of it.
>> Bill Benson: At some point soon after you were forced into the ghetto.
Nothing is going to happen to me  he said  I was in the war.
They also had to be ca reful because they couldnt trade for food that would be evident that there was more than two people in the house hold eating so it had to be all done in different places and as my mother tells it they were never hungry during the war.
The first one is my school I.D.  and -- when I was 14 years old  and this served as my I.D. after the war in Czechoslovakia for a few months   because it was not in German and didnt have an eagle on it.
A year later  not quite a year later  in Sept in August of 1914  the war broke out.
What do you think the effect of the war has been on you?
And then he looked at me  says  \ Child  you do what you want after the war.
But tell me the story that you say has to do with the war  that it sounds like its a little complicated.
Incidentally  I had a maternal great-grandmother who  at the time the war began was 103.
And my husband was here during the war  so he -- he also lost a lot of relatives  but he didnt feel that -- the -- the anguish  you know  a nd the -- the Germans came to the house  and rang the bell  or they picked you up  or things like that  th e -- the -- you know  always the nervousness that was around your life.
But later on  all through the war  I stayed in my room.
I mean  the ---------- escaped from France  and he made a first appeal from London on June 17  1940  and he told the French people  we've lost the battle  but we haven't lost the war.
And uh after the war  you know  I I went back to the Netherlands for about a half a year  and one of the interesting  for me  things that I did was I joined a therapy group because I'm having a hard time living all this stuff down.
Now  after the war  wouldn't you think we would have priority to go out or to get out of Germany?
Are you more comfortable around people who experienced World War two firsthand than those of us who did not?
One of the after the war  when were I was working with my husband in Lodz and I saw Mrs. Lempke.
Were you a witness to any acts of retaliation or retribution against people who had helped the Nazis?
We were expecting so much sympathy from a af ter the war and we were all the time planning what the whole world is going to try to compensate us for our experience.
Well  we knew that the end of the war wasnt too far away.
And besides  why do you have to renovate  you wouldn t live long in this house  the war will end and I will go back to the house.
I dont know how they got all this furnitu re back after the war  or I dont know anything about that.
Against the wishes of my wife  who was also hungry during the war  I not -- the first time I did this was I made them go to school without breakfast.
And I Interview with Richard Peterson April 6  1999 14remember then  it was in the May of that year  which would have been 1941  before the war  but here they made arrangements and I remember being in I was in the band and orchestra  and it was al ways typical that we would play  the orchestra  we would play our our school march was ﬁThe Pilgrims Chorusﬂ from Tannhauser .
No  no  the only thing I remember is that after the war  in 1987  and I was there with Chris  that we went to see the barrack  so then I knew that was the barrack.
And at that time we really needed it  because my brother had eaten up all his savings  you know  for keeping the whole family alive during the whole war.
And she died in March 1945 in Bergen -Belsen  two months before the liberation of the camp and two months before the end of the war.
I just wa nt to tell you that afte r the war when I came ba ck to Ulanow  I came back when the Russians still were--.
They brought 10 -- at the foundry  before the war they made all of the locomotives for Poland.
And you know the memory of Europe after the war  a lot of Europeans came to the United States.
Irving: A small town  not far away  about twelve miles south of Radom–and we returned–we returned because my–well actually  I was ther e with my adopted sister  she was already married  and her husband got a draft notice  and we knew the war was on.
The first uh copy arrived through the Slovak underground at the office of the Czechoslovakian representative to the League of Nations with whom I very closely cooperated during the whole war  Dr. .
Yeah  and so all the children in your school were Jewish?
At what point did you realize th at this wasn't just a short war or that things were really very  very  horrible for the Jewish people?
As a matter of fact  before the war  they persuaded the leadership of the Jewish communities to send a cable to Morgenthau 7 trying to stop the impending war.
In '42 I we nt to American army  World War II.
I says  at the end of the war  nine days exactly after the end of the war  which was March 2nd -- MRS.
My parents had the opportunity to send me to a monastery to be taken care of by nuns  during the war time  and then they made the decision to stay together.
What did it mean to you that the war was over?
My father was a soldier in the First World War for the Germans.
So  we found out specifically that Babcha Tannenblume and her daughter Regina  with her husband whom sh e married during the war and the daughter Anja most definitely went to Treblinka w ith the Austroviets Jews  no question about it.
Of course  uh  after  uh...at the very end of the war there  we did overrun--right somewhere in that immediate vicinity--and only saw part of one of the Mauthausens.
>> Gideon Frieder: To the mountains where the pa rtisans eventually established themselves and stayed there until the end of the war.
She wasnt aware of how recently the whole civil war battle ha d been fought and I told her that my senior year in high school we had come down here with my international relations club  my teacher  for a visit to Washington.
And then I ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 found out what happened to the other people.
But that did not in any way preclude the terrific devotion that my sister had shown me  because I know for a fact there were instances during the war that I was a goner  and had it not been for them  I would never ever have survived.
>> Bill Benson: When you finally reunited with your father  what was that like?
Th ey were they were more concerned about that until really the onset once war broke out  then I think the country really became became the country became unified as nothing Id ever seen before  the same way as it would happen in England .
>> Bill Benson: In addition to fellow internees  others that were in the same boat as you  so to speak  there were also prisoners of war.
They had to come back  you know  because the war broke out right after that.
I made money and How long did it take after the war before di di before you spoke about your experiences at Buchenwald?
Did any of your friends from before the war re turn afterwards?
The war broke out in 1939  and so there was no opportunity to  uh  show what I could do  uh  in the Olympic games.
I had a birthday in July  so I was 11 years  because the war started the first of September  39 years -- nine -- 1939  I was 11.
Well  after the war  they put -- the Germans left  naturally  and they put all the people from concentration camps  most of them were sick and so on  and he -- they put them into all their apartments and the houses  whatever.
>> Gideon Frieder: He was tried as a war criminal and hanged  and rightfully so.
I didn't -- you know  we were comforting each othe r  you know  every day there were new news  you know  that the Americans  they have joined th e war  Berlin is bombed  the Russians are here  29 the Americans are here.
So my brother said  look here  we lived through a war.
Had not the war broken  I think that probably my brother  maybe me  we would --he would emigrate to Palestine that time.
She said  ﬁAfter the war  go to your brother ﬂ because I had a brother in Palestine  ﬁgo to y -- Palestine  go to your brother ﬂ I had a brother in America  ﬁand tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us.ﬂ So this is the reasons that after the war  I started to tell  even in the beginning people didnt want to listen.
Did you know... did you have other Jewish friends in Germany at the time who had been through the Holocaust?
He -- he gave them moral support  and material support also  in the way that he kept all of my corres -- all the correspondence which was sent to him  which were meant for me  and which he sent to me after the war.
All the men were picked up and put into a camp.
However  this was the beginning of April of '39  and as you know  the war broke out in September.
But the situation was still so  after the war  people were not recovering yet.
But so the whole war time part was kind of in a different mode from the  from Dachau.
Unfortunately  it wasn't like that when I went back after the war to see the house again.
>> Ge orge Pick: The Germans no longer trusted the Hungarians  they knew the Hungarians had various connections  back -door connections with both the English and Soviets  and they were trying to get out of the war somehow  and the German intelligence penetrated the Hungarian intelligence  so they knew Hitler was worried about a couple of million German soldiers who were east of Hungary.
But the Germans got smart  eventually  you know what happens  so they were ripping the trains day and night and you know  the war was going on.
But your father  he had been a decorated soldier in the First World War  hadn't he?
I-It was yo u know  having survived the war  here is a situation where we could have lost our lives  had our parents not returned on time to to rescue us.
My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to officer training school for four months just before D-Day  and of course they missed most of the war.
I do remember the persons  the nurse where I stayed at  I know she was still alive after the war  and I know my parents took me there  once in a great while.
When -- before the war broke out  I was two  three months before finishing my studies.
When you were in Israel and you were growing up  and the war started Mm-hm.
Did you have the impression  over the years of the -- of the war  that things were getting worse for Jews?
Yes  she got- But she was in the orphanage before the war.
Anyway  so in fact   that passport I still have  part of my cherished memories  with a big J which af ter the war I found out  we actually owe the Swiss more than the Germans.
And we were hoping  of course  for the -- for the freedom in Czechoslovakia and for the Cold War to end. [
After the war  it was really rough too  to pick up the pieces again and I dont know if we should talk about that yet.
But  I mean  then after the war  right after the war when I came back th-the liberation  then I ha d different names and diffe rent cards.
He was in the manufacturing business of mens suits  and at the time just before the war  was starting to get contracts for army uniforms  and apparently had an in politically speaking.
The next day they took us to a different bunk and that bunk had some kind of preach beds.
I didn't r ealize what the war -- what's it all about.
She was a Polish woman  and came during the war asking my parents to move.
1944  March  if I remember it  19 th  is when the Germ ans had serious doubts apparently  that Hungary is not a trusted ally anym ore  that Hungary probably ente rtains the idea of getting out of the war because by th at time I think Romania was ready to jump and the situation in Italy was very shaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in a very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944  October.
And Joseph was called Joop  J-O-O-P. Jacob died before the war.
Warren Marcus: So the war stats and what's the immediate impact on you and your family?
And I somehow -- and I didnt care for it too much because when I first came to 21 Carteret I si -- lived there  I must say this  people were not bad by any means  even the Jewish people  but their -- most of the people I found were very condescending  like even when they were -- they really were not interested about what happened during the war  but everybody was like -- like -- almost like you pat a dog  poor kid  and -- and I really remember I didnt like that.
And then from  so I joined one of those Zionist groups.
The following day  we hear the war is over in Japan.
Is there more to do  or is the situation so bad because of the ravages of war?
As a matter of fact   I have there a picture of the synagogue which was destroyed which was on our street.
And after the war  my mother was the only daughter home with the with the two brothers.
You told me a story about your uncle who after the war was recognized.
But it was dark and I was  as I mentioned before  I was only 13 when the war broke out and this was earlier  so I was afraid to go down .
In the beginning  of course  we corresponded all the time  but then -- then the war broke out and once America entered the war we could not write to them then  we could not write to each other any more.
So when the war broke out in 1939  the f -- the Foreign Minister of Poland  Beck -- disappeared and you find out he was a German spy  the Foreign Minister Beck.
The other Hungarian rule that preceded anything that Germany came up with at the time  a law named numerus clausus was introduced in the early 1920s  restricting Jewish access to higher education  to the same proportion as the proportion of Jews in the total population  which  you know  numerically makes sense but when you realize that 80% of the population were illiterate Serbs bound to the earth that they labored on  then it's sort of out of kilter.
What do you recall  what impact did the war have on you?
Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in September 1939 to begin the war.
Interview with Susi Frank Annes October 4  2015 86 Again my mother.
And he served as an example like that throughout the war.
But they there was one individual  called Ludwig Leist   who was with Hitler in the first World War  in the Bavarian regiment.
Do you think that your experience made you feel more No  no I was very Jewish to begin with.
They had worked on the refugees committee before the war  and they helped after the war.
And my wife was born there  so sh e was here during the war  so was her father  he had come back here.
Well  my father left Poland from the port of Gdynia  or Gdansk in late August  with the last ship to leave a Polish port before the war started.
I was working with my father because up to the 42  I was working for -- because in my school  high school  you mu -- before the war  you must know the other language.
When we went already  we went to the ghetto  when we finally reported to the ghetto.
So  most of the time  I tried to catch up on the physical activities  which I missed during the war  rather than on the emotional side.
I was not at the top  but I was a good student.
when we fled  and we entrusted these possessions to a so called friend  and uh  after we returned after the end of the world war two to claim these possessions  they wouldn't recognize us  they wouldn't give them back to us  and uh  uh  they just totally dismissed us.
There was a big struggle after the war  a big struggle.
So  I hope that eventually I will accumulate a little bit  and  maybe get somebody to help  but there was not time between 38 and 40 in those --- between- 1940 the lowlands were attacked  but in 39 the war started on the Eastern front  so after that there was no leaving anywhere anymore  so it was just a year had gone by  well maybe a year and a half  and  and uh  that was  that was uh the end of our being together in a way because uh it   if it had lasted longer  if the Germans had not attacked in 1940  but maybe in 1941  maybe there would have been a chance for my sisters and my mother to follow me to Belgium.
That's when all before the war -- far before the war.
So there was mother just with her father just dead and the horror of the war  moving... Uh  my brother had gone back to the school that we had gone... He...he could not adjust to to the school in Breda  and he went back to Bilthoven.
Do you have any thoughts about spending time longer in Germany after the war?
It sounds like there was a pretty thriving black market going on after the war.
>> David Bayer: Before the war and during the war Germans occupied it.
And when I came back yeah  and what they said but she said to me  you living outside  and you gonna let live through  and get mar you will live through the war  and go to America and get married and have children.
And that sense of having to be this perfect child became part of who I  who I   I was after the war.
I remember thinking to myself  well  you know  while I was working on the land and the sun was shining  but under this same sky only relatively a few miles away  because Engl and isn't all that far from Germany  these people were living under the sa me sky and comparing the  you know  the fact that they were so hopeless and without any -- any hope of being save d or anything because  well  before the war ended  I mean  all the while th e concentration camps we re going  they were going on for eternity  I mean  the people -- the Germans gave up the camps only when the war was at their very doorstep.

A-Anyway  so it -- th-then the war broke out in September of 39  and Poland was -- was divided that like all in three parts within two parts.
That maybe by some chance they wound up in a camp somewhere and maybe after the war you w ill be reunited.

He was born Aaron  but in Germany he called himself Adolf  and that this thats the paper  thats a very interesting paper  that has on it what country are you from  and said and before 1919  you know  because after the war  it changed.
But I did hear about him in uh about 2 months or 3 months after the war ended that he was in Salbergs.
Uh  then uh  there were Russians  and it was hard to separate the Russians who were uh  military prisoners from Russian civilians that had been sent back  but uh  they were always hungry.

But when the war broke out  either they were killed I know my fathers sister  very tragically  there was a movie that was called  the brievela de Mama.
But I think it was both  it was the war in general  which all the children  Interview with Arlette de Long 25 everybody in my time suffered from  and it was personal in the difficulty of being a Jew and having such strong identific ation with -- with a man  with Christ  with a religion which basically also doesnt exist very much; its an idea in my head.

So some of the prisoners of war that signed the agreement that they would like to work for the you know   as civilians  they were there.
He left the little village in Villefranche for France before World War I. And when the war started -- and then he was an Austrian national.

But what really grieved me and -- and -- and - and enormously  is the fact that I couldnt find any of my schoolmates  and I couldnt find -- you know  that -- that -- that -- and you didnt know this until the war ended  until you were liberate d  so all that loss of all these -- I didnt reali -- I didnt have to de -- until the -- the actual liberation  I had no idea of the enormity  of the scope and the enormity of this annihilation of people  you know?
And after that  you didn't care where you were going to go  I mean you didn't know that you were going to go to Israel at that point  or you did?
I mean  it had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the war and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way.
It was a very scary time because we didn't know how long this would go on  hoping that the war would be over.
Started at eight oclock in the morning  til five in the afternoon.
Having seen what you saw in the camps  in Buchenwald   did it alter your view of th of the war  and your role in it?
Yeah  it was very hard but he had some old customers who when they  who had  as a matter of fact one of his customers was very helpful to us during the war.
But  when  when my husband came back from escaping from prisoner of war camp  we stayed in this town called St. Etienne  and uh he  he took over this uh  this uh store because he wanted to try to  to equip the underground that was in the mountain not far from there  and gave them every possible item that was in that store  socks and blankets and everything that was needed up in the mountains.
The war had ended by then  and we had lots of transport available and these the need for getting those people out of ther e as fast as possible  was great.
And they remained in Holland after the war when they went to Canada in 1956.
Now  tell me about the life in Budapest for you  away from your family  for those two years before the Germans came in.
And he was the hero of that war  of that battle.
She went; because  if she would go to the \ Krankenstube\  -- 04:15:03 She met me after the war  she lives now in Ch icago  I hope she's still alive  and I met her in Landsberg am Lech.
So then I was in Krakau  and I was together with a girlfriend  and I went to this apartment where I used to live when th e war broke out.
And in the meantime the war was going on around us.
My mother was a Knight of the Italian Republic after the war  Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27  2017 122 for all she had done for Italian Americans here.
But you know  even after the war when we came I was proud to come there.
>> Ronald Coleman: You mentioned that you had a cousin who had been killed at the very beginning of the war.
And we had a German company commander who asked Sergeant Goldstein and myself to take these SS troopers back to the prisoner of war.
In 1939  just before the war  I was listening to the radio like most of the people and we heard that there might be a war against Germany.
I  I didn't  there is nothing  I mean the only diamonds actually that survived the war  was my mother's engagement ring  but no  my in -laws  actually  because they came here  so they  they fled  but they fled as a family and they didn't really go through any ca mps or anything  so whatever they took with them they  except for what they had to spend to bribe officials along the way to survive  they came with quite a bit of diamonds with them  so my mother -in-laws jewelry that she gave me along the years  those are really pre -war  many of them.
There are different -- I me -- is seet -- not a single group  but together this is the group -- summ er camp shortly before the war.
In order to make business and that it should be something we make work for the benefit of the country  so it was war.
I went to -- to the aunt where -- she died in the meantime  during the war  but her ska -- her -- her a -- thats [indecipherable] is the -- well  si -- Im con -- no connection with -- with the -- with Rene  but they also connected a little bit.
>> Bill Benson: By the time Germany invaded Poland in September 1939  of cours e launching World War II  by that time your community had already experienced profound change.
I thought if I would get involved with that  when the war ended I wouldnt be sent to the Pacific.
Then I I worked in the camp for the...partly to establish that brothel and then when I was working in the camp  I heard one day that there were British pris oners of war who had appeared in that factory and sure enough  uh what the Germans had done was uh the British  as you know from the records  had fought Rommel in North Africa  had surrendered at .
Because they took them to Poland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time.
And the King said if the Jews ever have to wear the...uh...the Jewish star  the six-pointed Jewish star where it said Jew on it  he would be the first one to wear it  but it never materialized during the war.
They were published after the war  and thats when he said  ﬁIf your mother were alive  I would ask her to marry you.ﬂ He to ld me that he had a daughter  Eva  who died in the ghetto at not even a year old  and thats when I found out that he had a wife.
>> Fanny Aizenberg: Well  I had a sister who has remained alive during the war in Belgium.
She was left 14 years  a girl before the war in Europe was very sheltered.
And -- And after the war they -- they didnt go back to Poland  because used to be a lot of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 84 pogroms there and up against the Jews  right after the war.
>> Bill Benson: Manny  you also mentioned that there is the larger context of the war going on  so there was bombings and other deprivations.
But my father also then  it was very inte resting in our little apartment  ‚cause he– there was no rabbi in Spartanburg and so he– I dont know if they ever had one before the war  whether they just got– I mean the Jewish co mmunity learned right away about his vast knowledge of Jewish culture and religion and that he could actually officiate at a service.
Everybody was happy about it  but we had to get rid of all these people  we had to get into the war crimes trials  a-and all these things were going on there.
So by the time this whole war had started and my brother was already there  1942 came  and everyb ody was getting arrested and deported in Ludbreg.
How -- How was that for you  to be back in -- in Auschwitz  specifically?
And after the war  when they transfer my unit from Berlin back to Ukraine   and it was 10 miles from my town So you didnt see him you didnt see him when Since 40 first of 45.
I reme mber in World War I  part of Yugoslavia was occupied by Greeks.
And then my br others mis and my two brothers then later  during the war they worked pa rt time in a photo sh lab.
>> Bill Benson: Let me go back a little bit right before that .
This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing happened.
The greatest pain I have -- its funny  its interesting because it has nothing to do with the war  or maybe it does  is of being in exile.
>> Henry Kahn: Prisoners of war which were kept separate by a stupid little tent.
My brother was going on the -- was at that museum and a person a pproached him that we knew from before the war  and said  ﬁWhat are you doing here?
>> Bill Benson: You would be in those circumstances  then of course in 1944 the war is turned against the Germans and Hungary is preparing to capitulate to the allies  and that is when Germany moved quickly  once they realized the Hungarians would capitulate  the Germans moved quickly to occupy Hungary  and the areas including your town.
But when the Germans start losing the war  when the Russians put up a fight and the Germans seen it's not working well  then they start taking care all these...they start going after the Jews.
Is there anything more you'd like to say about the war crimes trials?
And in the war crimes teams there were actually quite -- I don' t recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were.
But after that it was the war was you could tell it was coming to an end.
My -- there were not many Jews left and there were a lot of people what went with the Germans.
And Hans had been very ashamed of his father when the war broke out in World War II  in 39  he signed up in the Foreign Legion and was taken prisoner by the Ge rmans and escaped  and wrote a book about the whole situation; his service  his family  and it became a best seller.
That the indi -- an individual of the same name  a nd same birth year at least  and its o-often the same birthdate  of this war crime suspect had actu ally entered the United States on such and such a date.
Can you tell me a little bit abou t when the war broke out in 1939?
In fact  in the whole war I remember being afraid because I always knew when the adults around me were afraid.
People could not  during the war  go out and buy new shoes or -- or had difficulties replacing the worn jackets or shirts.
To go back to Europe  after what you went through  what was that like for you?
And closer to the war  the family  all of us  were in that city of Lastrovmazofyetsky and in Ostralinka they left the homes  the houses that we were living in  as sort of to the outcome it will be.
Li ved through the first World War  it was horrible  I wont be able to make it.ﬂ And to me it was  my God  if Mother says that  I am doomed as well  I cannot take it  I cannot do anything like that without my mommy.
W e went to West Germany to a DP camp in Berlin .
It means that longer than the war  but thank God I escaped and I was free earlier.
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek Jewish colonel  Mordechai Frizis  who  with hi s troops  stopped the Italian advance  giving the allies their first victory of the second World War.
One day  when we was the German occupy our town  and we lived still in our house  you know.
Did you have any dreams before the war of what you were going to be?
D-Do you remember where you were when the war started  1939?
As a prisoner of war  I had the right to write to send letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me.
And of course after the war uh we had uh  it was a big affair in in Los Angeles in uh I believe it was Century Plaza and she was honored as a righteous Christian.
I dont know exactly  but I think she was about 26 when the war started.
After the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 30 war  I -- I still was in touch with her  but she married this non-Jew and she cut herself off from the fam -- from -- there were uncles and aunts and my parents.
I know it for a fact  because after the war I came to Krakow and people told me that.
The Poles felt it very possible war may break out  so a partial mobilization took place.
And so in the morning when they opened  when we supposed to go to war  the guard took position in those spaces where they supposed to be  and they opened the gates  and we walked to [indecipherable] the holes where we work.
I have no clue how we got through a war  and my mother brought stuff.
You know  it its a stupid thing to say  but in some ways the air raid s  and the disruption of everything  is what Interview with J udith Heimann November 21  2011 72saved us  because there was lit the communications werent any good any more  and you know  things werent going if the war had gone better  we would have been a goner long ago.
But this was helpful  this was obviously a Christian organization and its before the war  before there was any si -- ca -- question of trying to h-hide your Jewish origin  she was -- obviously had a Christian orientation.
I know a case of a guy he was a living in Germany in the Gdansk before the war and when the war came  he was no longer they simply told him go to Poland.
But then the war started  I start to go in June in the air force  and in May the war started  and that was it.
What was the general spirit of the Armed Forces going back into Europe to help end the war?
So I guess  the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners  whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners  I don't know  but I know there were Germans.
But we couldnt do anything with this tremendous  tremendous horde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took ‚til the end of the war  and then some.
I was with a group of young people  we wer -- we survived the war intact.
And after after the war  they thought communism is of course the solution for everybody.
And she said  well  she said  during the war years all children in school were given a small bottle of milk and my mother told me to save half of the little bottle for the baby next door.
The awful thing that happened  very shortly after the war  1946  was that my brother contracted scarlet fever and died within three days.
Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically  except their pride and their joy that the -- now  the war -- the end of the war came.
So  you were following the war because Eddies family is still in Vienna  or not?
The photo on the right is of Gideon's parents  Ruzena and Abraham  before the war.
But also  after the war  of course  nobody practiced any religion.
As I say  I have no ill feelings for -- war is not healthy.
Well  we think that we were escaping because the Germans are behind us  you know.
He was also in the war  taken to the war  a Russian man.
When you said the coal boat  the boat going from Interview with Ursala Guttstadt McKinney 41 Oh the re were the boats   after the war which came from America where had coal in and so on.
I wasn't even afraid; I didn't know with what to associate this  that this was the day that the war started  and the planes came over Poland.
Well the Hungarians tried to do the same thing except they were not successful 12 and the Czechs intercepted them  captured them and imprisoned them and held them and tortured them and who knows what they did to them  but once the Vienna Arbitrage came and the Hungarians took over  they had to turn them loose  they had to release all these prisoners  but they continued their activities even during a time of war  there were organizations which let's say -- one day our town was  I don't know what to call it  raided or something.
My father and I followed right after  right after  and we came to Bialystok and in Bialystok there was danger again of being killed  again  after the war by pogroms.
This again  this was very shortly before  before the war came to an end.
But as a child  do you have any memories before any war  before any occupation?
Now  after the war  when the war ended  they maybe thought that nobody will survive  cause my mom died  grandma was taken into a concentration camp.
And I was one of the lucky girls to get one  because I was evidently engaged to a Swedish gentleman and he said if the war wouldnt have come  I would be his wife.
The War Refugee Board  they had a representative in Stock holm.
So  my father was uh  was given by the authorities a certificate with a medal which I still have to this day which was saved by a German Catholic family that he gave it to that had also served with my father in World War I. And uh the certificate uh I  reads basically uh - in the name of the Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor  which was Hitler  of course  give n in my father's name  and uh  in uh  it gives the law that was passed to give this to people and I think it was a mistake to give it probably to the Jews but some of them slipped through.
He was killed after the war  the third of May '45  he was on the walk  and they took a transport and wanted to bring them to the sea and drown them there.
Why did they come it was in 1956  and this was when the Suez War was.
He also  in his speeches  published by the Nazi regime  in during the war  would repeatedly refer to his promise to kill all Jews in Europe   on 30 January 39   always said he did it on for September 39.
His son had been a victim... was killed in the war.
I think it was about til f I would come home for holidays  vacations  til about fi til the end of the war  maybe.
He was a  just kind of a very outstanding figure  a tall  very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during th e War  World War II and somehow worked for a shoe factory  which was a very famous shoe factor y all over the world  Ba ta  got married there and came once to visit us and I stil l remember his visit.
We thought because of lack of communication during the whole war  that maybe they were hiding somewh ere.
When th-the Russians came before the war  he was afraid  too.
In 19 grad got my da my masters degree in divinity and it was in 1940  first war had already started in Europe  and my father had headed up the war war prisoners aid of the YMCA   which was approved in the Geneva Convention  that international Red Cross took care of the physical problems of the prisoners on ev-every country  and the YMCA took care of their Interview with Tracy Strong June 11  2009 6spiritual and intellectual problems  physical problems.
I forgot  thats when you asked me what -- what happened immediately after the war.
Why dont you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war started.).
So that eventually when everybody got settled back and it was now official that the Germans have occupied Po land  the factory was taken over and converted to heavy war machinery and  whereas before the war  Jews were not employed in that 19 plant  now Jews were beginning to be taken in as a labor force.
Her son was one of the heros of the Six Day War.
So it wasnt as if the war came and you became a different person?
But we had not talked about leaving Poland before the war broke out.
The Jews -- the Jews were supposed to wear an armband with the Star of David.
Do you know  before the war was known for this it was called ﬁthe Wilno Jerusalem of Lithuanian.ﬂ There was such a strong nucleus  culture in Jewish and in every  every aspect of Jewish life in Wilno that we were convinced that there must be an underground there.
And and actually  the first mo memory of her is for what I thought that it was the beginning of beginning of the war.
Here is the police registration in -- in Karlsbad where  for the first time since the war  I gave as my nationality Jew.
By that time the World War II just started about two weeks I think it was  in September something.
Now  prior to that time  there was a question early on at the end of the war  how would these people be housed  the refugees.
In a different way  but it was a war we fought.
After the war at it was excellent but at that time  on that one occasion  just couldnt eat it.
Which reminds me  I meant to ask about your -- you were talking about how you felt about Germans back then.
Now I'm telling more  and now they're all asking me when they found out  you know  that I went on that Honor Flight  now they're saying  \ You mean you were there \  but they say most people don't talk -- they didn't talk about their World War II experience.
And then we became in a little bit hopeful  became that this war isnt going to last long.
And Im also lucky that my life after the war turned out to be a nice  and a good life.
I guess I just did another year when the Kor ean War broke out in 19 50  and we were in Michigan.
And they were charged with what was known as war crimes.
You see  in those days  although penicillin was all ready -- after the war  was already invented  but it was question of availability.
And of course th at was the time where  from what I have heard from the Russians  an the Ukrainians  how horrible Russian and the Soviet system is  I said  even worse than the Germans  than the Nazis even at war I mean  they are just as the Nazis if not worse.
And when he was a boy  he was for free  ba about 17 - 18 years old  or maybe 20  he went to Hasharah and the war start  so he had to wake up  if not we would were were got ourself we got to go to Israel.
And did you know what was going on in the war on the outside?
Im going to ask you clarify the t the term hot war.
I m ean  I visited the camp a few times since I  you know  after the war and it's still standing.
No  there was no no other wa and th en then the war started  and and and my mother and got married.
We were there  then when Germany came  we went to the DP camp.
In the war time they made guns and rifles and things like that and in the  in the normal times they made some  some official with meant on and hunting rifles and something like that.
Could you tell me  please  wh at happened to you and your family once the war began  once Romania and Germany started to lead their operations against the Soviet Union?
Did you -- Did you witness any treatment of how the POWs were being treated by the al -- No  no  it was -- it was afte-after the war  there were na -- no German soldiers occupation visible.
youre going to go and -- I dont know if they thought it was great  you know  but that was -- that was war and we were fighting the war and that was certainly my place to be there.
I I I think I only had one or two encounters with him before and there he was  again a a person who in the months between the invasion and uh and uh the end of the war had been toughened by combat  and there he was standing with a a with an emaciated - well  they were all emaciated - with a man who who had who was ready to eat ravenously and and he put his arm around him  and the  he was in a spit-and-polish uniform and the prisoner was dirty as they were all  and he put his arm around him and he he said to him  I heard him...he said  take a little now.
After the war  also  that was a kind of betrayal on my pa rents' part that I was pensioned off again.
My father was a dentist and my mother was a pediatrician and uh in 1936  when I was not quite three years old  my father passed away in a sort of a medical uh mishap and uh then my mother died shortly thereafter  so I was left to be raised by my grandparents  uh just before the war started  and my grandparents were living in Timisoara  in Romania  so that from Budapest uh I ended up uh going to Timisoara and that's where I went to school and lived until uh after the war in 1948 when we left.
And then I didnt do anything til I met the doctor  Otto Vulcan  whom I knew after the war  still in Poland.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 54 Did you sense  at the same time in -- that Americans were anti-Semitic?
In fact  Camp Sharp had originally been commanded  during World War I  by Eisenhower.
For instance  to work in a all kinds of agricultural work that I was not really qualified for  but I could at least make a living and I think till the war crossed the River .
before the war and you did say some thi ngs about it in the first interview  but we didnt get your -- we didnt get the names of your family  your parents and your sister.
Did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews?
You know  you lived in this constant hope that the war was miraculously going to be won soon.
But  this was only the beginning because the minute the Germans came in  things started to get very bad for us.
What did you -- did she tell you more about that  what happened to her during the war while you were there  or was that something you didnt talk too much about?
In the end  out of 5 000 Jews in Dresden  60 were still alive at the end of the war.
When I showed him the photographs of Warsaw with the  some underground inscrip tions of the war on the walls and all that  he said to himself  \ Poor Warsaw \  a nd all that  but there was the attitude well  we cannot do anything for you.
I happened to be  you know  when you come af ter the war  you ask everybody.
Did you learn something about their fate while you were in Auschwitz?
So what do you remember about the actual beginning of the war in 1939?
I mean my father had to die  he was 48 years old  he was a sick man.
But three days before the war -- no  she was supposed to go there and begin -- in the beginning of September the war Interview with F red Goldman November 19  2001 41broke out  and -- about three days before she would have gone  so she -- she couldnt go.
And the Germans were there with them with a lot of money.
The war is over and -- and maybe its -- maybe there was a feeling that its time to start a new life or -- but at the same time  youve got this burden of knowing what had happened to your family and to your people.
Well  unfor -- unfortunately  month later -- by that time Im in the mountains  but Im -- I -- I learn after the war  some people  you know   foolishly  in March  or April 44 -- now  were going about a year later  the Jews issue another proclamation -- I mean  the Germans  saying Jews can come and register to get matzoh distributed  and some of them  believe it or not  did go  and they were grabbed  and -- Now  before you go to the mountains  you are hiding for about how long?
I think that they thought that they -- well  the war was winding down  and I think they thought they were not going to have to bl ow open any more bank vaults.
We financed the war from our own people 1:10: putting up the money to fight the war  and so I spent time here and my assignment was the Paramount Theater circuit and I met the president of the company and the vice presid ent and all those people.
And so we knew that   we actually found out that there is going to be a war again.
Well uh  there are there are pictures that remain with you like uh you see in flashbacks in movies som etimes and uh for me it's in real life several uh pictures that are alive to this day  and that would be like the first telephone uh that was installed in just before the war broke out and the reason that I would remember it is that uh I would watch people walking to uh talking to the wall and uh that uh was such a wonder to me that uh I couldn't explain it and it's remained with me to this day.
Just let's hope till the war is ended  and  and that's wh at we tried to do  until we were deported from Auschwitz  but we  we stayed together all  and  and that gave us strength to survive.
I ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 don't remember how this came about.
Right before the end of the war  we had one  one guy who was a Danish agent.
Then when the war broke out  I was going to school in 1939  and in 1940  they started to talk that I wouldn't be able to go to school.
And whereas American plan es bombed the rail lines to I.G. Farben  which had slave labor  they used the camp inmates to operate their factories  it -- it -- it is said and it is remembered and it is a part of history that they did not bomb the rail lines leading to Auschwitz  because it would delay the war effort.
That finished me with the War Refugee Board  that finished me with th e army.
But the war thing happened  I never forget  was August 10  1942.
>> Bill Benson: And you would continue in these circumstances until 1944.
It wa came during the war  brought by Soviet Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 25Union .
We f -- I remember that when the Russians arrived  they assigned most of the partisans to the army  because the war was still going on.
But I knew them from before the war but they were not close friends.
Anised was a very  very right wing g roup of underground partisans in Poland in time of the war.
They always despised the Jews  if it was before the war or after the war.
Who knows  if the war wouldn't be there 33 or something.
As a matter of fa ct the whole three are  after the war we knew  the whole three ar e finished.
In Lexington  or in the– and did you  do you  did you have the sense that people knew what had happened during the war in Europe  what had happened to the Jews?
In 1939 we heard that the war broke out in Poland and the Germans went into Poland and the Russians came into Lithuania took over the Baltic states.
And ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 many were.
Because wherever it was before Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 14the war  everything was taken away.
That was a wartime  and gosh in a wartime  many  man -- this no -- no war  you know  is honest on either side  you know.
So anyway  when the war started  we knew that something was going to go on.
H-How do you explain your ability to -- the war is over  its over  and now we start anew.
They were trapped by this traitor who was shot after the war.
One day I came back ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 home and I said to my aunt and my sister  I said: Well  today I spoke with my friends -- I was 9 or 10.
Schiff is relating a story of a man from Horo chow whom she met after the war.
Because this was a camp and we work together with the Germans.
World War II began with Germany and Russia's invasion in Poland in September 1939.
And he explained to me that at the end of World War II  when Austria became what is now Little Austria -- ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 >> Bill Benson: At the end of the First World War >> Charles Stein: Before that  Austria  of course  as you probably know  the Austrian emperor ruled over what then became Austria  Czechoslovakia  most of Poland  most of Romania  Yugoslavia and the northern part of Italy.
So Germans came and these two were deport ed as prisoners of war and they survived the prisoner of war camp.
I know that they had an airline that was traveling into Ecuador and -- and some of them actually  during the war  were sent to the states to camp  you know  to whatever kind of camps they had for the Germans.
Of course  I know  it's war time  but there is a certain limit that you can allow yourself to do things  even though it's war.
I also -- the -- my -- my si -- teachers at the yeshiva and the older  more senior students   you know  warned me  said that the United States was extremely materialistic and I shouldnt forget the things I had learned over there  you know  that -- and th at one of the -- the lessons that I should take back from the war was that material objects were really not that important.
My the 28th Infantry Division after the war was sent to the States.
But when they wrote  did they then fill in some of the gaps of what had happened during the war?
And when my wife picked me up from Fort Mead   she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for me.
Did you have  or did your parents have any correspondence or connection with the people back in -- ya -- the family back in Germany?
And i -- we -- we want in  and besides th-the Russian  you know  it -- they wanted to send my father and us I think to Siberia because they found out that we were bourgeois before the war  and this is  you know  terrible in -- under the Russian communist government.
I couldnt be there because it was end of the war.
It really goes back to United States immigration policy at the end of World War .
Okay  I didnt care too muc h. The war broke out already.
Bill Benson: September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland  starting world war -- Rae Goldfarb: No  no  Russia invades Poland.
Where we lived before the war was actually where the main ghetto was set up.
So by When your parents  at the end of the war and other people  heard about the terrible slaughter of the Jews and everything  were they affected?
From on the date that I gave you and the war was still going on because it didn't fini sh officially.
And we left  we left in August of ‚39  the beginning of August and they followed us  September  beginning of September  the S econd World War started.

During the war years  how closely did you follow the news of what was happening in Europe?
Lodz   Lodz   the city of Lodz   that had 200 000 Jews before the war  two of them came back.
Then they organized  as the war progressed and as the war got worse  the German...we got involved in...uh...in the cold weather.... the washing...we got bogged down there.
And the minute the admiral who was the head of Hungary  Admira l Horthy finished his speech in which he announced that as far as he was concerned the war was lost  at that moment  you know  hell broke loose.

Interview with Renate Fischer Chernoff June 23  2005 84But the fact that the war was over was -- at least the European part of the war was over.

It reminds me a story when it was the Yom Kippur war.
And then after the war  beginning -- starting a life over again  I would hear her cry at night at times  certainly  in the first few years.
RJ] Well  I suppose it was just a war ti me experience that was best forgotten.
There was -- There were -- There were quite a few Russians  Poles.
So to escape that war and the camps  the father di ed  the boys survived  and the mother survived.
Or a man by the name of Kasztner--a lawyer  a Hungarian lawyer  who negotiated with uh Eichmann--who then immigrated to Israel after the war and was assassinated there by some people who thought...by a person who thought that he had done something that was inappropriate  or there was a collaborator.2 Those particular stories are well documented elsewhere.

And as prisoner of war we worked; it was very bad.
World War I. So she brought up her brothers and sisters.
The war was won  the Germans had walked all over them.
Lillian: Yes  and I think school was supposed to start within two or three days and of course  after the war started  the first to close were the Jewish public schools.
I wasnt born then  but she came and must have been in the -- after the -- I think after the second World War -- the first World War.
When he found out that we were Jewish  you know  he was -- this was shortly after the war  and maybe he had family in Germany  you know  and he didnt fee -- he was a good doctor  but he had no warmth  and it was so funny how suddenly he was helpful  and -- you know  theres a difference between being correct  and being nice.
And I was -- since my father had been in the World War I and fought at the front  I was -- the Jewish children whose parents fought  their fathers fought in the front  they were allowed to go to German high school.
So  he and the daughter - this daughter and her name was Hela   because he always talked about her  Salik Analewicz  after the war.
Uh  until 1944  it looked like Germany was going to win the war.
He must have got killed or didn't come home or something from the war.
But th -- Roosevelt could of course not go and -- and join in the war.
I mean  we were really very much and thats how he was able to go back to being in a position to being in a position of power because he had suffered during the war.
Germany and the Soviet Union attacked Poland beginning World War II.
Th at that territory had to be clean of all the Jews  which that territory which was expected to become Romanian in the event of the war ending with a German victory  should be clean of Jews.
Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 103 Ah  I see.
We had a type writer  I remember my father put it on the 5th floor because we thought the war w ould go only 6 months.
And then everybo dy hoped and prayed the War woul d end soon.

They got all the chocolates one could round up during the war to keep these kids quiet.
My sisters name is Sarah and she lives -- she survived the war with me and she lives now in Israel.

We managed to communicate after the wa second war a little  but my parents were in the process of diso divorce  anyway.
Did you talk to your husband about what had ha ppened to you during the war?
If you had but one statement to say about this whole period from Kristallnacht to the end of the war that you would wish to leave with somebody as to what it mean  what it did to you  what would you say?
So  I guess what I wanted to say to you is we kind of led an -- an -- a normal social life here  but felt different  because we had gone through the war.
My Dad  keeping in mind your possible interest in our integration in American life  that this was also the period of the o utbreak of the Spanish Civil War.
M -- in the last few days of the war we had seen long processions of people on foot  m-most of the time from the eas t. It was a strange mixture of people  the occasional concentration camp inmate in stripe d garb  the occasional SS man  guarding him  or just looking out for -- for his own interest.
At that time my father had died  died a fulfilled man  because he managed to bring his fa mily together  managed to give me and my sister education in spite of the horrible ordeals of World War II.
I think that did more for my spirits after the war.
What about the people that you knew from befo re the war.
And somebody  with that being in mind  avoiding the draft  going to a foreign country  and demonstr ating against his own county country about the Vietnam war  does not deserve to be a president.
The war would go on and out of 20 years  we would have plenty of food in our house.
World War II began on September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland on the west followed quickly by the Soviet Union attacking Poland from the east.
And he was very  very concerned to the poin t that when the war seemed inevitable  he and my mother drove around the country  looking for a house that we could live in and -- outside the city  because we didnt know the city will be bombed.
And -- whereas before  these were independent units  marauding  doing whatever they could  but this was put on a much more professional footing  because by that time  the -- the man in command of the entire ELAS was General Sarafias  who was a professional military officer before the war.
So that later after the war  after I had survived  I got fresh papers.
And thats how we both happened to be  at the end of the war  involved in the Nuremberg Trial preparation. (
And one Polish man who he did business before the war lent him some money to start.
Tell us what that time was like for you and your community and your family when you were under Russian occupation.
26 About that little boy... Oh  that little boy came over  so then we hear the war coming nearer.
What I met him after the war  you know  I [indecipherable].
I was  as I indicated before  a witness in a couple of uh uh war...call it war crime trials.
We felt that we were so prepared for war yet war was an abstraction.
After the war  well  when it's over  going after so -and -so.
Did you experience any anti-Semitism on the campus in general  or in those years?
So they had to find a place where the--the ghetto could only--there was at that time  in Kovno  was about  I would say  around--30 000 Jews when the war broke out and I think you probably know the percentage--maybe 3 or 4 thousand of these survived in concentration camps and so forth.
I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials that   which means they are materials they use during the war for war materials  because I used copper.
I -- I was just trying to -- I have an image of what it must have been like to be in a DP camp on the first high holiday after the war and it -- it -- if you participated in that.
And the Joint was on e of the agencies working in Europe after the war.
There  you never forget -- forgot that there was a war.
Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its doors  and I went to Rome.
But because of the war there were no students at the school.
Well  as we we followed the war  you couldnt help but be aware of what was going on.
Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war?
We heard on the radio Friday morning at breakfast time  we heard about the attack on Warsaw a nd about the war.
And then when the war started between Russia and...and Germany  that's when they liberated us.

But before we turn to Kristallnacht and the events that led up to that and what your family did right after that  tell us  first  about your life  your family  your community in your early years before the war actually began  even before Kristallnacht.
And it wasnt -- a-again  you know  coming from an environment so surrounded by death  it -- it -- it -- it was one more and the -- the war didnt end in 1945  it continued.
Then what I wanted to mention is that the first time I realize that there was a -- really a war  okay  was when I joined my father in May o-of 44 -- th -- I went to school in that time.
And  I was in Greece well  the war was still on when the camps were liberated  and people  I think  dont realize that so many thousands of people had been incarcerated in concentration camps and labor camps  and the army had no place for them once they were liberated  and the only thing they thought of doing was sending these people home.
And Hitler made a schedule for the war  and he had given Monday for the Netherlands  but he forgot that we are very stubborn  and we fought five days.
There was anti-Semitism in the Polish population  foreve r. Before the war  during the war and after the war.
When -- Before the war was your father's business catering to all different kinds of customers  Jews  nonJews?
And I did talk in these reports not only about conditions in the and how the prisoner of war were Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 65organized and how they had been able to kill some of the guards  but I also talked about the fact that there were special problems with Jews who didnt want to be with Poles  and certainly didnt want to be with Germans.
>> Vincent Slatt: By that time you were 13 years old when the war ended  right?
I mean  they had gotten there befo re the war  like in '39; or their parents did.
By the events that happening before the war  in '38  '39  the international events start to show to the people  specially to the Jewish people  to find a way to escape in case Hitler would come close to our borders.
And  but somebody further down obviously did  and we eventually found out in the end that he  hed been brought up in England and erm  when  his mother had married a German soon after the First World War  and moved to Germany with him  and after  when he was still a baby anyway  she left her husband and brought him back to England  and of course he was brought up in England.
Then the Germans came in and then  of course  the Germans took over like they took over the other countries.
Tell me about what happened when the Nazis...what happened when the war broke out?
You know  supposedly it was just the only son and they was saying  you know  send your only son to the war  but the mayor  whatever  he didn't like my father for some reasons and they they sent my brother to the war.
The third part were in the area of F ooznine  which was more anti-Semitic oriented territory  so -- and so this was wa -- 19 -- 1914  then the war broke out.

First it goes on th e river Elba and then it comes to Cookshaven  which is at the  as the Elba flows into the... and up to there it comes to a certain island  which is called Helgaland  which was complete ly submerged during the war  but now it's up again.
they they told me in probably in five minutes time  that M-Mother and Dad had been killed by the Germans in the war  but I was too young to know them  so they didnt want me to worry about it  or ever think about it  because I belonged to them.
As a consequence  taken by train to some neutral port in Spain  maybe even in Germany or to Turkey  to be sent to Palestine because we all claimed to be displaced persons because of the war.
And your your father was trying to escape being drafted  was that during the run up to the first world war  or when was that?
But it was a false alarm but it gave you a nice shock listening after the war had been declared  I can assure you.
Had your father fought in World War I  by the way?
And when I came to America I work with very rich people in the brokerage  all of them are millionaires  and one I told him that my mother always talk about Minerva   oh it was car made in Switzerland   it was 25 000 in America before the first World War.
Oh yeah  I saw him  yeah  before their I remember they took him to the war crimes trials  thats where I saw him  but I never went to the war cri I didnt really care about what was happening at the at the war crimes trials.
Bu ilt a house  two years before  this I know  two years before the war.
Did you even– When did you know that the war had started in Septem ber of 1939?
in between  with the exception that we f aced starvation because the -- the war between the Germans and the partisans intensified  and while before it was so easy to get in and out of Agrinion  it became more difficult.
So your family life and your family before the war  you told me a significant story that your mother shared with you along the lines of someone saying one day  well  today you now speak Yugoslavian.
That may have been  but I think that the war had a lot to do with it  too.
And 35 the local forester was sort of a fairly d ecent guy  I mean he got us as Jews  oh yeah  I should have said that with the outbreak of World War II  of course  immediately food was rationed.
It was already the preparation for the war was ordered in some way that -- of course  I know I -- lucky guess  but I knew  everywhere  people are doing up to now  they saying  we -- we tape the window glasses by the paper  yes  to avoid when the blow will hit the glass  and the bomb  and there will be no shrapnels from these glasses  and you will avoid -- first of all  you are strengthening this window  and you are avoiding the splintering of the glasses.
Is that in the ghetto or was that before the ghetto?
I  as a matter of fact I enlisted beca use  there was a war  they were beginning to draft people  my father had spen t  I guess a year and a half or so in World War 1 as an infantryman.
Do you think your experience during the war helped you get through this?

S: Very little  except the uncle who lived in Jerusalem and during the war when we were still living in Onod  he would write to us and he would describe the mountains of 45 Jerusalem  the beauty of the country.
And the rest of Europe didnt know much  rest of the war.
It wouldn't escape me  especially  especially to see people who do have family  because right after the war  people came from Russia  people came out of hiding and here were those families.
I know but you know it was important for me to sa y it  to give an answer not to sidestep it because for people like myself who were younger during the war the matter of having a voice is crucial.
Why would people be joining the army  his army  after the war is over?
I guess my mother was trying to be close  but not too close  in case she needed to lo ok up somebody  or -- I dont know why  really  but thats where we -- we spent the war.
How about the atmosphere in the City of Hamburg  do you remember what it was before the outbreak of the war?

Were you very close to your brother as a young child?
And uh soon th ereafter  and I was still working in that labor gang and it was still   and though America had entered already the war  uh we didn't feel the effect of it immediately because they had to get installed in England and they had started with the first air raids  but not towards Berlin.
So the Germans basically  they knew that there was some sort of plan going on  but they didnt know who it was?

Sometimes we knew that there would be ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 another battle.
That organization was started in Russia  I think  after the First World War.
We didn't know what  we didn't have  talk about kids my age  you know  when the war started I was 12 years old  I didn't learn a trade or anything else  my way of thinking was completely distorted.
Now actually  in my house we didnt have a telephone  we share it with the people upstairs  the Shabetais  and so I think Mrs. Shabetai answ ered  and I said I just arrived  she says  ﬁAll 70 right  come on  come on.ﬂ ﬁAll ri ght ﬂ I said  ﬁIm going to take a -- a taxi.ﬂ So I got on a taxi  and eventually f -- it wasnt really -- it was Omonia  that square I mentioned to you earlier  where people will sit on the grates du ring the war.

And alt hough I wasnt sure there was any future in there  I lived by myse -- I went and got an apartment somewhere else  which was great luck that I could even find anything after the war.
Im going to start by asking you some questions that are before the war.
So thats when we went to Volary and then we went to Munich with the Americ with the German Red Cross  and and to the international tracing service and thats where I found out that I dont even exist  except after the war.

Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 82 This may be a good place to stop for no w. Id like to talk to you again  about after the war.
But I'm not -- 6 ROUGH DRAFT COPY NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: But you know he fought in the First W orld War ?
That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training.
>> Bill Benson: But you had it all those many years.
So it was not that the Germans were strafing the fields as much as they did at the beginning of the war.
And there was a parish house here  and then next to it  exactly next to it  the same wall  there was a big hotel before the war  which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German services in that town.
But my father was concerned that another war might break out and if you went to one of these surrounding countries  you would find yourself under Nazi domination again.
No  but I meant  do you re ex cuse me  do you read about World War II?
D-Do you  when you look back on the times after the war  do you see a lot of ways in which what happened to you affected you  or is that really very difficult to parse out?
All I can say is that I think that -- I dont think theres been a day since -- since the war  that in one way or another  I hadnt thought about it.
Are there certain things about -- about your experiences during the war  during the Holocaust that -- that really directly affected things that yo u did later -- later in your life?

And of course  during the war my father -- I mean  befo re the war  when Austria was occupied and Germany -- ther-there was trouble in Germany  my father used to walk refugees from those countries across the mountains to -- to Poland be cause they were escaping from Austria and from Germany.
Well any place you went after the concentration camps in Germany and throughout the war  once it ended  nothing was in comparison to the concentration camps.

They had pigs  they slaughtered since war  a-and geese  so it was great.
>> Bill Benson: Once the Germans took over  that was the end of that?
And he met him there and naturally the -- the joy was grateful and -- and my father was -- was very sick and it was a friend of his  woman friend  that knew him from before the war  and cared for him.
So they were very impressed  I would say and -- and also I felt that -- that I had something tell my fellow officers  that I was a good influence to my friends and colleagues  and they saw it from a different viewpoint  they thought it was something  having been there  not hating the Germans  but that I could add something to it  which was actually true  because I was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 107 involved once in writing up a plan in Korea  for prisoners of war  not to mistreat them  because we didnt do that  we went by the Geneva Convention  and because of my experiences  I was very sensitive to when a guy becomes a prisoner  not like I became one because I was a Jew  but to become the prisoner in the field  in -- in war time  that they are not to be mistreated  or to interrogation -- what do you call that -- tortured.
But as I said  the whole war that we lived through was destiny.

Nobody could - they'd never seen any soldiers dressed up in a war like that.
>> Bill Benson: So Jill  during that time  those years that you were in Kenya during the war  and of course as you said the war broke out shortly after you got there  did your family have any real idea what was taking place in Germany  and was there any ability to communicate with any family members?
Still the same the same system  the same like how the fir first page  to the w-war to Germany   and war machinery  bulletins.
She died towards the end of the war  the very end of the war.

Coming back as a formation and immediately the war o independence broke without the military knowledge of those who came back it would have been impossible.
He eventually  he went back to Austria after  after the war.
the Russians would be coming to us  if they come  then would should be physically in the most perfect condition so they took us on a train to the next town where there was a prisoner camp- prisoner of war camp.

7 They 7 The War Relocation Authority was charged with administering Fort Ontario under the overrall 9 created a unit called Emergency Refugee Shelter under the War Relocation Authority which was part of the Department of the Interior.
And that was as I said  probably the beginning of August.
And with the other fellow who didnt who survived the war  but we split it after the war because he married a German young girl.
I wa sn't  I would say  the most adventurous because that group of 10 that I was assigned to by Johann Brower  uh  he was born conspirator  he had fought in the Spanish Civil War  and  um  I was afraid of hi m  his recklessness  and I was afraid of the 10 guys I was connected with.

So the Germans used to come over practically every night to bomb the Clydeside  and in doing so they came over Edinburgh.
And  of course  you know the day the war started  I think it was 5th of September  and all of a sudden so qui ck you see airplanes in the air and you see  you know  columns of smoke and detonations from bombs and everybody in those days were talking about gas  and everybody has a gas mas k  and there was a big confusion and it was getting worse cause day by day because the houses were being destroyed and you couldn't even for a couple of weeks you couldn't even tell the streets because if you walk you tell by landmarks  you know  where you are going.

So you stayed for the whole period of the war under German administration under the Tort Organization Administration?
Q. And yet during the second world war they behaved differently from any other group?
And so  most people are dead  who were in World War II.
Yes  I was  you see  a -- during the war  as -- I was the -- say  I did the first degree in my technical education.
My brother was in the United States and of course I didn't hear from him during the war because you could not write but as soon as the war was over  no  not as soon  because you couldn't write for quite some time.
>> Josie Traum: My mother had two sisters  my two aunts  who were also hidden in churches through the underground .
May I ask  after the war  what was religious life like in the former Soviet Union?

They lived a few blocks away from me  and that particular Daniel Swartzfooter before the war started  before the Germans occupied Poland  that I should say was between 1936 and 1937  he asked that Stigel  our boss  Mr. Stigel  w ould you like to go to Australia with me?
I had uh I had a uh an aunt who with her husband had moved to Canada before the war  and so in 1948 we managed to get papers and uh uh got out of there  uh bribing the authorities and having all of our earthly goods taken away from us in exchange for a passport and an exit uh visa.
In the last moment The last they they put this in  the saying about hero  because after the war I met some of the guys who did belong to it and and they wrote it on [indecipherable] paper that I was  and didnt touch it because I wa snt a hero  I wasnt fighter  I was only fooled by myself and I was hit by a bulle t  which I shouldnt stay there  at the window.
It was the s it was the same kind of It was the same kind  except that except that the 1945  the postwar anti-Semitism was made more acceptable because the war taught the Poles that to that you may kill Jews with impunity.
And so we made our way back to...uh...Romania  where most of my mother's family had lived prior to the war.
Life sort of went on  except that as I said we had these foreign people living with us and then two Frenchmen arrived  who only after the war we found out that they were French underground.
And at the end of the war  when the liberation came  I was in a very bad state.
And he -- 116 I was living there and then in -- in September  half a year after th e war  I applied for a job at the court.
And the reason was that the radio  at the end of the war  the radio broadcasted the names of all the French POW s who were released and were coming back home and her son didn't come back.
So I hid in the attic and I was thinking  the war is over  I'm liberated  what is it?
And for quite a long time  did there seem to be any horror expressed or any remorse of what was going on  other than the fact that the war had inconvenienced them terribly?
So I phoned to my friend  to Vsetin  my native  native uh city  where I was native  and before the war I was in connection as I told you to this  to transmit  to help this crossing of the borders  and this man who was enterprise man  and he was also involved in th is.
And he and the family here in Brooklyn worked on the papers and got them ready just before the war broke out.
And one of my friends who  at that first meeting  said I was like the Pollyanna of the group  saying the war was wonderful  and I had a lovely ch ildho -- and all of a sudden  you know  some things that werent so wonderful came out somewhere along the way  which I wasnt even aware of.
And -- Wh-When you first came to the United States  did you miss Vienna?
And that means [indeciph erable] three months I wanted to marry her  because of this -- that she didnt know who I was  or ba -- and I questioned her  what she thought USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 167 about all these things that happened during the war.
I do remember very distinctly  the outbreak of war in September 1939 from the radio.
And we were the investigators for the so-called grand jury  the war crimes co mmission.
I mean  you could always buy your way out  and that  but I think the answer about why I didnt really focus on Ferrara until after the war is because Cause of that.
And even in home before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim  every year our school made the play.
What were your feelings coming back to Vienna after the war?
>> Bill Benson: So what was it like to arrive in Israel for you?

The other another area  I guess where although its only been explicit once  I see it differently from many  not all  is on the German military leadership of the second World War  which I would suggest that the top and strategy was generally incompetent  when others Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 74 think was competent.
And so  what had happened with the Germans  had they retreated by that point?
And then  turning in all the valuables  including wedding rings  which I guess the Germans used to finance their war efforts.
No  it was terrib -- the -- the horror was only at the impending loss of the war and what might become of Germany and of them personally.

Of course 1956...I experienced another war during the revolution and again we were sitting in the bunker.
We lived in a town where mostly Jews so they didnt suffer enough.. Tell me about the war when it broke out.
Why don't you tell me how you got to ORT from War Production Board.
Because we didn't know -- we didnt know what the Germans going to do to us  see?
Did you have  did your relationshi p with your brother Bernard change very much after the war  after he had been through these experiences in Auschwitz?
So...in the meantime a lady who cleaned the floors in the apartment where I was living  said Francisca  you know  I take you to the chapel where the king performed before he went to war.
And because of blackout -- war time -- the windows were blue and blackened out.
Also my husband lived befo re the war 20 years in Poland.
Before we turn to those years and the war and the Holocaust  tell us a little about your family and you before the Nazis were in control of Germany.
And so...uh... uh...I stayed in that school...uh...til the end of the war.
I remember while being in the army in Austria I went to I was in Vienna one time  and there was a show in one of the Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 79parks  and there was a especially one of the things  one of the the acts was a comedian who was telling jokes about the war  and half the audience was watching the stage  and the other half was watching me.
How di had you did you know anything about Auschwitz Never heard.
>> Bill Benson: I have to believe that for all of you  you  of course  but your mother and father  the transition from the horrors they had been through  each different as you described  the aftermath of the war in Europe  pickup  arrive in the United States  the transition must have been a challenge for them.
In Exleba  Exleba  and the neighbors  you know  were all so happy because the neighbor  the man  had been in World War I and he had been injured  in fact  in World War I and he had no l ove for the Germans at all  so he was  you know  very  very happy  even though in this war they didn't suffer that much.
But So this one is the first sort of war result of casualty of war.
And so anyway so she  under those circumstances again  and then living in this this house which wasn't a house  and again being denied that denied that house uh  what in effect we did is that the school that that we had gone to became a very fashionable school after the war and the Dutch princesses went there.
But that was not to be  and later we found out when we checked the records  particularly here at the Holocaust Museum  there were indications that all of them had been you know  all of them had perished in the war.
So  uh  we had hope that uh  also America was also already in the war  and we uh  at least I feeling that Germany couldn't match the power and the economical and military power of the uh  uh Allies  especially of the America.
So pretty mu so in other words anothe r significant  what I would say fact  is that they family business did not get destroyed during the war  it remained throughout the war to the end.
Of course; when the war broke out  we did; we right away saw –.
Columbia didnt have at th at time  a specific World War scholar.
She stayed in -- She was caught in July of 4 4  which most likely is why she was still alive  because it was sort of at the end of the war.
First couple days after war was start  we was evacuated and full eq uipment with the rifles and so and so.
Well  we heard the word  Achtung  Achtung  that ﬁGermany capituliaﬂ -- that the -- there -- the war was over.
And it was quite a learned article that he had written  long before World War Two had started.
The JDC then as ked me to return to Europe  to visit the DP camps in Germany  Austria  Italy  once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to South Africa where I was to spend four months in South Africa  what were then called Southern and Northern Rhodesia  now Zimbabwe and Zamb ia  and to raise funds there for the South African Jewish War Appeal  the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution Committee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe.
And a man came along and shoved her into the gutter and said to her apparently so you old Jewess  you survived the war  well get you yet.
During the war  I didn't got too mu -- too much time during -- when I was wo rking and supporting my fam -- my -- my sister.
You see  when I grew up Lithuania was betw een the two wars-- First World War and Second World War.
At the university  I was pointed out about this one professor who I was told was -- belonged to the Nazi party and that it took him a long time  that he was among those who were questioned after the war  what did you do in the Nazi party and so on.
But there were two ways there was interrogating prisoners of war or civilians.
No matter what Jimmy Byrnes said in Stuttgart  I don't thin k it was necessary to get the Germans on our side in the Cold War against Soviet Russia .
Im curious of people who were Holocaust survivors who were fighting in the war of independence.
First the war of 1870 brought about the war of 1914  52 brought about the war 1939 and so forth.
Rose  when the war st arts  and then they star t having decrees about the Jews  yes  and then finally you have to go to the ghetto.
I mea n  we all had this picture of Dachau and Buchenwald  which we knew from before the war.
But that was something that I learned  being in Germany .
And I had an interesting experi ence  we went back -- when we lived in France  between ‚83 and ‚86  I went back to the farm my parents had lived in during the war and where I lived with them for not quite a year [indecipherable].
I wanted to ask you how -- how often you think about the experiences during -- during the war  and in the underground  if -- if there are certain things that trigger your memories  music  or food  or -- No  because frankly  I wrote my memoirs  I wrote my two books about my career in the radio  and I hoped that I can put it behind me.
But then  after the war  i-i-it wake up  that he accuse my -- probably my grandfather of no -- to have not protected enough my mother -- Right  hes -- -- though he got all tho-those kinds of money  you know  that she was not supposed [indecipherable] to be put in the train  but to remain -- Right.
And  as they had nationa lized a number of things  number of buildings  number of factories and so on [indecipherable] Yugoslavia after the war.
During the war they were in secret  resisting the Germans as much as they could.
Although World War II began with Ger many and the Soviet Union invading Poland in September 1939  war didn't come directly to your community in Romania until 1940.
So durin g this first half-year when I was there  it was very  very little of wars  things which reminds me of the war.
And this was about a year before the Nazis came in.
You know I'm used to telling the story to my six year old son and of course to my six year old son I have to include what happened during the war.
There was...at this point in the war  people tried to keep alive from bombings that were going on.
From there the International Red Cross would send them to Amer ican prisoners of war in Germany.
The war the wa when when the Americans got to Dachau   and they had been to Munich  they were then moving on to southern Germany.
He -- in -- in world -- 14 - 18  the world -- first World War.
So he was the translator  so I had always a little and I spoke fluently German.
And it wi and you and your sister remained in your apartment?
Because remember  in Canada  the war started Interview with Renate Fischer Chernoff June 23  2005 66September the third  1939.
Well  we got our leads from the war crimes investigating teams.
And when we interviewed prisoner of war  we first sat them down and says  would you like Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 42some coffee?
And they wanted to interrogate me once again  which was  you know  it was the end of the war.
Fighting -- its -- its -- thats a war  they were fighting against us.
What I r I was written to the Germans after the war  the company exists in Germany.
Well  you see  having been orphaned during the war  I had one idea in mind.
Uh  and of course it's only conjectur al  and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but somehow trying to define for myself  you know  wh at things that have stayed with me are really due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in France  and so on.
And he eventually went into that  because after the war  thats what he did.
So -- And your -- in the house where you grew up  tell me just about the different stages it went through during the course of the war.
And then  during the war  of course  th-there was -- as you know  under the immigration law there was a Polish quota  and that Polish quota for immigrants was subscribed until something like 1960  20 years.
During the war ti me  was he of age to be in the German army?
And we speak about the the good old days  when we were visiting each other  but we didnt have This was before the war  you mean  or af you were visiting her before the war  or No.
But afte r a while  the law came that you cannot stea l or take anything anymore  so what we did there was no food  no st ores  no place to go s hopping  after the war.
Me  she told me more  and she says that all the things that I had heard before the war were true.
But after the war  when you hear other st ories of -- peoples life stories of losing a husband  a wife  children  then I realized that -- where I fit it in  that I also lost parents.
I must make a point here  than many young people who are Fa scistoni  big Fascist  and pro-Nazi  who screamed moliama la guerra  moliama la guerra  we want war  we want war  they didnt go to the African front.
There was a great fashion at that time of heavy nets -- I think in the 40s they had them here too -- they were all different colors and you were wearing them like down from your head to cover your hair and they were like brown and gray and all kinds of colors; heavy  knit  made by han d. And these Jews had a factory some place before the War and they knew how to do it manually.
And so  after the war  I guess I made up my mind that I -- I wanted to marry Jewish  because I thought -- I dont know if its true  but that was in my mind  that somebody who was Jewish  could understand better what went through in my head once in awhile.
I get asked questions about Hollywood  about  did I get back to Hollywood work because I testified to the committee after the war  and I didnt go anyw here near Hollywood.
And–the rest of his brothers  who are older from  not from the same motherŠ from the same father Šlived in Romania and they all survive and during the war they went to Palestine.
Well  its interesting with ﬁSnow White ﬂ because there have been other people that Ive spoken with who recall seeing ﬁSnow White ﬂ in the theaters in Europe before the war.
Did anyone leave or try to leave Hu ngary during the 1930s or during the war?
One thing was this situation plus we were  during the six day war  when Jerusalem was under siege was a terrible experience for myself.
So my father and the intelligentsia of the town were taken within the first 48 hours to a miserable little place outside of Subotica  then we found out after the war to Auschwitz.
The barracks were any -- not much to -- to brag about  they were  I think  some old  leftover army barracks ove r there.
After the war Alex and his family were able to return to Paris.
But that was even before the factory  I was working there.
She too was married during the war  and she and her husband perished also.
And this  after the war  when I studied piano at the conservatory  I had some difficulties with it because my hands were swollen every winter and it took two or three years and after I could pl ay without difficulties.
I would have  but unfortuna tely  my younger brother -- three years younger -- he died in the war.
In fact  two of my brother  they gave their life in World War I. And he [indecipherable] and say  we fought  Germans  our country and all that  and Interview with Joachim Baer March 1  2010 38look what you guys did to us  you know  a nd he gave it to them.
32 Let me tell you  during the war  I really thought that God as a German.
When the war started this farmer  or some farmer s  continued to come to the city to sell their products and many times they help the Jewish people.
As Bill just said  the Holocaust didn't really arrive in Hungary until March 14  1944.
But finally my father said he had found a place to live  so we came...we went back to Paris and we joined him and things were almost worse than they had been...uh...at the...at the beginning of the war.
Where had he been during the war  and how did he find you?
I know after the war my mother on the ann iversary of her mother always had an azalea on the piano with her photo.
She was the one to who encouraged me to go into hiding during the war.
Your two sons  were they did they ask you  as they were growing up  about what the war was  and what you ha d gone through  and and anything?
Is there anything that you felt like that we  we should have talked about  about  about your experiences just after the war  was there anything youŠ That's  thats about summarizes  you know.
She returned it to us when we returned after the war.
But the situation -- this was -- we were liberated from the Germans but we are under the Soviet ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 occupation.
We were in the hands of this 17 y ear old girl who worked for the OSE [indecipherable] the Secours Enfant  who managed to save 10 000 children out of the concen various concentration camp s  5 000 of which we re recaptured  and 5 000 of us who managed to surviv e the war because of their help.
No  you see  I mentioned before in the interv iew that I felt older people had a harder time in the camps  and I also think they had a hard er time after the war  whether adjusting to a new language  a new country  a new culture  or whichever  or altogether  even if they went back to stay in Europe  adjusting to the emptiness  to the horror that was still in the soil  so to say  European soil.
I cannot.ﬂ ﬁOkay  we can take food and clothes and whatever we can.ﬂ But he says  ﬁThey will kill me  the Germans  if they know that I hide so many Jews.ﬂ Anyway  apparently the girl fell in love with this Salik Anulevicz a nd she decided to save him  and she took him in and she was hiding him there  and he surviv ed the war in her place.
>> Bill Benson: To move to the war itself  you saw the Germans soon after they invaded.
We waited out the war without knowing what happened to these two guys.
Can you tell us  please  what happened to you after the war briefly?
What actually happened to him  toward the end of the war  is that he and a number of other people broke out of the camp.
Well  first of all  September 1 st  1939  did you have any awareness of the start of the war in Poland before -- cause I think its th ree weeks later when the Russians take over Lvov  did you have any awareness at all?
But both of my brothers passed on already  but thank God I had them after the war.
But that was still at the very beginning of the war  don't forget this was 1940.
The court was called a Military Government Cour t. Now  the Military Government Court was one aspect in which the United States government participated in the war crimes program in Europe.
Tell us in those early adult years  before the war actually began  what effect did what was happening have on your life?
And my uncle  and my aunt  and my -- my cousins were -- were killed in a concentration camp.
What is your own position in regard to that -- to what is going on right now in terms of isga -- Afghanistan and war against terrorism?
Anything we had...coffee  we used to roast coffee after four years of war  and we had to close the windows because the coffee smelled when you roas ted it.
Interview with Erika Eckstut January 16  2002 5 We didnt have any opportunity to make any pra -- a-any kind of inquiry until the war was completely over.
In the city of Kiel ce the -- the pogrom after the war.
I found out that they had a war time price freeze on air travel.
And after the war  I dreamt that I were -- I dreamt that they had survived and they came back.
They all perished in the Holocaust  except my gra ndfather who died a few years before the war.
And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite.
What -- Im -- I -- My main worry is -- is places like Africa  where you have civil wars on every other country going on  and undoubtedly war crimes or civilian crimes that are at such a broad rate that they have to be classified as something of -- as violations of international law as well.
10 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD So when I came to her and I talked with her after the war  I r eally understood because I was trying not to be hateful to the woman because I figured  look  when she took that baby in she knew she would pay if they caught her.
>> Lynn Williams: So the end of war wasn't always the end of horrific things happening for you.
And we got quite involved  to the extent that she was my wife  through the war part.
And when my father went back to Lambsheim after the war and...to see how the...the home is and everything  he ran into her.
Anthony: Did you find Poland and Germany different afte r the war or was it the same attitude towards Jews?
The people who were in Madrid  there was a large colony of Jewish people who had been there since 34 '41 or '40  you know  when it was still--before the Americans got into the war  there was some kind of a pipeline  but af ter--definitely after '42  once the Germans had occupied the whole thing  nobody had passed  so I was a newcomer and everybody was so eager to know everything.
01:14:01 6 So  even then  before the war  everyone believed in a  in a desire and a need to get out of Poland?
My father had two sisters who were members of the Communist Party of Poland.
France has lost the battle  but has not lost the war \  something lik e that.
Before Before the war  wha when the Soviets took over Lithuania The first ti they had an agreement with Germany that the German na-nash German  ethnic Germans could go to Germany Okay.
Unfortunately  their stay coincided  eventually  with the German invasion of Poland.
BZ: They were investigating our mobilization for war  direct ed by Senator Harley Kilgore6 of West Virginia.
And she said  I wonder why I didnt why we didnt use th is before the war  it tastes so good  you know.
And my father said to me that he had fought for Germany in World War I  and nothing would happen to me  that Germany had had waves of anti-Semitism previously  they come and they go  and because of our of our nature  of what my father has achieved  what he had done  he would protect me  and no thing would happen to us.
And they won most of these wars  even though -- even that war in -- in 73  that Yom Kippur  when they were attacked.
Then it was belonged to Poland  but the Russian invaded this part of the country  of Polish country.
>> Bill Benson: And  Bob  of course  the following September Germany invaded Poland and World War II officially began in September 1939.
So then I didnt know about that  I learned that about the war Okay.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 33 >> Bill Benson: What we saw here.
She reme mbered that incident from World War I and she was convinced that the same will happen now.
After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the upper camp--see this was down at the lower level  the sports field.
For the first five years I went to a Jewish school.
And because in all the time I lived in Natrona  I don't know how many years  20 years  you know  after the war probably  and I just forgot about it.
I felt the cause was just  I just didn't beli eve that war would ever an swer it.
And so we were really advanced and so during the war years  and we talk 21 when I was 21  I was studying for what you would call a masters.
And this was my p-precious possession from -- from all of those years  and its one of the few things that I had at the end of the war  cause I collected all these things until they stopped publishing  and I took them with me to Amer ica  and I kept them in the 59 attic and so forth and so on  and then at some later date many years later when I met my husband and he came to visit at the house and so forth  an d I told him about this.
Nobody  no newspapers  nothing  until New York   where I found out that America is in the war  because 11 huge ships were taking troops to to England .
And I began to -- to -- to get back to the same ki -- guys I was friendly when -- before the war  who -- who had been put in cemetery  cemetery with nuns.
Shes not a well person and -- D-D-Do you -- do you and she talk still about the war?
Now  I know that it was known earlier  before the end of the war  or during the war  they knew that -- what was going on.
And I cant even remember all the towns we pa we passed thr ough light no  no  lets see no  I been its been too long since the war.
And to go in to a to a war like that  that was murder.
And the Holocaust  and the hiding was part of the war.
And for you that -- you think that comes from th e war  not from before?
Did you know  by the time you went abroad  if not before  what was happening to Jews in Poland?
Cause I don't know  as the war progressed  they used all kinds 37 of things to make bread go furt her.
After the war ended  the Polish unit  because Polish second corps  under General Anders  was still complete  as a unit  in Italy .
And reparations -- remember historically  if you go back to World War I and so on  it was 37 always an issue between states.
One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in school when they 1 beginning of the Second World War September 1  1939 2 were young boys.
If I will kill Germans after the war  and I had a chance when I was liberated.
Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 9 Well  right before the war  my father died.
People in -- when they lined up  and they had different -- [indecipherable] I overheard conversations  but I was part of it  eventually starts some [indecipherable] so I understood there was a war  and the Jews were targets and victims  because obviously we were -- most of them were Jews  okay?
And but before we reached this transportation  means of transportation  we were surrounded by the people who lived there  the Jews  who had a heartbreaking moment  because they came and they held photographs of people  of their relatives from from before the war  and the names of towns from which theyre came before the war  as immigrants to Palestine .
And how I ever got to Friedberg -- I walked  with French prisoners of war  with Germans  on this general exodus from the east to wards Germany  and I had my yello w stripe on a jacket  and we looted some things in German houses  so I had enough cl-clothes to wear.
In fact  that same year  in the -- in the fall  came the Battle of the Bulge.
All the men have to join the French army because war was imminent.
He survived the war but that was as far as he got in negotiating for trucks.
Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?
We -- we trained them in everything  and we had regular German prisoners of war  the very first who had been taken in North Africa were brought to Camp Richie.
Whereas my fathers parents  who had died by the time my mother married  ow -- h-he was -- came from Pressbourg  one of those places that was Hungarian in language  but became Czech by the time the first World War was over.
Bill Benson: How did your father's -- how did your father support the family after he lost his job?
The only bo y. Also and after the war  Trebiıov  they didn't have Jewish life.
And down in the military government and in the county  I had a lot of contact with Germans.
So the war breaks out So its 1940 and I went to that Youth Aliyah school.
Kovno was occupied by the Germans not the first day of war  but the third day.
My dad came to this country just before the war broke out.
Anyw ay  we bought a the latest vehicle manufactured  Pontiac  the last wave of passenger vehicles that were manufactured before the war  turned into wartime status.
So they put him into a POW camp for the German prisoners.
The ones that w n-no  the only Jews there was by the way  that Jew that helped us  that brought us the food  right after the war he was dis but he went when he exposed himself that hes a Jew  he got killed by the Ukrainians in the village.
No  the war -- the -- the -- yeah  it was the first of September 39.
I took lot of pictures  and and by the way  this lieutenant comes with a th-there was a before the war there was a jam in about maybe five pound cans.
Now we also had heard and we knew that once you were assigned as a labor force  if they put you into a factory  you were became war essential.
She sort of entered  this is how we survived the war because she was able to earn money.
When the war was over  did you make any efforts to find missing loved ones and friends?
So in 1938  you moved to Zwolen and then when the war broke out--?
And when I came back here  then I went back to Germany.
They signed a separate Armistice and they formed a new government  which was a collaborationist government headed by Petain who was a hero  the hero called  from the First World War.
Yeah  after the war was over and I started getting more information.
So we were not sent away until in -- in 1942  when everybody went  and then -- but hit -- the -- the Nazis were losing the war at that point  in 1942  El Allemagne and in -- in Russia  in the different -- Stalingrad and probably Leningrad.
But you see  I took her part and defended her against the Polish girls before the war.
In 1943 when the Germans were loosing on the Stalingrad and so on  they took us  took more revenge on 18 the Jews than ever before  what I read after the war.
So  when the war started  I was st ill in the gymnasium or academy.
And in  theres quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war.
In the beginning maybe some  but I wasnt there  but during the -- the -- the height of the war it wasnt.
And it had to do with the problems that came up in armaments during the end of the war.
At this point  did you kno w much about what was going on with the war and the camps?
14 by American Joint Committee before the war in a very high position.
I do want to ask you about how things changed with the Communists  but I think first I just want to get more of a sense of Konov before the War.
My -- when the war broke out  as my mother was born in December of 1929  and the war broke out in September of 1939  my mother had not even celebrated her 10 th birthday.
Do you remember the first day of the war in Kovno?
And that was a big business at that time because it was sold -- it was needed for the war effort  because America used to get its DDT from Japan   and they couldnt get it any more.
And she went to the partisans there  she reached them and she survived the war in the partisans.
My mother  who then had been a war widow  had to give me up just like she gave up her elder son  my brother Mike  who also went to this Pensionat in order to go from there to a Realschule  or in my case  ultimately to a commercial high school.
I meant aft were going through the ex periments  but at some point the war does start to turn against the Germans.
Th-Th They were flying these first World War planes  double planes  very  very low.
So you were in the camp for about a year and a half?
How about before the war when you were growing up  when you were a little girl  were there any relatives that had gone?
So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.
I never met him  and I have some questions to him if I met him wh ich I don't want to  what was he doing when we were being 'geharget\  as they say in Yi ddish  or exterminated and I don't want to go through the whole war time history with hi m because he would want it.
He was far from that   but a man of impeccable moral an d ethical attitude  uh who did not only preach as uh preach ethics and and morale but also also practiced it and uh uh I...we got together actually uh on a more personal basis when I was working uh at the beginning of the war for 58 the central organization in Berlin and when we had the first air attacks there by the British...by the British uh uh air force  uh we were uh taking cover  or we had to take cover in a so-called air shelter which was nothing  with no protectio n. Uh with the other members working in that office and very often Leo Beck would...certainly ca me.
Basically it was a -- it was a war that was over and finished and -- and -- and I felt the same way about it.
By that point in the war  Hitler was trying to run the war  removing decision making from his commanders.
I know that there were -- I think more Polish  maybe they were Polish Jewish  I dont know  than there were actually just Jewish people.
>> Bill Benson: That is probably when your mother we nt?
And in Bashmine  and Passau  the war had b een away a little longer  they knew a little better what would happen next.
It was clear it dragged on  the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost it  but the Germans who used children in the war effort and this was and I personally...m aybe it's my education...I was afraid that the last effort in a kind of in Waggoner's c ontext it's ...uh when everything is lost  they would at least see to it that the the rest of the Jews who were still alive  they would take 107 them with them.
Its was physical  and he thought he will get crazy  because didnt absorb -- his mind had to be busy  especially a big shot in Poland after the war  here hes mixing ink with another two black men  he thought he will get crazy.
That was the first time I was  you know  by '41 or s o  that I started learning that the things that she had said before the war that the people were exag gerating  that  of course  they weren't really exaggerating  you know?
1945  when the war ended  my father went to Wolkenstein   and he took back what it was ours.
I think we  we were more united you know during the war than we are now.
I certainly would love to have had him say he was sorry they lost the war  but you  you'd never get this from him.
You felt like G almig hty  is this the end of the war?
He knew Dr. Singer before the war  and his daughter was his girlfriend.
Uh so when the war broke out  they were in Sarajevo.
His camp in Krakow  what he established  what was all  only for protection purposes  not too much for work  except when they were working on the utensil  what he could sell it on the black  black market and get money for it  you understand  and use the mone y to bribe the officials  you understand  nothing was produced for the uh war effort of Germany.
We begin with this portrait of Alfred Munzer dressed in a Jewish National Fund costume for the Purim holiday  taken after the war  probably 1948.
So I finished the first year  but even during the first year  I still had physical problems  because I was extremely weak as a result of the war.
They used to come  they had Russian and French prisoners of war over there  at camp  so they us ed to come and bring  so they worked  they had a different camp.
ﬂ She said  ﬁWell  you know  all children in Holland during the war years were given a small bottle of milk in school and my mother told me to save half of that little bottle for the baby next door.
So  one day  when the Korean war started out  th-the store didnt do that well  and the man what he has his partner what I know was not a nice person when he started with him  he was desperate  Chaim.
In Witzen (Ph)  1939  half a year be fore the war started  I had to visit another man with whom I worked together for several years who was a representative of the Danzig Jews.
Which was an indication of how everybody  everybody  every business  every everything everything was devoted to the war.
The only time I saw him again  is when the war finished  I was with Mr. Lederman in Switzerland.
I knew  bec we tend to forget how much the first World War dominated thinking in the 1930s  still.
So what I did was  I took him would be interesting to see what he remembers  I took him to the Polish committee  because they the I knew that Poland was repatriating  they wanted all Polish citizens to go back to Poland  that was after the war.
So  i-in -- in -- and at that time  this -- this was a very dangerous place to be  because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews  just like the Poles did after the war  yeah.
What sort of friends did you have when you were a ki -- and Im -- Im really trying to distinguish if we can  before the war.
>> Bill Benson: Have you learned whether or not you had an extended family  cousins  aunts  uncles?
It would not be given the liberty that it enjoys today and enjoyed right after the war.
And then And then  of course  they couldnt come  because war broke out.
I think this was taken 1938  just before the war  when I was a high school student.
Did you hear about the Germans and the Nazis while the Russians were there?
When World War II began September 1  1939  British authorit ies required Henry to register as an enemy alien.
That time  I have in in papers here  that I the Korean War was on that time and I went to register to the army.
>> Bill Benson: You were instrumental in helping them after the war get recognized as righteous Gentiles?
Otherwise I -- I was not very close to her before the war.
And we waited there for the war to be over and to go home again.
Did you talk much about this after the war  about all these things?
>> Bill Benson: During that time  and you lived under those circumstances until 1944.
But the quota number which we had would not have come due for at least a ye ar or two after the war had started.
So those people were saved because they left before the war.
What was that like in those immediate post -year years -- post -war months really?
There was the sewing factory  the women were -- were working and making all kinds of apparels.
Now history will tell me why this was done  because the Jews were all spies for the French and the English and the British and because Hitler already starte d working on the war with friends  you know  that this was on the border of France and Ge rmany.
You were  oh I remember my mother  probably I was 10 years old when my mother was trained against gas attacks to wear a mask and all this  so in retrospect  it's rather interesting to realize that that happened that early already  but you didn't see it as a threat of war  you saw it more or less as a good exercise to be prepared if ever  you understand?
And finally there was  over there I remember now  there was some people coming  Jewish pe ople what they look for refugees  you know?
I mean the selection was very brutal and you really were not safe just because you were a disa bled war veteran or even if you were a highly decorated war veteran.
At that time alre ady  tho -- that netting with -- with -- with Interview with Brigitte Freidin March 12  2001 22the  like balloons was all over London  I do remember that  before the war.
Don't play him with him he is a zyd.ﬂ And did this change or get worse once the war began?
And it took awhile  until  well  at one point  much -- not much later  but in 1950  there was a war in Korea and I was just the right age for that.
And so I preached my first se rmon in a German prisoner of war camp.
Yeah  I didnt think he was that bad because af ter the war they had -- they h-hu-hung him as a -- as a war criminal  but I didn't think he was that bad [indecipherable].
After the war did you make  did you initiate any attempts to find any other relatives or friends from before the war?
When you say Russian uniforms  what is it -- what -- Russian uniform from -- The ar -- -- their prisoners of war.
There was only a plank  uh  keeping us away from everybody else  and  uh  but we came through and on the 4th of May  when the war was over  and they said  \ You can come out now.
By this time the German high command all the way up to Himmler  not Hitler  Himmler  are interested in thinking about issues having to d o with war crimes  postwar issues  because they realize that the possibility of the Germans winning the war is disappearing with enormous rapidity.
I love -- my father introduced me into -- you know how I survived the war?
Hes esta-establish a factory in -- in -- I mean he had -- its no problem  but even though -- even though with eff -- can you imagine  when you -- in -- we came after the war  we had to be two years in those DP camps  sitting  waiting.
I mean  I dont know if this is anti-Semitism  because that the Jews were considered enemy aliens during the war  I dont know if thats anti-Semitism.
Of course  he went to Belgium 18 when he was in France  so the greatest part of the war  he was not at home.
They didnt -- they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 26 were younger and so the war hit them at a di fferent stage of their lives.
These our friends...the se are people we lived all our life together...were in school together and the business together and when...uh...when the war came  they kill us  as many as they could. (
And we are talking of the year of 1944 -- ‚45.
This my mother told us just before the war broke  before we were  we were separated  that we should all remember.
In fact  my mother thought she would not survive even after the war  because she was -- she was like skin and bones.
Oh  th-th-th-th-the -- the liberation people  and th-the fr -- the th-the fight for freedom  because we were all in the Cold War operation.
6 My father was let go after four weeks because he was a veteran of World War I  was fighting in the German Army  so they let him go.
5 >> Bill Benson: And  of course  the German Army did approach in June of 1940 when they attacked France .
It was the worst prison in Poland before the war and during the war.
Talking now not about the people you taught  but about the other people you might -- You -- you mean stereotyped during the Cold War? --
Your experience when the state of Israel was  into existence  what were your thoughts at the time?
We kept on thinking that nobody knows in the 24 whole world what was happening to us because you know first we said \ oh  we will wear the yellow star  a star  two three days  a week  a month  the war will end\  but here I am talking already 1944  three years already.
So they say that they remember the Germans from World War I. They are cultured.
And he said to the people that when they start to take out  for Ashoshok   for the men  and they did the graves for themselves  and they said to us  to the women  to the children  that he's taking them at war  really he did the nice war.
And many people committed suicide during the war  afterwards  because they they didnt know what was going Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25  1998 28to happen and they couldnt believe it.
End of Tape Two  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 80 Beginning Tape Three  Side A This is tape number three  side A  of an interview with Beno Helmer.
Just months before Germany and Russia attacked Poland  launching World War II.
Now  we know what happened  but during the war the Germans didn't know the Consul was supporting it.
They had come in them selves to the United States right after the war  and they -- when they were in Bolivia.
The truck just took off and they uh they beat her down to the ground  my mother and uh could do nothing and uh I can imagine uh after the war for all these years to have to live with such memories  what it means to uh to or to my father for that matter  that he couldn't uh that he couldn't protect my brother and that the uh guilt feeling  uh him feeling that uh he had uh taken my brother with him rather than having sent him with me uh and that in turn may make him feel guilty if uh if I was able to survive and uh if he had let my older brother go together with me that he maybe he would have survived too.
We only lived the way we lived because we have things from before the war we could sell.
Suzy Snyder: The war is -- your -- Halina Peabody: The Russians are coming.
I went there and I was there once...there we're fighting in there and this was when after the war when Lvov and we came to the and I rode the tanks when they surrendered.
>> What was your first feeling or thought when you found out about your history  about the war  and hiding  and your parents?
I would say 39  after the war with Poland had started.
I offered to do this interview to tie in my video interview which I took for the Holocaust Museum which involved my whole story of the war  Holocaust up until to the days of liberation.
I think that the morale  up until this Cold War business  I think that Taylor could inspir e great dedication  hard work and he could rally people to the cause  without any question.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo : My family  they all came from a small little town which was then in Poland before World War I -- was in Austria .
And I think its very important to set a standard  a fa ir standard for prosecuting  a-a-and in this sense  war crimes like this -- or I ha te to call the -- I -- Ill call them Nazi offenses rather than war crimes  are not di fferent from other criminal acts in terms of the need to establish a consistent and fair process to try these indi viduals and judge them  and if found guilty  and the -- the innocent -- the -- the acquittals are as important as the guilty verdicts for the survival of the system and for an expectation that the system will be fair  that this is an important process.
It was the Korean War  and that was a quite traumatic for my parents  that Now  bef before that  in the first few years in Vineland  had you sort of expected that you would continue in that di rection  or did you think about going to college at some point I did think about it  but I I I it because of the move perhaps  and and then the other thing was  my parents found  as I said  the business  the the the poultry business got eggs bu siness got to be rather poor  and they had a great deal of difficulty making ends meet  so I went decide well  I can just go out to work.
So it was 52  was when I– I know the Korean War was still going on when I joined.
He taught catechism at the Belgian border to Nazi  no  I mean  non-Nazi children who would cross the border before World War II to learn catechism because it was forbidden in Germany and under Hitler.
So its not on the scale it was in World War Two  but things are happening  and if -- if you dont listen -- for example  we -- we tried to stop it like here they went to Iraq  and got Mr. Saddam Hussein Mr. Saddam Hussein would do like Hitler do  occupy lot of countries  he probably holocaust a lot of -- a lot of people.
Did you all know -- had you talked during the war that you would want to go to America once the war ended? [
Well  of course  food in th -- probably the worst part of that entire war experience was the last six - nine months   where we had no food.
The monument for  again  political correctness  speaks about Yugoslav because this was Ti to  the ruler of Yugoslav after the war  that was his request.
Also  they organized  they established a concentration camp on the system that it was in Germany in this time because in Germany even before the war  they had a few concentration camp  which starting with Dachau  Buchenwald.
And when you are telling kids about the Holocaust -- well they say  well Hitler was a bad guy.
And the the Germans wanted them to go into Poland and Poland didnt want them  cause they were just Polish Jews.
Or I didnt connect this with the war in any way.
you know) And it never came to a war  luckily  but that was sort of my motivation towards the intelligence work  to do what I can.
Q. It is fair to say that this was the -- of all of the pieces of informa tion that you received during the war  this was the one that made the greatest impact on you?
Is there anything else that stands ou t in your mind about the war years that we havent discussed  that youd like to talk about now  before we go to the postwar?
Funny story  my fathers ni -- name was Marian and it was spelled -- it was a very common Polish name  M-a-r-i-a-n  and he was in the World War II New York phone book as Marian Glass  and so he would get propositioned by the sailors coming through and so on.
They thought all -- we are exempted because my father was an invalid and a soldier in the first World War and the Jews were -- they were against it  the Nazi  they were a ll somewhere  so this was an abstract -- abstract notion  somewhere on top  but not for us  it wa s and she recommended -- she didnt know the people there and she put m-my sister in contact with a Jewish comasherot  it was called  as a -- in -- in [indecipherable].
A-All I know is that I had -- had to practice a lot to make up for all the time that I didnt see a violin  when I came back to -- to Budapest after -- after the war.
Finally  people were able to travel back into Hungary  and they figured out that some of the people at Auschwitz did die  some did survive.
The first one when you go in   this -- they show USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 143 you the book -- the -- the life of Jews from before the war.
I never ha d a chance to go to school because the war broke out  but my father gave me some education.
So its for many years later about two years later they would the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial  and I participated in that one.
Although it takes a whil its gonna take quite a while  but since nobody else has done it  which is part of why I did my book on the origins of World War II  I figured Id give it a try.
>> Bill Benson: As you told us earlier in December of 1944  for you  the war was effectively over when you made it to Switzerland to a neutral country.
They uh...the American government addressed a note to a country with which it was at war.
Of course  one must ad mit that a lot of the children weren't happy where they were sent and there was an after care department in fact when the war started that Mother looked after which tried when children had problems to get the problems settled or get new guarantors for them.
We left off last time where the war had ende d and you went back from Switzerland to Paris and you rejoined you mother and your br other  Gaston  and eventually your other brother  Bernard.
Because even he was not active during the war  he was 60 years old  and the Germans made the list  because he was 60 years old  that means that he was unproductive.
The family had five adult male s and during the war my mother ha-had many  many Jewish soldiers  from England   from Africa  from -- from South Africa  from America  that would come for rest and recuperation to our farm.
How did you learn that Hitler had invaded Poland and the war started?
As I told you  my mother had rehearsed Freddy and me in addresses  in case we were separated during the war and one address was 503 Fifth Avenue and the other one was 108 Benyahuda Street  which was in Tel Aviv  which was her brother.
One had her husband who came back from the war  and the other two got married right there in Dashe (ck).

And you nev -- so you never returned to Vilna after the war?
When you say the war broke out  are you talking about... 1939.
Was it hard to believe that -- that you were truly liberated  that the war was truly over?
Can you tell me when you fo und out you were Jewish?
When you were in Bergen-Belse n in the middle of 1944   did you hear any news of the war?

I mean  if you can imagine how eager I had been before the war started  to go to school  to have a life and so forth and so on  and now I come through this period of intense confinement and containment and -- and life picks up again  and I can wave the flag and I can put the picture of Queen Wilhemina over my bed -- which I also brought to America and also had over my bed in Rochester  New Yo rk.
No  no  no  Im not talking about those who were murdered  Im talking about the town before World War II  or the village before World War II  about how large was it?
Interview with Lucine Horn 10 It sounds like what youre saying is the survival that the drive for survival you developed during the war  it never let up.
And i mmediately  in my head  I see the map switching into the scenario for World War Three.
Yes  yes  thats very lucky and nice time  which finished with war.
So  this wa -- was about as far as I came to the -- to shootings  I mean  from war related shooting  so to speak.
You never saw anything like it and it started the war.
He told me that he was a German soldier and that his family was in Germany  but he said I don't think that we will win the war.
And  your family  while they believed very strongly in charity  was that ever on any organized basis before the war?
That was the beginning -- that was just before the war for us.
If it wouldnt have been for him  I wouldnt have survived the war.
I went with the first ambulance unit to the continent and came out at the time of Dunkirk and then as I said I joined the R.A.F. At the end  you know  it's all inevitable once war really starts whether you think it could have been stopped or not.
It had had long-standing alliances with I. G. Farben  which went back to World War One  and th ey not only had these cartel a rrangements but they had joint ownership of about 10 compan ies in this country other than General Analine and Film  which I mentioned.
And told by some of my people that I knew from before the war  ﬁMiles  you better get out of here  because if you wont get out  theyll finish you off.ﬂ And I did.
Suzy Snyder: So I just want to jump ahead a little to when you were -- I mean  it's not really liberation but suddenly the war ends but in a tragic way.
You know everybody was coming back after the war and they needed housing [NOISE] so we did/couldnt our apartment even.
Do you think youre more comfortable around people who lived through the war like you did?

You know  ‚40 - ‚41  we -- we didnt know there was a Holocaust.
And  my father took me and my sister into the r oom and said  ﬁMy children  during the war  a person has to have a roof over their head  a roof is very important.
Well  right after the war I remember seei ng a list of survivors which was published by the American Red Cross  and my fathers name appear ed there as being killed in Dachau  and it also appeared that my brother survived.
And I -- so  little by little the puzzle got put together  because I searched  I really searched and I -- and I filled it in and -- I -- I meant to ask you the question  did you learn anything that changed your understanding of the war  but that would be wrong in a sense  because you just began to really learn about the political framework  right?
Before the war  and the building was a nice  good building.

And while its not -- the numbers are not quite precise  they range between 100 000 and 150  000 who survived out of that total  who were in Poland when the war began.
And I went to Paris in April of 1945  a month as it turned out  before the war ended.
You have been in this country since before the war was over.

Uh my willingness to accept risk in life is diminished by my war time experiences and therefore I have tended to be  to stay employed with the same company or the same 25 organization longer than I should have because I think that uh the war time experience when I was very young somehow conditioned me to to avoid risk and avoid and avoid uh maybe taking initiatives more than I should.

The Cold War  of course that was somehow predictable  that having met the Russians  we knew we werent going to be friends  although we were friendly and the vodka flowed freely  but that was not it  and then of course when the Russians dug in and said and dictated to us practi cally what what we what we could do and what we couldnt do  that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War  and Churchill saw it and and it happened.

They were not able to do it  so you had certainly a...during the Depression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to capitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh Germany had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was not defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called home-front  which means by social democrats and communists and the Jews.

And I think it really  now talking today  I think it wasnt only my father  because my father was su nk in despair at the end of the war  whereas everybody was rejoicing  and even I was rejoicing  my father wa s despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that ha d happened  and the -- the death of so many pe ople  not only in the concentration camps  but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war  I think just -- just crushed him  and he was very despairing.
It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war.
According to history  and I read somewhere  the first transport to Auschwitz  th-they when they opened the camp because Auschwitz was  before the war was military barracks.
I was 13 years old when the war broke out and by the time I was liberated I was  um  four-four yearsŠ three and a half years in a ghetto because I was born near the German border so the Germans arrived at the same  the first day  and schools were obsolete for Jewish children.
Uh  people which we believed our associates and being our friends before the war  they were not friends anymore because everybody was looking for yourself how to survive  how Video Tape No.
No  after the war I found out that they kille d her.
Yes  but was there an expectation that the Germans woul d attack  or did you think the Russians are here and thats going to -- Well  I -- I think there was an -- for the -- fo r a -- for awhile there was a mixed bag  but with the German successes in the west  you know  when they overran all of Europe practically  okay  and also with the -- with the London  you know  blitz  too  and all that  and knowing the history of the relationship between Germany and Russi a you know  and -- and -- and knowing the -- the -- the German ne -- expansionism and need -- need ing the Ukraine as -- as their breadbasket  you know  to -- to f -- fuel the war effort.
And between December '39 when you arrived and May '40 when war broke out  what was your daily routine?
When you were -- before the war  or you have no rec -- Yes.
But he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war  and he never  you know  he just -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know.
Let us go back a little and ask what happened to Flying Officer Pollack at the end of the war?
When my Lieutenant Colonel was promoted to full Colonel in recogn ition of his splended work for war crimes  he called me in with great pride and he said \ Y ou know \  he said  \ I realize this is done  you know  as a result of your efforts and to show you my appreciation I want to give you these stripes\  and he made me a sargeant.
A nd my brother  of course  we didnt know where he was  since he was in Kiev  since before the war -- the war started.
He survived the war in Much.. and came to New York afte r the war.
And so that same evening we were all dispersed  and we didn't really get together again until after the war.
Needless to say  that did not turn out to be true and in May of 1940 the German army moved into Ho lland and the war really was over before it even began because the whole Dutc h army had to capitul ate within a period of four or five days that we were no match for the German army who came in with a tremendous amount of air power etcetera  etcetera  etcetera.
And we had -- I already had enough vocabulary so that I could talk to him and most of the class were Ukrainian women who lived -- who came before the war  but they never learned English.
So that's the first time I found out that I was Jewish.
51 Q. Did you think the end of the war was coming?
But his sisters  who emigrated to the United States  when my grandmother became a widow in World War I  they were in the United States and they told us wonderful stories.
What went on during the war  you know  it was immoral  it was terrible  but people will do things -- terrible  immoral things  in order to stay independent.
So having been in London during some of the attacks  we were getting a poor taste of what the war was going to be like.
Did you have any idea what was happening elsewhere in Europe during the war?
We knew and heard that American forces  that the war had finally turned.
We're going to be talking with you  Roger  thank you -- about World War II -- your experiences there -- what you saw  and much much more -- what comes from that.
When you came back to Poland  was there also a lot of anti-Semitism?
So  are your earliest memories connected to the war  or are they some Yes.
My father  after the war  had bought a book about the second Wo rld War that was illustrated with photographs  and I remember spending endle ss hours leafing through the book  looking at photographs of the French generals  French soldiers  battle scenes  plus also the text.
I had another dream later after the war  and I'll tell you later about it.
So this uncle  the young did you ever see was the first time you saw your uncle again after the war in 1995?
But I -- I drove an ambulac-ambulance for the American field service in the first French army.
I myself am a citizen from Germany and I had a lot of education about the Holocaust  the war crimes  throughout my school time.
After the war  when you were in Kovno  and the Communists were in charge  could you be Jewish?
Just in terms of what the long term impact that you feel you can see of the war and the Holocaust on your -- perhaps on your decisi ons -- for instance  you were telling me about consciously not wanting to dwell on things too much with your children.
And some authors  and I'm not quite sure that I share all this opinion entirely and so on  but the fact is that towards the end of the war the Germans tried  even first the underground in Germany tried  those people who were fighting against Hitler tried through our people in Sweden through the Wallenbergs -- that's the relatives of Raoul -- to get contact with the allies.
And then the war years  again  the  the lack of open discussions  up until lately  up until just the last couple of years  means that theres all this s tuff in your background and you  you know something went wrong but you dont  you dont discuss it.
You didnt have- No  I did not begin to have nightmares until after the war.
Yet  on the other hand  where are the Jews to go?
And they were  but  as far as such people as Eden is concerned or member s of the cabinet  they were very well informed because after  discovered it after the war  that for instance  a very high level Nazi official  whose name is known  was passing to a Polish intelligence officer in Berne  in Switzerland  information about the plans of final solution well before it was they started to implement it.
And I noticed this after the war  too  when we came to America.
There was a bi g  big  big scandal right after the war.
So I -- And we were in the DP camp  and they wanted to take my wife and the baby  but I saved them from the war  I didnt want to let them go away from me  you know  beca use during the -- you know  when we were -- you know  on the Polish paper its on  I didnt -- once it -- it -- there was someth -- sometime in -- there were times when you [indecipherable] a little bit were scared  you know?
Now she -- now I know -- I have met her after th e war and she said -- sh-she tells -- her feet -- her legs are not quite the same and she says she had the -- a bi cycle accident  to explain it.
So  did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?
The Russians kept the German prisoners of war two years extra after the war.
Okay  I remember exactly when the war broke out  September 1  1939.
Nylons were just coming out after the war  and he would write and tell me hed send me stamps and stuff like that.
And we got through later  I got an offer of a job on the war documentation project.
My family knew about it  and when I came here to the United States  I had a parish in Virginia  close to Williamsburg in West Point and sometimes people asked me what about during the war  and then I told them stories sometimes  and they were more interested  and I don't know  I think that some time people were asked if they knew somebody who helped Jews during the war to write to Washington  and there was a lady parishioner and her name was O'Connor  Sa m O'Connor's wife  Helen O'Connor and she 22 didn't write her name but she wrote the Post Office Box 53 and I remember that I found out who that was  it was Helen O'Connor and she worked that I did work for the Jews during the wars.
Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 30 This was July August  but was really mostly August  because the war started on the first of September.
>> Bill Benson: During that three -year period that you were all together in Belgium  before you came to the U.S.  was your father able to resume his work?
>> Bill Benson: I think you told me that Jews were ordered to use whatever valuables they had to pay for the war blaming the Jews on starting this war.
>>Bill Benson: As you explained earlier  of course your father was gone but your mother continued the business.
The population kept hearing all these lies about how the Jews were spreading disease  they were disloyal  they were dangerous to the state  they had to be deprived of their citizenship  relentlessly hammering away at this one group who is the cause of all the problems  based on the war.
And uh we saw them coming over and they didn't really come in our town but they came near  and from that time on the war really came as the war  the fighting part of the war came close to us.
So  yes; the family began to know before September 1 that world  not knowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to break out any time  any moment.
And she continued this after the war  too and I think I rebelled a lot and became very -- in some ways  she was very intim -- controlling and intimidating and I think I had a hard time working on that and working through all that.
Maybe they could do something  but they couldnt stop the war.
And thats was only two  three years  because that war and [indecipherable] so -- Right  right.
Those that were...few that survived  and others that were hidden during the war  were now decided also to leave Europe.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 >> Dora Kl ayman: War crimes trials  yeah.
46 And also she was very lucky  but she was extremel y active during the whole war.
Im going to change the subject back to the time that youre in France after the war.
Before the war  those sentenced to death spend their last days of their [indecipherable] in this cell.
And I had one urge and that is to put everything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war.
My parents -- I -- small apartment  because after the war they had lost everything and they were sharing apartment with somebody else  as a matter of fact.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 Suddenly the Germans moved in.
And calling to my father  fired back  I'm a veteran of World War I and turned out eventually they believed him.
Can you tell me  with the benefit of hindsight  what effect that you feel the war has had on you?
But he s it it was a bad it was a bad war.
At the time we diminished a ll this like that  so towards the end of the war we didn't give th e Germans any favor whatever.
And this I remembered even af ter the war  that I promised her  even she wasn't alive and it was hurting me after the wa r very much that I didn't give her this...I should marry a \ Hasidic boy and gave...give the \ Nahas from me.
The Russians had occupied eastern Poland   the Germans had occupied western Poland.
See what ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 happens.
Now  I have friends who were in the resistance in different places  but after the war  they were killed.
The Polish had to come and register and be ready for the war.
>> Bill Benson: And you've been able to learn that in the years since the war.
If my father would have survived the war  he would change his political views too.
But I 63 dont know if he -- but I -- he didnt have any [indecipherable] about me really  until we met after the war.
Oh yes I was  very much so  but there was then a large movement to stay out of the War during the early years  an anti-War protest moveme nt.
And when he traveled in the train he still did...didn't know that the war started.
I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe that the Poland going to lose the war.
By then they was looking for Jews  to kill them because they wanted  they knew that a lot of Jews survived after the war from the Nazis  but they don't want should be Jews by the Polish.
The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty earlier this year at Rome  the Rome treaty  is a big step in the right direction  but look what year it is.
>> Bill Benson: George  of course  if I remember right  you then -- your family tried to get out after the war.
Becau se what he did  he withdrew from the League of Nations  as you know  started building up all this war armament  opened up all these factories to build all these weapons  and it made it possible for a lot of Germans people to go to work.
They got this War College  and they go there and retire from there.
Holland as a -- a country did finally make so me blanket payment of a coupl e thousand dollars to everyone who was caught up in this war  with the understanding that you then didnt try to sue them  or get anything back.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Dora Klayman: The family Runjaks.
They came  I think  after the First Worl d War here with all the children but my grandmother was already married in...uh...in C zechoslovakia so she was...uh...I think she was the oldest daughter.
My memories are very  very hazy about family before the war.
Interview with John Bucur August 18  2003 54 What did you tell them about your experiences during the war?
My family before the war  we had a restaurant and my family  we had eight children.
And my fa ther  he had brothers  and some of them died in World War I. And as I mentione d to you  big family  they were.
And especially after the war  especially after the war  when the Jews were being persecuted.
By the time war started  basically the family had  more or less -- the oldest son had left for Zagreb  but my mother's sisters were living in that small town of Ludbreg.
I think I asked her br other this question  too–Does she remember the war starting with Poland?
After the war  a lot of prisoners  they said \ well  if you're alive  then you are a traitor\ .
Did you know  by the time you went abroad  if not before  what was happening to Jews in Poland?
It turned out the man she had been living with was actually a spy for the Germans.
But when he came out after the war  he s -- found out that I was alive and he came to say hello.
And my father and I both realized that we would both be involved very soon in war.
And is this -- this is the uncle who came and tried to get the -- your goods  the stuff that your parents left  yes?
A (Pela): The war broke out...broke out uh September the 1st.
So then they the well  the Battle of Britain and the air war started and we followed that  of course  from Holland and we would listen to BBC.
And then I found out that the Polish government -- there was a Polish government in exile  in -- in -- in England during the war.
But basically  in my young age and until the war started  .. that I was somewhat re moved from death  because we didnt I didnt have a large family.
>> Bill Benson: So you and your brother are now with your aunt and uncle.
101 Camp Hood  yeah  they brought them from -- fro m North Africa  with th e North Africa corps  and they were still think -- they -- they -- they still thought they were going to win the war.
So  when you were at home  you spoke both English and German?
Once you got into operations in Europe  how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews?
But our main work was with prisoners of war  to identify students in the prisoner of war camps  particularly in Germany  cause we were in Switzerland.
Even after the...uh...cold war was declared  and I had to go back roads my last couple of trips to Theresienstadt  by the way.
Because this was a camp and we work together with the Germans.
We said to -- from Auschwitz that made the transport  yeah -- how was it?
Now  after all these years  and af-right after the war we know that they were very good for us because they really saved our lives  but it was very dangerous because when the neighbors were all big antisemites  and I knitted sometimes for her  wh en she was spinning  she made  uh  weaving her own  uh  yarn from linen  and I knitted clothes for th is little boy that was 2 years old or 3 years old  and the neighbors ask her how you got these nice clothes  so  that was already dangerous  when she  they know they couldn't afford to buy it.
After the War of Independence  I went to England to see my uncle  my father's brother  and he wanted to adopt me but I wanted to go back to Israel.
Halina Peabody: She was two months whether the war broke out  yes.
I mean  I didnt -- I -- I-I couldnt speak he -- I couldnt read Hebrew or anything like that  but I -- I -- I was -- I was Jewish  I felt Jewish   I -- you know  like -- Did you learn Hebrew?
Only after the War did we learn that at that fateful meeting in Berchtesgaden  Hitler had asked him very firmly for two things: to finally hand over the Jews  and to finally send an expedition in force to fight the Soviets on the Eastern Front.
Shes quite a character  and she -- she had been an archaeologist in Greece before the war.
And then at the end  a little Korean first grader came up to me and says  who won the war?
And the Jewish community  whoever left before World War II survived and went to Western Europe  etc.
A lot of talk about what had happened already to Jews in Germany and what was probably happening.
indecipherable] disappeared or dead  or -- but in this case  because they didnt find him  of course because he was a prisoner of war.
So finally we were ready to go leave the camp  the war was over and they say we cannot go to Poland now  cause why?
But she was a a wonderful person and even after the war she kept in touch with my family.
I remember  right after the war  there was some gather ing of the American soldiers and I was included and it was in a synagogue in Heidelber g  Im not even sure  but occasionally I go now to religious service but a synagogue is not part of my life and this is b ecause of my background.
And actually  before I left Palestine  I went to a lecture once by a former high commissioner of Pales tine and he was talking about his military experience in World War I and he was saying one thing he did was because in the army you have a lot of time  he said  I read books  you know  and I was so inspired.
We think of some  partic ularly when we see the movies with the Nazi arm bands and you th ink of the arrogance and the arr ogance of the Gestapo and so on  this was not the kind of man he wa s and he may not have even been that during the war  but I don't know.
They had lived through the war and -- and this was a strange sort of person  you know  and they just didn't know what to make of it.
People -- because there was no food  very little food  and it was during war  so people would put their kids in a convent  like an orphanage  and hope they would pick them up when things got easier for them.
During the war was a cousin who made it  a cousin of my father who made it to Bolivia.
Side B  Tape 1) Had the war lasted  I mean had the American army not reached us on May 5  1945  if this would have lasted another week  none of us would have been alive today from that particular camp.
During the war  Zoltan's age was also faked on written records so that he became \ older\  than Shony. (
And despite that he was not eligible for war service  they kept him there.
And were any of the non-Jewish Greek population able to help Jews at this time?
And this person came out  said the war is over with Japan because of the atomic bomb.
Si ster   of the Order of the Sisters of St. Joseph  who sheltered us and cared for us at an orphanage in Ethervig  outside of Brussels   Belgium  during World War II.
When he came he was drafted  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 65 Korean war started.
They had been in  separately under hadoken and they were reassembled after USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 6 the war and they were living in a little town called Rainin in Holland  about an hour and a half outside of Amsterdam and they lived in a house on a dike  it was a small farming town and Fre ddy and I went to live with them while my mother was not well.
And I saw her we ma the housekeeper  I think  already knew that some he she heard it on the radio that the that the war maybe started  because she took me to the window  and we were all way both of us are waiting for Mother to come  to sort of confirm it  or whatever.
They had she had survived the war too  and we were uh we were allowed to take  get our old get our old apartment back and uh just about at that time my mother  who was racked with pain all the time was no longer able to uh bear her pain and uh went to the doctor and was found to have uh bumps  lumps uh and she uh never really recovered.
Uh and then we were told that when I was ready to go to school in 1942  well really it was 1941  uh we couldn't go to school anymore and so for a while there was a little Jewish school that they had in a - I remember it was on the second floor of a of a building down town Breda  and going there and sitting in a classroom with who knows - twenty other Jewish children.
But most children of surv ivors  even born after the war  went into education.
I should ask  do you recall the end of the war?
So I decided because I could speak Russian  I could help in the Cold War.
There was -- and among these women  I remember them very well  because after th e war my grandmother used to bring me to this place  it was a -- a Aunt Sura  Aunt Fa nny  and there was a very old woman who was paralyzed.
Were you drafted into the Army  or did you choose to enlist?
Of course now war has this other connotation in my mind  you see?
It was uh this this kind of war coincidence--I've written about this because uh he might still be alive for all I know.
So this is in 1946 - 47  after the war Yeah.
One  I forgot all this  was Yitzhak   which I met him only after the war because they went  way before even I was born they went to Palestine.
Its still before the US declares war on Japan  if you Yeah  right.
Did you tell your kids about your experience during the war when they were growing up  or not?
We didnt know what war means  but we when we heard the bombs flying and when we heard that people got killed  we got scared.
But of course there was no way of writing to her because France was occupied  most of France was occupied except for Vichy France  allied to the rest of the Nazis and and so England at war and so there was no correspondence between us.
Ah  so  but when the war started with the Germans so  and suddenly so mebody told that the Germans are going from hou - home to home looking for Jewish men.
Yes  well I am a -- a Catholic  and I am a believer  and I think that the war was just a chain of miracles.
Do you realize that if Hitler had won that war and become what he wanted to be  the thousands [indecipherable] encompassing the whole world  that we wouldnt be sitting here  talking?
Did you experi ence any other anti-Semitism in England after the war?
It took over the war was over  and I traveled only with soldiers  German soldiers .
He said that Jews from Gleize from World War I were smothering tobacco from Austria into Poland  Warsaw.
Did you ever see any newsreels or anything before the war that showed what was happening over there?
But at which point and then Russians march into Lithuania only in 1940.
It -- on rare occasions my mother has found books and she has found not Holocaust photograph s  but from before the war  photos of people who were in her family  in very formal  stylized portraits.
And that was -- But on the other side  every b -- I think that some Danes believed that Hitler will win the war.
I my my mothers brother George   he was two or three years younger than my mother  was terribly proud of his World War I record.
Then that had to be reduced  because the War Claims Commission and others would refuse to accept it  to one million  and in the end  we had the Congress pass legislation which gave to the JRSO  only half a million dollars.
And I mean I think we made believe we were fighting the Germans with that.
So it sounds like when you talk to your sister about the past  mostly what you talk about is your family life before the war.
But it was -- it was -- what happened farther down the line  the Russians came in in 1940  in Lithuania.
So  when the war came closer and closer  the Germans left  because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently.
all the years since the war  did you ever have the feeling  or did you ever worry that something like that could happen again?
Now  this is -- I also didnt even know that there were that many Jews there.
When you were there the first time  so thats at the end of the war.
I mean I think during World War II all the wives knew that their -- in the air corp --were going to leave.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 201 How about this?
No  th-th no  the different bake different places  but it was more oh  after th after the war.
But the Quaker s were very involved in this because  as now  they were against war.
But Grandfather died before the war  and I think he was fortunate enough  the only one to die a natural death from the immediate family.
She made it  it seem okay and I came through the war never doubting that we'd come through  in fact I remember lots of talk about  you know  with my mother about after the war  when my father  whom we calle d Poppy  would be back and we never doubted that.
I was fifteen when the war broke out and I was three years...my eighteenth birthday.
So  back to Vienna after the war  it sounds like you spent a considerable amount of time in Italy  and then you had returned to Vienna on the weekends  and about how long did -- did this go on for?
I don't know how tall I was at that time  how much I grew during the war  when uh  I am five four and a half now.
And you know we went to the World War II memorial opening and everything yeah.
After the war  Kishel became very important because he was a leader in the AK  in the underground  and he was not any more inter -- internal revenue  he was older  he had got married.
Before I came to America   in Germany   the Americans the Germans  we lost the war.
So in April  which is just a month and a half before the war ends -- -- yeah  but we didn't know it. --
Families together  unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work both ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of the town -- functioning of the town  they eith er kept the one and send the rest  or they kept the whole family back.
I want to ask you to sort of think -- I want to ask you to think and reflect on your whole family  with this question  which is that  how do you make sense of the fact  that when the war came  everyone in your family was a very tenacious person and survivor.
But that was like  I dont know  very disappointing  very you know  we been all disappointed with that war.
And after that  I realized  Sam  the war is over  you can tell the truth.
You know  even ju -- before the war  when he was -- he had a -- he had a difficult job -- Yeah. --
He said that if he survives the war  after the war he will do anything for me.
Were you getting continuous dispatches ab out the war and about wh at was happening . . .
Did you meet many Holocaust survivors then  coming to America after the war?
And -- but she probably remembers qu ite a bit of -- from the war years.
The Allens did not encourage me to have any c ontact with my aunt or my brother  and by then the war had started.
Did you talk to people about what had happened to you during the Holocaust  or did they ask you about it?
So when Hungary then lost two-thirds of that territory  all the -- or most of the Hungarians were sitting out on this land which was taken over by neighboring countries.
I played by ear  I played  I started playing when I was very young and I took piano lessons but  but after the war I have never gone back.
And we had dead people piling every morning  and wagons were picking them up  picking them up  and that was after the war was over.
They came in  I would say in the second week of the war  towards the third week  and I was on the square they came.
Okay  before the break  we were talking an awful lot about your childhood  your early years  which coincided with the war years  when you were having your very first impressions  your very first memories  and your father was the director the governor general of Poland.
You know  everybody got sick after the war  because eventually it started coming  all these goodies to you  and I got very sick  and they took me to a hospital  and this doctor came in.
My grandparent -- grandmother brother used to have apartment building and one apartment was -- before war in Sacz  and one apartment was vacant  so our family just moved to this apartment.
You have the war time but the earlier time which was a good time  right?
So  I decided to go to Washington to look for a position with any of the war agencies.
A-Are you more comfortable today be ing with people who experienced the wartime -- This -- -- than with people who did not experience the war?
He was a -- some officer during the first World War  and he had an idea at the time  so far as I remember that people has to do something to avoid war.
Are you more religiously Jewish now than your family was before the war?
But I went into bus iness and then the war came and the Now  you had been working for how many years before the war came?
A lot of Hungarian Jews ŠŠ in 1943  '44  that was the end of the war  they brought in a lot of Hungarian Jews to that camp.
Interview with Edith Langer 34 After the war  you read in papers about  you read in papers about the concentration camps.
She looked on his hand  and said  \ You and your closest one will survive the war  and you will live happily after.\
I mean did you  you were incredibly  I dont know  maybe blessed is the word you could use during your experiences during the war.
And he went back to Germany then as part of the U.S. military?
You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do.
Oberst rasser was the seat of -- before the war  that was the Yiddish geminda  which means like stat the council -- the council of the -- and  so -- The consulate?
And I had two friends from before the war yet  that we happened to be together as school girls  and I made them do the same  because they -- they relied on what I wanted to do.
And what -- and was it -- And they had doctors there  too.
You see when I was engaged with your mother \  he told me  \ I gave her this watch  and she gave me this cigarette and I saved it through the first world war.
But after th e war  I sort of -- I mean  not changed  but I just got a -- the -- the time when they -- the German invasion came and they burned -- first they burned the shuls  burned the books and then they saw the people.
And he became later  after the war  the President of the East Berlin University.
Yeah Interview with Sylvia Rosen November 20  2012 28 After the war ended.
And so we stayed there on on the first night when war star started.
I mean  did you think of -- I -- -- Israel  or returning to Germany after the war?
You -- you just -- your whole concept -- I think soldiers in war time too  they are afraid  but they just -- oh  excuse me.
What do you know about the pogroms after... After the war?
And this is what I said  and I was the last speaker  not expected maybe  to speak at all  and when we get it first at th e house  with the congressmen  and it was  at that place  it was the military commander the -- from the Jewish war veterans of the state of Illinois.
So she looked at her and said  I think that after the war yo u will be working for her.

He gave me and I still have it  and a long  long conversation started with a man whose daughter  hers elf  had been given over to Christians and when he survived the war his daughter who by then was eight or nine was saying oh those goddamn Jews  was inbued with anti-semitism by the very people to whom Turkoff entrusted his own daughter.

And the young peopl e were trying to hitchhike and go east after learning that the Soviet Union have entered the war  and occupying east of Poland.
Was there any romance between Leon and you in -- in -- before the -- during the war?
And that happened right around the time -- ov ernight you had Dunkirk and the English who had been in Le Man disappeared in the middle of the night  abandoned their barracks and headed for Dunkirk  part of World War II and -- and went to -- and then escaped.
And I can remember the French came to take all those prisoners that had been French or -- victims.
Not at all  no  no  no letters at all  you know  she she he evidently perished kind of early in in in the war  you know.
Yeah  yeah  its hard for -- its hard for non-technical people to realize that  but the fact of the matter is that Ive had a few -- if -- if -- as Iv e done  if you put a large chemical plant on line  with a new process  new  untried equipment  and all that sort of thing  the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything Id done in the war.
Th e very simple word of war took me and I was all the time attached to the radio and th en the Kovno was bombarded and all...first of all the air...the airport and then the military and then all th e town was in flames  so we tried to escape and the the Russians  the Sovi ets were taken by surprise and they rushed out of Kovno.
We then asked for a transfer  after the -- the Dutch went home very quickly after the -- after the end of the war.
I mean  when the war broke out  my mother didnt know how to cook or clean or do any of those things  but thats not how proper young ladies were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 17 raised.
When the war ended  you and your brother  with your uncle  what then happened?
If there would be no war I would still have a year or two.
I do remember then when the war started and we all had to wear I.D. tags.
Well  there are a lot of people who have told me  that after the war was over  they just didnt talk about what they had gone through.
We were on the fourth floor  and everything was burning around  and we had to start the war.
Before the war was a regular jail.. So they took them back to the jail  to the yard by the jail.
Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17  2001 31 There are some things that happened in this country  a-after the war -- you know  in years since the war.
Yeah but you know youre never happy with anything when you go through this war.
You know  some people  for instance  I met them after the war  and I asked them  did they went in Palestine?
Were you hoping that you would be able to go wh ile the war was still on?
I was taken care of  and so I was da -- 28 wa-was about two years and the war had started November -- December 7 th  1941  and we the -- we were drafted in 1942.
Oh  I could have stayed in Germany  by the sheer coincidence of my name  which is a German name and the fact that I was  for a few month  a German citizen  in World War II.
So what do you remember about the war coming to an end?
Well  as a Jewish person  before the war  I knew -- like I said  I knew I wasnt equal to the others  because I wasnt treated that way  but I always felt I was  in myself.
Q. Tell me  how much did you know about Hitler and what was going on in Germany before the Germans occupied Poland?
In that time  did you know  was it spoken of  was it known about  of what was happening basically to the Jews and others in Europe?
And then I met my wife before the war by our neighbors  when she was very young.
And I  the victim of the Holo caust  the horror for which this country supposedly went to war  I had to wait five years.
>> Bill Benson: And you were able to get back home?
The war  American war correspondents had reported during the summer of 1945  and their reports were read by Americans in New York  Chicago  elsewhere  in the in the daily press  that Jewish survivors of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria were being badly treated.
Well  when our our our thought would be maybe its only mine  but our thought would be that the fact that this plane shortened the war so much that that a lot of the Holocaust survivors benefited from the fact that and were still alive today because of the even Eisenhower said that.
>> Bill Benson: The war ended in Europe in May 1945.
What was the like for you to receive that news that the war had ended?
My wife was not permitted to come over while I was at Dachau  but at the time of as the war crimes ended  when was it?
It was made for Goehring  and they said this was made only of the fliers that were downed in the war that they had taken these tattoos from.
I was suppose to come home 01:07:00 Septembe r 26  but the war started September 1st  1939 and I was in the Army at this time.
And then  again  I can't say for  it's six months or a year  they bought me some kind of bed where I was in the so -called dining room and the family  the additional  the uncles and aunts and that group  moved to the third floor  so we had the first  ground floor  the family  the owners  had the floor right on top of us  the owner's husband did no t come back from the war  so she was with two children by herself  so she needed the rent  and then the top floor was for the two uncles  the aunt and the grandfather.
Are you more comfortable today around people who came from Europe and experienced the war than you are among people who did not?
Did Sarnee look very different than it had looked before the war?
End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B So Id -- Id really -- I-I know that I was very touched by your words  ﬁI didnt cry for five years during the war  but when I saw Jewish boys  with Jewish stars on Canadian uniforms ﬂ -- Well let me -- we were -- we were liber ated not by the American army  but by the Canadian army.
Some who want to go back to Poland   they stayed there and wait until Soviets arrive  and I dont know what happened to that  but we get out to west  on the British zone  so we stay as stayed  then I well  I we get to this I mentioned this little town  Seesen  a very nice town and it turned out there were many thousands of Poles from Poland during the war that can do work in German factories in those warehouses and so on.
And then as the war progressed  people were sent out of London.
Was that the only time since the war that youve been to Germany ?
Is there anything that -- that we havent talked about that stands out in your mind about the period of time be fore World War II started?
Uh now my grandparents and my uncle went also into hiding in the eastern part of Holland and they were in a barn on a farm and they were...they were caught the week before the end of the war  but the Germans didn't know what to do with them because they were in such a mess at that time and they put them in prison in in nearby village and kind of left them there while they fled and so they were saved.
The Germans came first to the border with Poland to the west of Poland  this border.
apprenticeship in as a lawyer  and the war started and this was an end of my profession.
Do you remember hearing about th e war ending when you were in the U.S.?
She was is and when we went to Germany  my husband and I  we visited my husbands friends.
Would your parents -- I mean  would you be sitting in your -- the arms of one of your parents at that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 12 farmhouse table and think you were very weak  at the end of the war  but I wonder if the others too  were poorly nourished and ragged in your clothing and so on?
So they called carpenters  blacksmiths  and here and there and I say to myself   I knew from my father that during the war  a shoemaker and a tailor was the best trade.
As far as the school was concerned  I think we could go to school for a little while  but then  again  there was an assembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the school and go to a -- a Jewish school  and have be separated from the others.
Which is why I can understand the Bosnians reciting a war from 800 AD or you know whatever.
What do you think about all the attention th e -- the Holocaust and th -- and Holocaust survivors have been getting -- Yeah. --
And the French prisoners of war cut through some wires  we were surrounded by . . .
Talk about nightmares  if I didnt have terrible nightmares before  I sure had them after that.
My father spoke Germans perfe -- German perfectly  and he worked for the Germans the first World War  as an interpreter.
Now he can come and God but the..the...right now after the war he will come to convert us.
By 19 -- by the end of the summer 1939  of course  we knew war was coming.
I found out after the war that the Belgian Nazis in Antwerp had gathered one night and had been shown a film  \ De Avaga Juda[ph123]\  which is the \ Eternal Jew\  which is a horrible film where human beings are tr ansposed into rats and back and forth.
If he would've died a few days before the war  I am sure his family would have send us away to the Germans...throw us out from there because they been so afraid and they...they just didn't want anything to do with us.
And did your father speak German as well as your mother?
And I am saying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War  my family sort of stayed to stayed in the geogr aphical locations they were  but all of a sudden they were citizens of three different countries  Czechoslovakia   Hungary and Austria.
He gave over a hundred affidavits Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 32personally  to sponsor people after World War II.
There's Hitler here; there's a war here  but you could be saved.\
And I know that because there was an enormous ruckus between those convents and Israel  at the end of the war  b ecause Israel wanted those Jewish kids to come to Israel.
I had a happy childhood until when I was twelve years old the war broke out.
And I spent all my year of my the war years in Italy.
After the war  you gave evidence to er  to the trials  the IG Farben trial in Nuremberg.
You know  the United States was not in -- not in the war  and Russia was -- had succes sfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler.
having lived through the Holocaust  and -- and seen some of what you saw -- Yeah. --
SL: See  because -- RL: Right after the war  when the war was finished  they caught somebody that was a collaborator  they finished him  they hang hi m right away.
Did you have any other feeli ngs about being Jewish at that time?
In the Finnish German -- In the finni -- fi -- fi -- -- in the Finnish Soviet war. --
We said we could survive a war like that and we saw small children being killed or heard about it  there is no God.
I must say that we did not find any important evidence of his involvement in war crimes.
And two  in general can you formulate in general how your experiences in the war affected you?
And -- and all the workers in -- in the 37 factory where I worked said well be in war -- at war in a week or so  and I say  no you wont be.
Then after the war was over  I was hoping that I would have sense enough to control my diet.
It was impossible to think to go back to Germany  because what probably would have been happening  we would have taken off the ship into a camp  and be killed.
Thank you very  very much Mrs. Gabis for agreeing to speak with us today with for agreeing to share your story  your experiences  and in this way help us understand how the awful things that happened during World War II and the Holocaust occurred  how it affected ordinary people.
Did you notice that your parents cha nged their religious practices before and after the war?
And he then visit me in Israel once  it was funny because on that time  it was before six year war  so Jord an and Jerusalem was divi ded.
Feiga   Im wondering if you can start by giving us your name before the war  as your birth name  and the date and place of your birth?
When I came to Poland  because I -- a few years ago I was in Poland  too.
Your he did have relations with his younger brother  who also lived in now moved to northeastern Poland   to Lida  but died before the second World War  and the younger brothers son was deported to the Soviet Union .
And what happened was  uh my... They dealt a lot in those days to...uh you weren't able to buy food  things like that  right after the war.
An article  a short article was it writte n  only about the war.
DL] What changes actually occurred in the camp towards the end of the war? [
Part of that territory was was given back to Denmark after the 1st World War in 1919  but there's always been an an apprehension against these very very powerful Germans just south of the border.
My oldest brother came back from on permission on fu rlough in wintertime befo re the war started.
And when they bombed Pearl Harbor  made us kind of mad.
Well  we participated in -- in that war and we were assigned different duties.
You must have seen that church  we bombe d out that famous cathedr al  and they left that standing there in the middle of modern Berlin  which is quite interesting  but thats just a reminder of the war  not -- nothing to do with Germans -- nothing to do with Jews.
And then there was terrible war going on in England  between the bombings and all of that.
And even though we did not have any radios or any newspapers  the news kept trickling in to us that the tide of the war had turned.
After the war  your new husband was part of the Polish army?
I found out after the war that she was involved in a...in an underground group that was smuggling people from Poland to the West to safety.
The war broke out  my mother was only 50 years old.
He was not Jewish  but he couldn't get into med sc hool so he studied in Pola nd because of the war and all what was going on  he was coming back.
What did war mean to -- How could I not know?
But before we turn to that  tell us first a little bit about your family and your community in the years before the war and the Holocaust.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 19 Yeah  sure  yeah.
You know  I was nobody Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8  1993 47recognize  you see  the way they were I paid the fortune for my life during the war  because I they people were recognizing  the Polacks  from my husband from my fathers factory guy  he was running after me from one tram tramway to another  and I escaped.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 244 Yeah  by all means.
The Germans come back and they really give them some blows and they lost a lot of soldiers  the Russians.
Governor Reagan at that time  who would become President  had sort of declared war on le gal services in California  who had represented migrant farm workers and had also won some fa irly major welfare decisions with regard to hearing rights.
Looking back on your experiences and thinking of your career in the theater and acting.. It was not much of a career If you had to select the most dramatic moment of your life at least during the time of the war what would you.. The most dramatic I think was when we were in Rhodes 28 and I still had my Austrian passport.
Im going to report you to the Gestapo.ﬂ Well  its remarkable that on the eighth of May  that there was still a German woman who didnt realize that the war -- that they were losing the war.
And we -- and one night she came with a -- a friend of hers from before the war  that he took her out for -- th -- he wanted -- basically he wanted her to have dinner  and she didnt want to eat  she was too proud to tell him that he -- that she is hungry.
I actually spent the war years in Brussels in this orphanage.
Since he hated the Germans so much  uh and hated certainly to work for for the war effort  he had developed a certain technique  you know  when you weld pipes you have to be very ca reful because uh under high pressure they could burst easily and therefore you have to be have to be very accurate.
Uh  uh  I think the one you're referring to is actually a uh  a German prisoner of war camp.
11 ROUGH DRAFT COPY NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: Right.
And then Switzerland...and now we experienced in Switzerland the exchange of prisoners of war.
Jen Ciardelli: So your father made it to the United States after the war.
After the war  we had a little bit of contact from beginning.
And towards the end of the war -- and I lo se -- Id -- nobody -- I mean  I still didnt know the calendar date  whether was mar -- Februa ry  March  to me it was the winter  who knows  but I dont associate with particular months or dates.
Look  when we went into the war  and into the ghetto  the structure of society was not dissimilar in th-the structur e of my family.
Its when I was Jewish and -- and the war broke out.
So then in -- and after the war  when my uncle  my only unc le what I had the [indecipherable] was not a real uncle  was a second cousin  was a cousin from my father -- from my mother.
We arrived in that town shortly after the war star ted.
So  from then  what I remember is spending a lot of time in the fields with the herd  driving the herd in the morning and staying in the field and I was told very precisely which fields they were to graze when because they didn't want them to just ruin the field so you had to drive your cattle to one field  let it graze a certain amount of time and when the sun was at a certain point you drove your cattle to another field and come back at night and they attempted to teach me 12 how to milk the cows which I wasn't too successful at the beginning  but I learned eventually  and assorted chores around the farm  which I did and I stayed on that farm in that Ukrainian speaking village until the war was over.
But they figured  there is going to be a war  which eventually ends  an d sooner or later well be out of here  you know?
He was a reserve officer and when the war broke out Interview with Leonard Zawacki 2 he was called up and he was taken prisoner of war and he spent the war years in a prisoner of war camp.
The uniqueness of my war experience  I don't know whether  should we talk a bout that now?
We both for the war  he was against Nazism  he escaped to the partisans because he did not want to be drafted to go to Germany  to work with the Nazis.
Yes  I was very I I id yeah  I I was crazy to have joined the navy  to see the world  or whatever  for the war  because I was carsick  seasick  train-sick and every other nauseous you can imagine.
But this was -- there was nothing normal about his war.
Yeah  I said to her  and I remember that very distinctly  and my mother reminded me of this after the war.
So I was not that close to her even though I wa s with her all the time and practically  I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this  but my father  and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a yo ung man because he was always away in  in the concentration camp.
The final thing what we heard actually after of the war  that the whole train went to Northern Germany near Hannover someplace to a concentration camp and they were all eliminated.
But its typical of the atmosphere of the school that the free places  or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War  yeah.
So you traveled by -- by truck  by train  on foot  until you finally -- Yes  the thing was  in Poland  my mother somehow was -- she was a business woman from before the war and she was resourceful enough to organize her life again  and from what I was told late r  she was dealing in barter  buying and exchanging and selling and doing  until she had put together enough money that we were able to travel to Germany.
Would you be talking about other things you could possibly do  or the war  or -- Well  nights you -- you would talk about the news that was in the -- in the paper that day  and other things that you might have heard that hadnt gotten in the paper yet.
>> Bill Benson: So what was it like to arrive in Israel for you?
And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp  from a prisoners of war camp.
Im very much involved with the -- with the Holocaust  yes.
I -- I would like to say that thanks to him  not only I live  bu t a lot of people  tens of thousands of people in Israel and all over the world because the families got bigger and the families had children  the children had children  and he is counted as a war -- the biggest [indecipherable] in the history.
So I thought  oh  now they are killing  and now after the war  I was in Auschwitz  and I asked so mebody there [indecipherable] when I left [indecipherable] I met her in Birkenau.
And was this how soon after the war started  did these things start happening?
No  not here  but in Poland we knew  because my dad was taking part in World War I fighting  and I think my when th ey were collecting like gold or something for the country  then my dad and gave his  and my moms wedding band  donated.
So tell me  what After the war  were he was in a hospital in i-in Scotland   I think  for one  and then England .
But its remarkable you know when you think what the Germans did after the war and they are hardworking and but then I think half of the American population is German.
That for us was the end of the war but we were afraid to go to town.
During the war -- after the war  I was one of the few.
We discovered  only like three  four  five days later that the war had ended.
I left Athens in 1940 with -- when the war started against the Italians.
You were -- so youre -- youre in Italy afte r the war  and youre just starting to learn -- I think you said in the first interview that you -- you were not aware during the war  of Auschwitz.
So af ter the war  so how did you find your wife?
Some of them were really Jewish Germans instead of German Jews; there was one gentleman with the Iron Cross from World War I  proudly displayed  whic h was torn off.
And then I told him  you know  Vera  I was with your brother during the war.
He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the orphanage or whatever  and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young 01:21:30 women to a place at the outskirts called Marianske in ghetto.
What they did--this was put under what they called War Relocation Authority.
It turned around and -- but of course  they won the war  but never peace.
Beca be yeah  because I had I have here pictures here from Was she o married when the war was over?
At that tim e however  I was working for a company that was important for the war effort and they [indecipherable] want to rele ase me  so for six months I was not released  but after six months I was -- the position was still held for me and thats how I got to work in the Czech government.
Now  a lot of people th the they were cremated o-or killed  in i-in the war time  they cannot speak no more  because they are dead.
Because he wrote a book about Dutch Jews and the war.
And when the war was co ming to an end  he became a governor of a part which was annected from Poland from the German territory there.
Tell me the first time that you do you remember where you were when you learned that the war had broken out?
I -- we had a one -- yeah  brother-in-law who survived the war.
So most of my fr iends were killed during the war.
I  I believe this is the joke of  of the century: her being afraid to take us on a boat that might be bombed  and then getting caught in the war in Europe and concentration camps.
And then came the war and my father go  and so my mother had this little boy.
Barbara Farkas 79 December 9  1995 You see  after the war  I became a very strong person.
When did you  so in the time after the war when you were in France and you were attending school again  did you have the– how long did it take before you had the idea that you wanted to become a doctor and do you re member how that happened?
>> Bill Benson: So five years after the war before you got to the United States.
I was initially in Feldifing after th e -- right after the war.
So I was al most there -- What are your thoughts about Israel?
And my grandfather has experience from World War I that I knew also with all the gangs in Russia when they were deported to Russia by the Czars in the -- during the revolution that each gang who come -- occupies a certain city took people and arrested them sometimes he cruel to them  so  he had very  very good experience of life.
So  a-and the journalists  even American journalists were there because America was not in war at that time yet with Germany.
So I thought maybe they send me to Russia  because my father came from Russia.
One flight up from that was the wonderful woman whose husband had died in the First World War.
That -- thats the way it was  until we came to Germany  we realized that the war was coming to an end.
So like after the war  whatever I wanted  it came to me  it fell into my lap  very easy.
It's not just giving somebody a shot  but for a long  for about a year after the war  I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been sterilized.
Soviet  or In before the war  Im talking this this is before the war.
The brother of Mrs. Steina ts had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War 36 One  and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats.
And I wonder what would have happened if there had been no war and if I had lived in my cocoon in Poland.
The second time I remember he came to shul to speak that when before the war started and the Polish government saw that there have to be a war  so they wanted the citizens should donate money to b uy airplanes because the Polish air force didnt have too many airplanes; they had a few.
>> Bill Benson: There's a story you told me about being in the Army during the 1956  this was the Suez Canal war in 1956.

It's a miracle I tell you what happened  that the Germans lost the war.
But  right after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway  so I say to myself maybe a good thing that happened  you know there were so many kids they went to their death so frightened  so scared b ecause they didnt have their parents with them.

And so half a year later  war is declared on Poland.

Hopefully  we hoped that the Germans will lose the war  and they thought they were telling us going to be a Blitzkrieg in 2 weeks  the whole uh war will be over  and uh  everything will be okay  everything be nice and fine  but they were mistaken  the war dr-the war dragged and dragged  and uh  they start slowly annihilating us.

Yeah  so my mother quickly found a farmer who w ould t-take my father as an unpaid f-farmhand and so he went out in the countryside  and we just av -- sort of waited for -- for the war to end.
And there was a lot of prisoner  Russian prisoners who were -- came home from the -- from the Germany.

Schools in Germany  West Germany  in the American zone   and the British zone  didnt 124 open for nine months after the war ended.
We just thought that this was maybe part of the ove rall war effort as it were  and the Jews were considered also as being communists  you know  a lot of Jews belonged to the left or -- you know  socialists an -- organizations  so the Germans may have been using this as an excuse to -- you know  to restrict and confine the Jews and so forth  and using that as a -- as a -- as a -- as a co -- so there were a lot of mixed  mixed feelings.
The other bad thing about war is that we talk about the Sweden  about the work  about everything  and always we get back to the camp.

Now this is the dog you had when you... In Hannover  in Germany afte r the war.
We had -- we were not wealthy  but we were comfortable  we never had -- except for the war  hunger  or whatever.
J-Jews werent at that point wer I dont think I am not sure  but I dont think they were killed just because they were Jews.
He was fighting the war they didn't put him in with the military because he was Jewish.
Til later in the war  then my hus -- my mother gave some food for -- his father was in the hospital  and his mother picked it up.
Later on  he became an medical st udent  after the war  and practiced medicine.
Then while my father was still out there  the Italians had stepped out of the war  and that brought to us hope that now they're falling apart and now we don't have to hold out too much longer.
Now  it should -- I have to emphasize that I was permitted to stay in school and not change to a Jewish school  because my father was a front line war veteran.

Did she find out  did she know he was in this prisoner of war camp?
So -- so theres one of those ironies  if you will  of the war that people that didnt know what to do  with so much c onfusion and so forth and they actually survived  and the native  or the local people perished [indecipherable] Were going to have to stop and change the tape.
9 But that was early -- in the early stages  later on became much more difficult  even before the war  because the -- there was a lot of -- obviously some anti-Semitism that -- it was prevalent.
I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem when all of a sudden I  war would be overŠwe were always optimistsŠand I could go to  instead of the first form to the second form an d Latin would create the biggest problem.

And we got together and we sang songs  we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my happiest days because in this group  Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war broke out.

His father got killed in the beginning of the War in Odessa.

If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some -- or in World War I  I should say that.

But when  after the 67 war  when they opened this road again  there it was  exactly wa As your memory.
And Well  the nine months that youre in Britain before the war breaks out  youre not receiving any kind of schooling?
I was very much aware of the Spanish Civil War  of the war that Germany had played.
That was their first transport to Auschwitz  to the concentration camp  first transport.
And then the war ended sometime before that so the draft was off but there was a period where I was very draftable and I wasnt taken right away.
Are there other memories you have of your own personal experiences during the war  you're own involvement in trying to help people?
They were like big numbers  the Spanish people from the Civil War.
That we found Krupp   because he was building tanks and stuff like that  and testing them  and things of that nature othe r war material.

The money that I have gotten at that-- at one time  that lump sum  went towards a in a small  very small part  I took my family  my wife and the two children  and my son and daughter  and we went to Israel  right after the '70 war.
But at that point  you know  my mother was gone for a year and a half  so Yeah  this is the end of the war  when Germany capitulates.
And then after that you learn that you learn after the war  that they went into hiding.
And in real life they were not allowed to kill Jews  but if they caught the Jews they killed them.
Right after the war  in Poland  also my father was a good businessm an and financially we were doing okay.
And uh  he had a man at that time  I think it must have been in -----------oh  1943  late 43  that he had a man in his house with all the other people and the children that um  he was from the Spanish war on the black list of the Germans  and he had for a few days no place to go  and he was from Ho lland originally  and so he took him in  and that night  they came and em ptied the whole house.

We looked for them after the war but we were told not to bother looking for them because they were murdered two days after that.
Before that cross -- Red Cross came I me ntioned the old people -- a lot of old -- thousands of old people were deported  and after that  it must have been under the influence of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto that the Germans did not want it to happen in other ghettos as well  so all able bodied people who were not necessary for the war industry  and like agriculture for where they produced for the Germans  and those who were necessary to maintain the functioning of the town  of the ghetto as such  the physical functioning  were all deported  and Schliesser was gone  and I was among -- the 91 kitchens were running  so I was no l-longer needed.
Then when the war broke out in 1939  when the Germans came in the first thing what they did  they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and put into the synagogue and they had to take out all the  you know  and everything the...and everything and put on the sidewalk and burn themﬂ. Only Jewish people have to do this.

Moise Weiner: Yeah  because we had no supplies of details  of spare parts during the war; and the machines were out of wo rk  most of them.
And after the war we found out that if we had had one or two more relatives who we would have known for sure were not Jewish  we would have made it.
That was the German invasion of the occupied territory of Poland.
And -- cause we werent at war with Romania during the period that the Iron Guard was in power in the autumn and winter of 1940 and 1941.

But my friend  by the way  where I lived in -- in -- interestingly enough  I remember he had a brother who lived in London  who went to London before the war  and he was on the British Broadcasting Corporation  yes?
Did you have  were all of your friends Jewish at the time?
Because subsequently - I dont mean right now at the outbreak of the war - but subsequently  not only would the Jews start working as a force  labor force  in the factory  while there was still a ghetto  but once the ghetto was liquidated  there was a labor camp set up just to supply workers to the factory and  since there were always typhus and there were shootings and killings and Jews were just disposed of here and there  there was forever a new shipment arriving of workers.
They hate the Germans because of the war and that was so many years ago.
But after the war  th ey'll need the British for they  whatever they wanted to and to annoy the British they didn't understand what we understood  that it is not a question of favor that you do to somebody  international politics is a question of power.
And uh at that time there was a Jewish boys school and there was a Jewish girls school.
in this camp  in the war [indecipherable] you know  this and his brother Was underground.
And then  of course  after that  became  you know  the Vietnam War and -- But before we get to the war  how did you follow up from  ﬁI Have a Dreamﬂ?
But after the war  a friend of mine who I told exactly where the money should be  went back to 33 Poland  finally to dig -- dig the money out  didn t find anything.
So my first boots that I wore after the war was some small soldier's boots.
And and he give me an orange  he give me an orange  and I didnt know what is it  because I [indecipherable] before the war  so I didnt Right.
And what I think was happening is that th -- that they were celebrating different things happening as the war was really  completely ending.
And when the war started we had to give up all our silver and gold.
My dad didn't come back from England until 1946  a year after the war.
Interview with Sol Mackler December 28  2009 27 She got she got no  she got married in the war.
In any case  we said that sooner or later the war would end  that we would surely see each other again.
And this was all prior to -- This was even prior to Hitler.
We probably got food from the peop le from the Jewish people who lived before the war in Lwow.
The first war was 1914  19 -- 18 - 19 - 20  we over this.
My grandfather  not grandparent s because grandma left for United States on the last ship before the outbreak of the war.
>> When you were -- when you were with the Harrisons  did you hear anything about the war?
And then he started to talk to us children  not about Jesus or v -- the Virgin Mary or anything  but about his time in World War as a submarine commander.
No audio ] >> Manya Friedman: I was 13 years old when the war started  so I don't have much life experience.
Already it was almost known that they re taking the people to Auschwitz. {
The after war period  over 50 years old today  all full of -- full of opportunities for Rome  to ac -- to -- shes not -- to -- knowledge -- for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 47 Rome to acknowledge  and to -- and to atone for the sins which were done to Jews for centuries  did not -- were -- were not done  up to today.
The Germans were starting to lose the war  so their interest in the Jews were getting less except if they happened to see any  they shot them.
I think  cause it star -- the war -- World War Two started  by us  when I was five years old.
Was there an effort  now that the war was on and everybody's motives were changed so much  that they let in a lot more people who's orphanages -- I don't know anything about before the war  but I'll tell you they did not they couldn't get into our place because the rooms  the area was very small and we had 30 40 people in a room.
Because we had naively assumed that the war would be over within a matter of months  since it was only a matter of playing for time.
We have not got the means to go to war at the mo ment.
But if not that woman  maybe they will stay til after the war or maybe a few months  but it was not a Jewish neighborhood and all the people knew each other and they wo uld never squeal like she did.
They lost the war because the Germans took a part and this took a part  but they wanted to kill us  the Jews.
And during the war later on  German and English languages  to me were 5 something where I literally basked in learning those.
Was it from like 1940 to 1944  or was it that long?
She left for Israel just shortly before the breaking out of the war and she lives in Tel Aviv  and I visit her occasionally.
Yeah  that was slave la -- I mean  it was all slave labor.
He would say to him ﬁyou see that girl that blonde one  I will take her outﬂ. He knew me from even before when we attended the wedding of my teacher Esther Eckshtein  who was my teacher after the war.
In '45  when the war was over  she married an old friend [of] her first husband.
When the war was winding down  you would have been ab out 17 years old  right?
I remember one gave me a pair of slacks and I had it after the end of the war.
But after the war when all the news came out and the pictures came out of the camps and the victims did  were Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 49 you old enough to understand what happened and you say your parents never really talked about it.
Not everybody  even has idea how how people spent this time  in concentration camp  or even occupation during second war in Poland.
So  being in Greece at the time of the end of the war  suddenly the trains began to come in with these young men and women  many of them spitting blood from tuberculosis  no families.
We would sing Jewish  Polish-because this was my language at that... I was educated in Polish.
Immediately when the war started  my dad  as now an enemy alien  was arrest arrested.
But anything now here that remind me of the war years I dont think so.
And there was this snobbery but I imagine that preexisted the war.
>> Bill Benson: Henry  your father died before the war began  right before the war began  a couple of months  I think.
But when the war came to the end  the pressure wa s put on Bucharest.
What do you think was the most difficult thing for these folks after the war?
The way we found out the war was over  on August 10th is my mothers birthday.
But one of the things that we think is either that he was  because he had been born in Poland when he was a little kid  he came to Germany  maybe beca use at that time the Nazis  the Germans were not at war with Poland yet  because it was before they occupied Poland  which was in 1939.
And my and my mothers twin sister  who died of a of the influenza epidemics after the first World War.
And so what it was  it was he after the war he told me that it was just at first he c-couldnt get any kosher fat  and then he just certif ied it himself.
And I th-they wanted to take me as an American prisoner of war  and smuggle me to America   and I said no  I explained with my hands  because I didnt speak English  that I wanted to go to London .
Well  the war ended on May eighth  very conveniently  so I had no further trouble from that source.
Now you've gathered all of this materi al and the War Crimes teams have a lot of this evidence.
Now -- and he was influential to -- you know  they -- they -- they knew in Poland thats the war -- you know  that the Germans  first of all  they requested -- they requested Danzig  that was the first thing.
But then during the war later  I went back to school   nursing school.
Uh  the Germans came into our city 3 days after the war broke out.
And ‚99 was a very happy year  and before 1940  until 41 when the war started in Russia and Germany.
They felt if they -- as long as they can stay out  maybe the war will end  and we will f -- continue to live our normal life.
and I was very puzzled by that question  and he told me he had been a student at the Yale Law School in the First World War.
Mr. Gureckas  where we left off  you were describing to us how you saw the downed Soviet plane which had fought which was flying against in the Finnish the Winter War against Finland  how it landed near Panevžys  and you saw the dismantled parts of it being taken by Soviet soldiers  and it aroused a great deal of curiosity amongst the the kids in school  and you all went to the windows to take a look.
My mother after the war when we were living in Sweden slept an awful lot.
After the war in December of 44  I had the surprise of a cousin who came and found me there.
So in 1940  I believe it was  my entire family along with the rest of the town Jewry were corralled into a ghetto.
Weve got to move to a certain area of Lodz  which was the poorest area of Lodz  which was called Baluty  you know  its funny enough  a lot of Jewish people lived there before the war  you see.
My question: did life change even more when there was an actual war?
And I'm conservative  because I had to make it  I di d. When I was in the army  I made 72 dollars and that's all I had and I bought a war bond of 18 dollars and 75 cents  every month for two years.
Lesson from it from my own personal experience is don't let the war ever happen on you own soil; fight it somewhere else.
An eyewitness went after the war  or he was one of the liberator.
And when the war broke out  I was 14  and my brother Fred was 4 and my brother At  was 6.
I mean at the end of the war how old was my father?
I have to sketch out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I dont have to do that here.
Like two months after th e war or a year after No.
We got the sense that we got to move into the ghetto.
Id taught a course on early modern European history  and I was scheduled to teach a course on World War and on eastern Europe at Columbia when I was cal led by a representative of the U.S. attorneys 5 office in New York  and asked whether I would be interested in working for a short term period  gathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offe nder.
If he didnt -- maybe he came back to Poland  you know  so I wasnt sure  maybe he went straight to Poland from the concentration camp if he is alive.
We -- for a short while one of our roomers during the war was a Latvian former diplomat.
And that typewriter  he used that f hunt and peck  for years  typing even 15 - 20 years after the war  suing here and suing there  writing to this place  writing to that place  to Do you have the files for his No  I dont have that any more.
And whether it was a dr eam or whether I wasnt  you know  persevering enough many people who went through what I went through did very well after the war.
Tell me please a a few words about the first days of the war and how this impacted on the life of your family.
There were hardly any families that did not feel the...the tragedy of war. (
Except for Interview with George Pick November 13  1997 97 Di-Did the tightening of the government   or what you had to do  did that bring back any memories of the war?
Right after the war ended  immediately and the years fol lowing  did the German people talk about what had happened to the Jews and the concentration camps?
Y ou were born in Germany in 1928  five years before Hitler came to power and a little over 11 years before the Second World War began.
There was -- Before the war  was -- for me was not so popu lar start argument and fi ghting with the Jewish people  it was not popular.
And after the war -- I forgot how many orphanages they had ; unfortunately quite a number because many kids had no more parents.
And then there were Jewish USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070 22stores in Poland where they -- they were working with signs  dont buy -- dont buy from a Jew  you know  so we were beating them up.
By that particular time  it was about a week later already into the war and the following the holidays it was already   which as you know  it follows Rosh Hashana  Yom Kipper  and five days later  Sucot .
Uh there were no boats available at the beginning  but also with the help of our people in Holland in the last minu te they found a ferry  ferrying these children to England and when they arrived in Harwich they they...England had already...was already in a state of a blackout  so they came to England or I would say on the eve on the war.
Were you -- you were fini shing up school at about the time of the war?
People were crying please  good people couple good family you know was connected to us and before the war Jewish uprising my father found th ree places where the people can hire.
This was not bombarded  that there will be the... immediately after the war there will be the officers to organize the groups and so on and so on.
And the reason I'm saying this  because when the war started  Germany attacked Poland from the west.
He had left during the war and was inquiring about his family 's fate.
Speaking of \ ours \  I mean Jews in Germany immediately after the war  knowing of the unbelievable horror under which these people had suffered  we had the same hatred towards Germans that the Jewish DPs had.
It had before the war some 300 000 population and now with the refugees the town had over a million population. ..
But  as I say  we were never hungry  and interestingly  we always knew we were going to win the war.
We were very worrie d that the Germans would come back.
My parents arrived by the first commercial crossing after the war had ended.
It was 1943  but I couldn't become a citizen at that time because it was the height of the war  Stalingrad.
He wanted me and my mother to come to England  so he was trying nothing happened  he wrote that he bought some stockings for me  and that was very Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 71difficult at that just after war.
Had that not been diverted by General Montgomery selling the idea to mi Eisenhower these are all our opinions  not only mine  but a lot of lot of our people  that those tanks of Patton could have been continui ng on their unobstructed drive to Germany   and would have saved one year war.
And then he interrupted his studies  because the first World War started  and he joined the Pilsudskis legions  and fought against Russia   and was very badly wounded on the Ukrainian front.
When the War Education asked me -- War 13 Education Authority  to go to Oswego  New Yo rk.
And the Colonel who told me that said \ Your name has been given to us  and what's a war crime?\
We certainly had not sympathized with the Germans when it -- i-in their war against the we st.
But you you and your family expected the war to be over so you could leave  I gather  right?
It showed a picture of a B-17 and a silhouette of a B-29  showed how much bigger the B-29 was and that we warned the Germans that they were going to start using these planes on th em if they dont surrender  and stuff like that  you know  and and it showed how Am ericans treat German prisoners of war  and stuff  it showed them in mess halls and stuff like that.
I happened to know -- remember her address that I wrote to her.
We did not have -- we only had  afte r the war finished  we had -- whoever was left over  they took them to concentration camps.
Another sister  Genya was also -- survived the war  also made it to Australia.
And he used to live in Antwerp before the war and he was in Antwerp quite a known person.
That brings us pretty much to almost the end of the war -- no.
No  there was nobody -- yes  th ere were some out of -- we found out  we we re told that out of 34 000 Leucoline Jews  who had lived in the Leucoline ghetto we re all murdered except for 4 000 young men who had occupations that were important to the war effo rt.
End of Tape Two 39 Beginning Tape Three All right  so the Germans come in.
So they agreed to a small corridor that w ould lead to the Baltic Sea  so that both countries had access  and that Gdansk  or Danzig -- Poland will have ac cess to -- to Gdansk to use it as a port.
The Germans only came in in 1940  and we went to Belgium in  no we came  '39 we we nt to Belgium in January and the war started in September that same year  so there were no Germans when we  otherwise  why should we go where there are Germans  anyway?
At that time  1939  yeah  Cana da entered the war  I left  I left Canada on the fifth or sixth of September  Canada entered the wa r at  on the seventh of September  September  day after.
And this was in between  lets say before September 39  before the worl war breaks out  you had secured these positions for them.
But  on the way there  Russians occupied Lithuania   so he came back  and we ended up working in a factory   Seidel Naumann factory that you before the war used to make sewing machines  right now was making pieces for for military purposes.
And I think that my parents were totally  you know  astounded that this and of course very happy  and and and so  in celebration  what they had brought back from Sweden was a certain kind of chocolate that during the during the war in Denmark   you know  you cant get chocolate  so what happened was there was a big party  where all the kids in in the in the complex where we lived  were invited up  and it it was a sort of a it it was a party that took several days  that ended up that ended our Sweden odyssey.
And it was during the war  he felt it was wrong to strike.
On the fir on the W-World War first after  they the Romanian took it over.
Youre chasing all the girls?ﬂ So I says to this guy  ﬁArya  when were you in France?ﬂ He says  ﬁRight away you want to know my life hist -- biography?ﬂ I says  ﬁNo ﬂ I says  ﬁI was in France  too.ﬂ He say -- I says  ﬁI was there in 1945.ﬂ He says  ﬁSo was I  in 1945.ﬂ I says  ﬁI was in the -- in the Ozair  this and this home.ﬂ He said  ﬁFor -- So was I.ﬂ I says  ﬁDont tell me you were in Buchenwald.ﬂ He says  ﬁYes.ﬂ He says  ﬁOh  you the leedfacshiker  right?ﬂ Now  all those years we sit in the same synagogue and the man never want to talk about it  right  because he doesnt want to talk about the war.
And we got ther e and this group of people started coming out and they reco gnized me  a bunch of them  and they started asking about my brother  who -- so this was very shortly after the end of war  maybe the war was still on.
I remember not I remember  I saw with my own eyes a man get a way a hole in the lining  the material  that time they're going to buy before the war in normal time  it costs maybe 2 000 slotas and 2 000 slotas was a lot of money.
PS  his father was a printer with the pre -war Social Democratic newspaper.
Because the Germans needed Holland in the First War  that's where the Kaiser ended up.
What can you tell me about your life before the war?
He reads everything  he talks second World War  and -- all the time  and he now has written -- he wanted us to read this during our party  but we didnt because we had to translate this  and it wasnt quite appropriate.
But this is different kind of trust  during the war  where your life is in danger  you know  or your future.
Uh over...when we came to Lublin  actually the war was still going on.
His staff was -- his office staff  which was concerned  of course with wholesale textiles  was a-accustomed to service the members of the league of war orphans  widows  and people who had b een injured in the war.
I dont know about th e future wars  but in the past wars  the one I know of  which is the first and the second World Wa r  the minute the rumor of war starts  leather becomes gold.
My grandparents died during the war  and so Jewish life really centered around the synagogue and so forth.
I had a brother who was five and a half years older than me and in the beginning of the war  he got sick and due to bad conditions  he could not be properly diagnosed.
So  there was a tremendous wedding  all my si sters had tremendous weddings except me  and their only son  Menek  survived the war.
He married after the war  I was married just when the war started.
The us Navy had an air base during the war over there.
You know  eight year old boy  I mean  what did I know about war?
Did you have mostly Jewish friends  or also not Jewish friends?
They...they were  before the war they were using that for building roads and so.
I was convinced  and Im must then  when I started on this  and remain convinced today  that after the experience of World War I  which was most unpleasant for all concerned  winners and losers  there was no one else on the face of the globe who was going to start another World War  than the Germans.
So Did you have any other relatives that you left behind in Germany?
is first English self -taught Interview with Wies 51 May 23  2019 or basically There was everything helpful until the -- many tim e in my life   uman think coming from the training during the war and after the war and ba lancing acts which we had to all of the time  whom to trust  to what and how to build relationships and friendships and how to value real relationships  the real friendships.
It had been a hard war  and people were tough  and employers were tough.
And second one was a book called  ﬁRecollections of My Life as a Diplomat ﬂ [recites title of book in Polish]  written by Yandro Hoyofski   he was a Polish diplomat with an extremely complicated life because he was sort of politically involved from the time before the first war and through the 30s and into the war years  and he was mixed in with the Polish government in exile in London  while at the same time he was more or less free to travel to Poland and -- and become a part of the later government  communist government  and ended up as an ambassador in Mexico   which of course was a plum job to -- given to people who deserve it.
Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war?
>> Bill Benson: The full force of the war and the Holocaust would not hit your community  in Hungary  until 1944.
I would say  okay  the war was over  it was June  right?
Did your family think -- Oh everybody -- everybody are afraid to war  if somebody know what mean the war.
And I was often amazed how looking at them  how childish they were  you know  here they and and when I think what I was like at that age  thats when I realized what the war had done to me.
But he did  and so immediately after the war  a law came out in Poland that if there is a parent and there is a child that survived  they have to be united.
Did you know what was taking place in Germany  especially once the war began?
Thats the worst thing that happened in Gusen during the war.
I did have chance to punish them after the war  the father of Wanda was tried  he was in jail  he was found that he killed some Jewish people and she probably didn't kill  she was the woman  but she certainly was cruel to me and I could have hurt them if I testify th at I remember something of them killing Jews and you know I could not.
The rest of the time we went to the.... People coming in from Ukraine  you know they escape from the war  so we went over there to the sea.
End of Tape One  Side A USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 15 Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak  this is tape one  side B. You described in your video interview  returning to Hoost and rejoining with your family there and that you were immediately put into a ghetto.
Thats an interesting thing we learned over over the we sort of picked up as we went through the war and interrogation techniques that they didnt teach us in school.
I could have told him the differenc e between German indu stry and American industry because German industry was his enthus iastic partner for a decade before he ever started his wars  whereas in th e United States  even after Pear l Harbor  Franklin Roosevelt had to bribe our businesses to convert to war production by way of tax breaks and tax incentives.
He spoke Polish without a Jewish accent  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 8 correct grammar  ever -- he spoke -- now  as a matter of fact  if sometimes they had to send a delegation to the Polish peep -- to the go vernment or something  my father went as a spokesman  because on account of his language.
And so some guardia civil  33 you know  the Napoleon guy with an old musket that must have been from the 1870 war  he says ﬁAlto!ﬂ and then he put us in a little  local jail and there they kept us for another day without feeding because everybody wanted us to sell  to give our watches  etcetera  against food.
So I was in the navy for the duration of the war  but but we were classified as enemy aliens.
I do want to bring out another thing  and I know I'm jumping now  this is already 30 after the war ended  I was liberated by the Russians  by the Soviet Union soldiers.
After the war  when did you make contact again with your friend Ann Price -- Ann Green?
And -- And thats why I -- I never went back to -- to Warsaw after the war.
So I was up there until the end of the war.
The story came out that on the 2nd of February  which I always remember for other reasons too  this was the time that Stalingrad was taken over by the Soviets  this was the first German defeat and was a change in th e war  I didnt know then what  all I knew is that on the 2nd of February  the night of the 2nd of February  my parents and my older sister and Menek were sitting in another part of th e ghetto by then  in their room  all dressed.
And there we cleaned the street and  and -- till the one day came that all the Jewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to Pole.
And so -- And maybe my previous experience  my very brief experience at the end of the war  maybe that had something to do with it  I dont know  but at any rate  I decided that I wanted to become a physician.
I came back -- Purim is approximate early in spring  and the war was still raging in Berlin.
The ...the war paid... Everybody paid a great fee in this war.
So she took this too...this German woman until she returned after the war to me.
Some survived that they went to Russia; they managed to get there.
And this -- this was before I started elementary school  so it was really pretty soon after th e war that she showed me those.
No  this was th-this was a a thing that the Germans didnt know what to do with this  because on the 18  the pressure of allies in the west  exerted on the German government  forced the Germans to take all the AK people as allied army  and this was treated as the prisoners of war.
And I think he was from a very nice family and he travel very much before the war.
ﬂ By the time some Russian or someone occupier would end the war.
When the Germans came in -- >> Bill Benson: Just a couple more questions before we turn to the Germans coming in.
Well  this is made by...it was made during the war by George Hensen.
And the German quota was unders ubscribed because during the war  obviously did not come to the United States.
And she did the best she could  and we did go to Hebrew school.
And my understanding of that situation was that the most virulent collaborators and traitors of World War II  who had been sentenced to death or long jail period or even li fe sentence  through amnesty and so forth  all of a sudden were back in the streets.
Once you were in the Ural mountains  what happened after the war Well  when the war finished  everybody started you know  they didnt need any more workers in the in the you kn ow  th-they so everybody started going home  and took us months and months of walking and catching rides  and and and So  you had no train transportation  you was all on your own energy?
They had special teams on each regiment cal led interrogation of prisoners of war.
So this was Interview with Jan Hieminga August 9  2016 28 So I was never in the war.
Id like to talk more about that later  but just keeping with the pre-war or the war time -- Yeah.
And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War  which was -- they sent me to Germany  which was a good place to be during the Korean War.
Well  the Jewish community of Shanghai which I came into and this was already uh this was right after the war  the Joint Distribution Committee and uh of of the Jewish people heard about their Shanghai ghetto...well first of all  how did we become a ghetto?.
I saw that there was a program on  on World War II.
5 I I you know  I dont know if its an original memory  or or you know  pictures and stuff  but I seem to remember or or stories that my mother told  but I seem to remember very well  when when the war started that he he was putting us on a train  that we were leaving Sarny for the Russian you know  that the deeper into Russia  I seem to remember him waving goodbye.
indecipherable] invaded Austria  occupied Austria -- But there was no war. --
I dont know  this -- this is what happened then  during the war.
And then of course and of course the ca the concern whether Lithuania could become still be ne neutral when such a gr-great war is starting around.
But did it have a sense for you because of all your aunts and uncles being there who had survived  and even t hough you were a child then  did it have any sense of continuance  and we -- of surviving  peopl e having survived the war.
And then the war came anyway  so she lived for 30 years with this gall bladder.
And after the war  particularly after meeting American soldiers  and many of them Jewish  I was surprised actua lly to hear that there was large scale antisemitism in this country and that the influe nce of these Jews was a relatively minimal.
He had been  he had become a Fritz Schnaittacher 21 [Date not labeled] Page 21 prisoner of war so he wasn't back yet  but his wife was back and I helped her out with some money.
Before we turn to the war years which began with Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939 followed by their attack on Paris  on France  in May of 1940  let's start first with you telling us what you know about your parents  your family  their life before the war began.
And she came  like  three weeks -- she came three days before the war broke out  the last minute.
They went through the war also  but they were furriers before the war.
When you and Frances and Sylvia would be together in the apartment  would you talk about your parent s and life before the war?
But it Did did you ever I mean  it sounds to me that all of these things youre telling me  you learned after the war.
Uh...They...in a farm house  and the people took pity on him and he stayed there all through the war in Lithuania  and then went back to Kaunas and he got married and my brother brought them to Israel and he just died about 2 years ago.
And the -- there is a monument they put up themselves  place it is sa -- they say 345 Jews were buried there.
Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15  2010 100 So  was this So this was because I had to  in the evening of the day of the beginning of the war  I had to go to the party.
And no -- no  Horowicz store was already just before war.
And that's how four of us spent the ending of the war.
Because  for cigarettes and coffee you could get anything you wa nted after the war.
How they s -- made vodka  I have no idea  but somebody got -- knew how to do it and they -- and it was a barter economy at the end of the war.
Before the war  before 1939  there were 80 000 Jews in Vilna.
But the civil Russian popula-- government in every community  including Kovno and Vilijampolis  disintegrated within a half a day of the first outbreak of the war  which was the night of June 21st  1941.
15 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: To get taken care of what you had to?
Then she told me that after the war I can find her  which I will tell you what I did after the war.
Im reading now a book about it also  from dur-during the war  and when I saw Molotov I rem or Kora Stalowka   this was a place where we were  the the little enclave like a few barracks and on one side were the woods  with lions or with tigers and whatever.
Other letters that I have in ghetto slang  that reveals the panic there  which in fact Im gonna write now a article about postal history from the g-ghe tto during the war  it reveals the pain and the suffering of the Jewish people.
Before we talk about that  lets just talk a little bit about more about before the time before the war started.
A nd to the end  you know  I couldn't...couldn't see any other way out but to come back to Kovno  and when I came back to Kovno  two days later... The invasion... The invasion...German...German war break out and so as I said yesterday  I went from the from the pot to the to the fire.
So  when you were with these folks  you never talked about the war?
But we were lucky because the war all of a sudden made us into allies.
Did you ever consider the possibility of of going to Palestine?
So all our documents were changed and my mother's maiden name was given Kossouth  what is a typical Hungaria n name and it was given in this goal so that if someone was asking during the war  \ Oh  you look somewhat strange  you look Jewish  you have so black hair\  I was telling immediately  \ Oh  ye s  I have black hair because my grandmother was Hungarian  you k now.
Because of the war we could not go into France or Germany  so we were stuck.
The war started  I was almost -- slightly older than 1 year old.
Then on the 18th of June 1940  said France did not lose the war  France lost the battle.
I mean I realize you know How aware were you of the war?
Yeah  we would play  and do a lot of things together  in the in the winter  around Christmastime  we would they would they had they wouldnt they would and its again  the war  the war mentality.
There was I know of many people who many I knew a few people who did go back  who Well  but this was quite a bit after the war.
You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war?
And having been totally inexperienced in the  not just the art of questioning  but what kind of information we wanted to have  I got the most important strategic information  how to end the war within a matter of days.
How we got there And so now the war is over?
An d I'm thinking of back from before the war end.
Wher e di -- where did you go -- oops -- where did you go right after the war  when the American occupation [indecipherable] 100 Well  once the American occupation came in  of course we could go move wherever we wanted to.
And once -- special in 1941  when America went into war after Pearl Ha rbor  we celebrated  this is the end of the war.
Remember  May 22nd  the war ended May eighth a year earlier.
I assumed that I would go into the Army immediately when the War broke out  and I tried to get into diffe rent branches.
Before you tell us about your life during the Holocaust  why don't you tell us first a little bit about your family  your community  and your self in the years before the war living in Kozienice.
But did woul d you have gone if there had been a state of Israel  you think?
We heard bombings  we heard the noises of war  but we stay ed in our apartment and one or two days later  I think was that they came in and took a ll the men out  I think Sam may have told you about this and took them to what the Soviets call the   the Pa lace of Culture and there  I 12 believe that  I was sure that I'll never see Sam agai n  but he has told you that   that he managed to get away from there.
Was it important for you to talk about -- t-to ment -- did you talk about at all  about your war experience  or did you -- did you not  to people?
Did you ever  in those early years  did you ever feel that there was anti-Semitism?
She was born in 1906 so if the war was from 1943 t o '45 she was over 40 or close to 40 and anybody who got typhus died over 40 because of the high consistent fever for 15 to 16 days and whatever.
That victory in St alingrad had special meaning for me because it really was the turning point as most histor ians say of the war in Russia  but also the turning point of belief in what was coming among those people who had to survive...the remaining Jews.
And and three of those si blings  all boys  escaped to the United States in before the beginning of the second war or the first Wo rld War.
But I was already out of the war for several months at this point.
Did you sense that before the war  there wa Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 39 Before the war?
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 127 No  that is during the war.
Were there any commemorative events  for even ts that had taken place during the war  such as the Warsaw ghetto uprising  for example?
Well  that was during the war  and I figure well  after the war -- he figured the -- that the war is finished  that they dont keep their mouth shut  because they were Nazis  and anti-Semites  probably.
And she was so deathly ill when the war -- war ended  that the Swedish Red Cross was taking all these terribly sick people up to Sweden.
The Russian planes were started flying over the area and there was bombing.
And I went  and we told the people to to the Polish town I dont know  Hrubieszow Hrubieszow  or what  and the and mine cous in lived over mine cousin – A2: There was a story during the war  Mommy  where they caught you with a blanket  with a Polish blanket?
It was the first time  actually  when I -- and later on when we already left the -- during the war  went to Pinsk  and Russians came to Pinsk  that was a first -- you know  this region of Poland was occupied by Russian.
Undoubtedly we will be killed there or starve to death or they will kill us or we will die as a result of the civil war theyre in.
I should just say for the record here that in your video testimo ny and then in the audio interview that I did with your husband the other day he told the story of how you lost your younger brother and he was tricked and the whole thing with the phony resort and that after the war  as far as you knew that he had not survived.
Actually  what they did  it was -- at that time it was right after the first war -- war  and of course I was not there and dont rememb er anything of that  just by stories.
So when Eichmann came to Theresienstadt  to   shortly before the end of the war  ten days or twelve days befo re the Russians entered  he all of a sudden find uh found Leo Beck there  and he was absolutely flabbergaste d and in the words of Leo Beck he said  Leo Beck.
Okay  lets talk now about the beginning of the war  do you remember the very beginning and -- Everything I remember.
During the war  there were -- my mother a nd I would go to these things.
Then a year before the war  I came -- I -- I got married.
And -- And the people who survived the second World War were not looked upon as heroes  they were looked upon as cowards  and as sheep who went to slaughter  this was the public imag e. And -- And thats not what they wanted to transmit to their youth.
We never thought its going to star t a war over there.
In the meantime we were in Paris and I became ill because you know  lack of nourishment and you know  being run down from the war and I contracted pleurisy and I was very ill for three months.
My father was very proud to have fought in the first World War as an Austrian -- I think he was a captain or a lieutenant or something like that  and he had many decorations.
And of course  that was in 1960– it was 1970  which would have been twenty-five years after she went to Isr ael  after the war was over.
What was it that -- that made you realize the war was ending soon?
And I saw people like me...there was no men  only women and childre n  because older men were in the war.
Uh there's another stor y of uh which was given by Professor deYoung  who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from Holland  and he was a young man and and and the government of exile in Holland during World war II  and was in charge of radio emissions  and he gets hold of some of my reports  and he reports in a lecture he gave in Washi ngton...no  in Harvard  some time ago  and uh tells the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of Holland  .
>> Bill Benson: Then he had to get you out of there.
One of the terrible things [for] which I will never forgive myself -- was the last days before the war broke out  there was a Zionist Congress in Geneva.
Oceans apart and that they're leading a reasonably normal life in a war time-- Yeah.
As a matter of fact  also after the war we found out about him  that he  when they took us  and this was -- can I go on?
They changed  because Hungary was starting to get slowly out of the war.
That is something  that is some of the worst  she should have been done away with  preferably hanged immediately after the war.
I always loved my wife and my children  but I couldn't show because anything that you got close to in the war  you lost.
But in the next town  in Cz (c.461)  there is one fami ly who survived the war.
And so the sides from Russia was freed already  they see -- because theyre free  because we were in ‚44 freed and the war ended in ‚45.
We were called displaced persons  DPs as they called them  they called us after the war.
Because I figured out exactly and precisely  if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin  I would have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my properties.
And we were sitting at the table  and talking about the war and everything with some of my sister's friends.
Do you remember once the war had started  did were there any new restrictions  like were there blackouts  or rationing?
So  you know  so And they remained in Germany throughout the rest of their lives  or did they Yeah  they remained in Germany.
And for most people  probably  I mean you cant  I havent tried it  but any time you would talk to any German about it then they would immediately tell you how bad it was during the war with ration cards and bombs falling on your head and all that and people tell you how bad it was to shut you up.
And before the war and after the war starting to publish only war  German what you call communiques about the war.
Did you start going to the synagogue again after the war?
In Warsaw   our house and our apartment survived the uprising and the war.
And so  there were actually more than 4 000  I didnt know that til after the war.
Second war was a totally different thing  because it wasnt just that they were bombing civilians  but it was -- it came to pass that they were exterminating people for being Jewish.
And Can I just ask you about that part of England.
Well  thats something different  because if th ere was an Israel before the Second World War  before– this probably  I mean the Holocaust pr obably never would have happened.
He was a French citizen  he served in the French Army before.
For that school year   I had to learn Lithuanian and Lithuanian history.
And when they went they went in war with Germany  a a [indecipherable] there were he he was afraid of the Jewish population because in those days th e Jews were friendly with the Germans  Interview with A. Zalc  L. Ragin  J. Mizrachi July 23  2009 4and they spoke Yiddish  which is an an old German.
Was that– will you say something about your relationship after the war?
But after the war  I went everywhere you can imagine here.
Did you have  were all of your friends Jewish at the time?
>> George Pick: We found out after the war  what happened is the very first next morning that particular building was surrounded by Nazis.
At this point in  in 1945  did you  had you realiz ed what had happened to the Jews of Europe as a whole?
I was laid up in hospital and when the war broke out  I was in the hospital.
I -- I dont want to call myself a -- a student of the Korean War  but I -- I feel that -- I -- I think we made a mistake getting involved in the first place.
It became big after the 1st World War  has beautiful parks  boulevards.
In the beginning we could know if we had enough money or not for th e duration of the war.
And then a year later  this was 1939  when the Germans came in.
And Hitler wi ll start a war  he was only waiting for an opportunity.
And I understand he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp  and he stayed in Czechoslovakia  Romania  every time theres a war  and every time they divide the country  it becomes another country.
He lived 20 years after the war in a little town as a doctor.
Do you remember that person from before the war  or Yes.
Q. Did you know anything about the camps at that time?
When the war started  and then when you made that walk  you were going to go enlist to fight.
I was prepared that maybe they would put me into a -- into labor for some war effort or something.
Actually  Lithuania  just going back  became independent in 1918 after the first World War.
Those of you who prove them selves  will have a place in the new Europe  which was Hitlers slogan for what was going to come after the war  and those that dont  well  beware.
I think everyone hoped that the war would be finished in one year.
If in your mind you have the question  How did they know you were Jewish?
I remember that when I was evacuated to Chichester after the war had started  Auntie Elsie sold my cl othes  and all I got from these beautiful garmentswhich actually I think I never wore againwere three pairs of black woollen stockings which I detested but which were part of our school uniform and I had to wear.
What did you know about Hitler and what was happening in Germany before the war?
No  everybody was saying well  the war is going to be short  dont worry.
I remember these officer s in white uniforms boarding the ship  and satisfying themselves that this was a refugee sh ip  and you know  not a transport ship helping the German war effort.
You know  I'm a little confused about prisoners of -- German prisoners of war that were huddled together in trucks and they were carried  they were driven away from where they were captured and prisoners of -- and concentration camp prisoners with the striped uniforms in trucks.
Did people in the Army with you know that you were Jewish?
Did you practice when you pr acticed medicine  did you meet people who called themselves survivors  who went through the war?
And by that time the Nazis instituted thing s. They instituted for Jews something called forced labor.
When did you hear that the war had ended  and how did you hear about it?
It was just a -- the war just -- Started in 39. --
Oh yes  my sister  my sweet little sister  she was a baby two months old when the war broke out and my mother and I always took care of her.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 My grandfather wasn't.
How long did you stay in Russia after the war was over  before you went back to Poland?
Q. Before we get do that  I want to hear a little bit more about the Ghetto.
The war was ending with the Germans  and they were rushing to bring this last group and do the final solution  the genocide  on this remaining group.
Well  I want to take this opportunity right now to thank you for sharing your views  for sharing your experiences  and your story of what your life was like before and during the war.
Do you think that you would have been a different person today  if you hadn't gone through the war  that Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 84 Yeah.
It is titled  and forgive my pronunciation  I will do my best  \ A dimanche prochain: Memoir of Survival in World War II France.\
Once I was on my own again  and later with the priest and working for the Polish peasants  as of November '43 going to east Prussia with new Polish documen ts and Polish catholic until the end of the war  I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people.
She has seen -- many people had seen a cross on the sky oral like this because my mother spent the first war  she had the experience and she said  \ No  never in our life a second war.\
It's very important for you  maybe also for us  but what's more important is you have stopped to do it and everybody who is in a certain age \  he tell them  \ You have to come and to work very  very urgent  because Germans demand I don't know how many thousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort.\
What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war?
And he wrote him as soon as the war broke out.
And the Cold War is still going on  so what allowed Holzmans amendment to actually be passed when people still had a very -- I dont know  shall we call it a rigid view  or at least a Cold War view of eastern European countries under the Soviet Union?
Bu t anyway  this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley took a -- pictures of this room with all the mask  with the colored light  and so we had a jolly good laugh at that time  and reali zed that the war was really over  we could talk about it.
Where they were located and -- and factories where -- where they manufactured war materials  where they were trying to -- to build an A bomb and things like that.
I guess during the war a lot of people want to save themselves and their families  so whoever want to be militiamen  he felt that he can save his family being transported out that fast.
And I became a fanatical history buff only about World War II and particularly the Holocaust.
Iasi was already better organized and the war itself was covered in the newspapers and the German army would drive through every day  every week  with more enforcement at night  we would hear them rumble by.
I was wondering if you could start by describing the town that you lived in  pre -war life.
However  that didn't help them after the Austro -Hungarian Empire lost the war.
So I had private lessons  first in French for many years.
So we saw them already when the first moviehouses were opened up in Berlin; or I would say the war was over in May  and by June and July  they had the first moviehouses  and there were newsreels.
>> Bill Benson: When did you learn about what happened to your parents?
She used to work as a cashier in a bakery before the war.
When was it that you saw when did Sanok when did the war come to Sanok?
And sometimes they took them to work  you know  to make the uniforms for the Germans.
or from partisans or from war -- or hohomeless pe -- when we came was [indecipherable] cause the German -- German population lived there  and they left.
But the war was already known that it's lost from the Germans.
But Hungarian laws were passed in the '20s after First World War but not r eally enforced until much later  maybe 10  12 years later in the late '30s.
When war over  my parents got a room and my father returned from army 1945.
We worried a bout our parents a lot  and  of course  there was no contact at all from March 1942 until after the war when my sister went back and found out that there was no one left.
I think you said you were 11 when -- When the war start I was 11.
By the way  the German doctor was hiding 20 years after the war.
The war was a very difficult time for everyone in England.
And I know of what transpired after the war about the U.G.I.F and how close they were with the Germans  because they knew of the German work as it took place.
>> Bill Benson: He sent a couple of his children to the United States before the war.
So the situation turned generally grim  but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening  and some hope started to -- to come up  that the Germans are going to be defeated  and the war is going to be turned around.
If you were to meet a German on the street today  would you be uncomfortable?
And when World War I broke out  his brothers insisted he come back to Germany.
And I remember this doctor  who was a dentist of mine  who I used to go with my pitten there to her during -- before the war.
I all the time curious  was all the time curious  politician  when the war broke out in Spain  I followed all the time  everything when  when the Germans went to Czechoslovakia.
And they put us in big  like war not warehouses  you co uldnt call it some some maybe old shops that they didnt have anything to sell  but the Right.
R: You know  after the war  which is reallyŠ for children  I think  the hardest partŠ this is like another Holocaust starting or use– Thats how I look at it.
So that's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out  and that's what had stopped afterwards.
This was already two years after the war  was still -- was still USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 59 occupied.
But in Berlin  it was  of course  for me  for a Swede never having been out in war and all that  it was quite a new situation  all that.
Did you th ink about this ending and the war ending?
He is still up to his eyeballs in the -- in th at international criminal court and the acceptance of aggression as a war crime and up and up and up.
No  he came from Poland  from Lodz  just before the war.
When the war broke out  did you volunteer  or were you drafted?
I was a month in the military school and I came out I was a sergeant and I was a commander of a cannon.
In '39 just before the war was declared  about a we ek before the war -- there was a government appealed to all the people from Metz who could afford to leave  to leave because we were so close to the border.
Was it hard to live up to that ideal after the war ended?
Now they were out in the open too  but my father wasn't working and so their story was a more difficult one than ours  and so they had continual contact with [Pinkstrum ]  the one who gave us the false papers  and he again 12 throughout the war continued to help us make up stories supporting my parents' stories and so on so that if we had had one NSB--which was the Nazi...which was the Nazi support group in Holland.
And just to back up  do you remember wh ere you were when the war actually ended?
I dont know how it happened  after the war I wrote a letter to some German office  mentioning that we had Sharfuhrer Frenzel  who was very brutal  and he lived in this c ity  which has the word lerver and berg or borg.
We woke up and on the radio we heard Hitlers voice.
They took  as a matter of fact  Monte Cassino  and when the war was over  they were occupying Italy.
And the second year -- that was 1941  '42 -- since life was -- was more normal  I went back to a school -- not in Paris  but in   which is about 32  35 kilometers outside of Paris  where I went during the first year of the war -- from 1939.
The American soldiers took them in prison on the war  so we became very good friends.
QL Would you like to discuss then about wh at happened to your family when -- in 1939 when the war broke out?
SL: Well  before the war  the relation between the Jews and the Gentiles was very good.
02:16:47 And this again was due to the fact that Germany was losing the War.
And they were into Protestant school and there was me and another Jewish girl in the class  but no   not really.
These are wonderful memories of that the house  as storied during the war  how it survived and didnt and so on.
Before we turn to the actual war years  let s start with you telling us about your family and yourself in those early ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 years  what it was like living under Nazi power as the power before the war.
And he inte rpreted it as saying that now that the war is obviously lost  that fanatical Nazi is sort of becoming -- going out of his mind  losing his mind.
Then they came in and they took all your silver (cough) so that there were a lot of things that my parents  I am sure  had to give away  but I am also sure that my mom  or my parents may have hidden some things  because I know that in the beginning of the war we were able to get some extra food 6 in the house.
And I have a feeling that he respected the man as the leader of his country and I believe he always did and I don't believe he ever changed his mind   through the en d of the war.
So even while we lived in the war zone for a half a year they continued to take care of us.
I dont know if she was in touch with them before the war  but after the war  I mean  she came through with sending care packages.
Then  later on  of course  after we were ma rried  after I came back from Europe  from my one-year stint with the Army  which was in 1966  that is when everything started  especially the Vietnam War flared up.
On the other hand  you couldn't go into many street  and I have many memo ries of standing uh I do have a memory of for instance at one time and that was also maybe a ha lf a year after the war broke out  uh standing in front of the main street in our city  which was ca lled  became Hitler Strasse  but it was the street of the Third of May  which is when the Poles had a national holiday  and it was a beautiful street with  with many trees.
But inside of me I always  yes  I ha ve to live through that war.
In Belgium when there was an inter-marriage  they did not touch the Jews and I spent the last few months of the war in Brussels  when I say in hiding...I walked the streets.
Many were very sympathetic to the whole idea of Hitler and we re very supportive of him all the way through  certainly when they thought they were going to win the war.
>> Kyra Schuster: So U.S. wasn't engaged in World War II yet.
It was in the school  and even when I used to give deposition the first time th at I gave deposition  this was in the orphanage after the war  that I was [indecipherable].
Of cour se  we spoke Polish at home  and -- and then during the war I learned a little Hebrew and Italian because I was in Italy.
Did you hear about the war in other places in Europe for instance?
I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is  is hard to say  because at this point in the 1990s after living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish  I think  is so rusty that he didnt use it.
Before we turn to the horrors of the war and the Holocaust  tell us  first  about your parents and their lives and their community in the pre -war years  a little bit a bout them.
And its of some significance too  she also worked for the War Crimes Commission.
We thought that perhaps this was a -- a -- a temporary prob -- you know  thing that the Germans were -- were revenged themselves because of the Versailles Treaty of the first World War  you know  because they felt they were mistreated by the allies  and -- and they trying to use the Jews as scapegoats  and of course that -- and theres always this history of Jewish persecution and -- and sc -- so there was this mixed feeling because -- because th e feeling was that the Germans with that high culture  with that -- with a tremendous contribution to civilization  how could they possibly be -- be prone to -- to -- to -- to do that  you know  to really try to destroy a people.
Do you know if when you were born in the year the war began and Naziism and Hitler in power  if your parents  do you know if they felt worried about the future at that time  bringing you into their lives?
We were the first displaced persons to arrive in the United States after World War II.
If there was some hope  I knew a war was going on  but whether they are going to succeed  whether we are going to be liberated  that doesn't come to our mind  that didn't come to our mind.
What attempts did your parents make to find family and friends after the war?
So  this picture was taken before the war  before the Ghetto.
In normal circumstances  I would remember more about the war  or knew about  but it was so many things that happened  that you dont know whats im portant  whats not important  if you remember.
No  well  had they had that stands  but they had to sell it during the war  because my fathers salary was so inadequate  it lasted only for five days of the month  the rest of the time my mother had to bring in food  and and and sell it on the black market.
While  before the war  I was courting a young doctor--a sister of my very good friend.
Bill Benson: Tell us about her -- at the end of the water  you were liberated in the summer of '44 but the war went on  of course  until May of '45.
But anyhow -- >> Bill Benson: You stayed there until March 1945.
Interview with Gert Silver March 30  2006 107 Do you think that your effects  the effects of the war  the experiences that you endured  do you think that that has had an effect on you as a parent bringing up children in Australia ?
And what we were doing there basically -- this was of course at the height of the -- of Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27  2001 33Cold War  were the -- human rights was not something -- human rights was basically used in many quarters just as a propaga nda tool  one way or the other.
How would she have known about that so early in the war  okay?
And he said to him  \ So you're no t an American  where were yo u during the war?\
But then Austri a lost the war and there were a lot of unemployed people   so where ever there  the Socialists  saw that it's going to be better  so they were Socialists  and they set the Parliament on fire once  long before Hitler and then they said  okay when we have Hitler  we'll be happy  we'll live happy ever afte r because they were poor  they had no jobs and the women of course  the Viennese are terrible.
Now youre working and you stayed there until the end of the war.
>> Ronald Coleman: You mentioned the story of your grandparents and their fate.
And during the whole war  she always was very nice to us.
And those traumas caused me to more or less  she has a fear of I had Id swing my bra my arms around and and yell  because I was having those traumas  I was a prisoner of war.
And I remember that they prepared the hospital across the street from where we lived for wounded soldiers but before everything was really settled in our mind that this was war  the war was over and the Germans had taken over Holland.
But in Russia you have to know how to live because people were dying in the street... you know  with the war.
When the war started  we lived in our house then later we went to the ghetto.
And -- and ulti -- mayb -- I wanted to prove to myself  after the war  that I am -- I am a decent human being  and Im better than -- than most of them.
And we had Russian prisoners  and you know  all kinds of prisoners walked alongside of us .
He was very much in favor of helping the underdog  and you should see the testimony he got from French men after the war.
And that wa -- thats the reason people now  ask me do you  you know  whatever  and what was his name during the war  you know -- oh  you know  something entirely different.
You know  but then  see  by that point in the war  I already knew  there were enough rumors coming back  that 49 we kind of knew what was happening.
We knew there was a war on  we were thankful the war had started.
It was interesting when we first came to America -- this was almost a couple years before Pearl Harbor  but only -- we arrived here 30 days  directly 30 days after the war in Europe broke out.
So the Quakers were asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now 41.
But I made it to the Jewish hospital which existed all during the war  thats wa -- the hospital was located at the Iranischestrasse.
But na -- I didnt understand exactly why England  for example and United States were supporting Chetniks at the beginning of the war.
So he got together with the doctor who was educated in Vienna  a perfect German -- b ecause Drohobycz  before World War II -- World War I  was Austra -Hungary.
>> Bill Benson: Now your mom  your brothers and sister and you.
Some of them died because of the war activities but many of them died because of the inhumane circumstances they were in.
The situation in Poland  even before the war  was getting a little tough for being a Jew  for the Jews.
And but thats but I knew about Auschwitz immediately what because the first day  that first day that they war was over  they started rounding up Polish intelligentsia and shipping them off.
Yeah  and there was a meeting of the Holocaust survivors from all over the world.
You know Im used to te lling the story to my six -year old son and of course to my six- year old son I have to include what happened during the war.

>> Bill Benson: We're not going to have time to hear about September 1944 when the families reunited  Paris is liberated  but the war would continue until May 1945 and so they continued to live in war -like conditions  scarcities  and then  of course  had to establish a new life and begin over again.

Anyway  that was the tragic story of one of our people  and uh when you go on the war front and you uh you shoot it out with the melise or the Germans  that's a quick thi ng.
I am a veteran of World War I. And it's a good possibility that the Nazis will not punish the veterans  the German veterans  of World War I.\  To make a long story short  they did marry.

From my one and only aunt that came to the United States just before the war and pictures from her and making copies whatever I can get  anything and as many pieces of information I'm able to collect from the couple of surviving members of the family and it's basically genealogy but I am not going back very far because right now I'm not well  but I want to do this for those of my  members of my family who were killed and even those few who survived and I would like this  to give this for my children  who did not know their aunts  uncles  grandparents or cousins  so that they will know their family  at least through these pictures and whatever information I can gather and write down for them.
During the war we ate mostly potatoes  and carrots and rutabaga and those root vegetables.
So  my mother met there people that she knew from before the war that they had already an apartment there and they recommended a small apartment on Lubartovska 18 in Lublin.

Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 38 When -- do you have any memories of the time when the war was over in Holland?

So she wrote the whole essay like a script  as her being in a war  age of 13.
We had some 3 500 accused that had been denounced in the war crimes case at Dachau.
But then came  you know  a -- a -- a situation which I still dont rem -- I remember  but I dont comprehend  is that people were ev -- you know  evacuating from Belgium to France   even though like in the first World War  you know  they wanted distance.
Before the war  all the communist party in Poland was not legal.
I had -- you know  I tried  but I began to see that the anti-Fascism that I grew up with  and also the 34 reference to the Communist after World War One  were bad too  but it was so remote.
In the meantime  I gave birth to my boy and I didn't know it was already after the war when I gave birth.
at that time  and my father was born in Limbeck   Poland  and he came to -- came to Austria and he went to business school  and then he got this job -- I mean  he -- he served in a -- he was -- he was a prisoner of the Russians during World War I  and then he came out  decided to work for my grandfather  and eventually hard work pays off.
And after the war  we found out he got special honors for killing Germans.
BZ: Oh  unquestionably  unquestionably and that's all understandable  but Cold War politics or no  in my ken  that game should not have been played with thes e sentences  in the fashion in 61 which it was played  because I don't think it was ne cessary.
And they were brought to um  I don't know  they were brought to prison  I know  but when they found out that his wife was  was pregnant  they sent her home  and the others  Joe came to Dachau  and that  from then on he lived through the whole war in Dachau.
In some ways you know if I would have stayed in Germany  no war  no Nazis  or nothing I would have had a very nice house  I would have gone to the university.
Were talking now begi nning of June  okay  and war didnt -- took place in September.
Did your parents -- they continued in Athens after the war?
Did he find out very quickly about your war years  or did it take you a few years to be able to tell him as well?
And he was born in this country  but fortly before the war  his mother came back to Slovakia  his father was still here.
Well  when after the war  when only my brothe r and I survived  she was real upset when we told her were going to try and go to America.
I mean ob -- obviously his family came from -- fr -- came from -- was expelled in the -- at the end of the war.
Now  prior to 1939  what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and Germany?
Let's go back then to the time the war actually began  in 1939 in Poland.
So by 1919  when the war ended  they -- my gr andfather and his sons  two sons  three sons -- no  two sons -- my grandfather and two sons became wealthy enough from this semi [indecipherable] war time production of leather to acquire the property on Kwizinska 14  which was a factory building.
Were coming to certainly  as far as the large picture is concerned  Germany is now losing the war.
And simply  they were too young to have had first hand experience with the Nazis or Jews  because they grew up under normal conditions  with the exception of -- of -- of the war years.
And much of the literature on the war  completely disregards what was about.
So  I said  I will pay you back after the war is over.
Hoffman  and apparently he was only a medic  he was not a doctor  we found out after the war.
I  I was  later I learned one of them was the infamous Dr. Mengele  uh  though it was already a couple of years into the war  they looked very well-fed  almost elegant in their uniforms  and uh  this SS officer asked certain questions  about your age  about your occupation  about your state of health  and then with his hand  with his thumb  I would sa y  move to left or to the right  which means  uh  to the right was life  to the left was death.
And my brother was prepared to go  but then there came the war and he couldnt.
Thats not the same anti-Semitism that frightened my pare nts and the Jews before the war  or even after the war  in the first years after the war.
My mother survived the war and we both came to the United States  she passed away in the late 90s.
But imagine  if the war will be over a nd the Germans are losing  so they won't...they won't remember the SS.
Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 115 Its not not for us  the war did not stop there  even for somebody we could choose to go out of Warsaw as a prisoner or war  or as a civilian.
But that was all part of -- of the -- that was the last big epis ode that -- we had some casualties obviously  but then the war came to an end.
sometimes and it is like she was the only one who worked in the underground  but so many people -- but many people talk about it that didn't do anything during the war.
And the victory of that war  in my personal opinion  electrified the American people.
Did you have an understanding or what was your understanding of what the war was about?
I have taught the Holocaust as a part of modern Europe   modern German  and World War II history as long as Ive taught  starting  ironically  back in 1954.
And I -- I -- and it -- I dont even by -- that -- tho -- the p -- the -- the occurrence of the war mellowed her.
You know  I went down to the American Embassy  the old one which was destroyed during the war.
We want to remember that the kind of separations during the war in Europe did not permit you perhaps to separate.
So do you remember hearing that the war ende d while you were in Switzerland?
And then  while we had this feeling  all of us  he starts telling me  \ You know  when the war will come  what will be our destiny?\
But how ironic that they were  that IG Farben had Jews working as slave labor during the war and then you were working– That is right.
Tell me a little bit about your family life before th e war and your town.
You lived in the part of Poland that fell under the Russian occupation.
You were there at a -- when the State of Israel was formed.
And so when you came back after the war From the army  yeah.
I didnt have much religion all during the wa r  and after the war  oh God  I was bitter.
As I mentioned earlier  I remember very clearly  the population among Jews in Greece had been 70 000 before the war  and after the war there were 10 000.
And if I can jump ahead a little bit  when I did the Spielberg interview  it was during the Bosnian war and I had a horrible time because I was watching the news every night and it just brought everything back.
You had mentioned just earlier when you first sa saw these Polish military people  you were walking along  you you how could you tell they were not Polish communists  but they were Polish  London affiliated?
It isnt a little Starachow ice slave labor camp that is kept to produce war machinery  where just soldiers fight each other.
Let's beg in  before we turn to the actual Holocaust and the war  with you telling us a little about your family and their lives prior to the rise of nazism and its impact on your family and your community.
But when it was raining they had their feet in the water which wasn't all that pleasant  particularly during the war when we didn't have any good shoes anyway.
Well  it I was 22 years old and I felt that in the war I made a few decisions which saved my life  and I am not going to stay around.
When the war started we were the first one to be bombed.
No  no  no  that happened in 1946  after the war was already over.
We always have to be thankful for them because we -- now the children  you know  they -- they are aware that they suffered  too  while we were in hiding there  and th e interesting thing is this happened very recently  I got -- for our 50th anniv -- wedding anniversary  we got a letter from the third oldest child  who is really -- I would almost say obsessed with the war.
He was a young Frenchman who as a -- who had survived a war USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 88 younger than I wa -- he was younger than -- you know  about my ag e  I think.
But later  after war when I spoke to her  she said to me that in Lvov they were afraid to keep me because apparently they were in the middle of the town and they were simply afraid.
After all  it was after Worl d War I. The economy wasn't a very good one.
But at one point  for whatever reason  the French authorities froze all the applications and my pa rents remained stateless throughout the war.
That was not benign  that was not -- it was -- first of all  it was war  number one  although you didn't feel it that much.
And after the First World War  my father was in Budapest  same thing.
One during the war  and one after the war -- Right. --
So I started to ask her to tell me about life before the war  what she did before the war.
War began in Europe with the invasion of Poland by the Germans in 1939  September 1  when you were 3.
We used to eat  our group  always together lunch -- eat lunch together  and I used to sit -- mostly there were two girls  with the girls  because there we -- the men were always talking about the war  certain aspect of the war.
She couldn't work as a dentist and after World War II she had to take -- when she became a French national   she had to take a kind of general French culture exam a nd the last exam of dental school.
I know it was a neutral cou ntry  but war is still going on and will continue for almost six months.
So he lived under the -- on the Soviet -- I mean  he was in the Soviet Union for part of the war.
After the war I was malnourished  obviously  but so were th ey.
Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war.
We did it ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 anyhow.
So he changed it -- of course  again  he was not religious  but I remember when we were in Holland in ‚60 or ‚61  he -- we -- the first boy born after the war USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 104 in the Jewish community  was Bar Mitzva hed at 13 and this boy was Harry -- Harry Zeetroon.
Now can you tell us what happened in your earlier life without going into great detail but maybe bringing us up to the time when your activities with regards to the war and the Jewish community began.
If you look at it from the perspective of Vietnam War where in some dozen years our casualties were approaching 60 000  here it would give you an idea of the ferocity of the fighting.
Kerosene - shmeie ph079 in their hair  because we had lice - even before the war - we had lice.
So  to answer  as I just stated  we did know something tragic as war will come  but we did not know when.
What were the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 conditions like there?
And so my father said  \ I'm not going to survive another war  I just  I will not be able to do that\ .
And at as most of us most people know  there was an agreement in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Act   which kind of divided up Poland  you know  be-before the war even started.
So before the war  they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business  like my late father needed for example a loan.
Interview with Henry Stern June 8  2016 53 When did you learn of what had really happened to the Jews of Germany   and the Jews of Europe ?
Vonda was married in ghetto to a guy  and he came back from war -- Oh. --
See  my  this part of the legs  I have very thin legs  and this got frozen  and right after the war they were all purple  just purple  from  because it was frozen  and swollen.
Yeah -- and no  but then  after the war  I became -- I became a -- an announcer -- a speaker on -- on the radio.
And I I became a a pretty good [indecipherable] with a lot of them aster after the war.
When the war was over  and you said y ou had read articles  not on the front page  about what had happened to the Jews .
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your father in his day.
I forgot a lot of my history until I read her -- she and her sister escaped during the war.
Did you talk with your pare nts once you were in the U.S. much about your experiences during the Holocaust?
A couple of years after that  Will was killed in World War II and to this day I still feel very strongly about it.
This was after the war  this was -- During the war  during it -- during?
And th at was the time when they took them to concentration camps.
Im talking about already after the war we were together in France.
S o by the time the war was over  had you decided it was a  God was a terrible God?
Did you talk to your wife about what had -- what your experiences had been during the war  and what had become of your family?
And I must sa y that even today when I think about it  I'm amazed at that  that in  in Europe afte r the war  there were countries that were bare of all those things and countries that just  just had it up the kazoo.
No  I meant -- I dont mean your daughter  I dont mean -- I didn t mean after the war.
My husband always says  ﬁWhat they should do is take the old people to fight the war  instead of the young ones.ﬂ Then it wouldnt last very long.
At the end of the war I had to repo rt to the First French Army at the How did you know it was the end of the war?
But that has nothing to do with the war  I probably would have found it very confin ing if I had you know  if I had gotten from the kind of background I was from  into this kind of milieu  I may have found it very confining anyway.
But the thing was so immense  and yet  they themselves having suffered so much in the b -- bombardment in the second World War  because Monastir was a pla -- a -- a batt leground between the -- the Germans and their allies  and they -- You mean the first World War.
I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war.
The Flying Tigers were that part of the Air Force which dedicated itself to General Chenault to help him in winning the war in China.
Well then  the head of the Swedish Red Cr oss  a fellow name -- name -- fe-fellow by the name of Bernadotte had made a deal with Himmler  that he would try to negotiate with the allied and get a peace going  and the price for that  Hitler had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that all Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- concentration camp inmates should be shipped to Sweden until the end of the war.
Yeah  because yeah  because the the guy who came from this woman  they told him she told him that probably went to there  because if he didnt [indecipherable] and I didnt find him  not during the war  that means from end of October or so til after the war  so I knew that he went there.
You were in America for the civil rights movement  McCarthy era  Cold War  Vietnam War  womens movement  etc.
Well I think I talked about the beginning  being a result of the First World War.
I was one of them  and then later on in Grenoble the Italians had set up two in our area  two nice resort villages that b ecause of the war weren't used.
And and you know  when that war started  I remember  God help the Hang on a second.
Anyway  getting back to -- >> Bill Benson: One more question.
Now  whats important about that tim e is that at the time we arrived in Lithuania   although there was a strain between the Polish and Lithuanian governments having to do with the arrange ments after World War I  we were ra- Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 17rather well received  and my father was able to actually earn some kind of living by buying and selling stuff.
When did you find out  when did you realize this was not just war  and horrible war  but this was also a genocide?
The expiration date was just before the war started  so they said  ﬁWhy didn't you come before the war started?ﬂ But the di fference was like something like one or two weeks.
Can you tell me a little b it about the end of the war?
HAROLD ZISSMAN April 27  1995 I'd like you to start off by telling me your name  date of birth  place of birth.
During the war his fa mily was broken up very  very rapidly  and he  being almost exactly the same age as my mother  it was a very  very young  but obvi -- what turned out to be very resilient little guy.
But we as a family before the war  we 5 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD -- and I was a kid going to school  I always felt very comfortable.
And so where -- weve talked about the war is over -- Yes.
They also transported Germans  repa -- repatriates w ho were American citizens and decided to go back in the war to Germany.
in the -- in the -- from Hitler -- from Hitle rs war.
By the time the war ended  he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a where are we and obviously trying to bring us over.
I never saw  before the war  my mother with a gun.
You must re member that in 1943  and before the war  it was very seldom a Dane had a passport.
So  I found someone from my hometown in Lida  who prior to -- before th e war  because he was a Jew  he could not enter any university in Poland  he started in Pisa  in Italy.
And two weeks before the war ended somebo dy gave them out and they were all shot.
It was January twenty-one a nd the war was continued until  as you know  until May. So here was all the time moving Russian truc ks and armaments and soldiers.
No  I think this is an [indecipherable] that is now very you know  people do it and Im going to say something thats going to shoc k everybody  but I think that I myself feel that theres when we really needed help and support righ t after the war  and when I came to Brazil and and  you know  I had a need to talk abou t what happened to us  in order to inform people I had close c ontact with  schoolmates and so on  nobody was interested.
Yes  and one of the things that he -- he showed me after th e war was a suit that my father had made for him.
However  once I met my husband and we were ma rried  I was able to become an American citizen because my husband was in the American army during the war  and I became a citizen within the first year of our marriage  and I w ould not change that for anything in the world.
A lot of Ukraine SS when the war start coming to an end  they used to replace  they used to take the SS  send them to the front  to Russia or wherever they needed them  and then putting in Ukraine  and they had black uniforms.
So that was familiar things   but not when it came back after the war I had handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort.
Yeah  because the government was occupied with the with the war.
You have to find  those are the most essen tial work for that uh war effort.
But th e town was not liberated by the Russians  it was liberated by Rumanian units because about a year before the second world war ended the Rumanians switched sides and joined the Russians.
When the Gestapo knocked on our door and came in with guns and told us to get out  at gunpoint.
The war had involved both Deso and me because Deso was a psychiatrist and kept people out of the war  with certifications.
So now its the end of the war and your father comes to get you.
01:31:53 So when the war did end and my mother and father came for me  I really didn't want to go back with them.
Did you I guess my larger question is   did you go back to any of the places  whether it was Wilno  whether it was Nesvizh  whether it was the various towns you had been with your mo ther  after the war  to see what they looked like?
And sparing the British from having him as king during World War II  is something that Ive long argued that people in Great Britain ought to acknowledge by some kind of plaque  or other dedicated thing.
I want to talk about some of the events that happened after World War II that were related to the Holocaust.
The waiting period from May 24 to the war started June 5.
There I set up the officer of Chief of Counsel for War Crimes  Berlin Branch.

All brother a brother and two sisters  and its going to be and its on July 23rd  2009  in New York City  and its a continuation of the three separate interviews that were just done  talking about wartime experiences  and perhaps some of the experiences after the war  or some experiences before the war.
There was some -- there was the Korean War started out and business got a little bit slower and I dont remember exactly what he did  but anyway  we just came out with our own money.
There was always the possibility of some war between who knows  the Hungarians and the Romanians  who were always itching to do that  but fortunately didnt.
And my mother said  I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War.
Hitler did very well by waiting for the Poles to gather for him  a ll the harvest and put them in barns where they can easily have it picked up for their own use and for the armys use  there was feeding off Poland  Were you surprised by the outbreak of war?
As we moved  as the war came  other recollections come up in other countries.
Got up  and they came Russians too said the Germans run away.
I was living in the seminary  and I was ordained during the war  and during the war we could not go to the missions where I was going to appointed later for South America.
Even though we knew that the Germans  theyre against the Jews but nobody thought of something happening whatever happened.
Before war you did not get it  where you got it?ﬂ So you had to tell them where you got it.
We were four   really five years in this war  and if you think that more then two and a half year  every month we had to do those robberies.
And a third group were the one of decorated officers  the families of decorated World War I officers.

You're always...nothing ever seems permanent so I really was waiting to leave again because I understood from the war what I could understand.
I had been asked -- when I first came back I had been asked  I had to report at Keenan's request amongst other things to report to the Attorney General and the War Department.
What had happened was that one synagogue was not -- had not been destroyed in 1938 -- it was a Reform synagogue -- because there were houses around and they figured if they burn it  their houses would be affected  so they used it during the war as a storage and stalls and whatever.
After the war broke out  Mr. London told me  well  they're going to be evacuating.
And I know him even...from even before the war  so whenever I saw him the street  we were talking like...like two friends.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: I was tol d that before the war my mother kept a kosher house.
Well  I didn't know all of this until after the war was over.
But th ose who were hiding  a nd were perhaps with a Christian family  they coul d still listen to BBC so that was the  the entire existence was the war and the topics were just that.
What about your sense of--once yo u were reunited and af ter the war  was there any more sense of Jewishness in the family?
But I couldn't be paid for such a war  so he said that's in your file.
That is part of what I went through with those Germans.
So I focused on research  I didnt return to my army da ys or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II.
In the town of Grudziadz which before the First World War was under the German occupation or it was part of Germany.
Wilno now belongs to to th e Russians  they took it away after the war  you know.
My grandmother was taken to a hospital where she lived during the war.
Well  when we arrived in Haif a  of course  that was a very emotional scene and then eventually  the war  basically  was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we  our movement went to a ki bbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then.
We have this in the bag  we're going to get them; it's just that they're having a little trouble with Hitler.ﬂ Well  we never did get them  bu t in the meantime in 1936  wh en all these preparations for 16 war were being made by I. G. Farben in conjunction with the German Wehrmacht  11 the Farben people filed thousands of applications for patents with the United States Patent Office on their own.
We had Soviets and citizens there and Soviet prisoners of war and so on.
Some of these dentists had been in the Soviet Union during the war.
I asked you if anybody in the United States asked you about your experiences during the war or before the war.
Again  there were shacks where before the war people kept wood.
Thats the people who lived through the war  they came from Russia with children  they killed them all.
They all shipped them to the war prisoners to  to Russia or they  they used them first for labor  for  for  for laborers  you know  for whatever reason it is.
And I  the war broke out  night and I was in th e factory with my colleagues and there was one of maybe one of my bosses and he came next to me and he ld my hand and said  ﬁ Shtoybooyitznomee what is  what   what  because it is  what is go ing to happen to us?ﬂ And I could not understand.

They made they -- they are the -- very famous movie  it was during the war time.
And they would come and borrow a furniture for the duration of the war.
America was always the land of opportunit y. A lot of the Jewish  the survivors  the Holocaust  the concentration camp survivors  I think  went to Israel and certainly after the war  the children whose parents had been killed and  in Holland  if  if they had fled to Holland from eastern European countries to escape Nazism  and  and if those parents were killed  the children were put in hiding  those children were all sent to Israel.
What had your aunt told you  if anything  about her perspective of the war years in Germany?
What was the reaction of your parents when the war was over and the news came out about what had happened to the six million Jews and so forth?
You told me an incident about being out in the fields  I think with tomatoes  and you got news about the end of the war in the Pacific.
Poland was not prepared for war  because we had only twa 20 years to start to be alone  not divided between our friends  Germany and Russia.
But when the Germans came  of course  then they came up.
My cousin  Berta  when she left Vlasenica that this Bosnian war -- she called me a nd I tried very hard to bring her to this country  which I did  thank God.
Buy from the German who are against the war happen  or kill the German and take the ha -- gun.
We will discuss the comedy like you run into situations that you experienced during the war when you're visiting Paris or something like that  but you don't talk about death and murder and torture and the pain that -- it's amazing.
Are we talking now about World War II  or World War I?
He ŠŠ there was ŠŠ before World War II or during it  there was a movie by the name of Escape  and he had written the book.
After the war  there were very few teachers and they insisted me to teach  English.
I wanted to ask you sinceand we will talk about this latersince you have gone back to Germany since the war  is that apartment building still existing that you spent your childhood in?
You must have had -- any kind of war mu st have brought out some strong feelings in you  I would think.
And Ive always vowed I would never name a child after a relative who was killed or died  because my brother was named after the oldest so n of my grandmother  who was killed in World War .
And after the war they returned to Litic  but they left the kind of impression on the Danish community here.
As I said before  probably  since 1941 or even since the beginning of the war  I dont ever recall having to give anybody my name.
The war broke out 1 East Prussia 2 in 1939 and Poland was divided between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany  and my town  of course  was directly on the German borde r. And immediately the Germans came and occupied the town.
And in September of 1946  as a war orphan  was taken to the United States to an orphanage in New York.
But  of course  the I understand  going back into history  that there was a lot of continuous up unrest in Germany  from the end of the war actually and through the Depression and all this.
And June 22nd in 1941  the war with Russians had started; and my brother and myself  every night we could go home.
When the state was es tablished  he was in the army  and he was killed by a convoy in the protection of Jerusalem during the War of Independence.
The war was around the ghetto and we had we had to move to the ghetto.
But in the smaller town there  we are talking about a city right now that prior to World War -- to the outbreak of the war probably  maybe  had 3 000 people in total population.
>> Bill Benson: In the little time that we have left  there's a couple other things I want you to tell us about.
Can you tell us how your life began to change when the war came?
It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge  refuge in this big forest  being fed and protected by the civilians.
and I think she was the second in ma -- first was Esther  her  and then my -- what I want to mention is that in this pre-war period  and leading to the -- the invasion from the German  I know this because after the war  that contrary to some of the friends o -- friends of the family -- Mm-hm. --
Let me ask you a little bit more about Kovno before the war.
And I just had  and the job was getting more demanding because of customer service  I would deal with angry people all day long and the pressure  I couldn't take pressure  that's one thing I've never been able to take is pressure  any kind of pressure  since the war.
There were many small merchants and one of them was a teacher who du ring the war became one of the five leaders of the resistance in our area.
What happened is after that -- oh  the Germans asked for the Jewish population earlier in the war.
The camp the Germans lost the war before I was released from the hospital  or rather  they had to leave the  the camp.
I meant during the time of the war  I meant during the war?
I mean 1944  they knew that the war is lost for them.
So after the First World War there was a conference in Versailles  near Paris.
It a pharmacist  the Coens had two little girls  Doris and Hannah   who they had managed to send to England with the last Kindertransport  in August Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood April 27  2017 51 1939  days before the outbreak of the war.
But at that time he came -- he came  he found me in Ludbreg where I was living during the war  and he -- I remember that he -- he tried to talk to me about going with him  and I refused to go.
So I said  \ I'm going away  there is  got left from the war  from the family\ .
That was elsewh ere  the war  not it would not come to the Baltics.
This was taken also during the war  about the same time when they took my father's picture in order to have pictures in the event they wanted to get a passport.
My parents were honest people but anyone who understands war situation knows that if you want to survive in an occupied country  you do black markets.
When I moved war I took a job in Des Moines .
As you made your trips to Germany in the 1930s did you sense that war was coming?
He got a job in the Nuremberg war crime trials with the American judge.
The crematory could not destroy them because the war was very short to end .
And then there was this effort to track  after the war  to try to get some additional information.
It was a quite different country because when you live in a country occupied (cough) and go to another country who haven't got the same feelings as we  to them the Germans were not so bad as we thought because they had the relationship with Finland and with the Finnish-Russian War and all this.
No  look  she was older as I am  and she was -- I know that she was very friendly to me  she -- and -- R: The war did that.
And we were sitting -- if you stay first in the first war  you move down and you ended up down in the caves where we were spending our last time.
He was in the military  he enlisted in the military when second World War started.
It was immediately a question of food  because there we re -- the Germans came  the -- the Nazis came too  and took away our  you know  food we had.
And -- and this is true  I -- I would  with frequency  stop by the public library branch near my junior high school  all the way down on 178th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue  quite a bit out of our neighborhood  to look at Holocaust and World War history books.
And again  what was your reaction when you talked to these German soldiers?
You were -- you were actually fighting at some point  at the end of the war?
Interview with Marianne Liebermann January 9  2004 35 Did your parents talk about the plight of the Jews during the war?
And sometimes people Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 7 dont have much  because no one talked to them as a little child  but it sounds to me that your father told you very a l ot about your familys Well  he told me that after the war.
01:09:40 Do you remember the day that the war started in Vengrov?
And my mother heard that there is going to be a World War Three  and so she became panicky and she said  ﬁWe must leave Europe immediately.ﬂ So  she had a sister in Cuba.
And the concery had some problems because it was during the Vietnam War.
These were families that might have moved to – children who ended up from other countries in France before the war  didnt have  necessarily French passports  you know  so all kinds of mixture.
The -- This other person -- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle  but he had somebody who got him out in somewhere.
I think its -- its one experience that I wouldnt have had if the war had not happened.
Uh after the war broke out and we uh were put into the uh the ghetto  uh sometime uh in 1940 we were uh put into the ghetto in uh Radom uh where they would take a whole section and uh keep all the Jews  collect all the Jews uh from the neighboring uh towns and villages.
And England was tr ans-shipping some of our land lease goods intended for them and for the war effo rt trans-shipping them to South America to protect their markets.
So in 1945  after the war we had to go through the whole procedure again applying for permission to immigrate to the United States.
The enmities by and large evaporated with the end of the war.
Like Jesus said  \ All those who take the sword will die by the sword.\
The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war  so they brought them into concentration camp and never gave them any food.
So  when the war started  he took my bicycle and he told my mothers sister that   listen  Ill try  maybe I ll catch up with the train.
Then the war was over  and we came to the United States.
Al spent the rest of the war in Tole Madna's house  where he was cared for by Tole's Indonesian nanny  Mima Saina.
So  we used to deliver  before the war  sand to make the glass  okay  so he knew the Germans who owned the factory  were German people who owned the f actory  glass factory.
After the First World War  Hungary is truncated and some of it becomes Yugoslavia  some of it becomes Czechoslovakia.
But a few weeks before the war broke out  they changed the slip of paper - the there were red cards  blue cards  white cards  and there was must have been that day because of having seven children - the youngest child was four years old when the war broke out - that they did not call him to the army.
It turned out I was not by myself  there were other -- about three or four Christians and they were talking about the war  the -- even they mentioned one guy tells about that Israeli ar -- tanks hit -- hit them so hard that it -- and th ey went to -- into Sinai peninsula.
I dont think it was terribly damaged during the war  but its sort of touristy.
But -- And in that  of course  there were many Jews.
The young man by the name of Gavrilo Princip who shot the Crown Prince in 1914  and started World War I in Sarajevo I say ﬁSarajevoﬂ You say it differently  don't you?
Your schools will be here  and they made a complete and they actually had uh I I don't know  I remember some of the kids saying they had badges which after the war they ripped off  and had all kinds of symbols to remind them that they are Jews  that they are Jews.
So  lets come to that point where things start to change  and you know  did you when the war started  do you remember that day?
I always went  at the time and to this very day  my wife can tell you that too  it drives her up the wall  but maybe those war years taught me to be this but I don't worry.
And the people– and I saw the– I told you about that 12 series what was on television  The Winds of War?
Yeah  as the war finally came home to Germa ny  we were delighted to see in the official vairmarkten  armed forces report  that was issu ed at the end of each day  finally German place names.
And when the Nazis started to lose th e war  of course I didn't know about it because we had no outside communication.
This was towards the end of the war  and no one paid any attention to that anymore.
Before the war I actua lly didn't have contact with the Polish people  only in the place where I worked  they used to come in as customers and I used to talk with them a little bit.
16 -- that seems to me something that came to me as a result of hearing about the Spanish Civil War  th-the end of my -- my book says Im -- at the moment -- in a moment of -- of -- of peace.
No  because there were non Jews a -- Jewish teachers  because there were not enough Jews who wanted to be teachers.
E-Even -- Even this whole thing is a -- the consequence of World War Two.
>> Susan Taube: Also  he was a World War I veteran  from World War I   fighting for the German Army.
My quest  my search for my mother continued and wh en the war was over I went back to my home town.
I had been engaged to an Amer ican during the war  a wonderful fellow who lived -- who actually lived in Denver  Colorado .
But when we heard that the Russians got closer to Berlin or  or I dont know where it was  what was it there  a very big city.
I didn't  my wife I didn't know her before after the war.
>> Dora Klayman: Somehow we muddled until the end of the war.
Maybe it was the -- the deep sense of bitterness towards people that I knew before the war who betrayed me  because I thought this was betrayal.
Because then I started to realize I didn't know anything what was happen  with Hitler  I didn't know what's Germany  I didn' t know how the war is.
How long after the war began in Poland was this armistice when you went back to Warsaw?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003 11 11 Not too long  I would say.
We wo rk over there until... ya I receive a package from Poland when the German were together with the Russian were friends  you know  until 1941 they started the war.
>> Bill Benson: And yet your family was a religious family  as I recall.
One June the 22 nd  early in the morning about 4 oclock in the morning  being that I was on the border and working on the railroad at that particular town  in the morning I saw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplane s. That was the start of the war.
we have a very nice little group of resistance  what Schindler himself created  wa s 15 of us ex-soldiers  who uh  he organized us in special little groups  and everybody has a job to do  he explained to us that there are orders when the war will be over  and we are already close to the  because there was the uh the march 1945  the war was going to the end  is or--there are order to executed all those people in the Brinwitz camp  and already there were a grave dig out by the Russian prisoner of war who were in the different camp  four people from Brinwitz  from the camp of Schindler .
I knew about as much about dancing as I know about the ballet dancing (laughs)  but I learned  et cetera  and because one of the things that I remembered very well became the rage in Latvia before the war in the late ‚30s was the Tango  and a particular type of Tango Naturno.
And the 15th of October was the day when Horthy 8 very belatedly decided that maybe he needs to do a gesture and he proclaimed Hungary a neutral country out of the war.
The one exception was Adolph Hitler  who would never concede that he was losing the war until he was in a bunker in 1945.
Now the reason it was called an exchange point is because  apparently  and I believe it was at the Yalta Conference  we  that is the four major powers  said that we would repatriate the Germans  also  who had been displaced because of war.
And there was a fight to get food  because the Germans had no f ood themselves.
Its very difficult  because we have seen  after the war  many thing which goes near Holocaust.
So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game  because he helps them  and he help usually important people  of the Committee of National Liberation  like Ferucho Parai  then later on  at the end of the war  would testify on his behalf.
But when the Germans occupied Poland we lived near the Polish border  at that time that was.
And this very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold War atmosphere of the time  and this was an at mosphere that continued affecting the few cases that actually were prosecuted  or were litigated during the 50s and 60s  until the Vietnam era.
Were I I used to to live be -before t he the the war.
At that time  I -- I think we knew already during the war also that things were -- what was going on  but people were not sure and people died.
So  almost your first well  your first interaction with this war.
Id like you to reflect back on some of the things from the 60s  like the the Vietnam war an-and Civil Rights  and Womens Moveme nt.
After the war w as over and again you were quite young then   I understand that.
And then -- oh then I got jaundice  and -- and dysentery and went in -- in hospital and then the war was over.
His wife  after the war  he met at a b eauty salon in ghetto... Hes Nacht-man actually.
So Hungary  they took away from Hungary two-thirds of their territory after the first world war and gave it to the neighbors.
Because that was in ‚57 or ‚58  that was many years after the war  already.
How this historic fact relates to my survival is probably a bit farfetched  but it isnt  for the reason that the factory di -- me -- the factory in our town  which prior to the war  smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all kinds of locomotives and -- and meat gri nders  from the big to the smallest  was converted to a munitions factory as soon as the war broke out.
If you want me  I want to tell that 1944 was when the -- short time before the war was over.
On one occasion he walked in and recognized a friend of his from his town  from his little town before the war.
But I was late  and maybe three hours  because on the  on that -- well  you don't know but during the war was nothing in time.
As Austrians  we were German citizens  so we became enemy aliens.
But after the war  when we were liberated by the Russians in January of '45 and the war was still going on  so we figured that we--so then we were from the whole camp  when were about 700 women.
When a man named Hitler came into power in 1933  did you hear of him then?
Did she talk much to you after the war or did you just not speak very much about it?
Now  if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an Israel  these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel  and these Jews would have been saved.
When the ghetto came  of course  like everybody else  we ha d to move in the ghetto.
And before the war  life was -- the life of Jewish immigrants in France -- tolerated.
But in 1944 -- >> Bill Benson: Before we get to 1944 -- I don't want to skip over everything.
And so we found out that there was a prisoner of war camp where they had a lot of prisoners who were capable of doing special things.
he laughs) Then for some reason my father knew a man before the War he did him a big favor  he was one the head for the work agency  you know?
And we started with the synagogue  and the b eautiful synagogue that that was there before the war.
They never met them  like this distant Uncle that left Poland before the war yet  before they were born maybe.
It was a chance  this was the only chance after the war to succeed.
Now  I don't have much experience because as soon as the war was over I went with this soldier in a pick up truck to .
After the war -- he survived the war on the same camp as I did  Bergen-Belsen.
In the Jewish tradition  anyhow the tradition in Poland before the war  which I remember  the most important things was education.
I just re member Perl Duri  with his friend because I went to visit him after the war with his mother survived.
He has grandchildren who go to school  hopefully  the war is over soon.
A. No  when they got to the United States  my uncle bought a chocolate factory  and he worked there  and when the war broke out  it was difficult to get sugar a nd flour  so he sold it.
Whatever I remember from before the war or even during the war the love  the affection I got from my pare nts  its all gone.
They speak about World War One but not abou t the Holocaust.
Were there any negative comments made by non -Jews in Edinburgh about harboring these children  taking care of them during the war?
You survived the war  why do you want to go back and get killed?ﬂ Because he mentioned me somebody who went in to the city  and he did not hardly live a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 14 day before they killed him.
And it was three weeks  as long the war lasted  I was a soldier  till they caught me  and  as a prisoner of war  and all the Jewish prisoners of wa--all the prisoners of war  they sent to Ger many  to work there.
As I told you before  we didn't even have an inkling before World War II.
And that is the very painful thought that that whatever was known by the author Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14  2010 83American  British authorities was not disseminated on time for the Jews to so survive  particularly the Jews of Greece  and particularly these Jews that were arrested sort of late in the war.
And when I came back here  then I went back to Germany.
The Russians were looking for the traitors that run away even after the war.]
All the faul t which was made during af ter the first world war  more or less  caused the s econd world war  I think.
I  who had never read a book on the Holocaust  I suddenly was -- it was like  I dont know  like my mind opened up suddenly to something that I could -- you asked me  did you t -- earlier  did you talk about the war  either in New Yor -- in -- in the Zionist organization or in the kibbutz?

Walking around  finding all sorts of stuff at th-the -- this is what wartime is  nan -- and aftermath of a war is like  I mean you find stuff.
I did a few times risk my life by trying to find out how far the war was.
Well  the war was over in 45  he might have sent them a little later  but I was 23.
I developed -- because I was an infant  I was what  less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death  I mean  I -- s - you know  so my mother took me to a field hospital  miles away  where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people  we have soldiers in there and I dont have time for -- for you.
Yo-You mentioned in your videotape  yo u -- you told of two dreams that you had during the -- during the war.

Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 124 In Wolkenstein .
I mea n  its very difficult to think of another country where you could have anti-war demonstration the mi ddle of a war for survival.
How aware were you  and how interested were you in -- in political situations that were going on in -- in those years  or in broader social and cultural issues  or were you more focused on just trying to build your own life  and your family   or were you kind of aware of some of the -- some of the things like the -- were yo u following the Korean war  and those issues  or -- or the -- the Civil Rights movement as it started up?
Uh from there uh...this these were the the final stages of the war  that it was becoming quite obvious that it would soon be over  but uh reports reached us that uh the town a few miles away from there was was ready to surrender because there were uh flying white flags uh from from their houses and uh so it became my job  along with uh a very small medical detachment and and the military government uh detachment  uh to go to that town and take take the surrender.
I mean  my father and my step-father both fought in World War I. We so thoroughly believed in Germany . [
And with all the I mean   it was such abrupt experiences from moving from Europe and  you know  leaving war behind.
Uh there were twelve brothers and sisters of which only one survived the war  they having escaped in 1933 to uh what was then Palestine  and from my father's side uh wher e there were eight brother and and sisters  uh none of them survived.
So therefore I had to take a -- I lived up here  I had to board a trolley car and tr-travel I would say about 20 minutes on a trolley car to Ribna  which w ould be -- this is Balskirinik  its somewhere right before Balskirinik  because it was duri ng the war in the ghetto boundary.
Of course it -- Did you -- -- I -- at least of what I remember  might a -- very possible before the war I had the fish  I dont remember.
AG] We were treated alright they couldnt give us no food  we had a scrounge everything  but I didnt see any  how can I put it  cruelty  cause they were the same as us see  mainly old war people  they were not too bad at all.
>> Bill Benson: As you said  the war for you and where you were living at that time was over ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 in August of 1944.
What had happened upstairs was that these people  who had lived there all the time  since 19 -- I dont know what -- just after the war  I guess.
In the spring of 1944  with Hungary about to capitulate to the allies  Germany moved into occupied Hungary  including where you lived.
But during the war there's nobody there so they were able to rent a house.
I asked permission to go and uh to come back  so they know I come back anyway  so he name...his name was uh Meyer and uh after (cough)...there was a few time he helped me and after war we met because was not far and uh he told me was arrested for for associate while helping uh Pole but he don't told me about he was big smart engineer so he would fight with them and they let him go.
Like I have pictures here on that wall over there  my pictures from before the war.
And we were not treated very nicely wh en we came back to Poland.
During the First World War he went onto the allied side .
And she say -- she went into the service of a priest in Czechoslovakia and survived the war.
Because they have no room for us [indecipherable] the war was on  it was go on.
I want to ask you a few more questions about the Ghetto.
And then you know before the war ended  an American came into our lives.
Well  if I have to continue about the Moscovitz   then he died  and then I saw Mrs. Moscovitz when she went to Milan  a-after the war sh-she was there.
We expected the war to be finished but we couldn't see the end of it.
The woman that lived upstairs in the apt that we previously occupied said  said one day to Mrs. Olefska  she says  \ You know  after the war  after the war is over  I wonder about those Jews that are hiding here.
lets you started to talk about the Soviet occupation  and before we get into what happened during it  Id like to step back just before  and ask about when did things change  and how did things change?
My sister already had uh an advanced case of TB they call galloping consumption and so on the truck uh when she got too sick uh on the road to Austria  they just threw her out on the roadside and left her there to to die in in uh the snow  and we found out about this because uh another woman who was on the truck 4 with her who survived came to visit us sometime later to tell us the story  and  you know  that was a common thing that uh many people who survived the Holocaust or the war in some way...at the end of the war they made a special effort to go and visit whenever they could the families of people that that died next to them or that they saw  so that they could recount the circumstances.
It was -- I am only guessing that it was kind of 1940  1941  thereabouts.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 53 How long were you active in the brigade  after the war was over?
And for some reason  I stayed with them the whole war.
I went back to Germany when Im in in the military.
Later on the Jews had different -- we got the ration books before the war started  already.
We had to assemble in a school gymnasium in Girpingen  the people who were in the transport  and mainly the people who we re in my transport were disabled war veterans and old people.
It's a fact that one of my second cousins I should say  and the first cousins  I didn't know that they went to Australia in that time before the war.
Did you learn something about their fate while you were in Auschwitz?
So was it shortly after the Germans occupied the town that you were herded up and put in a ghetto?
Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 19 November 29  2012 And I  I was supposed to go with next transport and then the war broke out so the transport  the Kindertransport stopped.
And my father always said  they didnt mean him  he was in first World War.
These people that you mentioned before - Well  they were usually SS guards at the -- there were some -- I guess by the end of the war they had some guards from Latvia and various other occupied countries who swore up and do wn that they weren't SS  of course  but they were Latvian SS or Bastognian SS  but they were -- That's interesting?
Do you think the world has learned anything from the lessons  any lessons from the Holocaust?
Can you distinguish the attachment -- you have the personal attachme nt and how it may have been clouded by the general excitement that you ha d about the war being over?
We got there on May 5th  three days before the war was over.
It was the first time that I was with very devout Jews.
Im not saying that would have been the case  but basically the professional guys in the Service  the non-commissioned officers  who had experience from the Korean War and then served in ‚Nam  theyre basically who trained the new guys  you know  and got them understand what a war is all about.
The heroic acts of individual Christians  laymen  priests and nuns  are a witness of the sadinbanny -- of the neglected moral duty of an institution whose basis is love of the neighbor  compassion and help those who are -- those who helped save lives of Jews during the war.
And then the Germans needed people who spoke German to help them govern this new kingdom of theirs.
Many of us want our children to know about the horrors of the Holocaust.
Well  the best evidence is the fact that they got the presidential citation its either the presidential or war department sar citation  some call it presidential.
The awareness of what had been done by the Germans to the Jews of Poland and Russia  did not take place until sometime after the war.
The thought of being in another war or  or hearing the shooting again.
I met one after the war once in a hotel in the lobby.
Well  the Zhaglietski family are still with us  but in the meantime  we find out that my father was in the the as prisoner of war  and somehow landed in the pri as a prisoner of war with the Zhaglietski .
That market hall will be very important to the lives of many people during the war.
And the Jewish youth movement became a very active movement in the resistance in France dur ing the war and then eventually after the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 15 war  some of them found a kibbutzim in Israel.
And  the war to an extent  its only in retrospect that radicalized me.
Is there anything else you can tell me about your life before th e war that would give me special insight into what it was like living there?
My name was changed by war office order on joining the commandos in 1942  I believe.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 >> Bill Benson: And just to emphasize that point   you told me for your sisters  because they were older  and for your mother  it was just a time of total terror because of the roundups and your father's now gone.
The other problem was that the 18 -year -old grandson lived with them as well and he joined the Reichstag party  a fascist political party that existed in Belgium before the war.
Well  my father  before the war  he tried hard to learn French.
That's why so many years -- That was maybe two years before the war.
Who knew anything a nd certainly who would expect that the war is not going to end and we will be alive.
My brot her  during the war he write and her father was the like the president of the gemeinde for the Jews.
So  this way the Germans of the war made us believe somehow that they were not completely to blame  that they were  were brainwashed  that  that circumstances brought them to that.
And you see Winds of War in the last segment when the woman opened the door  opened the door for her and she stands there and she talks to the SS man standing there with his dog and his white gloves  and she said  \ Sir  we have 7 people  7 dead people in this car.\
That stems already from before  because when the war started  my friends didnt come to see me.
Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the war?
I had l ong hair at the end of the war.
We had this -- I had this support group with you nger people who were children and teenagers in the war.
Gradually -- I don't know what it was like but I know the place in Paris was a hotel where the Gestapo used it to -- the Gestapo occupied during the war.
My moth -- I found out that my grandmother converted after the war  or -- because she wanted to be buried near her son.
After the war  so long I was in Poland  she was hiding  because she -- I find out about it -- she knew that if I will get her  I will kill her.
Because the war started in 1939 and ended in ‚45  so it was six years and in -- during that time  I finished the academy and got my -- my diplomas  etcetera.
The war started for us  the Second World War started for us September 1  1939.
I matter of fact  there was a family who corresponded with me even after the war  after  afterwards.
They say that in the -- in the first World War  I guess  that in the trenches  every -- every soldier becomes religious  and prays.
Interesting  after the war we had a number of good German friends and my mothers says  why in the world do you like these darn Germans so much?
It must have been two months or so after liber ation  where Im still as I look at it pretty emaciated and that of course is during World War II  during th e tough days of World War II  but also with a certain sadness in my eyes  I see  really not knowing the direction I want to go  I guess.
And then when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland  so my father...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go there.
Theyre interested in the war itself  and they continue  as I s told y mentioned  to turn out books on the origins of the first World War  another one comes out every year.
Uh  my mother came from the Polish side of the Bug River and and my father was on the Russian side and  uh  they were childhood friends and they immigrated to the United States at different times and met in New York and my father was in World War I and  uh  in the infantry which  uh  I was quite proud of as you'll find out later.
That guy lived until -- >> Bill Benson: He was 13 at the time.
Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27  2001 3 Well  I of course am -- am new at the court  but in the days of the Cold War  basically since the second World War  initially there were very  very few cases coming  and that was because of the Cold War.
So how was it that you could return to Poland ?
You cant only say that World War is the only time that war crimes or crimes against humanity have been committed.
Id like you if you could to reflect on some of the events that you witnessed in this country  and lets -- lets start with the Cold War  and perhaps even the Cuban missile crisis.
And -- and they -- and I used to smoke cigarettes after the war -- in -- before the war  and after I was 16  and I smoked cigarettes at home.
And my father said well its true the Germans certainly wont hurt women and children because after all his memories  like most Polish Jews.
Well  this is what I want to ask is  do you have a memor That was the time close to the war.
I stayed in Siberia with the children w ith a childrens house  I was working two years there before -- until the war finished.
In Garmisch Partenkirchen the war was over two days before that.
May-Maybe a little bit with the food  because we used to dry bread  you know  before the war  figure just in case.
Do you remember any e vidence of anti -Semitism before the war started?
And I got to know about that  because as I was speaking around  so many of the people came to me and said  oh now I understand what my parents didnt want to 130 tell me  or now I understand why its so difficu lt to talk about the second World War  or whatever  whatever  whatever.
And two days later  first of September  war breaks out in Europe.
This is tape number two  side B. And lets now talk about your schooling after the war.
So in July  a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in Poland  there was no fear of war.
He will help Mother  and he will -- he always -- he survived World War I  he will survive this war.
I -- I just got the impression that you really did a lot of homework on reading up about the Holocaust.
What Id like to do is talk a great deal about the world  and the life that you had before any of these events  before the war started.
Interviewer: You said that your father   after the Revolution  he didnt have  you know after the Civil War also  he was an uns killed laborer because he didnt have  I guess  an industrial job before the war; so he didnt really have a job after the war.
We were trying to wrap up all this work at the end of the war crime.
5 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: And where you lived?
>> Bill Benson: And that night happened to be  as you said  Kristallnacht  what we call Night of Broken Glass.
Well  they were...uh...they were preparing us to leave Auschwitz at the time where it was bad already  that they saw the war was being lost.
But when the war came  and the results of the tragedy of the Jewish people were felt  the Jewish Labor Committee abandoned that.
They were very happy to see us come and help them because they had been in the war for four years already.
And I knew about the Polish woman who was the maid in my aunts place before the war.
A nd after the picture taking  I knew he was the head of the cabinet  miniszterium for PR and so forth  and I went to him in the building  and I said  \ I need the paper that I he was laughing  and he gave me the official paper of the Hungarian cabinet stating that Thomas Veres was  be tween 3:00 and 5:00  taking picture of the new Secretary of War.
And these were all slave labor camps  these were bad  these were bad places.
Cause you -- The war was -- the war was still going on  yes.
Well we -- we had to  as soon as we went to school in Bad Nauheim  already we had that ta - I think in 1939  right away when this -- before the war yet.
And you found that out pre tty soon after the war ended?
I didnt think of myself of somebody who was a historian of Germany  World War II.
So she knew them  and she kn everybody knew Ludwig Burger from before the war  because he was an actor  he was a very active youth leader in the in the boy scout movement.
Well  a -- everybody felt very bad about that war  why -- why something like that happened  see?
Bu t actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in M unich at the rear echelon of Headquarters 3rd Army was stationed in Munich.
So many peopl e used to ask me  you know  after the war  many people asked me  ﬁSo  who was the pers on who did it?ﬂ I cant remember  but somebody did it  and it was Penhurst  and you k now  it just came out so naturally.
There were very few Jewish officers before the war were officers.
It wa s first of all  the first days were -- the first week rather after the war.
When my grandmothers passed away  the rest of the family got killed in the war.
End of Tape #1 12 Tape #2 Hania  what happened when the war began?
Everything was a must for fortunes of war  and the fat would be used for certain productions including soap.
Tell us about the circumstances of your family and what you may recall yourself being as young as you were from those first few years of the war  before it really came to Hungary.
Interview with Michael Lin February 27  2000 92 Are there any smells or sights or sounds that come back to you now as an adult that you remind you of your difficult times during the war?
His son is in touch and he would say the nicest thing in every letter for Christmas and New Year that he writes me   \ My father didn't save you to go to a country where there is war all the time.
I was in the infantry and had uh  basic training and rose uh  by uh  the time the war started I was a sergeant.
My fia...Alec  who was my fiance  he applied for medical school in Poland but they didn't want to accept him on and when the war broke out  when the Russians came  he got a job as a bookkeeper in the railroad uh on the rail...in the railroad authorities.
Margit would later work for the Office o f War Information  spend time with MGM studios  and because of her language abilities worked for the U.S. Army of Occupation in Germany  re -educating Hitler youth.
So we were all together during the beginning of the war  bombing of Warsaw and all this.
When his father was dying  he told him that before the war  he was married and he had a daughter.
They promised my story to hide pages so I could recover after the war  which I did recover about 30 percent of it.
>> Henry Greenbaum: It wasn't that bad  really they didn't bother us until the war started.
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Michal  this is before the war  and your relationships.
After the war  while you were still doing occupation service  what efforts did you make personally to try and find family or friends who might have survived?
We were glad that now America was forced to enter the war  on the English side  because Roosevelt was  of course  fighting that battle for a long time.
But before we turn to the war years and particularly as it affected your community  let's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family and your community before the war began.
Even with th e war and everything else  there was just  also  we had to learn English.
Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans came?
This lady wh ich I romanced with  I met with her after the war.
And I think even to this day  we are planning to go to Israel next week  and its not a very safe time  since we just got over this war maybe two weeks ago.
Hate to call them the twilight years for gosh sakes  but no  but maybe and then you re go back and reflect upon these things and and and rec ognize what a full life a persons had  but and and and interestingly enough too  Oliver Wendell Holmes  the justice  a Civil War veteran  combat veteran  injured three times in the war  in the 1890s was asked to give a Memorial Day talk.
Let's say there was an English-owned British-owned property somewhere in the center of France  and in that uh factory--in that factory was now producing war materials for the Germans.
He had served in World War I. He had an Iron Cross  actually an Iron Cross th at was bestowed belatedly by Hitler.
Because I did not know about what the war would be.
You know to the front cause the war was still on.
It took him uh sometime to recuperate; but uh then uh...he went on uh a trip to Poland to look for uh...he seemed to have found out that uh myself  my sister and uh my mother had survived the war  and uh he got uh travel documents.
He was going to sit there for the whole rest of the war  because Lithuania was not in war.
I was in touch with my friends after the war  but the first time I came to visit Shadoweouf was last year  for the first time.
Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 34 So y -- During this war -- during this time I got -- we got a few postcards through the Red Cross  heavily censored  only knowing that they were starving because they said  you know  they -- they gained weight and were -- and now were up to 130 pounds.
Every community has to pay taxes from 1914 til today  if some Jew owes taxes.ﬂ Now there were Jews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their fatherland.
And the worry was that these enterprises would contribute to the Nazi war effort in at least two ways.
So  when the war started -- Can -- can -- can we go back a little bit?
There was priest there who taught us religion after the war.
And then you were starting to tell me about perhaps feeling uncomfortable  even German tourists -- did it make you uncomfortable some times to meet Germans who you wondered about what they had done during the war time?
When you mentioned that newspapers  and you mentioned this  that the Spanish Civil War was something talked about  that leads me to another question.
Do you think you are a diffe rent person today because of what you experienced during the war?
The older brother was already in the war in 1914  before–.1914  yeah.
And the Army did a great job of demobilizing the troops  and you knew almost at the end of World War II in Europe when you were going home  and you could figure it within a week almost  and so I knew it was going to be in May of '46 that I was going to come home  and I ta lked to my commanding officer about it  and he was an old AP guy  and he got me appointments at Stars and Stripes  Yank  and AFN  and AFN offered me a job  so I moved from Germany down to Paris and stayed there four or five months.
You know  in Germany every year you have different police departments in diff erent parts of the city and when my father came there and he asked by sheer coincidence the officer in charge was a former comrade in arms from World War I  and he said  Fritz Rosenbe rg  come in here for a minute.
We didnt got so good after war by the British here  we didnt got enough wood.
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: Every time there was a danger  and especially with the declaration of war  Germany invaded Poland  my parents left with us  l eft Paris.
When the war was over  and when I began to enter life  then the the process of analyzing choice started.
And we slowly had to convince the Russians that we are Jews  they didn't believe us; because we needed certain permits to go back home  things were very difficult at that time you know -- people could not just move around  the Russians were still advancing  it was still January 1945  the war wasn't over till actually May. But we wanted to go home  we didn't want to stay there.
>> Bill Benson: And with Germany and the Soviet Union attacking Poland in September 1939  beginning World War II  it was some months after that  however  before the war actually directly affected you and your family when the Soviets occupied your hometown of Vascauti.
He was a interpreter during the second World War and he spoke fluent German.
Although you're too young to share with us your direct memories of life in Germany  perhaps you can share with us what you learned from your sisters and what you gathered over the years about what your family life was like  what your town was like in those years before the war  and before you were sent to England.
I remember that there were I guess conversations with some  or there-there must have been some English speaking prisoners there.
Bu t to survivecan you imagine before the war  and our town was about 300 Jewish children.
But actually  I came along just at the right time because two years after I graduated we were at war and all of the men  all of the lawyers  were being drafted.
My father didnt have my fathers father died before the first World War.
The war is at -- the war is -- how the war started.
I know for Americans it's very difficult to visualize war because the only people who really experience war in this country were the G.I.s who fought in the wars.
Okay  because you -- you then went after the war to a Sobibor -- SE: No  we -- we went to Helm  theres a little town next to where we were hidden and there all the Jews told their story.
And then of course  the war probably wiped out  if I had any doubts.
The gentleman was a first world war veteran also lost his eyesight in that war.
Now  below here is my Aunt Angia  who again is my mothers sist er  and she was a single woman and she also perished in the war.
Of course  they were entirely into war production at that time and one day after our  after the ORT school was dismissed  we already  we had to report to this labor office and there we were given  you know  pieces of paper telling us where to report the next day and at what time and so on and so that's how I wound up at Siemens.
An d then I went  my eldest brother  who died in the fi rst World War was in a firm for ov er 20  25 years and the boss of the firm knew my mother and me very well and he said  \ Send the boy to me  I want him  to teach some .\
World War two  on the Belgian -- Belgian  French and German border  generally.
Trudy knows more about my parents during the war because she was in Italy and my father  when he finally got out of jail  he was arrested by the Russians and was a year in jail when my mother got him out.
During the years  the first years in the 30s  and through the war years  was your fam ily following what was going on in Europe   at Interview with Henry Stern June 8  2016 47 Oh yes.
Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was going  and -- and how long you thought it woul d be before it ended  before it was over?
This car was confiscated by the Hungarian army  and it just disappeared during the war.
Somebody ill would be sent from Balti to Iasi  that was in the years before the war.
He saw the person they helped out  they were poor  the father worked in the bakery -- >> Bill Benson: Helped him before the war?
But the Japanese by far didn't match the brutality of the Germans visa vie the Jews  and the emigrated after the war to Australia.
Did your -- did you -- did you learn very much about the beginning of the war in Poland?
They had the letter from this man in England that he was taking me  so I got a permission to leave Germany in June 1939  which is three months before the war broke out.
We could do -- and unfortu -- well  not -- I suppose unfortunately  there were also some Russians from the -- not prisoner of war  also inmates like us  on the boats  you know  and they did commit a lot of crimes  unfortunately.
They both were surgeons  they saved a lot of lives during the war.
So  I was aware  until the war  very much aware  what was going on.
Now  I think I have the advantage of taking the best of all three of these things  German  [indecipherable] take poetry  or some  and th ere was a German poem that kept me alive in the camps in the war.
as a unit refused to be repatriated together with our professors who were prewar Polish teachers who found themselves in one way or another in Ge rmany after the war  we were sent to a punishment camp in a place called Altenstadt near Garmisch Partenkirchen  wooden barracks.
During the month of June  1945 newspaper correspondents  foreign correspondents  in Germany had umb sent back stories to the American press that there were Jewish survivors of the Nazi Nazi concentration camps living in Displaced Person's Camps under the American army who's living conditions were abominable.
And I  then when the war broke out I you know we all went to somewhere else and I never heard from him again.
There were a lot of there were a lot of people who had been displaced by the war  a lot of orphans in orphanages  which you know  just tore your heart out.
And then  when the war was over  my father came home from Russia.
This was the height of the war  and the doodlebugs  which are one kind of bomb  would come over the area of Tunbridge Wells  and they had balloon barrages up to prevent the planes from reaching London.
My cousin  this cousin  didn't wait for that  she escaped into the woods and lived the rest of the war with the partisans.
They were very idealistic  describing a wonderful society that is going to be built after the war  a society that was free of ignorance and poverty and injus tice.
And the reason I wrote that book is because I felt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived  people were writing books and telling stories that were horrible  and in recounting their their stories  and I felt that someone ought to st ress the fact that not everybody went like sheep to the slaughter  but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to fight back.
Can you recall  what was the sense in this country to the news coming out of what is now war torn Europe?
But during the Korean War I r ead that some soldiers burns from the gunpowder had removed by ?
I mean  the man  the man who really fought against them  and  and  and who really  who really made their war machine weaker  I mean  they were heroes  but we  we  we were trying to  to scatter human beings you know around just to  to try to protect them.
And we wound up in a place called Weida  W-E-I-D- And we were bivouacked in a schoolhouse  and we spent the balance of the war there.
And if people wouldnt be that fanatic of religious  because a lot of people couldnt before the war  go to Palestine at that time  but they said no  they have to wait til the Messiah.
>> Bill Benson: In September 1940  your father returns to Paris.
Yes  after the war  we were  at the beginning in [indecipherable] and afterwards we came to Moroskot Shabawa .
I heard that  after we left  there was such pandemonium  and I think that this continued until the end of the war  there was never  nothing ever ran smoothly  it seems.
And we saw the situation in Poland like they start to be like Nazis.
After the war  while I was working for the Russians  I was able to find her somewheres wandering around in Germany  and I brought her to me.
Well  the way that I learned English is that two weeks before the war started  which was in September  all the British -- London  Manchester  all the major cities  the schoolchildren were sent to the country  voluntarily.
These are very important things and have affected the Islamic worlds view o-of Jews and America in the years since the end of World War .
What did you know about Hitler and Nazism in Germany proper at that time?
During my sophomore year in college  she met a Mr. Stark  Mr. Edward Stark  who had been a lawyer in Europe  came to -- and had been a prisoner of war in the pol -- in the Polish army  and came to the United States and went to -- back to school and got a Masters in social work and worked as a social worker.
Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 28 What other things did you tell people here about the war  besides the the rounding up of the people?
After the war in 1947  Bertle got notice that we had -- >> Bill Benson: Before we go there  I want to keep you back a little earlier if I can.
But as time went on  in 1939  Hitler decided to go to war.
My mother was assigned to teach in a school in another part of Poland and it was not until 2 years before the war when we were finally together.
And Kielce was a big town  a big city and had a lot of Jews before the war.
And after the war  she came and joined us  but both are buried in the Jewish cemetery in Ferrara .
Uh  the war was over at the place where I was on the 9th of May. That was the last day could be because the Germans were still doing something.
So in World War I  he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good administrator  so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsba d. And there he then later settled.
13 The horses were wounded from the war  but also not enough.
And the garrison  the German oc -- the German garrison in Limoge was not the same as it had been before June of 1944  because some of them were sent to the war front.
Uh  can you tell me about any of your recollections uh from your childhood  before the war began?
But ri ght when the war ended  he used to write letters.
How can you go in in an area where you dont know the terrain  you dont know anything about -- I think it was a lost war before it started.
I mean  I dont know if you are an active -- I mean like -- even things like  you know   the Vietnam War years or  you know  the Civil Rights movement or those kind of things.
Well  th-they looked after the war  and it took time til we got them.
After the war well  during the war  we already knew that some of our relatives are were killed.
Yes  he did that in the first World War  he he was a chemist.
When he was your age that you were during the war  you know a young child.
Because she she before the war  she traveled a lot  she was very probably a fairly rich family  so she was thinking she is going for a ride.
What I was trying to get at was that -- that same -- that same feeling it sounds like motivated you after the war of just not -- not -- not taking on responsibility in -- for something bigger than -- than what was within your sphere of control  in a way.
>> Bill Benson: Harry  of course  the war is ongoing elsewhere in Europe.
Well  after the war  we heard  we learned that her husband  who had been in the militia  a collaborator  had been gunned down in a theater.
I would like  with your permission to go back to the war time  because I'd like to know what happened during the war  to your family  to your father and to your mother.
But when we found out  we called some attention to it  that uh  hopefully the war will be over  and uh  they will not be too well-received after the liberation  and uh sometimes they changed and sometimes not   and we had cases after the war where people want to  to bring them to court  or they took uh care of themselves  and uh I was always against it  not to take revenge.
Can I ask you a few questions about back during the war now?
With your father  as you said  pretty w orn out from the war  a widower  how did you manage to go on and get that kind of education?
About 6 000 people we re assigned to that war production which was splitting that big rock of mica in to very thin slivers which were used for filters in the gas masks for the German soldiers.
That was the end of the war  and then the woman next -- across the street from us  she was a spinster.
One was nice Oh  the other reaction that says oh  now now now  we may have another war.
So I keep in touch with few of them that they rema in our friend  even that we couldnt -- but when they came -- when we couldnt during the war.
He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel  he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife  Zeporah  spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives  also her own relatives from her own family.
During the 1930s and the early 1940s th ere were a lot of political changes in Europe and then there was the war.
B-Before war -- was wa r or not war  villages in Poland was very friendly to people from the towns.
We all lived in Manhattan  and then my son went into the Army during the Vietnam War.
He just well  you know  they he and his family were sent to the same camp  which proves that they lived in Nuremberg the same time my parents lived the early days of the war in Nuremberg.
Here I was this little heathen who grew up in a war  hadn't really seen plumbing before.
And it was very hard for a family of eight or ten to go - nobody  no country in the world would take them  and of course we did not have the state or vision   so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there would be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity  have the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do.
Seeing my first pineapple in 1949 or so  in a store which was just sort of put there prominently and I not knowing what a pineapple was  so very simple foods after the war when  after things became  Holland was in horrendous shape because of the war.
From what I understand in a lot of those camps  23 I have an American that was in the camp and I worked with him after the war and he remembered me always used to have a lot of talks with me.
And when the war when the Interview with Ruth Rosicka October 22  1993 11war began between Germany and the Russians  means 41  they amnestied us  and we could go could go away.
And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the war is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life.
But in 41  the Russians occupied the country  and it was war and it was terrible  and when they settled already in the Baltic States  they confiscated everything.
And so my job was to flush out who did what to whom during the war.
There was a handful of Spaniards from the civil war  who the Germans captured somehow  one way or another from France  France turned them over to the Germans and there were Italians and there were a handful of Czechs and maybe one or two Greeks and that was it  so we were the first Jews in Mauthausen [not correct] and the first Jews in Ebensee and getting back to these building sections  when we finally reached the bottom one  under it was snow  in the middle of June.
>> Bill Benson: Up to the time that Germans occupied Hungary.
I remember distinctly that a few years before the war  there was a strike but they called it in Poland an occupation strike  which meant that they were permitted to come into the stores and occupy the seats that normally are reserved for the customers.
So from that point of view  s ome Europeans have learned a lot from World War Two.
When did you begin to tell them what happened to you during the war?
The person that I mentioned to you before  aga -- who -- who lives here now  she was a little girl  her uncle -- and she -- she -- most of her -- the war she spent with her grandmother  she tried to go -- they tried to get visas to go to Israel USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078 70and they could not get a vi sa and they could not get a visa.
So we been lay there for 3 days  4 days  we knew the war is coming to an end because we heard the cannons shooting and a lot of activity at night and during the day  and it came closer and closer.
No I think I  I almost finished the grade ten when the war ended.
>> Manya Friedman: Well  you see  all along we saw each other  how we looked outside  but after the war we found out how that affected our lungs.
This was already going on a few weeks into post war and no one was appearing.
I knew hundreds of Germans -- civilians and prisoners of war.
Theyre close by and also my father in a way  was privileged at the camp because my father was a German schoolteacher in his -- when he was young  World War I  and the German help him a lot.
They almost started -- the Russians coming to chase the Germans.
I thought pretty much once Paris was liberated  for us the war was over.
And we were all assembled in the in the big assembly hall and listened to a radio saying the war is over.
And did they talk about the war  or it wa s as if you people just put it back and you were si going back to 1941?
He came as a teenager  when he was 13 year old  to [indecipherable] trans-Carpathian  because it was a war in 19 -- with -- the first World War.
And they convinced them to come to Vineland  New Jersey and also start a poultry farm  which turned out to be a big mistake because although during the war those farms made a lot of bus iness  after the war that business really faded.
Yes  that he was a  a war criminal and but at that point not really interested in politics.
And...uh...finished the last grade which I believe was 6th and took my entrance examination to what was called gymnasium  beginning of high school  roughly equivalent in the United States.
That's why they were able ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 35 to do it.
I am not sure any more  but the Pareta was one of the first ships... Now was that at the beginning of the war  th e Pareta was around...?
Couldn't understand how th isand of course he very  very happy when she came back but in two months laterin two or three months la ter the GermanRussian war started.
But how did you feel living in Germany knowing that Germany was the one to start the war?
One of the officers  if I remember  was with us when we went in  but we didn't discuss that afterwards  because things were still popping  as you know  because that wasn't the end of the war.
She was  and then at a certain point  she became the housekeeper  maid for th e mistress  for the Latvian mistress for the head of the in Libau  and my moth er knew her from before the war because they used to meet at the same hairdresse rs called Marys.
Suddenly we were taken to a place called a new Berlin after the war.
And finally  he looks he looks up at me  he says  for you  the war is over.
And I said to the Jews  \ Was being a kapo a war crime?\  \
That was only a year before the Cold War broke out.
The Turks owned the -- Greece  and my -- my grandf ather didnt want his son to get mix in that war  and he send him there.
They tortured people during World War I and she described some horrible things.
And then the next days  or maybe a week later  as you probably know  that in the ghetto  there was a big advantage to being in the ghetto than the concentration camps because first of all the fami- lies were together and we didnt have any Germans there at night and the way the ghetto was established we had what we called the Judenraute (SP?)
Uh...My...my mother...uh...my mother had  in her youth when she was about 20 years old...uh...helped my grandfather to take care of the wounded in World War I  so she had a little bit of nursing training.
Lot of guys got killed  a lot of Germans got killed for it  because I don't know  some of the planes never took off because was all  it was  by the end of the war  I mean  you know  I think it was January or February or something like that in in uh 45 already  1945.
There was really not a -- not Jewish groups as such before the war.
And eh then found myself in a very large DP camp in Nuremberg eh which was cold eh eh eh which was prior to eh the end of the war which was a large complex of barracks.
do your work there  and then when the war ends -- And the war -- -- you go home.
Mrs. Schiff  would you please tell me about your reaction to the start of World War Two  while you were in America?
He of course didn't have -- >> Bill Benson: When you were liberated in early 1944  and then as you just told us your mother learns what happened to her parents  your other set of grandparents and your father  do you know at what point -- because the war would continue in Europe until May of 1945  almost a year and a half later.
People that talk the most are the ones who see the least because many of my doctor friends who were with me in the same unit -- we never discussed the war.
And I Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10  2001 73star I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the assassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war.
Each time very interesting reminder of the era that we all went through together after the war.
So we to ok and started walking because  you know  the war you no have cars  you no have nothing.
The Nazis  incidentally  had instituted a special labor offi ce for Jews shortly afte r the outbreak of the war  whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them  give Jews jobs mainly in the defense industry or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant work  like for example  the city garbage de partment  garbage pickup and similar things  and also they ride the railroads  certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the railroads on tracks and so on.
Anyway  she -- she was very young in those days  too  but she learned how to sew and later on she really made -- made her living sewing and even during the war  when we would get some pictures from her  she woul d show us the same dress that she had changed and every year its look different.
All the war films that came out were really like 60 something out of Peter Pan  they were so -- so ba nal  and so sentimental.
But when the Russians start to come to Poland and the Germans start to lose the war  th ey start to take apart the crem atoriums.
>> Bill Benson: At what age did really understand what happened to you and your family?
I do remember when the war began  I was walking down Tilto Gatv  and coming home from somewhere with my mother  and we heard like a muffled explosion somewhere.
This is in Ioannina now  there used to be there used to be two synagogues before the war.
And I figured that a country which does that  you know  which was attacked by Japan and then  by Hitler declaring war on America  so these soldiers who went and fought  fought for me.
Well  I mean  we can get into the psychological and psyche -- psychiatric aspects of this  but I-I -- who -- I played at war  and war was play  and it was not fearful.
But I was in the Battle of France when France lost the war  and to be -- only for a short da -- time  under fire  under -- under -- under the fire of guns  its quite an experience.
Because the Germans had in their mind to start to attack the Russians.
So  Paul and I got married an d the two fathers  Father Goldschmidt  Paul Goldschmidt  his ancestry was German but he had been three or four generations in Holland and Father Goldschmidt and Father Laqueur got together and said  ﬁThose kids are going to get divorced as soon as the war is over.
Husbands already came and managed to came back from the war  you know  because Polish army was -- and it was another aunt  the youngest one  with her husband  but they decided to go to Romania.
German patrols began appearing in our neighborhood dressed in what were known before the war as anti- [102] suits.
And we were liberated by the Russian soldiers and when they found all of us being so sick and weak and emaciated  they took the very  very sick ones into the local hospital and took the other ones that were not quite as sick and placed them into home s where the German Nazis ran away from when they saw that the war was over and they were afraid that th ey going to be caught and punished.
And was that -- did you have any sense of -- how did you know that -- that there was a -- that you didnt want that  that you wanted to be [indecipherable] Well  we knew what the Russians stood for  from before the war.
Life in continued after that expulsion un til another war broke out and that was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded .
And going going back to your experiences  and your children  when what did you tell your children about your experiences in the war  as a POW  and in Berga?
The war comes  and Jews are clearly segregated in some very significant way  what happens with that family and you?
What was that period like  though  to try to resume life in Paris  knowing there's still the war going on until the actual end of the war in 1945?
Was there any change in your life once the Germans occupied?
Not living in Americ What did you during this time  what did you know of the war  of the Holocaust that was occurring in in in the east  in Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania and also in the west?
So how long were you  as part of the military government operation  in Germany after the war?
Well  your next stop after Berlin  what was that and how -- how did you decide where you were going?
But my question is  how large was the community before the war  the Jewish community in Serei?
5 000 Jews in Dresden  60 alive at the end of the war.
And from that time I guess until the end of the war  we were hunted.
And the mayor said  th-the it its predominantly blacks in this program  and the official from the war on poverty Interview with Peter Masters September 25  1998 71office of economic opportunity said  as a matter of fact  its 50 percent white.
So after the war we went back home to Romania first.
I mean that is what you read in all the 19th century novels of kids of that age doing probably -- but I don't think that the war was related or more experience related --but more age related.
So I was not in fact w ith these people after the war but I know that most of them survived and live in Israel.
So  when the war was over  everybody seeked his own level  his own intellectual level  his own level.
So does that also mean -- did you not e xperience any anti-Semitism before the war?
When I was draft Were you drafted in the second World War?
During the Japanese/Russian War 6  under the Tsar  the Japanese  as well as the Russians  needed finances.
Every day  this was in '44 just before the war ended  they had some American and English prisoners and they would parade them and the Americans would go with the V sign and the Italians applauded.
It's such an unreal experience to a person who goes through the war.
And by the way  during the war we had -- everything was rationed.
The temples were burned; every Jewish store was broken up  and that's what it was  so that's what life was before the war.
Tell us briefly -- I know it's a lot of time  but in those years before you were arrested  but the war was on  what was life like for you?
Then the last day of the war I remember it was evening and I was kind of a precocious child and I climbed the barricade.
What else do you remember about the city before the war started?
But was it after the war started  or before the war started?
But soon  you know  the Germans  I think  invented the very first one.
SL: Listen  he wa -- he was in the -- in the soo -- in the war.
As I said either he had no documents  but I do not think so  because when Waldheim was running for the Presidency sud denly all the Socialists in Vienna  in Austria  had the documents on Waldheim and they used these documents hoping that with the past of Waldheim as a war criminal the Austrians would not vote for him  but unfortunately they did  thus the documents were kn own and certainly Wiesenthal had the documents too  but you know living in a country like Austria he had been close to the Party of Waldheim  believe me they met together at receptions  so it is embarrassing.
I mean  dont forget  in the meantime the war had started  the Sitzkrieg as it was called.
I also tutored my younger  my kid brother who was only six when the war broke out.
But in Sweden and in Mexico  again just to reiterate  your p arents did not talk about the war?
Interesting that after the war  and I'm ahead of my story  I found out that almost each Ghetto was operated on a different wave length.
H e of course was nothing at the end of the war.
My dream was to become a doctor  but I was too young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father  \ I want to take off this Hasidic clothing \  which I always hated  \ and to be like everybody else  to be a modern man.ﬂ But it didn't come til a year before the war.
I speak a little German because of the Yiddish that I know and I took some German at school.
From -- which in turn mean that it would be most foolish at that point  with Germany obviously losing the War  to hand them over the Jews and thus be branded as a collaborator of Germany and a very humanitarian issue  while by saving the Jews  Bulgaria could score some points in a future peace conference and get more 12 lenient treatment.
After the war Alex and his family were able to ret urn to Paris.
Was that just in your family or was that common during the war where you were?
At that time we did not know what was happening to them  but they were chased through certain 01:15:30 sections of town into the forest  a place called Rumbola and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large graves  mass graves  and when the people got there they were told to undress  put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile  clothing in another pile  driven to the edges of this mass grave  and machine-gunned.
And then they came b ack and they -- then went over Copenhagen  and we have heard about the bombardment of Wachau  in the year before  when the start of the war started  and afterwards  we got the -- the message that Hitler has threatened to bomb Copenhagen if we did not -- gave up and sign the treaty th at let -- he should take USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 10 over the power and -- and all this.
I remember we were at their house when the war broke out in Europe.
And all I needed is an official document from the Polish government  that I am buying that stuff for the use of the Polish government  because I bought this on the black market  I bought it on the prevailing prices of after the war.
So  thats how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another  and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story house with a store on the bottom for my uncle  a small apartment in the back  which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there  and then there was supposed to be two apartments upstairs  and that never got finished  of course  before the war.
And that was a big  big thing  especially during the war.
Which probably  or was that a difficult job after the war given the  the economy of the country?
4 But  in general  did the Jewish Community and the non-Jewish community mix  was there any sense of Anti-Semitism before the war?
>> Vincent Slatt: Then in 1941  in June  the Nazis declare war on the Soviet Union  right?
And one question is  how do you feel about the role of the Holocaust Museum?
Well  we spoke less and less when we went out  because when the war started  lot of people didnt like the Germans  so we tried to speak English when we went out.
He had been in the Pacific in the war  but never in Europe.
And so they were getting tryi ng to get as many people into the Ural mountain areas  you know  to to work on in war factories.
In fact  the Russian navy that -- th-the fleet that sailed around -- halfway around the world to fight the Japanese in the Russian Japanese war of 1904 started in Libau.
>> Bill Benson: Which is how you were able to survive.
>> Bill Benson: And they came to the United States after you.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 32 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Partisans  underground.
I cant answer that  because I n -- first I said yes  then I heard about all the war stories.
No  because the Japanese way of life -- we were looking as the people  the conqueror  the people who are better maybe  we won th e war.
But before the war they were still all like 16 - 15 - 14 years old.
And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all the serums -- of in..inoculations  of all the diseases you caught during the war.
This is where I lived after the war at my aunt's place.
It was I could say a schizoid existence  I mean since the Czechs were the ruling caste  you might say  my father wanted me to become Czech  which  he didn't realize it and I 3 only found out let's say decades after the war that you cannot become Czech  I mean you can be a citizen of Czechoslovakia but you have to be born in the Czech lines and you have to be Czech several generations back to be a Czech.
>> Bill Benson: War would continue in Europe until May of 1945  so a lot longer.
She was much quieter  and  of course  she I only knew her in really bad times  where I knew him afterwards   after the war  when his true self came 23 forth  you know?
It seems like it must have been so difficult to -- I mean when you describe yourself before the war  and you describe yourself as being Polish a nd thinking of yourself as Polish and Im just trying -- Jewish - Polish.
We were three sisters and I. We had had to work very hard because we got just a couple workers to help us on the farm and finally they said there is some...some...after the war in Poland  they were saying that it is a possibility that you get a worker from Poland  and my father put in the application to get some worker from Poland and we did.
We called the -- Lodz was called before the war  the Polish Manchester.
We were in the Philippines now when the war trials  the Japanese were going on.
Was all unofficial or illegal or -- but we were able to do that and the -- and they were a wonderful group of people  they -- these were guys who had been in the Jewish brigade  they had signed up with the British army during the war and theyd left Palestine and now they had giv -- that was their identity  their way to get back to their relatives.
Uh and uh also because the there was already a war going on in Europe uh by that time  of course.
I remind you also that not until 20 years later was there any criticism above the president at the time  President Roosevelt and the Congress for not  you know  opening up the door and saving people  which of course in retrospect we all realize should have happened but at that time  I mean we went  everyone  all the Jewi sh refugees and the non-Jewish refugees who came to America after the war found this a land of opportunity and equality and you know  place where you could start and didn't matter what you had been  if you wanted to become something you could and we were very patriotic about that and I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 32 internalized that very fast.
And -- and I was waiting  but the airplane never came  because its the first day of war  and the airplane was supposed to come from Warsaw.
You were eight years old at the end of the war.
Hes changed his name during wor -- World War Two  when he was serving in a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army.
But in mingling with other student s at the school or with other refugees or Holocaust survivors  did you talk about the war experiences at all  or was that put aside?
And so then you came back to the United States when?
You must understand that the enameled surface was done by the Jewish War Veterans.
>> Albert Garih: Well  you know  the restrictions lasted even after the war.
Which wasnt a factual statement  because it was very possible that Hitler might won the war.
That unfortunately  when the war ended and I left for my trip to Israel.
I think I've  I know myself pretty well now and I  I can tell   you know  where things are coming from more than just blaming it all on the war and everything of that nature.
They were really the fortunate ones  that when that ship came back  theyd bring these prisoners back  the German prisoners back.
Okay  now I want to turn to another subject; again  before the war.
No  after the war  after the war  after liberated I had to go to a Catholic school and boy did they push religion there and again  thats why in this country  this  this separation between church and state is so important because they dont have that in Holland.
Because we had never felt anything of the war until then  except for the racial laws  but we had attributed that to the war.
And they have been my father spent the war in the Soviet Union.
The Russians start the war with the Germans  so we were saying to the ger the Russians are coming to us.
And he served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. Correct.
Was your family  do you know if they were Zionists at all  at that time  your aunt and uncle?
I'll spend a little bit of time on life before Barbarossa  before that war  to set the stage  if you will.
I told after the second World War that somehow it will stab ilize.
But Eustache Radziwill whose married Jackie Kennedys sister  her  his father the old prince had been a client of my fathers before the war.
You were saying you did not believe what was written in the newspapers  so that means something was written in the newspapers during the war about what was going on.
I did not meet any of them after the war  and I dont believe that some of them survived in the Soviet Union.
Correct  correct  but the real the real change came in April of 1940  the next spring  during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war  nothing happening basically.
And it was devastating for her and for me too  it wa s disappointing because  and that was the end of '52  it goes into '53 and all of a sudden I'm drafted in the army  Korean war.
>> Bill Benson: So you had some semblance of family there.
From Poland   but not -- no  I met him after the war.
And then he came home happy thats who knew the war is going to be for six years  nobody Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 34knew.
He assured us that uh we will survive the war  and as we survive the war  he ask us to be human beings  to behave like human beings.
The Germans came into Holland on May the 10th  and the war was only five days.
During the war  talk about how you kept records  you tried to keep records for their parents.
In the beginning on the war  when in Iai the Jews start to be killed by the Romani...the same people.
I dont know which ca -- which y ear the war crimes took place.
So  you know  the whole thing is so that Im sure that the time - time will make it s job [indecipherable] and it -- and y -- if the -- the -- the exhibition of these objects is not convincing  [indecipherable] enough  in -- in -- in a couple of years  people will speak of these horrible things  as they mention ed today  the history of the three year -- th-thirty year war  1618 and 48  between Protestants and then Catholics.
She was -- before the war  he was the head of the family  he was the person w ho brought that money to -- to the family  yeah  supported the family  and she wa s a quiet lady  who loved books  to read a lot  and during the night even.
4 When was that incident with the -- This was probably in about '32  '34  1933  '34  about five years or so before the war.
They took me out and I was going maybe for a mile  and this time the war was coming close.
And just before the war started  the erm  his father died  his father left him everything in his will  so he had to go to Germany to erm  deal with that  and once hed finished he went to get a visa to get back to England  and they wouldnt give him one.
HL: There is a difference in understanding of certain things  which the people who came here before the war do not have.
I dont know  but I suspect that because -- and I suspect this because of the fact that I learned when Interview with Al fred Lakritz April 3  2008 52I visited Saint-Pardoux again -- and Ive done that several times after the war  I learned then that there were several Jewish families in -- that lived around or in the hamlet  around the hamlet.
We never was suppose to go to synagogue until you're married so I never 8 went to synagogue because when I married  the war was on and Ive never gone to a synagogue.
Form formal things  and then what was what I was doing during the war  and so on.
In po -- was very bad in Poland lately  after the war  you know whats happened in Poland.
But I -- I absolutely did not understand the war  Korean War  I didnt understand.
I know in the Civil War  we just didnt throw slogans  and won.
The Germans had excuse for the war that we are all Communists.
And last but not least  I cry for the millions of people that you lost in this war.
I think some friends took him for a few days  an d then he was placed in an orph anage with the children of the Polish officers who perished du ring the war.
But were all these bodies from the last battles of World War two  or were -- what was the -- [indecipherable] yeah  probably.
Originally a Hungarian city  located in an area which became part of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
If not more than collaborated and immediately after th e war  took off for Argentina.
1944  March  if I remember it  19 th  is when the Germans had serious doubts apparently  that Hungary is not a trusted ally anymore  that Hungary probably entertains the idea of getting out of the war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and the situation in Italy was very shaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in a very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944  October.
If youre saying its when Germany itself was being bombed  or Well  the mass mass bombing  you know  it started where the Americans declared war  when was this  19 Forty-four  so thats late.
It has to be the people that -- just as a comparison that -- what I can say now is that pre-World War II and during World War II  America would not let any immigrants in -- or Jewish immigrants into the country.
And then during the war  he had to leave the business in Offenbach and move  to move the business into Frankfurt.
In 1952  finally  long after the war  seven years after the war  I found out on my own...I was sta tioned with the U.S. Army in West Germany and I took a three-day pass to Paris.
I started at I was 15 and I ended when I was 17  when the war came  I was almost 17 when the war came.
But a rumor was that the Russi an front was nearing from the east and of course later on  we found out in Auschwitz that all these labor camps that were situated in this heart of Poland  that did war production for the Germans were liquidated about the time we were.
Only  oh  less than a month from the end of the war in Europe and I had to do some import -- I mean some essential work  so I worked for the -- really some clerical work  a filing clerk in London for a time.
I photographed it in Kolomyja four years ago when I first visited for the first time af ter the war.
And some of my -- my confreres  including myself  were leery about the fact that we would be going to war.
Every Jew...the Jewish community 02:36: had to pay up the taxes from 1914.
And he kind of helped me out and this is how I stayed on til the end practically  two months before the war ended.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- your father was a remarkable man.
So she told me after the war why my mother was so sure that I will survive.
At least this was a general war  not a war waged against three people.
And then  they tried to keep us in United States  but they said that president doesnt want its during the we were in the war already.
While I was in the kibbutz in Czestochowa  I was working on one of the farms  which before the war belonged to the yout h organizations.
So from jail my brother was shipped to a concentration camp in Spain  where they had their own -- just got over Civil War in Spain  Civil War from 1936 to 1939.
In this area is where you spent your war years hiding with a false identity Thats true.
So  I started to ask questions and their name was Weissburger  so I stopped someone on the street and I asked  ﬁDo you know where the Weissburgers live and did any of them come back?ﬂ And the person said  ﬁOh  yes ﬂ he said  ﬁthere are two brothers that survived the war and came back ﬂ-- excuse me -- and showed us where to go.
But then when the war broke out and after the end of Interview with Guenter Lewy 26 March 18  2013 World War II  all the Israeli students had to leave.
And after the war -- and -- and -- when it came out  Hans Baron was his name  Baerchi he was called at school  he -- he was sent back from the army -- he was in the army and as his father was then a Jew  so he was sent from -- and he was not in 79 the army and he was denounced once  because he was walk -- walking about -- that hes a deserter. [
But this was already when my father was in the army.
But later  I remember shefor me was not kosher  nonkosher  but I soimmediately after the war I became skeptical about religion immediately.
He came  his parents had moved from Vienna to Berlin  they were Austrian Jews  but the parents were  of course  born before World War I like all of our parents and before World War I  the Austro-Hungarian Empire included southern Poland and particular ly  most of Galicia  the province  and his parents actually were orthodox Jews from Ga licia who had  however  left there I think before the war already and settled in Vienna and so they were then  by citizenship  they were Austrian Jews and they came to Berli n  it might sound strange si nce Austria at that time was still a democracy  but his father had some business  I think he sort of administered buildings and as an Austrian  he was not subject  he was a foreigner  foreign Jews were not subject to all these antisemitic laws.
I don't think in that se nse it's any different from any of the people who came up in post war Germany and were interviewed.
He indicated in conversations about the war  I learned he and I talked about his career.
Sort of getting a little...Well...three years in the camp became progressively worse as um  raw material was running out  and also as uh it seemed th at the war was taking a different turn.
And while we were there  my uncle  in the meantime or yeah  I I had to get a new passport which eventually I I got from the Germans  of course  you know  with the new photo and a big J stamped into it again  J for Jew.
So my stepfather and my uncle  he was very young when he was wounded in the war  you know?
Should that happen every time theres an -- an ethnic war going on?
Now  the DPs who came  also didnt have the education  because Germany inv ited -- invaded  you know  much earlier  and they looked at me  and I guess they thought we were stupid  and they just put us in the same pot of the people who ga -- dont fo rget  during World War Two  there was no immigration  and they pu t me to put piecework.
O.K. So after the war star ted  what were you doing?
Well  the colonel who swore us USHMM Archives  RG-50.549.02*0007 29in tipped [indecipherable] over it and put down Army of United States  sent it to the war department of Washington.
It was from the beginning of 42 until probably early 43.
We all had a very bad time before the end of the war.
I usually  I mean I started going to school in the village where we lived  that was during the war and that was pretty traumatic to me b ecause the teacher was Ukrainian and he was  I Edwarda Rorat 12 February 25  1996 Page 12 was the only Jewish kid in the class and he hated my guts.
>> Josie Traum: At the end of the war when she came back to Belgium  she was able to correspond with him.
They took me for a few weeks into a unit which watched enemy war...uh enemy aircraft  in training  of course  because nobody expected a war.
And but it was a coincidence to be in the train  because she was a neighbor of a friend that was a a prisoner of war camp with me.
And in the end  Jerry he got fed up with it  he didnt bother no more [DL] So this was a punishment in retaliation to what the Allies had done during the war [AG] Yeah  yer... [DL] And  and this was just a random punishment... [AG] Yeah [DL] ...without purpose? [
You know  y -- I -- and I -- I -- Ive -- Ive -- I -- I -- the only rea -- a nd theres nothing on paper  and he never discussed it  but Ive read documentation to say that  you know  World War veterans were -- were released with an understanding.
My -- ma -- my older brother  of course  was in Israel all the time.
And there were some other children who are friends of my parents  who were born after the war.
It had a synagogue which  of course  was destroyed during the war.
So this talk about We had the some pact with France and England  if some Germany would have attacked us  they are going to go to war straightaway.
So  did you feel that the war is almost s-starting at a certa -- certain point?
I was happy that my brother came to Terezin in the uniform of U.S. Army because when he flew from this  when they moved from the Malyy-Trostenetz concentration camp and when the war was ended  and he got  I don't know how  to the U.S. Army because he was speaking very well English  he was helping  and he came to  with the U.S. Army to Czech country and then it was only possible  he came to look if we are alive.
So  after the war  the the people who owned the home were fleeing themself.
That's all because they were quasi-recent immigrants having been displaced during World 2 War I and they came to this area after that but my father's family had lived there for many  many years so my mother's family was more scattered and the rest of her family was in different places.
I think they just thought it was Jewish -- Jewish and -- Jewish connotation  I think  even -- even while the war was right there  still hot.
So with that  my mother turned to me and she said  \ You know  we fought all this time so that we have our family ho pefully together again and we suffered all of this and then  now that t he war is over   we found out there was no reason to fight and to suffer  because there is no family left.
>> Bill Benson: He won the Iron Cross in the Fi rst World War?
His mom was widowed in World War I  so the older two immigrated to the United States way before World War II.
When you got the war is over  you go back to Milan   theres no more military  theres no more I go to Padua .
A ll of a sudden one day we were  I was plowing I remember  and I had to have al ways a guard on my tractor wi th a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so cl ose to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp  an Is raeli POW camp  guarding Arabs during the War of Independence  so he le arned some Arabic from them.
Had they been people So  I sort of [break] in the middle of the war  Nazi a Nazi truck came to Wertheim and to all the towns in that region  and they picked up all of the je the birth records of the Jews and took them away.
The first time I was supposed to go to Israel was in 67  and the war broke out.
Because we were in a turmoil  we didnt know whats what  whats going to be  because in ‚38  a-already  the anti-Semitism was very high in Poland and they were t-talking about the war  whats going on and Hitler was taking Czechoslovakia at the time.
And I remember  the Robinsons  whose original name was Robinowitz  said at the big outbreak of the war  if the Nazis -- if the Germans set foot in England  we're going to turn on the gas.
27 As a matter of fact  when things changed in Romania after the war  some of those people who taught elementary school or high school kids  turned out to be  in fact  scholars of high capacity in Romania  mathematicians who were rec ognized immediately and made into university professors.
And this show had very good critiques  but somehow Interview with Hedi Pope November 6  1997 55we being refugees and foreigners  with the war breaking out  it was all a bad situation.
So h After the independent war in Israel  I think that thats when he found me.
You but you s you did say someth ing  that you thought the war influenced you even to become a doctor.
>> Gideon Frieder: In 1944  it was clear to anybody that Germany would lose the war.
And thats why were doubly appreciative that you have ag reed to do it  agreed to tell us your story  and have it available for many people who youll never know  but who will have a better understanding of what a youn g  nine year old girl had to face when the war started  you know  and what she lost.
Interview with Tole Madna April 18  2002 35 So you went back to school after the war?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 >> Bill Benson: Of course  the following year  September  Germany invades Poland  World War II begins  then of course the following spring  in May of 1940  Germany invades Paris  then occupies France  then occupies Paris.
Do you remember when you were originally sent to that camp?
I have no other photographs of of anyone else  but that...and when the war was over there was some already institutional things started and one needed papers and so I went to a photographer and had a picture taken.
The war started in 39 and they came in the beginning of '40‚ The Germans did?
All of these Gentiles you were sort of friendly with before the war  what were they doing?
We found people like the mayor of Berlin    and many  many others whom I got to meet after the war.
So I came there  the Ge rman consulate  at that time  Am erica was not at war yet  so the Germans still had the consulate here.
Especially during the war  we kept hearing him  because he did the Dutch  the Belgian and I think one of the Nor-Nordic countries.
Can you tell me a little b it about -- you know as much as you can remember -- about the invasion of Poland by the Germans in 1939?
So this was just right before the actual beginning of the war years.
Anyway  this is only besides the point  and as I didn't talk  now this I considered the only heroic thing that I did through the war because my father and the three of us made up not to talk.
And we are talking of the year of 1944 -- ‚45.
And the crematorium there was Ive been there a few times after the war  after I been out of there  and they still have the hooks on the wall where they used to hang the prisoners  and they would cut them  their legs and bodies  and bleed let the blood drain out of them into the drain  because then they would burn them in the crematorium upstairs  and they had these little trollies that theyd lay them on and wheel them up there  and then wheel them into these chambers up Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 42there  had about  I dont know  eight or 10 of these cremation chambers up there  wheel them in there and cremate them.
As I said  people that he knew Rum-cof-ski and people that supported his orphanage before the war  when they came to the ghetto he was very ge nerous to these people.
I was the one  especi ally in the war  that I used to go around in different towns for merchandise.
I placed the baby at that time with them with the understanding that after the war somehow so mewhere I will get the baby.
They wouldn't have been able to do that during the war.
After the war my mother wanted to know what happened to her family.
They were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 going to have several things.
And I think all of us fe lt that  at least the World War II people pretty much.
This whole idea might have s ounded good on paper  but it was  of course  done mainly in order to smash the voice of th e workers and to enable German industry to increase production and mainly war producti on  without any disruptions.
And  uh  it was wonderful  and then  in the days  what we took there  we went out to swim  and I met a lot of Germany also  and one of them was  uh  a young man  who exchanged cards  and my name was Mandel  and then years go by and there is the war  and the Nazis are in Budapest  and suddenly the ------------- in my house  and I look out and I see a uniformed man  and my parents were  I mean  shaking.
They were looking to find a way in some way do something for their life after the war.
I said to him I know that there are these pris on of war parcels that soon will rot  that are showing up in the French black market.
Not they Finns didnt became Nazis at all  they were allies during the second World War with the Germans  but they still were a democratic country  and had nothing to do with the Nazi ideology at all.
And we were tearing down -- see the Russians had attacked Estonia -- was it -- first a Jew -- no.
Somehow or other  I don't recall how  they found out that I was Jewish.
She -- he was walking the streets  he thought that the war was over.
So at that time she went  my family found out that she came so they sent me a picture  family picture was taken about a month before the war and they sent me a challah and something else.
And I recall my father sending parcels to these relatives that were actually  you know  taking ba -- taking it to -- to Russia  and these actually survive d. And I remember them after the war  you know  that they actually survived.
So we didnt we were not prepared for any kind of war.
Yes  sugar beet cookies  because when she learned to bake that during the war  I even dreamt about that  and thats quite a leap from looking at an elegant table.
And even  I thought  I mean  even even Napoleon  whe really a reasonable military leader  he did things  and I thought well  Biržai will be also in history like Jaffa  you know  some cruelty which happens during th e war  you know  without any reason  something well  what do you mean  I m ean Jews were hiding weapons.
When people talk about the first World War  I glaze over a little bit  it's somewhere there before I was born and you know how things are before you were born  they're ancient history  they have no relevance.
Now  Holland was always neutral  in World War One was -- we were ne utral still.

There was a radio in the apartment and a te lephone  and I think the radio and the telephone belonged to Mr. Berman because he had privile ges by reason of an intermarriage  and two sons I think they even were on the Wehrmacht  if Im not mistaken  la ter in the war  and so he had the privilege of radio  but it was not a short wave.

I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know  when the war began in the first week of September  my father  who had somewhat impaired vision and was also Jewish  for both those reasons was not draf ted into the Polish army.
I didnt even finish elementary school and we started on a much higher level  because firs t we finished the books that were home and then she proceeded -- thats  by the way  through the ghetto -- what Im starting telling you now is still as the war broke out and were facing the new reality.
I mean -- Well  sometimes it was kind of difficult to go against your own and for the Germans  but this wa-was not the war any more.
Well  thats right  she was protecting me in the sense that they deci ded that some of the things I was during -- doing during the war  was endangering myself.
But I dont remember going to church very often with them.
While you were in this camp  did you have any idea of how the war was going outside?

Q. Did you think the war was going to end soon  did you think maybe finally?
In winter  we used to go skating and and had some and with sleds  you know  had s very war it used to be also beautiful in the sense that we used to go out and and had the wintertime  you know  with horses and sleds and it was a remarkable it was a very interesting and and very joyful life   yeah .
We felt that the great danger was that when Germany lost the war  which we hoped then we would be considered as the people who helped Nazism.
This was now  at the very end of the war  the spring of 1945  and they knew they had lost the war  the Germans  and they  the jails were overfilled  and Bram Pays was uh  invited by Neils Bohr to study in  in Denmark  and he had uh  I had a letter  and uh  ju st as he said  they did have some respect for scientists  maybe  and they let the girls go  they couldn't prove they were not Jewish because by now the Cadaster  where everybody was registered  so that you could check if somebody had a false passport  you could check if the counterpart was in the city hall.

Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 39 I didnt think about it  and it was fa r  far away  and the news we were getting from war communiques provided no clue of the direction or success of German penetration of Russia.
L et's start the conversation today with you telling us a little bit about your family  your community   and you before the war began.
So  I dont know if they knew them before the war  or if they became friends after the war.
Jew -- Jewish people suffere d the most  you know  during the war.
There was a school  Le College Cevenol  which had been created as a private school before the war and they saw to it that we went to school every day and that we get on with our education.
On the train home I kind of said  ﬁNo way do I want to do that.ﬂ But then after the war  people wanted me to meet a friend and so on.
It was a Jewish progressive school run under rabbinical supervision until the beginning of the war.
So there was a lot of people that died after the war  on account of the liberation and eating things that th-their stomach was not equipped to handle.
But then that ran out  and that was still -- the war was st ill on.
And uh  when the war was over I guess we were being asked whether we wanted to go back.
Were you ever  you know  as the war starts getting closer  were you ever treated poorly  or differently because you were German?
So now Germany invades Poland in September 1939  what are your memories of that?
The war would  another  another six  eight months  I don't know if America would be still America if he would succeed.
I: So your uncle before the war was a rabbi in frankfurt amein  was he a refugee before the holocaust?
Omega particularly was very successful before the war  and my father was had a partner [indecipherable] finance his cousin  or whatever.
My father came before the war  so his experience was growing up in America from late teenage-hood on  here  as his brot hers and sisters  who had been farmed out from Germany before the war.
They had been getting together one against the other keeping -- they didn't know what was going on until Churchill got into the act and started World War II.
And these people  probably some of them were on the Nazi side [indecipherable] because they lost the war  not on the American side .
What you were feeling at that time  how did you learn the war was over  because that's a pretty important . . .
Okay  and let me ask you one more thing ab out Vienna during those time s  in doing some of the reading and preparation for meeti ng you and talking with you  I understand that there was a fair amount of anti-Semitism in Vienna after World War One  did you experience it?
And at first I could not go to school because I was war work  so you had to work long hours.
That's when the underground ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 got involved in it  said  Don't go back.
Before we turn to the war and the Holocaust and the earliest years of the Hitler regime  tell us about your family and you in the years before 1933.
during the war...duri ng the war it was like one Jew wanted that  so he answered him  and Adam asked him what should I do.
And maybe that was one less gun that was used in the war  who knows.
So basically I had a mixed group of friends  I think.
And -- okay  Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 111and th-the war year were some kind of an interruption.
I wrote -- anyway -- Was it important that you both had similar experiences during the war  that she was in hiding as well  or did that -- was that not even part of the conversation?
At th -- it was never explained to me  and I -- Ive asked my -- I have some cousins in Australia from my mothers side  and they dont know.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 >> Bill Benson: Start  if you don't mind  Morris  by telling us just a little bit about your family and your community before the war began.
The day the war was declared my father and my mother were in France.
Th e war was over in five days  not because the Dutch couldn't fight but the Netherlands is not a country where you can fight.
And they -- they look at me like I [indecipherable] messenger that -- that the war is finished  you see  because they ent -- in they room  they enter not a German.
And the picture Interview with Al fred Lakritz April 3  2008 146is part of the aftermath of the war to the city of Kiel  and it shows  you know  a very -- I have a copy I have included here -- a destroyed city during the winter in a very heavy snow  and youve got a bunch of pe ople who are walking on foot in this desolate  terrible  abysmal area of the remains of the city of Kiel.
But of course  you know  people are optimistic and -- and still the war came unexpected  the bombing.
Especially after having taken part in three wars and having a five and a half year old son  whom I wanted  unlike me  to taste life especially in his formative years  in a country  where at least the country itself is not at war or is not the passage ground of occupying forces and things like that.
But  you know  I protested the Vietnam war  and I supported ending it.
Why we didn't go away from Hungary  I have no idea because I had a cousin  my late father's late brother who died also before the war  who immigrated to Argentina.
War began  of course  when Germany invaded Poland  September ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 1939  then Nazi Germany would invade France the following May of 1940.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 35 Oh  okay  I left le -- I went from Liege to Brussels  war torn -- first of all  I had trouble getting a passport  because Czech -- where I was born became Russia  and we were told we could remain Czech or become Russian  and we found out my father could not remain Czech because he had not served in the armed forces.
No  no  but I mean y-you had people to -- to -- to wa -- even when you were -- Yeah well  all -- all the time -- -- during the war you still had [indecipherable] -- also afterwards -- -- this is -- yeah. --
You were telling me a little bit more about the ghetto.
After the war  it became the Transcarpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR.
Of all the Jews  as far as I know  there is only one other survivor  an older lady who lives in the United States also  and there are some other survivors  but these are people who made their way from our hometown in an illegal way as the war started.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 55 I want to ask about the speeches and why you come here  but be fore  do your children know a lot of your history and wha -- and what you did during the war  and if so  when did you tell them about it?
And those 20 years between 1918 and 1940  or 39  when war started  it was a very intensive development.
The prisoners -- the Russian Army did not fight very much.
After the war  how did the operation affect your plans to marry?
After the war she came once to visit that I was wum -- I was married already  as I mentioned  we were not in -- we were not -- how you say it in English?
But he was hidden himself because he belonged  he was a spy  so his wife went to visit him every week there and after the war he had a hard time to get a life again  because he was dead for the co mmunity  for the you know  do you have that too  maybe?
Oh  when we ended the war  basically th e 8th of May  we m oved southward about 50 miles into an area of occupation  and it was at that time we were notified that the 30th Division was prioritized to come back to the States and have a 15day leave and do some 30day training and go to the Paci fic and help finish the war in the Pacific.
And then -- yeah  an-and -- and then you -- you -- and you -- were -- you were still interrogating German soldiers?
But still  we were thinking  so much blood for this system  which was  you know  so much so much war  and so much revolution and everything for the Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 93 system   and finally  just fell.
The third day-- the prosecutor was a German who suffered an awful lot during the war.
He h eard it after the war and of course by that time  I could  I understood the whole situation better.
Well then they took us to the  to a small  we had factory  big  for the war.
The buildings were built when I visit after the war  the walls were most likely close to a meter wide.
And when -- wh enever  you know  there were moments of difficulty  or -- or sadness  or po-potential difficulties  we -- I do remember fairly early on after the war  visiting the woman who had hidden my sisters  where my sisters had been hidden.
The factory  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 29 within one week was operational for war production.
So I think proba bly as as things were beginning to develop  I remember discussions of the Sp anish Civil War  that would be what  in the late 1930s.
Did you have the sense around that time that   that the end of the war was coming close and that you were going to survive?
They just thought I was a German prisoner of war for three and a half years and that was it.
Reese  after -after the war  after he came back to the United States  he made some trips to -to Israel and became very friendly with especially with my brother.
Had to start the war  and the [indecipherable] I dont know.
Ma -- after the war in Danzig  my father was still the -- the -- the Catholic  you know?
And of course there is more to add to it and if -- as we go into um  the war years  and the Holocaust and all of the -- all of the atrocities  if something comes to you where you want to go back to describing something pre -war  that's fine.
Its interesting you say that  because Ive had interviews where people say  ﬁThey didnt fear the Germans so much as they feared  esp ecially in Poland  their neighbors.ﬂ Because the Germans seemed  according to these people who Ive talked to  seemed not to really know who was Jewish.
But she was sorry  so after the war she met me and she was sorry that she sque aled  it was too late.
You were just about to talk about going to Belgium right after the war  and ad -- looking for your family.
We were  all of you know the war ended in May of '45  May 5  1945 in in Europe and we went back to - we had nothing.
Rovno the city of Rovno remained under the Russian government after the war  because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed hands back to Poland.
So  a family outside of our city  a uh  actually a duke and duchess  have accepted her as another one of their daughters  and my sister had spent the uh war with them.
It was not like living in Paris  which was ground zero for the war.
The end of the war because I remember when the end of the war came and my father came to the school that day and he said we are going to have to go out and celebrate and we went out to the movies.
So I was very familiar with German -- and I had never lived in Germany  but still coming to Germany -- except in the concentration camp  I was familiar with their way of talking  with their way of thinking.
We wanted to know the effect of the war on you  and I think your statement does that.
And he felt the war will end an d on the [indecipherable] but Im guessing  just.
But also  he didn't know that my mother told me this  when we were  you know  it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said  just remember  if God forbid we should get separated you see  never thinking that whats going to happen  that its going to be this mass killing  but just separated.
One of the big problems of the War Refugee Board was th at the government gave them no money.
Matter of fact  I sent some pictures to the holo -- gave some pictures to the Holocaust Museum with those people who perished  after the war  finally coming back after the concentration camp  and they killed them.
And he survived the war  was liberated by the Russians  got into Berlin  was appointed President of the Cosavillan Academy.
I think it was before the SS decided to put the regime to work in the war industry and they took the ability in Austria  the industry facility  needed prisoners.
>> Bill Benson: During that time  during those war years that you were in Kenya  do you know if your family members  parents and other family members  adults  did they have any contact with the family that were still in Germany?
Did you speak -- Did you speak to your children about your war experiences?
So for all intents and purposes  your father was survived the war  but he was out of the picture Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21  2015 15 Right.
He immigrated to 44 Israel as a youngster when he was 17  before World War II.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 It then became law that all the German Jewish men had to have these jobs of replacing people who had to go fight in the war  Army duty.
So its  again  the people who had we were sorting out who was a real security risk  who was on the war crimes wanted list that was put down put out by all the countries  sorting things out  and these were primarily the guys  the Ritchie boys.
Did you reflect during that time a lot upon your life in Germany and the events that had led up to your leaving?
There were people who survived years of war in the Ukraine and they were not about to die just a fe w days before liberation.
Well  I was...uh...as I say  I was 13 when the war broke out.
When did you when did you start finding out more because there was this reticence  when did you start finding out more about what had gone on during World War II when you were a child  and putting together these these dots?
We want to remember that the Holocaust takes place in the middle of an even larger conflagration Called World War II.
Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12  2009 69But it was it was not very different from anti-Semitism that you might have before the war.
Uh  what we thought at that time is this is a war between Poland and Germany  and that's about the end of it.
She was born in Albania during the war and her mother was saved because they also -- what she has been doing for Albania is when there are youngsters who have been diagnosed with a disease for which they dont have any treatment in Albania.
What happened in Second World War or when the Russians came in?
>> Sam Ponczak: Well  the war started by aerial bombarding of Warsaw.
teachers  profes sors  the best people and just when they saw that the war is already over.
Of course  I had seen photographs and incidentally  the family  after they heard that we survived the war  they sprang into action and send us lots of care packages  together with clothes  together with food.
So that I remember  because she went through World War I  orphan and all that stuff  so she knew what was waiting us  you know.
They must know how it was difficult in the war and what for  for what reason.
Indeed  before the war he had the possibility to emigrate to what was then called Palestine but he decided to stay with his community.
>> Bill Benson: So when the war ended in Belgium in 1944  you're with the Debrackelaers  and one of your aunts -- >> Josie Traum : Yes.
But I kept up my contact with my Jewish friends  and in fact  I was Bar Mitzvah in Berlin in 1941  two years after the outbreak of World War .
I have earlier memories of the school that I went to which was a Jewish school.
It was a nice rich before the war  it was a nice Jewish home  so they took it over when they threw the Jews inside the ghetto.
So  between the local left overs that were involved and between the retreating armies  those who didn't want to become prisoners of war  this is where they choose that life.
So I stayed with [indecipherable] Usas  and Mama took my fathers war medals a nd went to see our Prime Minister  Kubilunas.
There were more German people what say they were -- o-okay in the war and they got everything.
Just the fact that you survived and that you feel this course we all knew Americas gonna win anyhow  so yeah  especially with Gisela you know  who was saying me Im telling you  once the American comes come  the war is over.
And who would expect that the most civilized country in Europe -- nobody believed -- just the Germans who didnt believe it -- that last long  so that we  who lived under the Germans in the first World War  we were waiting for them.
Before the war  this used to be the ...the....also a \ ambulance\ --like social...social medicine station [ NB: perhaps \ ambulatorium\  (Pol)  an outpatient facility of a hospital].
Yet during the war  before we left  we had to take in into a spare room another fellow which was not Jewish; and he lived in our house.
And after the bad taste during the war with the police  you know  that stuff  I said  \ Forget it.\
He was caught at the end of the war and he perished himself  not being a Jew  but being treated as a Jew because he helped the Jews.
It seems like your early days  your affluence  your family education  all of that really helped you survive the war years?
And that hurts but I suppose that is inevitable  and so we are the last dying breed because when the war broke out I was 11 which means I was old e nough to remember what was going and young enough to attain my present age and talk about it.
And in real life they were not allowed to kill Jews  but if they caught the Jews they killed them.
Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23  2014 32 Did your parents know what was happening to the Jews in the 1940s in Europe?
And then ...then when the war came  to France  1939  we have really also suffered much.
Are you angry that you had to go throu gh the terrible war experiences that you did  and other people  for instance  over here  didnt have to?
There were such schools after the war  to make evening classes for working people.
I-I-I w ould like to make a few sort of post-script comments concerning the period of time before the start of World War Two.
Uh you have to remember that mean while the uh Axis had declared war  the entire Axis declared war on the Un ited Stateq  uh and I sk ipped here something very important and that is that in uh May  May 8th  1940  the American consul had finally invited us to come to Naples to receive ou r visas to the United Stat es.
No  only my grandfather on my fathers side who of course died before the war did observe the Sabbath and that was about it.
Did you know -- did you know where your moth er was at the very end of the war?
And they  you know  during the war my ears were very long.
So but you di d get a civilian job as an interpreter after the war with the military government?

He hopped  he put a string of his own  the loop you know over his  the noose  whatever it's called  over his neck  and to the assassin  the Gestapo  he said you are not going to win a war by killing me\  and somebody pushed or he pushed a chair from under his feet and I remember his body dangling like this.
Marta was the one who heard from Jacob that he -- when he got orders for the execution  that he stayed the execution  that he was -- he knew  as well as we knew  that the Russians are coming  that the war is ending.
>> Bill Benson: Did your parents or any other family members try to leave Yugoslavia before the Germans came in?
I mean  the whole  the whole truth came after the war  after liberation.
So  in Lithuania  of course that after the war  first World War was finished  a lot of small countries claim their right to be independent state.
You know  we've tried to get this for years but during the war we couldn't get it  and so on.
By this point was he talking more about what his experiences had been and his views had been during the time th you know  i-in Lithuania when the war started  or not so much?
And next came my brother Reuben  who survived the war  still lives in Boston now.
Before we end your--talking with you  are there any specific incidents or episodes from   during the war period or from before the war pe riod  that stand out in your mind  that you might not have mentioned?
Had you heard of a man named Hitler at that point?
This is all that I have to say for now about my early life  and the years during the war.
In the -- just before the war  they were getting the -- squeezed constantly  worse and worse.
And even before the ghetto you Even before the ghetto  yes.
Thank you very  very much Judge Calabresi   for agreeing to meet with us today  and to share your story  and to let us have a little window into the experiences that you and your family had during those terrible and turbulent years of World War II  and pre-World War II.
I remember when the war was over  we celebrated by having onion sandwiches.
This boy was living in the village where he lived before the war and he stayed overnight every night somewhere else.
Why a farm and not any other kind of employment  because you see  as a  as a youth organization  as a Zionist organization  even before the war we prepared ourselves to refarm workers to live on a kibbutz in  in later Israel  so that's what we wanted to do.
I didnt know about the war  but I probably would have gone out to be a soldier.
And Wh-Wh-When did you leave Germany and how long were you there?
I would ne ver think of saying  ﬁYouve got to hear my story.ﬂ I myself wasnt interested in my story when the war ended.
What...what did it feel like to you  during the war  when you were...you had Raphaele.... You had false papers in Raphaele's name  while Raphaele kept your own papers?
I have -- We do have one couple that they -- the woman was in Auschwitz and her husband lived -- hes also from Germany  but he lived in Israel during the war.
Yes  from my father particularly because he was in World War I and the stories that he told about that war were easily translated into what was going on there now.
Especially when the Germans marched into Russia  he said that'll be the end  that's the end of the war.
But in 1938  life started to get a little bit easier already  before the war.
I had a lot of friend s who were Jewish  I had that friend who I told you that saved my life   that was not Jewish  but s he learned Jewish and during the war she used to go to my grandfather and do a lot for Jews.
Cause the Germans took advantage of every -- of every able body since all of their -- their men were in the army  you know  so they used Poles and Jews and Ukrainians  and -- for whatever labors -- requirements they had  or they felt was -- was necessary for the war effort  you know.
Where did I come when I came home from th e war?
And di-did -- I mean  I -- w-was there a big increase in Jewish settlers there after World War II  or -- You mean -- you mean -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 74 I just wondered if a lot of se -- -- in ge -- in general?
Mother always said not to give way that we should hold up and maybe in the near future the war will end and we will survive the war and this was our daily hope.
The war is still on  and I can't take care of you.
Also from what I understand  what I found out afte r the war and had confirmed several times  the children who did not have a parent or parents to come back to after the war  what he did - instead of leaving them in the monasteries to become good Christians  he took them out an d handed them over to the Jewish agencies.
Th ere was Korea but it was far away and it wasnt our war.
But unfortunately during t he war my mother felt that it probably was best that she stayed married to him.
And we kept Jackie  the oldest one -- we kept during the whole war.
But  you know  when we came--when we came--then right away to war.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 >> Bill Benson: When did you know that  for you  the war was over  for you and your sister?
And the man  which -- now known  the man  head of the -- Eduard Schulte  a man who was at the h ead of a very big mini ng concern  Giesche and Company  who occupied thirty thousand workers for the war  who had access to the highest authorities.
Well  Goering  you know  had the Amer ican press  you know  during the war you know  after he didn't win the Battle of Brita in  he his Air Force did nothing in DDay  so he  you know  was the anointed successor to Hitler from almost the start of the party until those events  and he lost Hitler's favor  and he started on narcotics  got fat  and he was sort of portrayed in the American press as a buffoon.
He was a known policeman because before the war he was a very known box-man.
And then they said  ﬁNo  no  were going to celebrate  because its the end of the war.ﬂ And she said  ﬁI dont believe you  but if its really the end of the war  I will buy you another case.ﬂ So  we went out to the main square  because no one had radios  we went out to the main square and after awhile  Stalin came on the loudspeaker and -- and announced the end of the war.
Actually  for a government that was -- that needed its resources  its soldiers  railroads and all for the war purposes  instead concentrated on using all of those facilities to gather up and deport their Jewish population.
The Germans who are fighting t he war  we're talking 1944 now  the Germans were fighting a war and losing it .
No  and you know they Because of what they did during the war?
Let's start our conversation with you telling us a bit about your community  your family and yourself and those years before the war actually began.
They tho they were physically receiving these refugees  most of them  of course  Jews.
One were the wa -- the soldiers in the first World War  the others were the Communists.
You know  you fight every day that maybe today it's going to be the end of the war  maybe today they're going to lose it  or maybe today they're going to -- and then when it came  I couldn't do what some people did when they lost the war.
They don't have too much because some members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war  but uh they co ntinue to  to work the land and they come with the less product to the market.
And the friends that you had  were they Jewish and non-Jewish?
So the war is over and yet it would be 1947 before you came to the United States.
We just knew that his two sons ran away to Russia at the beginning of the war  but we didnt know about Uncle or -- or his wife.
Yes  and this woman by the name of Rachael  or Rochel  Rachel Yashpan  she was in the concentration camp in Stutthof  and I met her after the war near Rio de Janeiro.
And from the very beginning  I took the positi on I'm not going to let the war end without my being in the Army  and so I told him toward the end of '43 that  \ Don't apply for a deferment for me anymore because I'm going into the Army \  and I called up my draft board  and they obliged me by drafting me.
Before the war finished  the German used to di-divided our bread for four.
And I had...I had a guy that used to be my uh  you know  who was mostly...it's not like the Polish army before the war that was elite.
First one was -- it began to sink in that Germany lost the war  the Nazis were gone  and we were free.
He was a white Russian and he was running away from the Communist  and when I met her in Rome  her parents were with her in Rome and how they got out of Rome  because during the war  you know  as it was -- Italy was one of the axis members.
To interrogate prisoners of war you kind of have to have a little bit of a psychological background -- the -- from the technique of it.
But my father said  ﬁNo  the war will end soon.ﬂ At the time of this event of mentioning your brother and this German  was he actually a soldier?
He said to me one day  my parents have a farm near Berlin  and Im making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the rest of the war there working on that farm.
He said  \ You will be a soldier  because you didn't do anything during the war.\
So  was this the first time you met somebody who was Jewish?
A nd she worked there in the farm in all works as was she was considered as a as a relative  far relative from town that she run away from Kovno from bombardments and from the war  but she was for all things and purposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them and uh it was a woman  a widow whose husband  th e boss of the farm  fell from a from a thunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm  and the widow was a very good-hearted  that was very religious  and that's why the pr iest could talk her in that she should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina came because she didn't know what to... was crying all the time...Momma  Momma...and uh I...as I said she lived there instead of a week  she stood there for about four  five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman  the widow had three daughters and one son.
So  you said that your family and you had heard about what was happening but -- We heard about it butŠ And when war started in September o f 1939   do you remember that?
Yeah  well maybe -- lets move ahead to what happened when -- when the war was over.
You know  we -- I remember saying I wish I was -- I cou -- I don t care how old I will be at the -- as soon as I can say its 10 years after the war.
Her father was not  her fa -- father lived here through -- through the war.
And -- and she would have gotten married the ye ar of the war  in September.
So  a couple of years later  in 37-38  befo re the war begins and there are German Jews whose ancestors came from Poland  who are sent back to Poland and come into the area of Starachowice  right?
And in this place they had a man  a Russian guy who came  the first World War II  he married a White Russian  and his name was Matt Rosov.
They asked him to speak  which so he spoke with them  and si before I start my talk  who knows what was the name of the scho ol before the war?
And weeks before the war  and maybe maybe a mont h or so before the war broke out  my parents were able to extricate themselves from from Berlin  came t came to e to England   and I moved in with them for a short peri od of time  maybe weeks or a couple of months  until war broke out and it was decide d that I would be evacuated  as it was called  to this country country place.
I had never seen a Judge Advocate officer before  and I was told that I had been recommended for transfer fr om Washington  and that the unit had been instructed to set-up a War Crimes Branch in the U.S. Army.
So that was the approach towards the end of the war which changed the mood.
Out of 30 millions no  33 million people we had before the war  three million were Jewish.
But before I left your family  I wanted to ask one more question that was about the fa mily  and then go on to the war.
And then came the war  September 39 [indecipherable] arrived in June. [
Oh  oh  but before the war no  in the war  she came for Christmas to to us and ask us if she had whiskey.
I'd like to go back to the war and I'd like to go back to 1942  ‚43.
So what happened was when the war broke out  I told you.
This Hewlett Johnson  the reason they called him the ﬁRed Deanﬂ was because when it was the Korean War  he went to Korea and he wrote how the Americans behaved and what th e Americans are doing  ve ry pro-communist.
They were I the concentration camps were guards were Germans  the Nazis were Germans.
My -- my unspoken question is  where were you during the war?
Yes  this is also the two also th made the same time  just before the war.
Before we turn to the war and to the Holocaust and all that happened to you and your family  let's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family and yourself and your life and your community before the war began.
So now we are in New York -- Before you go on  I was interested in hearing whether any of his family asked you about what had ha -- whether she asked you about what had happened or any of his family asked you about what had happened during the war?
Comfortable with others who also came from Europe like you did.
>> Marcel Hodak: And they paid dearly at the end of the war.
That's  that's how we  we started life after  after the war.
This is tape number one  side B. Lets talk about when the war started.
But the the only thing we have to do is to make sure that somehow we convey it to other generations  you know  and they remember that human beings are capable of these unbelievable atrocities  all in the name of some idiotic idea  or or in the name of Bachkastani   who who killed his own he had the problems in the beginning of of the of the war when he waged war against Germany  because before  in the 30s  he killed all the officers staff.
And after the first World War  they left because the conditions there were terrible  and ended up in Athens  and thats where I was born.
I found some other people who survived the war from Europe in my college years at Wayne State University.
But I dont know– The camps that the Red Cross– I mean after the war began.
And that is that there was a saying the war will be over by Christmas.
Why I say this  after the war  my friend came back.
Can you describe your thoughts at the time of the end of the war?
It was rea lly from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video  so it was from early years  and then into -- into the war years.
So a friend of ours  who was one of those people before the war  engaged my stepfather into this and some other people; I was kind of witnessing these gatherings  were always very funny  very fancy  who dressed around.
My father  who was unable to find work because they wouldnt let him work  was in a -- sort of a desperate situation and as the war years came along  it became even more so.
And he kne w a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a number of non-Jews from before the war.
But in -- in -- in this country here -- Is there anything else that you wanted to say about the -- did you ever consider going to Palestine or to Israel?
So as a result  we didnt fear much other than the fact that we might have to be going to war.
And after the war was over  the son who was in the American army found us and that was a beautiful -- th at was one of these memorable incidents  which I think I spoke about.
I know that you were a young boy before the war  but I still want to go back and see what things you do remember.
So then we were in the camp and we heard some rumors that the war is coming closer.
My parents  my father fought World War I in the Austrian Army.
Yes  before the war  when we were kids  the religion was so strong  they force you to do things  which you didnt even f eel like doing all those things.
The life that I remember before the war  it was -- it wasnt so s -- you know  s-strict fo-for me  bu -- I-I had a nanny that I wa -- she took care of -- of me  but you know  it had to -- to be discipline.
During these war years  did you pay any attention to religion or to holidays  or to anything like that?
Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 36 That was go -- In fact I would say that the Jewish schools were  in many ways  even better than the non-Jewish schools  the public schools  because Jewish teachers prided themselves  they said  ﬁYou have to know more than others in order to come to the fore somewhere  somehow.ﬂ And th e curriculum was very strict  and I used to sit on my homework for hours a nd hours and hours.
For some crazy reason  I – my fathers sister and her husband had gone to the United States before the war and for some crazy reason I remember their address.
And so I have this document that -- that very picturesque document that my father got  cause he was actually wounded during the first war.
So I went with the others to work in the coal mine.
Did he used to tell stories to like you r brothers and sisters about the war and things like that?
Amos had to deliver a lecture in Berlin and I had an old aunt who survived the war.
While we lived in that -- at that -- that stretch of time during the war  as I was saying before  we -- children  of course had to watch out because of the dogs and the Nazis and such  we were terrified of them.
That's where I lived until the war broke out and the Ghettos and so on.
But it wasn't as open and free as up to the beginning of the war.
It was And when the war broke out It was quite desperate?
He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time  but when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming.
And I saw that I lost  I mean   you know  a war discipline  they they are not working  they are just entertaining me.
Privately everybody knew that once they lost Stalingrad and they started around back  that they would lose the war.
And there are some survivors  not that many  who were hidden by Germans and others from the Nazis during the whole time of the war.
Before the war  we didn't got problem s  because his he is from a from a comfortable home  I was from a comfortable home.
I was in the lumber...I was working  incidentally  in the lu mber yard as a laborer   and she took her to the hospital and now would you like to take.... Answer (Pela): ...came to...I heard of a of a doctor even before the war Doctor   so I came to him with the baby and I  I told him sh e's running such a fever.
I remember once he was saying  you know  wh-when the war is over  when I going to go home  what I gonna told USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 37Julians mother how Julian died  you know ?
We were going to synagogue for the first time since before the war.
indecipherable] And still there was the fear of the war  or the war was already here?
This is what I wanted to tell you  that it was wonderful because I -- we were Lithuanian citizens and we were not -- we w -- were not under the Hitlers la w  and we got even -- but my father told me when we -- we lived on kuf -- Kurfurstendamm and we got for breakfast  for instance  a -- a little britchen  a -- a -- no  a piece of white bread with butter  with -- or margarine and marmalade and my father told me that the Ge rmans dont receive it  and the Jews definitely not  because it is very hard now and they are prep aring a war.
Well  somehow we sensed that the -- the war was not going to we ll for the Germans.
of A. Brunner shows him as a brutal man  totally anti -Semite  not only the documents he had signed during the war  i.e. towards the end when people of the Social Welfare went to meet him in order to ask not to arrest the Jewish Children around Paris in Childrens homes and they pleaded why deport them at the very end  but it was to fill up the trains for deportation  so Brunners arguments was that these children must be ar rested because they are future terrorists  one day theyll look for vengeance of their parents death.
After the war  knowing how resourceful Eli was  I thought he may have survived.
He managed to escape the war in the middle of the war  and find himself in Paris.
And a bomb  I was with the typhus people  I got sick on typhus.
This new cadre of the people  young people  like a new generation which were growing to reach for this power  never did it  because of the war -- End of Tape #1 13 Tape #2 -- me Greek. --
One of the prisoners was not a copple which was so bad  but he was also was a winner of a German medal during the Firs t World War and was somewhat respected by the SS.
You know  very few Jews went back to live in Germany after the war  and to have such a prominent place in the life of a university and the city is -- I remember that he also when he went back he wrote a -- what you call those columns where you answer people's problems in the newspaper?
Yeah  oh  they was already in the occupy from the army where after the war.
So Okay  but you but you saw her once during the war?
Had he done 4 that  he would have been moved out of Hungary and survived the war.
And we thought  well  if theyre fleeing  then the war must be pretty much going towards an end.
Let's start very briefly  David  with you telling us a little bit about your family  your life  your community  and you in those years before the war began.
They had a child before the war which is the child I said she gave to my mother and she died about 12 years ago.
Frau Shermburg was the wife of a doctor whod been killed  and her son had been killed in the war.
But then the war came in ‚41 and after th at  I never heard from him.
Without refriger ator  without any  you know  fancy appliance of any kind  so in some ways  in some ways it was almost worse than during the war.
And we stoppe d and we chatted and we remembered the old times when I was the pupil and he was the teacher   and I asked him what he is doing and he said he just arrived from unit -- from the Soviet Union where he survived the war  and he was working for the Jewish Historical Society  and the Jewish Hist orical Society was transferred 23 fairly recently to Lodz and he is -- he just arrived in Lodz and hes working for the Jewish Historical Society.
And did th They were started already electricity  because they built before the war be they built on the rivers those dam  you know  a nd electric hydro hydro-electric.
He remarried after the war  had three more children  and the only time all six children would come together was when I was there.
By the spring of 1940  the war has come literally to your parents' doorstep with the German invasion.
The only thing we thought  well  maybe she went to another camp  maybe the war will be over next week  and we will see her again.
Russian language  Russian soldiers  dear ladies  we didnt know you were here  we were  we are fighting the war  we found already a few other camps.
Do you have any memories of hearing that the war was over or did that mean anything to you.
All right  maybe she would be a -- a divorcee  or a -- maybe shell be a little older  but she will have two houses  she will have a business  you woul dnt have to worry  you wouldnt have to start for scratch  why do you have to marry?ﬂ Now  I couldnt understand instead to be happy  that I brought over my wife  that she was prettier than they  she was more intelligent than they  she was smarter than they  she survived the war.
this lady was a sister in law of my sister who died after the war in Budapest.ﬂ She didnt know that we are related  I mean its not real relation there is contact whatever.
Did you -- Did you think of it after the war?
I begin to work  you know  in this time it's after...it's called...it was a war.
Not from her parents  but after the war  because they didnt have any Jews where she lived  in the countryside there.
Interview with G unter Haimann August 6  2007 58 About a -- within -- within the months after the war was over.
There was always there was always a Yiddish paper in the house  because thats what my parents read and the radio use to always be on and they use to try and pick up the Yiddish stations there to hear whats going on with the war and everything Can you remember anything from that time period?
The -- the skipper  the head of the troop got injured in France  you know  on a long term patrol  and he was taken prisoner  and he was -- did not return until after the war.
But in those days  the -- during the -- before the war  Babcha came to the house very often to us.
And  you know  people -- others -- Holocaust survivors that Ive talked to  they -- they didnt more around as much as you did.
And I had a happy life til 1939  til the war broked out.
The soap factory  and we went there many a times to hide from them and then  being a young person like I was at that time and trying to do things to stay alive and know we had a radio in the attic  hidden in that particular building that we were  and we were listening to BBC London to get the foreign news  whats doing in the -- on the war scene  or on the war front.
29 Close to the end of the war didn't they start bringing people from the camps west and sometimes camp survivors would come into Terezin?
Then I found out there were quite a few Jewish kids among them  too.
You know  you didnt pay attention to anything because we always figured its only during the war and after the war it will all go back to normal.
You know  never seen the beach like that on the ocean and it was in evening and I really remember that that was such an incredible sight  and you know  the peacefulness and in the midst of all this uh turmoil and war and running and then there was the ocean  untouched and beach and the sunset and this is something I have never forgotten in all these years.
And I again have friends that went off to war and never came back.
But worse even  who I made mentioned before who was Secret ary General of the World Jewish congress during that last period of the War  uh there was in 1944 in November a great conference called by the World Jewish Congress in Atlan tic City which really sets out a post-War program of the Jewish people.
So I soon decided that that was the only thing I could do is work and anyway I worked like this til about -- for my brother-in-law [indecipherable] for about -- til 1952  when I was drafted into the armed services  during the Korean war.
I tell you  I went to a lecture after the war  I dont reme mber the name of the guy  and he says like that  there isn't enough paper yink -- paper an d ink  to put down whats happened in the second World War.
She was left behind  but her son got out before the World War.
And after the war -- I never knew till after I got out what had gone.
I remember it was Sunday  I knew the exact day  I remember it was Sunday  and they gave an order the Russians gave it's hard to understand anyway -- he came from Moscow to dismantle the planes  to clean the planes  to put in all the equipment there and the Sabbath was Saturday  and Sunday that's when the Germans attacked -- bombarded the airports  and we know that the war broke out.
Then  after war and that  then I think from Poland that the communistic government was so was sending delegation to take us back to Poland.
We didnt know exactly what was supposed to be happening but we always hoped that maybe th e war will end and everything will turn out all right.
In fact  one of my -- one of my uncles -- my mothers sister married -- married an Austrian before World War I  and he lived in -- he lived in th -- Scotland all his life  in fact he was -- he ran one of my fathers businesses in Glasgow .
When I was four years old I wore a soldiers suit  wh ich was modeled on the so ldier's suits  the soldier's clothing in World War 68 One.
They felt they were very hard working people  clean  and also ru thless in war.
And  in my fathers family  the mother of my cousin over here studied at the University of Geneva in those days before World War I  and Grenoble in France.
Do you remember where you were when you learned the war had started?
I mean  I was recruited  got the uniform  got my they sent me within Lithuania   in certain places to to be attached to the there was also you see  there was also a Lithuanian brigade under the Commander Vilinski   who was which was formed right when the war in the beginning of the war.
After the war  when I started walking  I was so weak that I couldnt not -- almost not walk.
I remember crawling in into one of those long um chimney  a cylinder that was on the floor  and a few of us crawled in there  and there was some shooting  I remember a bullet went by  and then it was quiet again  and then the doors  must have been the following morning  the doors were opened  the Czech people called and said the war was over.
When we make the turn into the twenty-first century and all the remaining people in their nineties and so forth and the children of thes e concentration camp survivors also go deep into Social Security  I don't think the trial will have very much more significance than the Civil War  whic h will be that much older again  in terms of centuries.
Very sh ortly after the war broke out on the 21st of June  very shortly after  there were announcements that Jews were not allowed to live in certain quarters  in certain parts of Slonim and we had to move right away.
The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in  but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.
After the war -- during the war he volunteered as a soldier in the Czechoslovakian Army.
They spoke Yiddish when they didn't want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish.
I was always interested in arts  even before the war  but af -- certainly after that.
So -- and then they put me on -- on the build-building a railroa d. Its already the second year of the war and -- near Stalingrad  on the other side of the Volga  because there was none there to put on this side -- on the east -- west side -- you never know which [indecipherable] it was.
Anthony: What changes did you notice after the war came to an end and the Germans occupied Warsaw?
The special weapon that the German would use  and would win the war after all  except after April thir -- 23 rd.
And til the war ended and we became really a country.
But she was in during the whole war  because they needed nurses and she was a registered nurse.
So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.
It was another thing  we came to -- tto Krakow  and i -- I went to school in Krakow and my mother register me already -- not -- she didnt want to register me th-th-that I am Jewish  because after the war they had still pogroms in -- in Poland.
And how were people treating collaborators who -- who had survived the war?
Actually I was born on the street called 4 and my sister was born in the apartment and my mother's closet became too small and we moved to 38  which was...which was the apartment and office that I lived til the second war world II.
And I knew Lodz  Lodz the city  and I had many friends there before the war but who knows where or what.
And we ge -- and we went  came down to Geneva  and there was a -- a house there  not far from the airport  and I dont remember the name  but there was ot her refugees  but these -- these were not survivors  these are people who during the war they ran away and this and that.
I think after the war  there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the relationship that they ma ybe shouldnt have had.
He  of course  lived to eat his words and ended up in Israel as probably I'll talk about this later  at the end of War Two and with the establishment of the State of Israel.
And then he came back from that and then he went back to the Ferda which was the  the clothing factory Anita Frank 11 [Date not labeled] Page 11 with whom hed worked before the war so he went back to them and then  after that  he left them and went to another clothing  worked for ano ther clothing manufacturers  as a representative.

And he said  ﬁYou must go -- our people -- he was Jewish  too -- are in desperate trouble over there.ﬂ And they were  you know  after the war.
The Meye rs immigrated with us to Albania and the Millers went to America and   but when I came to America after the war in 1946  this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the clouds over my childhood did not begin until well  the death of my two grandfathers  which obviously had some effect.
He was older and two younger men dressed in the dark uniforms of the local Ge rmans who were uh  uh  uh now within the German army  and who before collaborated with the Germans  and basically were traitors before the war.
I remember there was the Polish army which was associated with the Russian army.
It was their work  and as they cleaned up in the war  they were assigned to it.
Now Wagner  the end of Wagner was after the war  he ran away.
As the war ground on  by the winter of 1944 -45  which was an exceptionally bitter winter  that's one of the memories you do have of that winter and the deprivation that was all around.
Then after a while  the people of the camp  we got them to go out to cut wood  the young people by telling them all sorts of lies about how they were going to learn how to use power saws  which they'll use in Palestine  God knows if they had trees there or not  and uh we promised them an extra reward of cigarettes  which we got out of the Red Cross packages for prisoners of war  which we had quite a bit.
I had a as a specialist  and a a fluent German speaker trained in the German armed forces  my last attachment was with all Marine commandoes and the colonel  who was a great soldier  was quite fond of me and after the war we had a drink at the Army-Navy club in London.
From there on for the next following four years during all the war time  I traveled from one prison to the other.
First during the war  when I was in France  because the war came when I had been sent to study in France.
And  then when the uh  uh  the  the  the surrounding areas uh were uh uh getting evacuated  the factories were empty  he took a fe w men with him  in a truck and they went (clears throat) to a neighboring town  and got some fabr ics from an empty factory  which he put in our warehouse  in our camp  and told the men who were in charge of the warehouse when the war is over  remember to distribute these fabrics evenly so the people will have something to start their lives with.
But they were friends   not very close friends  but friends.
It was just filed away through the war and uh that was one reason why we left again.
And I wanted to go back again and ask you a lit tle bit more about the time right after the war had ended and you returned to Hungary.
Later on Ill tell you  I find out after the war for what it was.
And the one who were suffering the most  they were the je -- Jews  because Ukrainian hate the Jews before the war  and did th -- the -- pogroms before the war  now they had the free hand from the Germans and they did -- did a ver-very good job by k-killing and beating the Jews.
Can you talk a little bit about the years leading up to when Poland was divided  and -- was it something that you were expecting a -- you know -- When the war start in 39?
My mother's parents had moved to Nice before the war because the climate in the Netherlands was so bad for them  and they wanted to move to a warmer climate.
Well  when I got to Paris  here was  in Cherche-Midi prison Cherche-Midi Prison looks something like a we sort of imagined French prisons to look in the 18th century.
War time use of Cunningham's Young Men's Holiday Camp and world war 2 camps was Granville  Sefton  Hutchinson  Central  Palace and Metropole and I'd like to get a picture of what went on.
Oh yes  before the war we had a radio  because Mama  as I said  my mother was running that little cafeteria for the radio producer.
Tirgu Jiu  it was on the beginning of the war with Russia.
But the kids  you know  my father was [indecipherable] he is sending his boys  his sons to learn whatever is needed to be learned  until the war broke out.
Can you tell me a little b it about when the Germans first got to your ---  when the war started and the Germans first come to your town?
What was going on in Poland  you know at that time?
The war in Israel was a question of survival for the country.
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone now  off to fight for the Soviets against the German -- or at the time with the Germans initially -- no  no  against the Germans  what did your mom do  and who was ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 with you at that point once your dad was gone?
Just as an aside  after the war  the new government  democratic ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 republic  Germany  a rich country  they want to reimburse us for all the suffering we've done.
And a cousin of mine was a tailor before the war.
Well  the well  that we knew right after the war cause my father wrote to the Burgermeister or whoe whoever was in charge right after the war.
When did you meet the Russians That was when was the war over  May May 8 th May 8 th so I would say it was in May. So that one week it was one week before  it was the week of  thats when you met the Russians I think so around then.
When the war started  May 10  I was in the night shift because we worked two shifts  three shifts in 24 hours.
From the years since the end of the war  have you ke pt in touch with the children of the man who you stayed with for two and a half years?
Was a judge briefly  before the first World War  and served in the German army.
I want you to tell us where you went next  but before you do  I want you to tell us how you were able to get news about what was going on with the war.
What was not a shock later on was the war you mentioned  the Vietnam War  the Korean War.
If Germany refused to do that  then Britain in line with its treaty obligations to Poland  will consider itself at war with Germany.
By the time the war started  were you still living in The Hague ?
We have a place for you  well wait until the end of the war  and thats it.
I feel Ive had a much  much richer life in the United States than I ever would have had in Gleiwitz  even if it hadnt -- there hadnt been a war or Holocaust.
Before the war I got the comfortable life of my parents and my they teached us all the religion religion.
I want you to tell me all that  but I just want to ask you a little bit more about the ghetto?
Another thing which happened to us in England was because of this war fever which could be compared to what happened in North America with the Japanese and the West Coast after Pearl Harbor  this kind of psychosis or whatever it is  made it that the...the police said  \ No Bruderhof member could pass the radius of 5 miles outside the community.ﬂ And when somebody did that they  this was illegal.
So that was when the war and Septem ber first  early morning  there was alarm in the bar barracks  because they bomb they bomb Lwow   which was 98 about Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 33100 kilometer east  and also some some something at the end of the town  some military this thing  bomb  so  we got alarm.
And the reason that he got out was because he had been a volunteer in the first World War  and because of the familys Interview with Brigitte Freidin March 12  2001 13long  long  long established times in Germany  and because we had the emigration number.
But when  UNRA located relati ves in New York  and told them that we survived the war  they sponsored us  and passports and birth certificates had to be made very quickly.
He came back from the war he moved over from the French Foreign Legion to the British army.
On the third of September  France and England declared war on Germany   and that was the beginning of World War II.
But after the war  you know  you are going back  you are trying to determine in your own mind what happened.
Now  was there any thought on your parents part to stay in Palestine?
Well  we m oved back in  but now the the Germans of course came came in that very afternoon.
And that's all  that was the life  until the war start.
Did you ever get depressed in those -- in those -- either during the war  or -- or later on  or -- or were you spared any -- I ju -- I just wondered if you had any difficult periods when you -- The worst -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 88 -- when your spirits sagged and you couldnt keep going?
And the -- really the heart of the Cold War period  you see.
Now  th-the town  as I a-am fond of remembering -- reminding everybody -- the fact that the town was an -- an industrial town played a great part in my surviving the war.
Now  you missed your chance  there is no war  so you better go to America  make money  send us the money.ﬂ So we didnt stay there  but  I have to tell you one -- this was the first trip  we were in 1949.
But all the others  my aunts and uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
Once my father came and the war was over  we moved back to Warsaw and my father reopened his gallery  although in a different place.
Did you -- did you talk a lot about the Holocaust  a-about your experiences after the war?
We were marched through the town under the whips of the SS uh to a certain collection...I had it happen to me many times during the war.
America took in  I think  20 000 Hungarians  a nd we came in a World War II not World War II Korean war troop carrier  ship.
>> Bill Benson: When did you finally get to the United States?
>> Suzy Snyder: They just wanted to make it through the war.
Mr. Wilschanski  what's your memory of the moment the war was declared over?
They lived during the 12 first World War  and they felt its going to be a static war.
>> Bill Benson: I wish we had you for several more hours because what David would tell you about  once he left Panama  the exploits  if you will   to get from Panama to Israel and then to ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 fight during the War of Independence and then return to Panama  just an entirely different story to be told.
In 1916 I beli eve  my parents ra n from Kolomyja because of the war.
Already I am sp eaking about my father being my father  but actually maybe I should tell you that he volunteered in World War One to the garrison in Metz  which is Alsace-Lorraine in order to learn French.
And eventually  in the -- in June or July of 44  there was a -- a s -- a signed agreement that was signed by representatives in the Middle East  in Lebanon  I believe  Beirut  which then held until the end of the war.
After World War   with -- with all its ineffectiveness  we do now have a United Nations which is going to respond when one country attacks another.
And because of that he lost his job  and for four years that was eight years before the war for four years he could not find a job  and then all the savings are went down.
I had dreams after the war was over and for many  many years -- subsequent years  including after I came to the United States and it was always the same dream  namely  I had two very good friends.
And he had four brothers  one of whom died in World War I  for his then country and he had another brother who saw things coming in 1933  befo -- when Hitler came to power and he emigrated to Palestine.
And early on  beginning even in 1980  the investigators were running lists -- post-war lists developed by American authorities of war crime suspects through the Immigrati on and Naturalization Service to see whether matches had taken place  or whether there were hits  we called them hits.
I have the actual -- I had that picture  I saved throughout the whole war with me and the reason why  you see -- Q. I want you -- let me have you explain it again while -- [Technical conversation] 85 08:17:20 A. This is an enlargement of an old picture of my father and myself.
During the war  I also went to night school to learn English and I had a very famous governor of Maryland  who was a teacher  McKelton  I don't know if you heard of him.
On April 28th  because May 8th was the uh the end of the war  the liberation day  but A-April 28th was his birthday  and we wanted to do something for him for his birthday  so each one of that of us  of the prisoners gave a little portion of their  our bread  and a little por-portion of our terrible jam or marmalade  whatever it was and  and  and um  mmmm  margarine  and so meone who must have been very  very handy among us  I don't remember   I don't know who it was  made him a birthday cake.
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 149 This is in the war.
I was always kidding...after the war I was kidding with my husband  I'm so sick because I was made .
Did they seem like criminal -- Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians  they open the jails you know  the [indecipherable] they were vicious guys  killers.
My father came back from the World War I. He was in the Austrian army.
A non-Jewish wife of a brother of my grandfathers who survived the war in Berlin  and we -- since Amos went to gi -- talk there  I wanted to see her because she really was a favorite of the family.
So what I did literally the day the war was over  May 8th  1945  I wrote a letter to the then head of the company and said  \ I just don't feel like coming back as an employee  but I do want to maintain a relationship with the company  and I want to start my own public relations firm when I get back  and I want Fergus on Company to be my first client.\
Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 2 Now I know you have been interviewed previously so we wont spend a lot of time on your war time experiences  but I would like to get a sense of what happened to you in the sense of who your family was.
And if the war had started instead of in May of 1945  in June of ‚45 or maybe July ‚45  we would have been in the United States before the war  but the war just broke out before we had a chance to get there.
As I often did my own things during the war  I went there and later were very eager to build.
A. Mixed  that's how religion is because we didn't have any allies  we didn't have any black people  because before the war it was very rare when you saw a black person in the street.
And then I ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 found out what happened to the other people.
Even so  the war was over in May. We still had no idea until -- I was married already to him when we found out where th ey are.
And then he was taken as a prisoner of war  and he came back to Kolbuszo wa he started to run his office.
They we re close to their borders  they were -- still was -- only a few weeks before the war  the entire war was over  they were still sending people in April.
Funny thing is that after the war  it took her two years to get rid of the child.
And my mother  after my father's death  was suspicious that perhaps Meir's wife wasn't Jewish and that's why my father hadn't bothered to look her up after the war because he was in Munich for two and a half years after the war  he could have.
They spoke Yiddish when they didnt want me to understand which was e nough so that I did understand Yiddish.
Yes  Im curious about him because he really he got punished after the war.
Lets talk about the war ended  and -- and what happened with you and the family from there?
Thats what I did after the war for mine uncles  you know.
And be for the fact that the railroad tracks between Grodno and Marstee  were not ready  because we  the partisans  the yesterdays destroyers of that  to s -- to not let the Germans be able to carry on their war  now had a problem of going back to see that theyve all repaired  so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies  as well as manpower.
I me t her after the war  and she still good friends with Luta  she went out and she came to the yard she was living  and she came into a apartment.
They gave us the privilege of becoming a citizen so they didnt ha ve to worry where we would have to go in the war.
And then  did your life change between 1933 and 1939  when the war started?
Were you drafted into the Army  or did you choose to enlist?
He describes in his diary how he got desperate and he was about to leave us because he thought we were cute  we were little  somebody would find us and take care of us and he would come back if he lived after the war and get us.
And again  what were your thoughts when you would see German soldiers?
Before the war -- although  you know  my first interesting  and -- experience in the contemporary history  was arige Crystal Night.
And  uh  in case the Germans did come..and a lot of times  Germans did come over.
Members of parliament denied all knowledge of concentration camps  and people -- I think including my father  but Im not sure about this -- did lobby  and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on   but I dont think that -- that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation.
The war didn't end until May. To a place called Koszalin.
As the war ends were in Switzerland  and after some stay at a childrens home in Hayden  which is in [indecipherable] province  the German province in Switzerland  we begin our journey south through Italy  to go to Palestine  actually.
But as I had typhoid previously during the beginning of the war.
When the war ju st began...what was it like for you?
I ask her one time -- oh yeah  the first thing that happened  I -- there was a trial in Heidelberg over the SS -- who -- who was born in Heidelberg  they caught him after the war  he was a -- not -- not high-ranking  a simple guy  who had -- who was accused of having killed three people.
It took me a long time to forget that the war is over  and I tried always to remind me  Sam  the war is over.
And actually it's different from the photographs you see of him be fore the end of the war because he looks very relaxed  often when he's with Hitl er  if he's walking around showing some piece of architecture.
And she survived the war a-awful  because shes looking very Jewish  in a in a [indecipherable] you know  youre unbelievable.
What about the whole upheaval that we nt on around the Vietnam war and all the demonstrations and Kent State and yo u know  the riots and you know  that -- that whole period abou -- of upheaval.
It wasn't  it wasn't exactly what I thought a war would be.
He had lost one leg in the First World War  so my mother helped him; especially if the weather was bad because he had trouble manipulating the cart and getting on that.
In the war  he was a high ranking officer  and we had lots of friends.
Did you hear anything about what was happening to the Jews of Europe ?
The things begin to change  that's in 1939  when it was the war what the German with Poland.
In the meantime they left for Israel because they were not allowed  but my aunt would come with my uncle and then of course we had a wonderful reunion first time we went to Israel before the Yom Kippur war  my 41 husband and I. And I -I just cant describe it  how we felt.
I remember when the war broke out  August 1939  we were in Druskieniki this little resort town.
Maybe a month or two months  because a they only came shortly they only arrived in England shortly before the outbreak of war  and I was evacuated out of London .
The first sheet of orders that I got included me  and most of the people that had been in my immediate organization in World War II.
My father was forced into go in the concentration camp and be killed.
So it was a three part city that lived pretty much in peace til the war broke out.
I went to Russian school there two years  I learned Russian and -- and -- under the Germans  you know  I learned Germans a little.
They shipped him off to the Bahamas   but this was not the kind of person that the country needed in its great hour of need  and people tend to forget that George the sixth  who became king and was king through the whole war  into the beginning of the 50s  when he died  was a man who had then  on a British Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 83 warship  in 1916  at the Battle of Jutland   the great naval engagement of that war.
I think they were  in -- in the aftermath  they were the most decent ones of all -- of all the nations who were involved in the war and took advantage of the superiority of the German army  o-of the -- of the -- the German government.
Was there anything that you studied during the war that you might not have studied if there hadnt been a war?
My father thought they would close the border and eventually there would be war.
At the end of the war he had to kind of rebuild his clients.
He was Australian ambassador to Vietnam during the Vietnam war  and ended up as the head of the civil service in Australia  which is a very big deal under the Australia n system.
So when I went back to school at the age of 6  to me -- but I remember May 8  1945  which was the end of the war  the capitulation  unconditional capitulation of the Reich  the sirens blasted also.
And my husband says she has two brothers  very nice  fine people and she came from a good family  but that's what she told me during the war.
Your siblings  when the war was over in August 1944  you're back in Paris  and of course your sister was now married.
They had various camps of various entities  prisoner of war camp  but there was no camp concentration camp as such.
Shes close to 90  and who with her cousin her sister  helped us greatly after the war  sent us all the packages and moneys to Berlin and to Hamburg  and we remain very close with them.
She had her  you see she left Poland not so long after the war and she always remembered this as the anti-Semitic country where she has the memory of tragic childhood.
And then after that you went back and forth to Germany?
Trifa  for example  was able to say he was incarcerated in a concentration camp during the war.
I wondered if you -- after the war  you felt a sense of connection with the place  if you ever visited again.
And they were the Germ ans who were supposed to protect the town  maybe about 30 Germans with had with the machine guns  the all  you know  ready to to fight the war.
They war got near the territory that they been fighting  got smaller and smaller.
So the prisoners of war decided they'll make a run for it.
We -- you also had the war that had occurred in Israel the year before.
Well  what was your understanding of what the Germans were doing with Jews?
The Russians and the Americans  together against Germany  beca use after the war in Russia this is the reason they start to be mad on the Germans.
Oh yeah  because uh because as...before the war  there was correspondence and some of these children then  and it was one of the first things they did  was that they uh uh asked their foster parents to help them to get the uh the uh the parents out.
And that was wonderful and thats why I knew that there was war.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 Anyway  again  I could tell you the story but for the sake of time I'm going to move.
What did you do in Vienna in the early years of the war until your arrest?
My other sister was killed together with my mother  but this was in ghetto.
They -- theyre losing the war  and it came nearer and nearer to the place we were.
Yes  my father was very active and there is no doubt in my mind that Israel could have been a destination had he survived the war  for us.
And now we stayed wi th our mother and four children at that time  two were born during the war and after the war.
Th e same guy  he was officer before the war  in Belvedere (332).
At that moment I told you this  that the authorities of the army in the west  under the command Eisenhower  they didnt send for two -- almost six weeks  the message to the Germans that they have the three soldier of the Warsaw uprising as a prisoner of the war according to the Geneva convention.
In the meantime  the war bro -- 1939  the war start  and we have to move into the ghetto.
Because after the end of the war  one other person who knew him well  came and told my aunt th at he was shot.
He went -- a-after the war he came back  he went to Israel  he -- he was appointment secretary for s -- for some mi nister  but he assured everybody that he was running the country.
But I don't think that I will be true to mine brother  to my family of 300 from before the war  to my colleagues to our...to whic h I went to school  to my colleagues who later were the heroic fighters in the Warsaw ghetto  to the simple people  my neighbors who perished fo r...for nothing.
To a point  I can tell you when  after the war  I lived with them for  used to visit with them  I didn't live with them all the time  I used to visit  we slept on one mattress.
He couldn't do this -- what he did during the war  all of these machinatzia  all of these things -- he couldn't do it.
It ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 was cleaned up.
I di -- I didnt know if my parents were Zionists or something.
In the early days of war  that means 1939  '40  there were multitudes of organizations  underground organizations  all eager to fight Germans.
Her husband  my mothers brother was Jewish  and he had perished during the war  but she had survived  and so did her two daughters.
Now  his sister was alive after the war  am I right?
Part of his brain was damage d  and that was the result of an -- he was a navigator in airplane in the Luftwaffe in World War   which crashed.
You know  we were losing so many ships during that war  but many people older than I were volunteering  and  what the heck?
Yes  and that was in the middle because I think I was two weeks or more in Sweden  the 8th of May was the end of war  but I was already out of there.
The -- then -- you know  the sirens would start screaming w ildly  everybody would run away  everybody -- Bucharest wasnt bombed during the war  it was far from -- from theater of war.
Did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews?
And the only housing that was left were the pre the very  very workers houses that my father and he worked on before the war.
This was close to -- the war was still going on  Russia wasnt taken yet.
Well tell me tell me then  in those three weeks  if it started from the first Three until the until the Russians enter on the 17th  they cross the border Yes  but the war was still going on  the Poland did not surrender until the 29th of S-September  Warsaw fell.
We didnt think about that  but very soon  its happened that we started to think in this way  when the war came.
He had himself b een a captain  but he was demoted to captain after World War two  because they made many peopl e officers  and after World War two -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 67 Excuse me -- -- it was common that a lot of officers  who made more money being officers in the army than civilian life  wanted to stay in the army as a career  but they couldnt use everybody on staff  there was too many people.
And your mother di did she go outside the house to work once the war started  or she stayed at home  still?
By that time  in the beginning of the partisan war  the major things that the partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do  was A  kill known collaborators  primarily to elevate the morale of the people.
I mean  one of the reasons I ask this question is particularly when people were children  really small children during the war  were talking about fragmented memories.
And when the war start  the Germans came to Wilna  after the war start with Russia  we thought  okay  it will be like in Warsaw.
One day when I was a child and he said  \ You have to go with me today and with   to Grandma \  his mother who passed away before the war .
Oh yes  war was over in May. All right  then its 46. [
I think I think our division went ba ck you know  I dont recall the last I remember is being in the in this town in Austria and telling that the war is over  but I dont remember how we how I got home.
But then one day  I went to school  the gymnasium  I was at that time in the fifth grade of the gymnasium . . .
I said what will happen to me if I fail to tell him...by this I would save the Krakow from really being destroyed but I didn't survive now the war to loose my life.
He had taken this up down at the university and eventually  of course  when the war broke out  he volunteered.
Did you make any attempts to find other relatives or friends?
When when you were with this family in Staines that had  you know  more children  and you stayed there for the duration of the war  can you describe what a typical day was like for you?
He beat them and killed them and when the war was over  it was the first village ca me in.
The national searches for military and all this  but we do search for Holocaust and war victims.
I watched these Jews  the whole  uh  during the whole war and they are just like us  and I completely...it was a completely wrong belief.\
We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945.
Then -- and they -- they said to me  those two guys  they said  you know  the German nation  the German people did many horrible things to the Jews  but that it didnt do.
Well  this was -- we were doing this off and on until the end of the war in 1945.
So  he didnt want to talk about the war at all  but my Uncle Harry filled me in on the months and months and months that he lived in in a in hovels  and Interview with Al Jaffee May 21  2016 20 Was this when you were older that he filled you in on this?
I mean cl early the -- the -- theres a turn in the war  and theres been a turn in the war since 43  or late 42.
But now that the war had started  we had Ration cards.
They 65 were children of Polish immigrants whod come after the war  and one didnt know what their parents had done during the war  and all of them were interesting because  if I told them  for example  the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews  they wanted proof  and my xeroxing bill was tremendous.
But I wanted to ask you whether you wanted to say anything about your husband and your relationship with him  because last time we talked you said he was a stranger to you and then all of sudden you met him after the war.
And they ship them to Auschwitz  from there directly to Auschwitz.
From Holland after the war  she had wrote that to her sisters  describing what had happened to some extent during the war and the deprivations and how that was her ambition.
My very fi rst interview after World War 2  performed by an American civilian in occupied German territory in Bavaria  was conducted by Professor Border.
I don't know whet her the prison was during the war because from what I know she was not a criminal  so maybe she  the Nazi laws were different than our laws.
But we used the same -- I guess youd call it the same three tiered bunks  for the inmates  except there was only one in each bunk instead of three or four.
He was a  just kind of a very outstanding figure  a tall  very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during the War  World War II and somehow worked for a shoe factory  which was a very famous shoe factory all over the world  Bata  got married there and came once to visit us and I still remember his visit.
>> Gretchen Skidmore: I think you should talk about the day that the war ended.
Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a little bit to the original interview what your function was after World War II.
We stayed in that convent until the war was almost over with and then this organization took us back and we went back to one of the homes.
That really  after the war  after the liberation  that was the reason I didnt go to Israel .
Did in part you  did in part that feeling like I survived the camp  I mean the first thought that comes to my mind is  you survived World War 2  you survived the camps  you didn't want to get TB at that point.
My brothers and I we went to Krakow  because we were going to move from this small town to Krakow.
But right after the war  the Ge rman put a trustee  you know.
The war years are a f World War I  that is  were not in any of his letters.

Potentially  three or four weeks after May 8  the end of the war  I arrived in Krakow.
I as a Zionist and professor...my my patron  my famous a nd beloved patron  Professor Sigmung Belaski who was a famous professor at the University of   which is now   after the first revolution  he run away from from and he came to Kovno  Lithuania and there he was admitted as a professor of civil law although he was a Jew  although he didn't speak Lithuanian at all  but he was world famous and he wrote several monumental books on the civil war in uh in copyright and so on  and I was lucky enough to write my thesis  my...you know...wha t you call it in other languages  the doctorate  I wrote with Professor Belaski  and when I...when I passed all the exams and uh I was waiting for the evaluation of my thes is that they submitted to Professor Belaski and then I was invited at his...at his law offi ces and then he asks me what do you want to do with yourself when you graduate law?
But I was I was such a hustler  because like even before the war  when daddy was dead already and there was no food  and mama couldn't support  I was able to go to work at the plant; sit a presser all day  and by the end of the day  we receive one one you received one zloty  and one zloty brought one bread and a smoked fish.
And so I went to a private hi gh school  and of course I wasnt there long enough  cause the war started  and the Germans occupied our schools  and we were not able to be there any more  because my schoo l was only girls school.
And also part of the explanation that is also part of what happened af ter the first world war when -- you see  in Hungary to do business wasn't -- a gentleman couldn't do bu siness.

So you have a period that before Hitler and then after Hitler c ame to power.
They were probably given a positive information about me  that I can help  and they were trying to set me up for a good job for -- for after the war.
But later we found out that the war was getting was almost of the brink of being finished  except we didnt realize.
For all my war time  it was probably the best time.
And one of the reasons for that was that there were surveys of where people Germans got their news and credibility were done  and the American Forces Network was the most credible news source in Germany for several years after the war  and the reason for it is  is the Germans felt that the Americans would not lie to their own troops.
Located in an area which origin ally belonged to Hungary  but was made part of Czechoslovakia in 1918; occupied by Hungary from 1938 to 1945  but returned to Czechoslovakia after the war ended.

And it was quite and I decided then and afterward that I will leave after the war  if he's in trouble  I'll help him.
But I smoked late r  for a few years  you know  after the war.
This was taken to a Frankfurt  not destroyed for some reason  and the American Army found it  was perplexed as to what to do with it and passed it on to the Yivo Jewish Institute in New York and I found this among other papers and reviews of my father's concerts 20 years after the war.
It had political prisoners  it had political prisoners that were left over from the Spanish Civil War.
So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.
Now  they -- that term  violation of the laws and usages of war  embodies the conventions that this country and Germany had entered into.
And that was right at the end of the war  and my dad used to travel back and forth in Amsterdam.
Good night  and see you again.ﬂ (German) 32 03:52:18 Tell me the end of the war very briefly.
The destination uh of uh Venice...beca use the Italian government was the only government in the world  not only in Europe   that didn't require a visa for people who wanted to immigrate and we had uh...we had the full intention to go to uh either Holland where my mother had uh customers  or to Australia and we got stuck uh with uh the outbreak of World War III  which uh star ted when Chamberlain and   declared this is it.
And from then on  she went -- she went to Israel.
And so the-the whether its the war or [with] the -the -the question told you about ﬁHave you ever been arrested?ﬂ Well  of course Ive been arrested. (
But what happened -- do you know what happened to the Russians?
My father used to keep the memoirs i-in -- in the sewer  he -- he used to write  but a-after the war he wrote -- he had a -- wrote a -- a -- with his -- his handwriting memoirs and when he came to visit me in the United States in 1975  w-w-we force him to put his -- in writing and to -- to write this on -- on the typewriter.
04:10:22 Maybe they were treated better than we were   because prisoners of war  that is  but the Germans didn't care very much about the Geneva convention  that they should be treated like human beings.
In the theater you could forget  you see  the war  and especially for me  I had no chance  nothing  no cafes  just no -- it was war time bor ing.
SB: Lets go back and talk about when the war actually started  what you saw  what you heard.
During the war  I must say that most of the war rea lly spent standing in line for food.
So  then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my friend Alena who went to school with me  her mother was a pediatrician before the war.
Did that feel good about it  to be able to be a Jew again?
A. Many people came an openly apologized for not having talked to us during the war when the law said that Christians cannot speak to Jews and Jews cannot speak to Christians.
Avoiding the bullets  avoiding the bullets because they would shoot in  and they would go to the door on the other end  but we were close over by the war.
Are you speaking afte r the war or during the In '44  during that time.
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 7 Right  and he was quite active in in in that military  he was already in reserves  but Soviets still  you know  has So youre talking now youre jumping a little bit to World War II Oh  yes.
So  did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?
And that was because we had a lot of people coming in  you know  coming ba ck from the  you know  the war.
And at that time Americans wanted to pay the pa y the dues for for fighting  for independence of Poland from the Bolsheviks ; this is the first World War.
But then the Germans  several days before the war end   began to give up and then we had these tremendous lines of prisoners.
And it was cold during the war  we had no heat  and I -- all those memories were very close to that time that passport picture was taken.
I hope that after the war I hope I acquire other blouse.
And then they shipped us down to Lourdes where thousands and thousands of French war orphans were there  Interview with Al fred Lakritz April 3  2008 73and thats located near the border with Spain and so they sent us there for sure  to put us among this great mass of orphan ch ildren that we would be saved in that process.
And I would constantly say to my father  you know  typically  Daddy  tell me what you did in the war.
But  I will not associate socia lly with the guys I know who previously had been big Nazis to all of a sudden cater to us  and ﬂ -- ﬁThats okay ﬂ he said  ﬁbut like I said  youre not going there to stir up trouble in the German agency.ﬂ They all had ph-phony names  and there were war criminals who were hired after the war  but soon gotten rid of later  but they came in there.
I was in the war  served durin g the time of Korea.
When you came to the United States -- youve told me a little about your decision  but I wonder if youd tell me more about the -- about your parents and their discussions about where they would go after the war.
I was going in another partisans from my group  and I thought 11 nothing not thinking too much -- I thought  ﬁIn the morning I'll come back and I'll get my bullet belt.ﬂ But you are not do -- you are not allowed to do this during the war.
And one reason why  during the interview where I discover where everybody discovered that the boat had actually had me on board  what actually happened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp  because hed been injured during the war  where his fellow Mr. Kerr was almost killed  when he was introduced to me  and remember the last name  which is somewhat unusual  there the the reason why he remembered that was that my father had  as a gift  made given him a silver cigarette he was a smoker and had engraved in it  a thank you note from him  last name being Korzen .
We  I think that it was a  so good school that  also  after the war  the life was not every time so easy.
We had a lot of historic war cri -- war department commissioned historians who wanted to interrogate these prisoners.
5 >> Bill Benson: During that period until 1944  of course war is going on elsewhere in Europe and Slovakia is allied with the Germans.
I w-wanted to know what your feelings about being Jewish were.
He survived -- both he and one of my father's brothers  both survived as German prisoners of war.
Not of course with the persecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared and he always – I remember one of the th ings that he always used to say was  ﬁWell  this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about the Jews  particularly the Jews that had served Germany in the war and so on and so forth  or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesnt believe in all that nonsense and if it do esnt work out  we will leave on the ﬁlast trainﬂ.ﬂ Whatever that ﬁlast trainﬂ meant  we never caught it.
But the  by the time we got near  the people knew the war was over because airplanes and radios  they had  somebody had a radio--they had one radio in the camp--and they knew the war was almost over.
My relatives in Spain   who fled Germany   saved them and sent them to me after World War II.
So that was -- that was the end of the war for me.
This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museums post-Holocaust interview project  and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Paul Strassmann on July the 11th  1990.
Even in Germany after the war  they found it better to hide that they are Jewish.
I had  in the meantime  39 - 40  most of the relatives that were in -- were left in Germany had gotten out.
And it was a town  population  I think  I would say around 12 -- before the war  12 000.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 >> Bill Benson: Alex  thank you so much for joining us and for your willingness to be our First Person today.
However the following year I remember in the second grade we only went to school for two  three months  and I thought that was terrific (laughter) because then the war broke out and we stopped going to school.
>> Bill Benson: So when you were in the bunker and you realized that these were Russian soldiers and eventually you came out  do you know if there was a sense of it really is over for us now or because there was still obviously war going on around you  a fear that the Iron Guard or the Germans would  you know  counterattack and you would be right back in the same situation?
Now remember  I didnt the only language I knew was German.
Poland had a...while while they were threatened by war they had to call an action urbaniza...urbanization ...to make the citie s and towns look great.
The US didn't get into the war until 1941  so once you go into the main exhibit you will see headlines that the American public knew all about things up to the start of the war  in Germany.
Now  your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war.
>> Bill Benson: You told me that in those early pre -war days that you were very full of patriotism for Hungary.
And then we slowly -- Do you remember the beginning of the war in September 39?
I told you that my aunt send to the Red Cross.
Was ver y va I mean  the end of the war  at least we survive  and a lot of people didnt survive  because they eat like a start to eat Yeah. [
What was more difficult was during the depression as said  when I was depressed that was  yeah that was worse to bear than what I went through during the war  yeah.
And Franco was helped with his Civil War by the Germans and the Italians.
Okay  we have a tape -- a -- a photograph here of yourself with your family before the war.
18 Telford Taylor (1908-)  American Chief of Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg.
And while that case was pending against us  trying to get us to leave the country  the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and started World War II.
He said  you will work and help us to win the war.
And when the war came  we were short  short of people.
45 Albert Speer(1905-1981)  Reich Minister for War Production from 1942 to 1945.
Germany attacked Poland September 1939   World War II began b ut not yet in Belgium.
Im just afraid whoever wins this war  will do the same to the other guy  always.
The last few days in Buchenwald before the end of the war  I had to go to work.
Any recollection during that year  or even with Pearl Harbor in December  any the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December and Americans going into the war.
He could have run away  but he wouldn't leave the family  because we had a very strong bond  and even after the war  they made if there was a wife  you go back to Kovno to see if you can find the wife and he went back.
It became more and more important later on towards the end of the war  you know  when we were all in the same boat  you see  where we were all living underground after having been liquidated by the Nazis.
I knew it was there  but they build it before the war.
Uh we were the first and only Jews  about two hundred and fifty of us and that camp was attached to a factory in which they manufactured the casings for bombs and therefore there was a need for lathe operators and all that stuff and it was one of those...as as the war was going on  the time was passing  conditions were getting worse and worse.
They sent her to Auschwitz  but my sisters wound up to be -- I heard after the war they were sent to Gdansk [or] Gdingen  where they worked in a factory where they were manufacturing uniforms for the German Army.
You can spot a Jew during the war  they looked super.
He -- he came out after the war  so he survived the -- the war.
I knew where the war fronts were because this was the the discussions of Theresienstadt  where the Russians are  where the Americans are.
9 >> Bill Benson: In time  your mother  your aunt and you were able to escape from Communist Romania and made your way to a Displaced Persons Camp after the war had ended.
I might add that my mother went to work for the United Service for New Americans  a refugee aid society in New York  very important for the many refugees that came to these shores after the war.
In fact  after the war  he was  he and his wife ar e both devout Catholics  an d  you don't have to tape this.
Because I seem to understand Yiddish after the war and I couldnt figure out how  soŠ it had to be.
But that I remember so good  and after  you know  I went to school  and we came back and my father  he said  and my mother is not doing good at the its we are in the Interview with Helena Knapczyk May 10  2013 46 war.
indecipherable] Canada [indecipherable] Jews and so did the United States  but finally there was a -- Truman introduced a law into Congr ess and they -- to let in all refugees of the second war.
Well but so he was bor -- he was baptized in the Protestant faith  and then my mother lost her husband during the first few weeks of the first World War  and became very ill with tuberculosis  which meant she -- thanks to the help of the friend of the family  the victor - Queen Victorias great grand-nephew  the count of Coburg and Gotha -- not count  Im sorry  the duke of Coburg and Gotha saw to it that she was put in a -- in a -- a sanitorium  and she survived very well.
It was relatively safer there and that is what led us to believe  that when the order finally came for us to report to the ghetto that we could survive somehow and maybe wait out the war by living in Borek Falecki without reporting to the ghetto.
Uh... Did you have any any experiences with anti-Semitism before the war?
One was in the duke's place synagogue in London which was bombed during the war.
The Foreign Ministry was behind it  they hav had to ha ve some excuse  they were desperately looking for an excuse for the outbreak of World War II.
Give you an ex ample liberate--how many Jewish people you find what they kill Germans after the war?
It was very frightening because we did - war was something strange to us.
So I volunteered to the army and Youre 18 by now?
And no stockings because there were no stockings to be had during the war and  you know  I remember the coat  which was very handsome.
The war was on and I co ntinued organizing and I organized there.
The father died  the mother sent him to Amer ica to be out of the war  to be with th -- he had the same -- he did the same thing.
And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war.
I remember that very well and  uh  we lived in an apartment that...it's sort of vague to me  but it was an apartment that I think while our...while we couldn't get our our original apartment back we lived in this  uh  apartment that one of the Germans had lived in during the war who was quite wealthy  and I remember the apartmen t as being quite luxurious and the kind of a place where you couldn't touch anything and and so different from the farm where  you know  everything was so comforta ble and I could just run around and here I felt I had to be this proper lady and everything had to be kept perfectly because the apartment didn't belong to us and the furnishings didn't belong to us and nothing really belonged to us and  uh  I just felt uncomfortable  and  uh  I don't remember a nything about school.
What was it like for you to be in Germany  and how did you find the Germans?
A. The war ended in May  so it was shortly after  maybe June or July.
Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms of providing shelter for refugees  which is something we ought to have learned from the last 113 world war.
They used to come and visit us and so we knew that the war is coming to an end.
My mother felt that they in terfere a lot in the war of and when we heard that eventually maybe the Germans come  my mother said  \ It couldn't be worse.\
So  they got the thing back  but because it was so left-leaning  the whole Czechoslovakia after World War II  because the Soviet Union  we were your protectors  and the country was really very much to the left  which we didnt care for.
And we knew that today  that day  May 8  1945  they were announcing the end of the war.
After the war  I understand he became a financial advisor to the Vatican.
So they made up  he lost his entire family in the war.
Somethin g bad about what the Jewish people don't  you know  or you hear the story somebody sa y before the war even.
The Korean war was on in full blast  and I wanted to serve my country  my adopted country  and I joined the Marine Corps  United States Marine Corps.
But -- but what happened in between is that the United States went to war.
They had interviewed a lot of German people about Crystal Night there  and it they they had th-this film was made aactually after the war  in 1989  so much later.
Can you tell me a little bit  if anything  that you remember from before the war?
But it still  from what I understand  the Germans  when talking about the September war  1939 war  in their reports said that some of the bravery was enviable  about Poles before they died  or before they had to leave the post  or so mething.
I began to get a sense of the bad things that were being done to the Jews and -- but I still wasn't clear that I was a Jew at all.
He was -- we -- I saw him after the war  and the -- I remember my mom  for we -- used to bring me to this place where we lived before -- before the war.
So each had our bed  and there was one very energetic girl that I met after the war and became friends with and had her mother there too  she had the energy to take a big pot of water and boil potatoes which was the best thing for our stomachs.
And he said like that  ﬁWhatever he did  this will be after the war.
When he was growing up...uh...when he was growing up  when he became a young man in the 30s...uh..  tell us about...uh...his involveme nt in the Spanish Civil War.
We all knew  however -- I also knew tha -- about what happened in January in 41 before Romania entere d the war  when there was the -- not the riot but the attempt to a coup -- coup detat that -- the coup by the Iron Guard to grab power  and Antonescu was the leader  use the ar my to -- to squelch that -- that attempt to grab the power  anand defeated the Iron Guard.
And once the war was over  and we moved back a block away on East Seward Road  the same thing occurred.
Oh  you asked me about what I kn ew about the war.
After the Second World War  after Holocaust  fifty years  seventy-five years  people forget about it and they will not like to discuss it no more.
He started in the first World War was [indecipherable]  the first  before Poland became independent in 1914  til he was taken prisoner by Soviets in 1939.
And he felt that because he was in the -- in the Army during the first world war and he was an officer and he was decorated that they're not going to touch him.
Of course especially the anti-Jewish part of it and that when Best tipped him off saying that th is day the of the Jews will take place and Best is quoted by Tuckawitz by the way  after the war.
It came out slowly after the war  it came out  even so set so far that last year when I was in Germany  I heard certain things which I didn't even know happened during the war.
It -- you know  give me some background in Europe and -- and also the war of Japan.
I dont -- End of Tape Three  Side A Beginning Tape Three  Side B USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 75 This is a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing.
In any case  all those who were left behind were...died in the war.
Because after the war my father came to this country and after the war he went to the Red Cross to find out about relatives.
When--the moment the war broke out  I had no more opportunity.
Such as  you know  Hitler came to power in Germany ?
I dont think that if my folks would have left  before the war  lets say  and immigrated to America and I would have been born here  most likely they would have acclimated themselves to the life in America and -- and you know  when I look -- for instance  I work in Washington Hebrew  so they have pictures from very early century when the synagogue was built by German Jews.
And they brought me into Stalag 13 in the film you will see  Stalag 13 as a prisoner of war.
But  I don't think that anybody thought of it as strictly political war or even any political overtones.
And those who had no partner were not even seeking for any partner  because they had their husbands at home  or in -- during the war  somewhere on the front  or they were old  and were never married  and had no -- di dnt know what it means to have a partner at all  yeah  spinsters  who were -- but they were decent people who were idealists  because that was the reason why they were put into the camp as Socialists or Communists.
Yeah  I remember him after the war  I do remember him.
After Stalingrad we thought maybe  you know  there might be somebody if if the Germans throw the Hitler away  or something may some but most likely Germans have lost the war.
The Russian-German war started on in June 1941  and the deportations happened the same month.
They w ould have helped me because I was fighting during the war.
Well  during the war  I I with the bombing  two doors down  there was another shelter there  and those people let us in because we did have the bombing scares  and we were in the shelter  and all of us  the people th Were these allied bombers?
And then -- yeah  an-and -- and then you -- you -- and you -- were -- you were still interrogating German soldiers?
And I don't know exactly what happened  if she survived the war or not  bu t anyway this is what was happening as far as Mrs. Chi-chin-ska was concerned.
Everybody slept on  on straw  but nothing mattered anymore  you know  because we knew that he will not  he will do everything  it was not absolutely sure  but we believed that he will do everything in his power to uh let to  to help us survive the war.
So the first step  my firs t step was to convince him that he had lost th e war.
We had a good cousin in Cuba who lived there -- went there after the first World War.
You said something earlier about how when the war ended  you became again  the person who you had been before.
I wonder if you had any continuing fears that are kind of left over scars or wounds from the war.
I I must say I Where did you live after the war?
And then my s -- my daughter -- my daughter Miriam was born in 1943  during the war.
He's talking about one of the reasons that I didn't -- I was lucky because the war with the United States hadn't started.
We came back from war  and the whole lager was under -- outside.
This guy was a guy who was an official of a bank in Warsaw before the war.
Um  as prisoners of war  they didn't even feed some of them.
Well  I was at that time 14 years when  when the war broke out  and at that time we were transported next to Auschwitz  where we used to build  uh  literally  we can say  build Auschwitz at that time.
They were imprisoned because United States was at war with that country  who attacked the United States.
So in 1942 is when she did it and wrote it  wrote the letter  and you only got it after the war?
This was the oven - I saw the oven in Bergen-Belsen; after the war we went there an d I don't know I wasn't on the list the I survived  my younger sister too.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: At the end of the war he was exhausted and worn ou t  worn out.
But it is certain it prevented -- this additional catastrophe and this part of the war  too  which we shouldn't forget.
I mean  one of the things that Id like to ask both of you  and this touches I mean  your your story on this touches on that  and thats that theme of  what do contacts with Germans  ethnic Germans  non-Jews  what kind of contacts are there  so many years after the war  and what kind of feelings do they leave you with?
They came and they had their log book from World War II showing their missions and how good they were.
I had pre-war contacts and I had a pre-war -- after the war contract with -- with the Czechs  with -- in certain factories.
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 15 And they were dividing the land after the war.
Lives after the war and lives to have a pretty good life afterwards.
I know you know very little about your family and their lives prior to your birth.
Meantime  you win the war  and how many Jewish or Polish live -- lost your life?
Af ter the war I found out that about three days later  the Nazis raided the building and they took the children to the Danube and they shot them.
Its around Reims  Versailles  its -- its -- it was near your well known during the World War One.
Because because this was the only the only segment of the Polish armed forces who could who was most precious  because they were very well trained  with experience in fights during that two weeks of war  three weeks.
It woul d seem that because of the chaos of th e war that was happening nearby the truck didn't arrive that day.
Anyway  since England had a pact with Poland -- on the 3rd of September 1939 Mr. Chamberlain declared war on Germany.
And they  try to remember  with some a lot of planes  war planes from Russia start to fly over the city and maybe some American flights.
So  Id like to know a little bit more about 1944 and 1945 for you.
So what did  I mean youre a little girl still  what did that mean that the war is over?
Then also my father's youngest brother was also taken for the Russian Army.
>> Bill Benson: What about the rest of your family in Germany?
Well  talking about the war brings a lot of bad memories  and a lot of heartache.
>> Bill Benson: With you and your sister there with her.
After the war  it didnt wasnt no longer part of it  I just wanted to get out of there  thats all.
Theres a war and they will be defeated at some point  and things will change.
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
You know  like -- I mean  we all felt that President Roosevelt did not do much for -- you know  for the Holocaust.
No  and then my father was arrested and until then he could practice because he was a wounded veteran of World War I. And then he was put in Dachau for a while.
This is me and I was -- its about seven y ear old  just after the war in Dnepropetrovsk.
They got good pay  they received good food  add ..adequate housing  and they worked in the war effort.
By that time I was eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet.
And you mention that you did not speak about the war -- No  no. --
Because we went in po End of Tape One  Side B Interview with Joseph Koplewicz October 7  1993 58Beginning Tape Two  Side A Can you tell us something about what happened in Poland after the war was over  between September Yeah.
He  as a matter of fact  volunteered coming back to the army  you know?
After the war  decided to keep that little town as it is.
Do you recall if there were different phases as you get into 1943-1944  or once you were out of school it was basically the same daily routine until the end of the war.
But he gave him some paintings in order to -- in order to preserve them and give it -- give them back to us after the war.
And we were arrested in the local uh arrest of the Czech police and it was not at war.
You know  and we know little bit more because we have Polish people who live in Berlin before the war -- Mm-hm. --
You  in our last interview  had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends around Budapest and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you would talk about.
He left -- they liv ed in a city called Kielce and in 1937 too  he left for the United States  hoping to bring his wife  my sister  and a little  four year old little girl to America  and that never materialized because of the war broke out.
We had just talked about different ways that this has shaped your character  that the Holocaust and war experience.
I know that we have almost no chance to survive  but I am willing to give my life with the knowledge that my thr ee girls will survive the war.ﬂ And  you know  since what we had in 1945  right after the war  and I feel that all the difficult situations that we went through  in moments where we really felt that its the end  we reached a point of no return  that it was really my mother who was wa tching over us.
Were there still Germans and then ba by that I mean soldiers  inside the camp  or not?
You were in the Crimea in 1941 when the war began?
He was in the German army  in the front line  and just like today when we have a war  on -- World War Two  families send packages to their sons  who are soldiers  or -- or communities do that to the sons of the community who are fighting wars.
Well  we stayed living at home because -- because of the war.
So non -Jewish family start to understand  and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost.
As a matter of fact  right after the war I came in contact with some people from Fran ce.
We could only listen and hope and pray that the war will end.
Every year there was  or every couple of months there was a raid that you had to bring certain things for the possible war that they are going to fight against the allies.
It was German occupied  German soldiers were all over the place.
You were born just at the time that the Firs t World War started.
But of course  during the war a you know  were keeping  you know  with Jews you keep kashrut   you know  its very important.
He says  we are going to war to learn how to fight.
There were sk irmishes in Poland and Russia which led to the war in 1920  1921.
And but since France  Vichy  France was at war with England   a British warship captured that ship and brought it into Trinidad.
We heard already news that the Nazis  the German military is going to war with the Soviet Union.
First when I wrote the first letter after the war  she was completely sure that I was alive.
Because during World War II  there was a lot of resistance in Belgiu m and...World War I  I'm sorry  I ap ologize.
For example  they gave me the test in history  they saw that I knew history up to the first war  like I know my name.
As it happened there were quite a few Hungarians there  Jews and non-Jews.
Which it was that it was shameratsyer  that it was a youth organization belonging to the Zionist organization  and th at spark kept through me  it was the new thing  just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto  and become a resister  and fight the Nazis  this is how it was  the new fighting that it became in me  and I assume in the rest of the guys that are war with me  because when people reso rted themselves to go on train -- to a -- rooftops  and on the steps to go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable] on their shoulders  and speeds of the trains maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour  maybe 60  ttimes 50  doesnt matter the speed.
After the war  we found out that when the Germans were passing -- well  the Germans usually had h elp from the Ukrainian police or Polish police.
And when the war broke out  her husband went into the navy and was stationed in the South Pacific .
Tape 3 I just couldn't see  God forbid  they will take him to Vietnam  to another war  he could get killed.
I did not know exactly what the organizational structure behind all of it wa s. I didnt hear the word Einsatzgruppen until after the war.
And then the UNRRA  the the ur United Nations Refugee organization  the director said to me  what would you have been doing if you were if there hadnt been no war?

And there  on these plates  they build the building on the district th e office of the district of Michalovce   and there they dedicated a plaque in Slovak and in Hebrew that it there on this place was a synagogue for the Jews who were who were killed in the concentration camp during the war  and I think even they say the no  not the numbers  I think th are not there  how many of them.

He was a very nice fellow  who became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army  and then I found out later on  when I met him after the war  in Prague  how terrible all these officer were treated.
But as far as when the war started  I think the main thing was duty.
I assume for a few months  I mean I assume that immediately after the war he was  it took months to recuperate.
It was a concentration camp but not like  nothing like what the Germans had.
During the war  when we were alone and my father we nt to the army  she started buying and selling things.
Well  let me tell you what happened to me after the war  that I haven't said that too often  hardly ever  I don't think I ever told my fa mily.

In Ermita  when we found out that the war was coming.
And interesting enough I remember that my late brother when to the same primary school a year before I did  and my brother  George  much later...it was already almost war time  he went to that same primary school which was called Princess Julienne.
In Poland you know we had many  many  very many poor Jews.
Yes  then the school actually closed  and we were very glad that the classes ended  without realizing what the war meant.
Which turned out to be a bad decision on my part  I thought many  many times during the war.
Plenty of food we had already there  and this was the best conditions in the war since the war started.
A-At this point did you know what was going on in the camps?

The Lischka case was about his high responsibility for the fate of the Jews of France  the German who had helped with the Vichy government had decided the arrest and deportation of the Jews from France  76 000 were deported  and after the Achenbacker case we learned that Brandt was signing a new treaty with France in order to obtain the possibility to dash the discriminaters of the 200 sentences after the war by the military courts  but there were no ways to sentence them because as German citizens in France they asked to extradite them  but as German citizens they were not expelled to France  at this time the French Military Courts could still sentence them  and the French after the war had in a first review asked the German not to take care of them because they were afraid that sentencing them  in Germany in military courts in absentia  to life in prison or to death  but never caught  but Germany sentencing t hem to life  so there was a kind of blocking therefore no sentences in France or Germany.
We had mail from our parents because my parents found a way to communicate with us via Hungary  before Hungary -- because Hungary was not in the war.

All the time  when the Hungarians were before the First World War  and the Austrian life was very beautiful over there  very great.

And when the war ended  I was much in northern Italy  not far from the Po River  and I forget the little town that we were in.
He said  I don't know but I think that we still win th e war.
When he got I guess this must have been on the Russi an/Polish border somewhere  he said that a man came to him who was in the Russian ar my and surrendered  and said that Im Jew soldier   and so he -my father took him home to Pozega along with his horse  and the man stayed I dont know how long with the family as a prisoner of war.
It was everything normal until one dayŠit was about the 7 th of May  7 th of May  yeahŠcame KGB and took us all  took us to a place where it was about a few thousand Russian former prisoners of war  that big villa with a big backyard.
When the war broke out on June 22nd  they tell us we cannot go home.
Certainly our people  many of our people were were crying and so and and praying  and my reaction was  I said be happy uh to see them b ecause you might have relatives sitting in the cockpit  you know  and and doing this work in our interest  and certainly you had to reckon that you could be also amongst the targets  but this is...in war  you know  you you you unfortunately you don't know where it hits.
1940  and the war has started in Poland and people are frightened  and everyones a politician finally  in Belgium.

That's famous for steel work  so they worked at that time of the war  they built airplanes there.

5 Do you have any sort of fond  clear memories of life at -- at home  or in the city  in Koretz before the war started?
And Interview with Lucie Ragin July 23  2009 4we were very happy family and all of a s udden they said it woul dnt be good for the Jewish people to stay in Antwerp because the war was broke breaking out.
So then  now after the war and after you were freed  you went back home.
After the war  I met a nei ghbor of ours who survived in hiding  the age of my parents.
After the war they did not -- most people they did not have a separate apartment  they got a common restroom  a common shower  a common kitchen  and six  seven families  they shared.
As I was saying -- saying to get back t-to the war  you were following what was happeni ng and communication got less and less -- Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 46 Yes. --
That I got a special kick out of  that a rabbi should be supplying German prisoners of war with New Testaments in German.
When war started  my father had to go to to the army.
Now I think I was allowed to stay in this German high school because my father had been a what they call a frontkempfer [ph]  somebody who had fought in combat in World War I  and Jews who had that status had at the beginning certain privileges.
You think the people who were protesting the wa r just didnt understand the nature of war itself?
And where did you keep this  so that you c ould get it after the war?
Maybe the war will take a little longer  but it's not going to be that bad.
Before you tell us what happened to you under the Nazis and during World War II and the Holocaust  tell us about your family and their life before Hitler came to power.
We couldnt get a house after the war  we came back.
I was  you know  skinny after the war  but my fat cells grew in that sanitarium.
Only after the First World War this part where mother used to live was called Grungrund when the Austrian people took it.
>> Bill Benson: Your parents made the decision to not stay in Poland very long after the war.
I wanted to go back to something that I m-missed asking you before and that was just in -- in the immediate years  right following the war  when youre sp -- youre spending those years in Germany  were you -- what was your predominant feeling at the time?
He was  after the war  he was pastor of a small village for several years and enjoyed that very much.
Did -- Y-You were in Israel in -- during the War of Independence?
At one time  having read a fair amount of anti-Amer ican propaganda during the war  I thought the United States has a lot of problems.
But the Korean [indecipherable] was coming the finish the war  they gave up.
Well  they uh they eventually collected uh all the children and uh not only from Auschwitz but uh from the other uh wherever they found uh refugee children  survivors.
>> Bill Benson: And you would remain  of course  living with the Debrackalaers until the war ended in Belgium in 1944.
What were the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 conditions like there?
And they went -- That was before Germany attacked Poland -- Russia.
No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was the old war hawk that was used  basically  in China.
When you were at Robb s till  in the concentration camp there and the Italians capitulated  what did you know  or what did you hear about the war at that time  had you been hearing a lot about the war?
By the time the war ended  you had even been in the partisans  lets say helping in the underground a little bit.
I'm still not clea r to this day -- and  of course  I will never know -- whether my parents had me because they had a sense that the war was coming or the fact that my brother at that time was 9 months old and it was an opportunity to send me.
They had no choice  because if they had an arsenal of weapons to say well tomorrow morning we're going to give weapons to a thousand boys and we'll go out and have a little war with the Germans instead of sending them  there was no such thing.
He suffered the concentration camp of Dachau and I wanted to know whether he had come back from the war and whether there is anything I could do for him.
And I was hoping that these bullets would misfire and I was hoping that in this way it would be my part of the war effort against the Nazis.
So that was very recent from the time that the war had started in Yugoslavia  which was April 6.
So my father's older brother died 01:04: 4 before the war  and his younger brother died in a concentration camp in  I think  Auschwitz.
Then  it looks like the Germans find out in the camp that he was an officer in their Army in World War I. They sent him to .
And when I came there  they were hidden al -- th-through the whole war.
CE: Well  there was a lot of Dutch prisoners of war  somehow they came to be there.
I was  you know  I was very much of a child be fore the war.
And after that he discussed it with other people who were in that line of work before the war and they decided to start.
When the war was over the Russian told us if we want to go back to Poland   we can go.
I was dread the fearing that at the end...it was clear that the war was over.
I didn't want to have children because I was afraid that another war would come one day  and that my children shouldn't have to live through the same thing I did  and then I said  \ No  I have to show the terrible people who wanted to kill us all  that they cannot kill a race  and I have to build a new family because they took my family away.
She survived and came to America  and after the war and since then she died.
And in addition to his action work during World War II  he did the same thing.
So one Russian officer came in  a very intelligent man  a nd he says  \ Listen  the war is over.
We had a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of that sort of thing basically.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned to us that your father served in the Austrian Army.
My father  who was in the German Army  was stationed as an occupation soldier.
And they always  you know  you went to catechism  and you learned the Bible  and it was really a life thing  you know  and you had to -- and I still think  I mean words are cheap  but then you have to do  and thats why I went -- we all went in Rothenberg  and Im really proud be cause after the war  years later  I had to go -- in the Netherlands after the war  the queen made a new department  like you have here  agriculture  and to -- now whatever  all the departments.
And I had  must say this was us ed  which I found out only later  in certain concentration camps to whip up the emotions   the anti-Semitic emotions of the of the guards against us  so after I had seen it af ter the war  I said I wonder...I I'm surprised that anyone is still alive after these people have seen it.
>> Bill Benson: Will you tell us -- before we go back to that.
We were already liberated  but the war was still going on.
And um...when the Second World War broke out  you know  uh we were already in...we moved to Bucharest in '38. [
We already heard obviously before -- before the -- the -- the -- you know  bef -- before this whole thing happened  all the problems of the war  and th -- obviously in the attack on Poland.
There were a a prisoners of war s  were a lot of in there.
What else can you tell me about your life before the war?
You don't see any single person  and curfew was on till the end of the war.
And Wh-Wh-When did you leave Germany and how long were you there?
I I don't fight in the war but I was fighting in the war after that.
So  as soon as possible  I had an opportunity once in who was originally his parents were living in the Parish  but he was a soldier during the war in 1940  and he was in the south.
And we knew  all of us  that the war was a terrible thing.
is a meaningful word  as ordi nary citizens of a society  that ther e be at least the potential  if we do something like what was done during the second World War  regardless of the circumstances in which the individual found hims elf  whether he was compelled to do it  or whether he did it out of his own a -- a -- as a volunteer  that there be some possibility of legal consequence for that  no matter how many years go by  in terms of that type of crime  I -- I feel 81 - in a recent news reports of the proceedings against the Chilean -- former Chilean dictator  Augusto Pinochet  that this -- though there are legal problems at every stage  theres serious legal problems  the idea that our world  as a world society now  is no longer prepared to sweep responsibility for crimes in an official position  where an official abuses the law and causes death and suffering to people in his care  or her care  if in the future  that -- that there shouldnt be some  somewhere down the line  the possibility of legal consequence for that.
I hadnt gone 100 yards up the road and there was a dirty great tiger tank coming down the road with a big swastika on the side  a big black cr oss and there was err a fellow  I presume a German officer  sticked up in the turret there and in perfect English he said to me  ﬁCome on boys drop your weapons  for you the war is over.ﬂ So I was a prisoner of war. [
Right now  what Im trying to get a sense of is what was life like in pre war Germany   in your childhood.
There was -- they have on the back marked ﬁPY36 ﬂ prisoner of war.
And I basically was not a top student like my friend Eva War burg  but I was a good student.
Do you know why your parents  like after war broke out in Septe mber 1939  why they left Paris but would return?
Tell me a little bit about what your life was like  before the War.
>> Dora Klayman: They were actually a nationalist group that had gathered in Italy before the war.
And this did -- this was an importa nt factor because s ubsequently when we were working in Germany under the -- while the war was on  and afterwards and the occupation  there were times when what the military authorities wanted us to do and what the Quakers would think would be the appropriate thing to do were n't quite the same.
But she had guts enough that the war she became later a doctor  M.D. A2: And she married a Christian and she didnt tell him anything.
There was a big then the Germans started there to ma ke  they figure out already that theyre going to go in war with Russia.
And and thats all within the first week of the war?
We were put aboard this ship and we were through half the world for nearly five weeks and arrived by some mysterious coincidence on the very day the war ended.
And they return after th e war to Lithuania  to Wilna because I hoped that somebody of 73 the family will stay alive  and we said to each other  wherever the war will finish  wherever you be  you return to Wilna  and its here well meet .
But this was now 45  you know  the war was over  so there wasnt much happening any more.
>> Bill Benson: Once you were liberated  you were liberated by the Americans.
Now  during the war  lo -- you have to be in some way -- you have to use the authorities of German  and therefore I -- I will mention for you who I was.
And I went to the kitchen  I remember before the war  in 1939 -- before the war  my mother bought a credenza for the kitchen.
Why dont you tell me a little b it about when the war broke out?
Heres my immigration visa.ﬂ The war wasnt on yet  but I was a very thorough in- And my brother and my mother a nd I were sitting in this inn absolutely quaking with fear.
At least during the war  and then -- then for another year  or almost a year  yes?
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 16 Im talking after the war  when did you find out her story?
At that point I sear ched for my mother after th e war  and I wound up with the German Red Cross  or Inte rnational Red Cross  at and they had a listing saying that all the women and children went straight in to the gas chamber  of that transport.

Szymon remained with that...with the group down there  and he did some what ever he did down there also the same thing like going out and derailing  whatever  and he remained and after the war I met him.
At that time I didnt know about the -- the Korean -- the -- the reason of the Korean war.
My wife now  she find out which her name is Bella  Brocha in in Yiddish  she find out that I am going to the Korea to the war.
So there had already been -- those laws had already been introduced afte r the first world war and slowly increased and so on.
Because lets not forg et that there were a lot of poor Jews in Poland.
And be friends  you know  as we was before the war started  you know  I had so many friends  I still got so many friends there  Jewish friends  yeah.
In some cases the Intelligence had reports  and I had a map  a war map showing camps at different sites of the major camps  so they kne w we were there and we would move for them and I could tell we were probably going to hit that camp in four or fi ve days and get ready for it.

And this is why I wanted to run away  but my parents  the factory was still going full swing and my mother was telling me in the First World War they were having a paradise in Poland.
I had some people who were wi th her and told me that she died in the last days of the war.
Here  my year is finished   I go back.ﬂ The rules were that you stayed two years in a place where theres no war. [
Was a beautiful  fragrant spring morning  was in April  and uh  I remember I jumped over the fence  and went to the garden  and pretended that uh  that I was just  I was picking violets  and I pretended just for a little bit  what it would be like if uh  if the war hadn't happened  if I would be going in  my mother would say I  I need to take my raincoat to school  and my brother would be hurrying off  my father would be going to his office  my mother would be setting the table for breakfast  and urging us to -----------  and uh  I remember it was sort of the most incredible thing that um  uh the reality which I had always taken for granted  now became uh the most remote fantasy.
And then the system kept it all the way secret until the war.
And thirdly  if you have an agreement on how to conduct a war  war crimes  define what the rules are  and if you break those rules  youre guilty of war crimes.
Nothing will happen  and they just...just be brave ...hold out  because the war will be soon over.

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 >> Bill Benson: Right.
No  no  its 1985  was the 40th anniversary of the end of the war.
That time this was 1940  I think  when the Russian made a Hitler make a pact with Stalin  they not gonna go to war any more  they go not gonna fight.
And as soon as they hear that the war start  a lot of people run away to Russia.
I remember writing in my journal   which I donated to the Museum now  saying I hoped that the war will end soon.
I was already in Poland  after the war  I have a high position  I had -- I was established  I -- I ruled -- not ruled  but I -- I could do a lot of things  and people respected me  and here I came over  and I was nothing.
So I -- in -- in two cases I was the first Jewish American soldier who -- who entered them.
Yeah  oh yeah  because who I was after the Holocaust  after the war was the exact  in some ways the exact opposite of who I am today.
But I suppose because we lived in a big city  it was a second -- as I said  second biggest city in Poland  and you know  there was a million inhabitants before th e war  and 25 percent  like 240 000 were Jewish people.
My father had died a nd I was in the Korean War and she had to sort of make her own way.
When the war was over  how many Jewish children did we find?
Well  we came here  and -- well  I met my -- well  no  no -- after the war  we decided that we are going to continue with our education.
Interview with Fred Firnbacher September 16  2010 31 That was confiscated by the Nazis  my grandmother had to sign it over  and after the war  we did get some restitution for it.
Stories from before the war  stories from the war  from cruelties  from -- so I have this  and I have the title  so we worked this.
Not even friends  not even when I go down to Americ an Legion or the vets  I never told about war.
They said the 75th infantry company went through there  through the area  and I had a map -- had their all map f -- when they went to the war  and they send out two scouts  to find out where the Germans [indecipherable]  and those two scouts never came back.
But at the base of that was my fathers hatred of Bolshevism  because dont forget  in the -- in the si -- the trigger for my dad actually was reawakening him to the threat of Bolshevism in the -- the civil war in Spain.
>> Bill Benson: So they were part of the German Army.
So the war is over in 45  and what happened with you?
And witki -- Witkiewicz was an avant-garde playwright who didnt quite fit the times yet  but he became the rage after the war.
So they got in with us as war prisoners; and that's funny but that's what th ey did.
So when youre growing up -- this is before the war -- Yeah. --
Interview with Marianne Roberts 10 April 11  2012 I think  and your father fought in World War I?
Ef -- during when I got -- during the war I heard about it  af-after I -- when the Germans invaded our city th en we -- then the news came around to -- then it was more open  people were talking about it.
I found out after the war when I went back th at those were Jewish young wome n who were also hiding in the orphanage  but since they were adults  they were dressed up in the nuns' habit.
So that when you were in Auschwitz one -- Yeah. --
Although the war was still going on  but Im not going back to work there.
So first of all  we we said we need to train youngsters to for as artisans that is so much needed for the German war effort  so this they understood  so it was that the school it was a course for preparing of artisans  but it wasn't...for all things and purposes it was...it was a school.
You ha-had obviously had an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 123experience during the war of -- of doing someth ing that many of us might consider being stereotypically male.
Th e 1600 plus people primarily professed to claim to be displaced persons captured in Central Europe  because of the war; but they really had Palestinian papers.
Probably  but again  you know  Im never quite sure -- and weve had this discussion with the Hidden Children  how much of -- of ones being can be blamed on the war.
You were 3 years old when World War II came directly to Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941 when it was attacked by Germany.
I need to...we need to stay with what happened during the war.
break] This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Jacob Wiener.
In a war situation  if you are Jewish or not  if you are caught  you are killed.
Just like I didnt want to dwell on the past  people in general  I think  immediately after the war  didnt want to do that.
And then in 47  when the American army decided to get rid of its draftees  that is  until the Korean war.
And now the war was over  and I went back to the trade school  and I finished one year of -- to get a diploma in instrument making.
And there they had a number of friends who had survived the war who had gone to Mexi co. Directly from Poland?
Then I said -- I just thought for a moment -- I sa id do you have any photographs of before the war?
Somehow they had no connection to us but they were willing to hide us  and so we lived with them until the end of the war.
But my question is is that  did he did the soldiers know that you were former prisoners?
So the first half a hour after the outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might  the Lithuanian fascists -- they called themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists   I don't know exactly -- the very same organization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities  they were within one half an hour in uniforms.
I dont think people even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war outside of concentration camps.
And he was sort of very happy with this idea to be an ambassador in Stockholm after th e war had been won.
And he married a Jewi sh woman  one whose sister and brother-inlaw actually emigrated to Palestine  to Israel then.
Had you dreams as a young boy  before the war  of another career?
World War II began with German's invasion of Poland on September 1  1939.
There were like a hundred children for a very short time  and we were supposed to be  I suppose they must have advised my mother to bring us there for a few m onths to retrain our thoughts to make us aware that the war was over  which I refused to believe.
She was in the kindergarten before...before the war and in the ghetto she volunteered to to held the kindergarten  of course in clandestine.
And when the war started  when the Germans  my grandmother  we made a meeting from the family  what we should do.
But after the war they didn't want to set foot in the synagogue anymore.
No  no  because -- the reason I didnt  because the Germans came in -- Oh  okay. --
>> Bill Benson: Once the Germans occupied Poland on September 1  1939  your life and that of your family changed swiftly and dramatically.
But a lot of shooting during the war because it was near a train station and they said to the neighbors that I was a little sick and I cannot stay in a big city  so they  it was around 50 miles from Brussels.
Slovakia enters the war in 1941 when -- when -- I think so [indecipherable] -- when the Soviet Union wa -- wa -- when the Soviet Union is a -- is attacked.
Now I started to learn English tunes  8 because they you know  they the war was getting to be over.
Excuse me  before we go on there again  I the reason why I ask about the war years is  how did your family react  how did your parents react when they when the U.S. when the war started in Europe ?
The whole war ended on May eighth  so five days later  everything was over.
SL: Even -- Even during the war  I understand was it -- I understand there was so much anti-Semitism going on  the Germans against the Jews in ame -- in -- right then your -- in York -- RL: Yorkreel.
But unfortunately  he was killed in a car accident on September 1 st  1929  10 years before the war was the second war.
Wha how do you leave [indecipherable] You mean when the war ended?
We didn't know what's going to happen tomorrow  if we survive or not while going t hrough the war.
The Jewish establishment was against it because they wanted to get good  on good terms with the British and they figured that they need the British after the war  the war was coming  there was no doubt about that.
That's interest ing  a matter of fact  like I told you  during the war exactly  we don't know exactly the components of this group because say I know one or two people  maybe four people  and other know other people.
I never know what happened  if he vanished  if he survived the war or not.
He originated from somewhere in Galatia   had served during World War I in the Austrian army  and uh after the war  after Worl d War I  he had made his way to Berlin  had established some existence as a cobbler  had married  uh had a nice family  and with a so-called Polish ar...with a Polish accent  in September 1939 and he had be en taken a prisoner and and and was shifted from Buchenwald to Sa xonhausen  from Saxonhausen to Auschwitz  and so so he had  when I met him  already he had spent quite some years behind th e barbed wire.
And I know that the memorandum was passed to Churchill   but he was not prepared to any -- to any -- the only thing he -- I believe that my memorandum did contribute to the decision to prosecute after the war wa -- German Nazi war criminals  because soon after the d ecision was made to install the tri-tribunal  and announcements was made that Nazi crimin als will be brought to justice.
When were you in Europe on V-E day  at the end of the war in Europe ?
You see  i - especially  you see  I have no thoughts or feeling at that time  but you know  later I was  after the war  one of the first visit to the south when I was again visiting my parents  yes  the -- say  godfather  yes.
All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the home office  with the war office  this that and the other thing.
Oh  so tell me again  give me a sense  how long did you stay in Romania in total?
Then  when we walked  w-we start talk  you know  said  I told  my father is invalid  yo u know  wounded he was wounded during he was in Austria army  he was wounded.
And you had finished before your army service  your military service?
So  anyway  soon after the war finished - and he was working with them in the woods there - and soon the war finished  the Russians started appearing.
Okay  can you tell me  when the Russians come in and take over that area of Poland  what was it like?
And then we live in  in Romania  this is again Transylvania  Romania  Hungary  where they changed again in 1940  it became Hungar y again and then after the World War 2  1945  it became part of Romania.
But you know  that was such a healing ti me  and I never talked about the war.
At this -- at that place  we were -- had part of the family  two -- I -- one -- my youngest brother and sister stayed with -- with aunts in another city  because it was near where they stayed when my -- when my -- our family left Shasnich the next day after the war  they stayed there because we did not know what will happen to us.
How aware of you -- were you -- of the re st of the sort of post -war period?
Uh  because I also was not interested to uh to uh to uh to have that on my conscience later to say that I helped the Germans to win the war.
I didn't have nothing to eat after the war  26 nothing.
Uh we had signed that we  before we came we had signed uh what kind of agreement with the American government that we were going to stay there for the duration of the war  and then go back.
See  when I was coming to Auschwitz  I even don't know this Auschwitz  you know.
They were French  they were Belgians  they Were you slave labor  or were you treated as prisoners of war?
I dont remember them being very religious -- I mean  I remember -- I remember the neighbors after the war  I remember that the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next door were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me  they probably werent  and -- and they were very religious  and they asked if I would like to go to Catholic mass with them the following whatever  whatever  and -- and I was a child who really kept away from religion.
He returned to Budapest before Budapest's liberation  quote -unquote  by the Russians which was a peculiar kind of liberation.
So the population the Jewish population in Denmark after the war  let's say in the late '40's  went down to about 3 5 000  5 500.
Because  I I guess what Im leading up to is that  if it was the Ukraine  then you were passing through some of the wors t ravaged areas  where where the war was  you know  had been particularly brutal.
He had my name  that this was a friend of mine who went to school with me and his parents emigrated to Panama before t he war and they had been looking for relatives and friends.
And then lately  just before the war  he was owning his property which was not far away from Kielce  by the name of Ludinya  not far away from Czestochowa.
But once on the ship  it was like a festival really of people who are free and are going to fight in a war.
Do you have memories of going to school before the war?
Now  before the ghetto was established  what -- what do you remember?
Of course  the Vietnam War was raging  but the United States itself -- the territorial United States was at peace  and I knew that by the time he grew up  that war at least would be taken care of.
Oh yes  they were born in Poland and some of them I knew before they -- no  s -- Before the war. --
So that I  I am  I am proud of that  that I was able to do it.
And -- all right  so then the next thing that you remember is when the war began.
And normally I would have been starting school  probably that September  but with the outbreak of the war  whatever formal schooling I might have had was deferred.
I said  how I said  you made it our war  how can you say that?
Thereafter  like the others  for the most part on the War Documentation Project  were on what was called  Project Alexander .
Bear in mind that  you know  the -- the history was that Germany  in first World War  has occupied our -- the town where I lived.
WILLIAM SCHNEIDERMAN September 21  1994 00:01:13 I need you to begin by telling me your name  where you were born  and what year.
He went to Europe for a conference in 193 9  but before the war started  before September.
And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in Washington who approached me and said  you know  UNRRA is looking for people to work in their program.
Do you feel that the world has learned a lesson  learned the lessons of the Holocaust?
The only language I spoke when I was a kid was Flemish and Yiddish  Yiddish  because and then I lived there since 1940 and and in 1940 the war broke out.
La ter he opened an ambulatorium  a free clinic because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people dont have money  so my sister and the brother-in-law who was also a member of the J udenrat  had the empty store because he was in the flower business  and in the war they didnt have flower  so he opened in his store the ambulatorium.
As the revolution started  then the citizen war and then it was no  no we could not come yet to America.
And  I mean  they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 56 were suffering  but it was normal war suffering  shortages of this  ashu -- but the threat of life did not exist with them.
>> Could you talk more about how the war affected your spirituality?
About was any of your family on your mothers side  affected by German policies during World War II?
And as I said  I had now obtained an ID as a technician for a defe nse plant in Berlin and I  and with that I lived for the rest of the war  showing it the ma ny times that I was asked for an ID and in fact  it was convincing enough so that there was never a follow-up question  but I was aware of the fact that each time the official as king me to identify my self could have asked where is your Wehrmacht ID?
That was before the war ended  yes  and I was still with the Haywards.
I knew he was in the army but I  you know  I didn't tell him I was in the -- You told me  you said this was the early 1950s when the Korean War -- The Korean War broke out in 1950.
And he promised them work and he built a factory  he prepared for the war.
Interview with Richard Peterson April 6  1999 33 We left  of all things  down to Yvetot  loaded onto 40 and eights  the old World War I style 40 and eights  40 men or eight horses  yeah.
Lessing  many will remember you from this summer  when I interviewed you on radio  but now here you are again  and I want to ask you a few questions.ﬂ And so he asked me where I was during the war.
One didnt know at that time when the war will end  anyway.
I believed the news breaking about a Hasidic person holding a gun  that change came in Israel and it only came after World War II.
Because my late father-in-law had money in a bank and they came after the war in l970 and lived for a while in the same apartment house later lived there and then they moved to Lodz because to get at the business.
Well  have you ever told your s -- your family about this -- your experiences during the war?
I guess what I'm wondering is th at in the midst of this horrible war it's interesting that there was so much vitality.
Things like the war in the former Yugoslavia and the massacres in Rwanda  and the fighting in Chechnya  you know.
And of course this was in the early days and right after the war  40 -- middle of 1945 and so things were still a sense of -- I mean  its like if you look at films  American films from that time  they speak about Uncle Joe and that everything was friendly and these were our allies and blah  blah  blah.
Uh  then the war was over pretty quick which we all know  and uh  where to go.
Even going so far as to supply New Testaments in German for German prisoners of war.
My mother was dressing us  you know  for the first time we were going to go to the synagogue for Rosh Hashanah for the service.
>> Bill Benson: You told me at one point that you remember the joy and exhilaration of the people at the end of the war  the French people.
So  when you got to Lodz  what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of the war to these Jews  since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked out of the university  and at least some violence against the Jews?
I dont know  like I told you  where she was killed.
I must tell you I...I was so already beaten before the war because the Russians sent my parents  and mine oldest brother with his wi fe to Siberia  and so it...it was a week before the war broke out  and I was very miserable because we hear d that the trains were...were bombed and I was sure my parents are not alive anymore.
He came to me...he says to me  \ I'm going to give you a loaf of bread  if you tell me who's going to win the war?\
And you couldnt get passage because the GIs were coming back  the war brides were coming.
She was 9 years ol d when the war broke out and I can only think of her as fear and love and by fear i mean the fact that she was so terrified of bein g torn away from the family.
The horses at that time were simply roaming the fields  some of them being injured from the war.
I'm a generation older than you and I have more moral beliefs than you do  you are totally demoralized by war.
Made big dinners  and we were -- the big ceremony at Yad Vashem  and the many -- there were dignitaries from different countries  and -- and there was a discussion  one of the speakers said  Im -- Im not sure whether it was Netanyahu  or somebody else  during the war  World War two  there were 400 million people in -- in Europe  and how many do you think -- Gentiles -- helped Jewish people?
You -- and I talking to myself  and I say  so the war is over  the war is over.
Don't forget ; when Germany invaded Russia  they took everything the Russians had also.
And you had in mind to get to -- I had in mind to go to Palestine on that time.
The -- the Americ ans  up til the time that Germany declared war against the United States  they had embassies and consulates all over the place.
What about when you came to America and youre here in the 1950s and youre in the midst of the American response to Co mmunism during the -- the Cold War?
During that lengthy period of almost five years  tell us what you can about what life was like for your father and your community during that period when the full brunt of the war is happening elsewh ere.
Before the war  women tended to sometimes earn a living  sometimes the men became so is olated and so discouraged and so demoralized that the women were the f th-the force behind the family.
When you come back from the Spanish Civil War  what did you do?
They didn't got the...uh.. it's..it's was the war and it wasn't in this time.
There were some  you know  what -- when people ask me today  you know  a-about the Germans  you know  of co -- of course  you know  after the war when I -- I -- when I were -- when I came back as a soldier  there were no Nazis  you couldnt find any  you know  there werent any  you know.
Tell us about the circumstances for your family and for you in those earlier years of the war.
A lot of those claims were by the American relatives or...uh...survivors of th e Jewish population of Poland...uh...who were claiming properties that were confiscated or destroyed during the war or after the war.
They expected that from Hitler because we're doing some small -- maybe I'll say it was quite a common thing  many of them were spying for Germans before the outbreak of the war.
After the war  in 1948  the situation in France was bad.
They sent me to England  to the war office in London  and they attached me to the army intelligence.
And something whic h is most important  during the last year  from January 1944 to end of May  the end of the war  in May  '45  that twenty million dollars were channeled through the War Refugee Board -- Jewish money  not other money --this we also have to talk -- were channeled to -- for efforts to rescue Jews  to help Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution.
End of Tape #2 54 Tape #3 Miles  wer -- were gonna -- were gonna go to the war  June 1941 in a moment  but I wanted to just go back to your name for a moment  because I realized that this -- and theres some noise -- at the start of the interview  I didnt ask you the name with which you were born  which was Shmoil.
7 And it happened very suddenly because  you know  the war was declared by France and England.
Something that was important for her rather than just working for the family and doing what my father wanted and -- The fellow who saved my life and myself -- one of the reason we didn't end up married after the war was that we had the most terrible fights.
Casings to bullets of different types would be pressed out there and this would be his contribution again to the war effort.
And there was a little sleepy station  a   and God is that clear in my mind  all those SS standing there when the doors opened and those hundreds of people giving out and I did visit that place after the war and it was just mind boggling.
I made it to a lovely  colorful  untouched by war  just fabulously looking town in Sweden called Goteborg.
When -- wh en was the next time you felt a presence of German soldiers?
Can you say my father– My father did a lot of business with England and the United States and the Germans desperately the foreign currency to come in so they were already preparing for the war effort I suppose and thats why the  they left him on for a while but then after several years  he was just like a figurehead on there.
From my perspective today  when I look back to conditions before the war  I must say that the family living before the war was much more cohesive.
And I usually knew one man in the Univad quite well because he happened to be a personal friend for many years from before the war of my father.
After the war  the German money wasnt worth anything  if you had a suitcase full of money.
They never got to Paris in World War I in four years.
Why Im telling you this  but when I come to Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 30 after  you know  just after the war  etcetera  I look I went to this place to to see  and I see the statue looks so small  you know.
And after the war  you know what they did  the Italians?
After the war was over  I found out that just a few hours later they were taken to a Fortification 7 and they were all shot over there.
And up there to in the cor Up there is Wilno   Wilno we have been many times a number of times we have been during the World War II.
So we went to Germany and at that time America opened up the doors  which were very closed before the war  but the doors were opened up and we came to America.
It -- I couldnt even talk German afte r the war  a complete blank.
But we have the war ending on May 8th  Harry Truman's birthday and  of course  my birthday is on May 8th.
And the guard will shoot above your head  so you don't have to worry.ﬂ And I told him  \ No  either all of us or none.ﬂ \ You will be going to a territory where the guerrillas still operate  and I want you in every stop we make to pass the word that the AK prisoners are being transported to Russia.ﬂ And  of course  wherever we stopped -- and we stopped many times because the Soviet war was still on.
It was at the point where it was maybe the end of -- maybe beginning of June  something like that.
They had a lot of Polish Jews   a certain home.
September 3  you first get the declaration of war of the English.
Then when the war broke out in 1939 it was September 1st a bomb fell into the house.
If you can remember something about Rozia  the story about her before the war  about 35 to 39.
And he he was an M.D. and I think the was partly the underground  because th he was arrested at the tail end of the war.
Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards?
My family an d my mother and father and the war and the neighbors and some   the neighbor from across the st reet signaled to me that my sister was taken away.
Where were you on V-E day when -- when the war in Europe was over?
The school started within a month or two because I remember even before the war was officially declared over on May 9  1945  our gymnasium was already functioning and we were going back and enrolling in classes and...and...uh...around that time  April or...or May  us youngsters who only lived this heroic  teenage involvement in..in...in patriotism and fight against the Nazis started resurrecting our pre-War...uh..boy scout units in...in gymnasium and I was one of the...uh...leaders of the...the troop I guess you would call it in English that was organized  being re...reorganized in gymnasium.
You were born March 1939  just months before Germany and Russia invaded Poland to begin the war.
So she -- she lived in Radom  before -- right before the war.
What are your first memories of hearing of a man named Hitler?
You know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse  because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth.

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 7 We were Germans w hen we were Jewish.
One was a wartime objective  to prevent espionage and sabotage and financing of th e German war e ffort and the second was a post-war effort which was akin with the idea   part of the idea that you didn't want the German  Germans as they were then certainly  to co me back in to any kind of political power in other areas of the world.
And that probably helped  and then they took us  because the war was still going on  to the other side of the Weichsel.
Only  if you happen to find yourself in the path of marching troops or battle s or whatever  that you knew that there was a war.
One afternoon  you now  if you ever worked for a foreign diplomatic place  you know that three o'clock in the afternoon they close  never mind the war or not  and at three o'clock there is this banging on this door outside.
And now I'm just going to ask yo u some questions about your life as a child before the war.
Obviously my brother was there  too  so I had a couple of weeks leave after the war.
In the case of a friend of mine that went to the same cheder  a religi ous school that I went to before the war  rumor was that he tried to escape.
My family in the United States ha ving been notified that we were alive was sending communications to us and the family w hom my mother had hidden in our apartment the night that they came  and those friends of hers  that whole family survived the war  the two children having been hidden that night when Freddie and I were hidden...those two children were hidden too separately and the two adults were hidden separately and all 20 managed to survive the war...and at the end of the war uh we made contact with them again  my mother did  and when my mother became very sick we were sent to the country where they were living out in the country  and my mo ther  with much pain and some surgery and much help from America  died in uh March  the beginning of March of 1945 9.
My next job was in a daycare center where  again  the parents of children had to go work in the factories for the war effort.
And only later  after the war  we realized then that was pr obably the OSS people.
And their immediate  or s -- di stant relatives were also killed during the war  so I was relatively better off.
Interview with Sylvia Rosen November 20  2012 9 And what was the feeling among the community  what was the feeling among the Jews and the non-Jews before the war?

I just loved the farm because I was with a private family who had a daughter who was  I would say  about 3 or 4 years older than I and  uh  they had the grandmother live there and this was really... My fondest recollections  you know  of the war was really the happiest there  was just a big farm  and it was just really wonderful except that now I became a Protestant.
Like the people after the war who came out of hiding.
He was 10 years younger  he never fought in any war  he was a very comfortable  childless couple  lived for themselves  and just a real diplom a gr diplomats [indecipherable] .
Yeah  th-th-the war  yeah  na -- May na -- nine  it was the end of the war.
He brought us into -- I looked fo r him at the end of the war.
They wanted to make toolmakers of us  because that happened in 44  when a lot of people thought the war was nearly at an end  the allied invasion had already taken place  and the wa -- they needed to train toolmakers  and all the toolmakers were on the front.
He was teaching me after the war immediately  because he gave me some privatenot private +.
So how was it that you could return to Poland ?
And that was  I think  right be -- 1939 to 1940.
And I recognized that the war  during the war in the concentration camps.
He eventually left because he was a reserve officer in World War I. He was a captain and so he stayed in the reserve and then left and that was -- that was bad b ecause I missed him very much.
They went  I went to public school where I was the only Jewish child in the whole school.
So  we I remember one leader who was with us in 1939 and her name was Vushka Liebeskind a nd she was  during the war  she married Dolek Liebeskind  who was the head of the resistance movement in Krakow.
So it shows  you could give him any rank  Erling Fjeld  he was a -- he was a fake name  so -- but its incredible  its all original soldiers [indecipherable] for duration of war.
In fact  they didnt know much about the Holocaust till I made that doc umentary.
The hiding place dated back long before the first World War  w hen the local people were sometimes using it to get protection during the times of pogroms.
The western part of Poland was under German occupation from September 29 until the end of the war and the Germans started the -- the extermination of the Jews right away.
It would -- i -- i -- I think it -- it -- its good to remind them  in your mind  of things that were also good in our lives  before the war.
Some of our big cargo planes  American cargo planes came--now the war is over -- came in to take these --the French people back to Paris  and they were so thrilled  so excited about going home that they took everything that was made of wood from the barracks  put it in a huge  huge pile.
Well  Hungary was a neutral country until June 1941 when the Germans essentially started the war against the Soviet Union.
Plus when we blew his safe and fo und all kind of thi interesting things on there  including a letter from the Kaiser  because the guy was very important in World War I. The biggest gun in Worl d War I was named after his wife.
And the farmer told me  he says  I been trying to tell him that the war is over  come out from there.
And  of course  once the war sta rted  things were getting more difficult.
It was a wh ile in Lodz after the war  we lived together.
I didnt realize the United States were not at war  I thought the whole world was at -- that wasnt -- that was no big deal.
At the time of liberation  af ter the war then  was there any effort on your behalf or on someone else's behalf for you to leave that village or that family and identify yourself as a Jew again  different ?
You know  I dont think I dont think I learned about the Holocaust until the end of the war  you know.
While I was still in Washington  when I got my orders and I read this thing  that I I was going over with the MOS  the specialty as a as a prisoner of war interrogator  I went down to what we called Korean man what was called Korean management  we called it Korean manglement   and was talking to some old col onel whod been there since world since the Civil War  I think.
I mean  Im a -- Im a Czech  I went to college to Hungary  my parents spoke German.
Do you remember  at liberation  and you  you suddenly saw  realized that you were liberated– Yeah. –
Oh  she was very sad  but the life had to go on.
So I enro lled in school  the university opened in Frankfurt [indecipherable] in me dical faculty  and I enrolled  and I could do it because German government paid for tuition  it was the beginning of reparations for -- you know  for Jews after the war.
And as we found out through a 7 tracing bureau after the war uh they were in fact deported to to Auschwitz  along with all the thousands and thousands who were there.
You know  that during the war I I have to the boys room.
And you want to know something but it was interesting to hear once my kids telling me the same thing  what I always thought its you know  the minute the war was over  I almost became back like this little gi rl  except minus the kashrut   this little girl that left home that was taken from home  that I was forced out of from home.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0070 57 He-here -- heres a war memorial  in -- Uh-huh. --
Because this was such a shock  that Mussolini entered the war.
Afte r the war in Budapest  I went first to Szeged where I could eat.
It was only...it was only Himmler and the others   or the attempts to say just uh Hitler and Himmler and are guilty  but all the others are...I never believed in collective guilt  and we never spoke about it  not even in Belsen after the war  bu t I also never believed in in collective innocence.
And I said  well  I don't know  the war -- they said  we're going to release you but under the condition that you have to leave these territories.
But we also knew  after the war  that not everybody stayed in Theresienstadt  and so for the rest  we had no knowledge of what had happened to my mother.
And he stayed with him for th e rest of the war.
The Polish government ran away on the third day of the war.
I can't tell you nothing after the first wo rld war because I was born born already No  I know that.
This was just before the end of the war  April  1945.
>> Bill Benson: September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland and World War II begins.
And the middle one  Ephemia became my best friend after the war.
And so the most important thing that I got when I got through the five years of war  I had a bicy cle.
The Chateau de Marjolet  was that Oh  this was after the war  this was L: Yeah  this was at the end.
But they were not like us  they was a a was war prisoners they were treated differently like us.
They are   she did a lot  but she was not born during the war  she was born later  but she did a lot to find out about Father .
What ... Tell me a little bit about what happened when the Germans invaded.
My name at the time of the war was Fela Yakomovich in Yiddish  and I lived in a small town called Ozerkoff in Poland.
When -- when German y attacked the Soviet Union  did that make you nervous  or you still thought someones gonna come in and -- We -- we still though t that the British -- I mean Poland  not the Soviet Union -- then German  that was the beginning of the war.
She was a -- She was a nurse during USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 3 World War One  treating German soldiers  and when she came to the United States  she became a baby nurse  took care of several important families  including Senator Javitz children  she -- she was the baby nurse for them  and died here.
Well  of course  I was down there in May of 39  in -- in the Germany  but then when the war started in September  and being in the shipping business  that made a whale of a difference in -- in the way we had to operate.
So I thought I had it made and even after war I thought I had it made  but what was the thing was I was in the Jewish barracks  the only place which was segregated inside the camp was the hospital  they had one barracks for Aryan prisoners and one for Jewish and the ones in the Jewish got virtually nothing to eat.
People are still suffering  and thats why I think  for many  many years  most of the people who survived the war were not able to tell their children of their experiences.
Obviously  it was not within their physique to take it too well  but other than that  they were not deprived of food or any kind of things  which was later very prevalent in the war.
All right  so now you hear that the Germans have attacked Poland.
The big question mark was  things are just bound to get worse  particularly as the war winds down  comes to its final stage and how will one get through that.
But my mother just made up her mind that I leave the ghetto.
The Germans you know Interview with Matilde Neuwirt 32 December 11  2011 So the war ended in Yugoslavia in May 45.
And I visited them after the war  and one of the sons was shot on the spot by the police because they tried to help Jews not to come into concentration camp.
And then there were -- I didnt want to go back to Russia  ma -- I kne w before the war how they were and after the war  they were worse yet.
And many of those boats were requisitioned  but they were not seaworthy  so they  he couldn't  if he had been able to use them  uh  history might have been different  he might have invaded England  and the war would have been lost maybe  to Hitler  because the English didn't have many tanks at that time.
They had one in Toulouse  so we didn't see them 'til afte r the war.
If will be no war  or before war  really that this boy is nice.\
Did you have any knowledge of what was going on in Germany and Poland ?
Uh...the Nazi period stretche s across...uh...the landscape of my memories of my mind almost like a Chinese war.
And another part  there are sent the place...it was  uh  Valea or Valea Jiului  which was  where it was a famous lieutenant commander-Trepadu--which was the criminal  and after th e war he was judged as a criminal.
Before the war  the idea of going to America was a horrible idea for most Jews.
After the war  we brought her back bi -- brought her back to Bergen-Belsen and she lived with us for awhile.
Well  I-I really -- I knew that the Germans are persecuting those Nazis.
>> Bill Benson: In May 1940  eight months after Germany attacked Poland began World War II they invaded the low countries  which are Belgium  the Netherlands and France  and as you started to tell us  your father left to join the British Army just before the Germans invaded Belgium.
I don't know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German.
And  when the war was over and they had a -- a -- a -- a court case against the Japanese criminals  you know  military  also some of the industrialists were taken to be investigated and Maury was their attorney.
Had did you ever think  after the war was over and you decided to leave  that you would go to Israel instead of th e United States ?
My mother worked with him after the war in different organizations.
But nobody wa -- was telling them that they actually started the war themselves  I mean it -- the war started in -- in -- after Ferdinand Testi was killed in -- in Bosnia by Gavria Princip  a Bosnian nationalist  who killed the successor to the throne of the Hapsburgs.
They were in Lida for several generations  but they ran away from Lida in the first World War.
The Russian army wants him but you're not trained for war.
Henry Kahn: The officer who was in charge of the soldiers got court -martialed after the war.
Do you have any recollections of or memories of hearing him speak on the radio or did he ever come to Hamm  before the war started  before 39.
You know  after the war you didn't have much food  so you always made enough for everybody.
And my father's brother died shortly after the First World War  he was gassed in France  during when they used gas in France  so he died of complications.
>> Bill Benson : The question  Fanny  you were so close to the other five women at Auschwitz and then on the Death March ; after the war were you able to stay in touch with those women?
Even after the war we saw each other regularly and they never forgot what I did for them and thanks to me I think they are alive.
Considering what she had gone thro ugh during the war  how was her health?
What this man really was at -- when -- the rumors were -- and the rumors are pretty accurate during the war -- during those times  but the rumo rs were that when he -- when there was an -- some kind of rumor of an assassination  of a killing  he was out of town.
We felt that after the war is over  whatever  we will give them a proper burial.
And he was a very Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 4 patriotic German  and was highly decorated the end of the war  for his achievements.
So  the first thing I wanted to do after the war was to resume my studies.
Helena Poppt etts who became also some kind of big wig in the Austrian g overnment after the war  she was there.
That saved my life because it eliminated the gas chamber for my family because of the action my father took when he volunteered to fight the war and had no idea that years later it would save his life.
One day  the Russians came to the town and we were liberated.
What was there -- you see  the Jewish bakeries from before the war  that were there over on the ghetto  they were baking bread.
There was war so I uh we we try...everyday we hope the war will finish and uh we be free.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 >> Bill Benson: To America.
Well  that's an interesting question because inat the outbreak of war  we werethe children that is to sayall of the school were all evacuated to Chichest er  a small  very old town in the south of Engla nd.
But then it started again  actually the main involvement of the Slovak army was in 1941 in June when they started the war  the German against th-the Russian.
Uh the Kamerlings having been arrested uh in the very early stages of the war and sent to Westerbork were in the nature of trustees in that camp and had uh quarters other than the barracks in which most of the inmates lived.
The war again I mean  the attack on the Soviet Union was on June 22 nd  or June 21st  ‚41 Fortyone  yes.
Well this I -- this I mentioned before  I -- when I got home and I opened up the letter from the war department  they offe red me a professional position in the war department  continuing what I have done during my army service as a civilian.
The Germans initiated something for Jews which I call forced labor.
And Professor Crawford asked me after the war  he said... Now  he asked me the same question about my emotions  how I felt...thought about it.
>> Bill Benson: Before we continue on with what it was like for you living with the Harrisons both during the war and a little while after the war  your parents  of course  when you left  were still in Adelsheim and your brother  Herman  was with them.
>> Bill Benson: What was your father doing during that time?
but she -- it was a -- you know  she was very old  too.
And the search to be able to go Palestine as it was at that time Before the war I didnt know but after the war they  but my brothers they were in organizations and like Bet Tah or other  the other ones.
So  from now on she was -- she was handling this  and I was to get myself back to the office  before the people -- and I had people whom I knew from -- from before the war  most accountants I knew  and they knew me and so on.
I mean  they could have done -- they could have probably won the war if they didn't.
But I remember during the war  you know  the pray  if you pray the men during the week and even on Saturday put that shawl tallit  he put away the tallit and didnt [EMOTIONAL] pray anymore.
Was it very frightening as a teenager to see German soldiers?
If she -- my mother -- if she thought differently  I --I never heard  she just -- she went through one World -- the first World War.

And I decided not to talk about the war  and not to I se I I was thinking that they can read about it  they can learn about it.
I also find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to meet with prisoners of war.
We were just talking about the people who came before the war  how did they -- how they cant comprehend these -- the -- the experiences of a survivor.
And what's going to happen to us \  and so forth  so she said in the first war  what did my mother know?
You talked a little bit about the schools and everything  but what about some of the other things that were happening in the 60s  like the sexual revolution and Cold War.

I met him only after the war  and he ha d a brother.

We didn't have any money  so he got a job with the British censorship in Germany so  so in 19... uh ... 1940 ...I think  that was '45 I think - it was almost immediately after the war uh after we were liberated  he went off to Germany and worked for the British censorship there.
And during the last month of the war in April 1945  the famous white busses that were originally organized by the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte arrived in Theresiens tadt on the thirteenth of April and they left Theresienstadt and went through Denmark  taken to Sweden.

9 Did you follow the local BBC broadcasts and the local newspapers regularly during the war years?
Following his service in the US Army during the Korean War  Michel pursued his chemical education in graduate school.
What I could not quite understand  is at the onset of the war  wh ich was still the the end of the Great Depression here in this country  and people again in this country  who really did not quite fathom the depravity that had occurred in in Europe   and how bad how badly things had gotten  and the reason I really mention this  because there were still people here in America that were striking for benefits.
Did you become more religious because of your experiences -- No. --
No  I cant say that it -- the war wa s already here.
Did you -- do you think -- Well  protect -- I -- I knew -- s ee  after the war  there were things that -- I had a long time a lot of trouble  because more than half of our friends were killed.
We hear the war coming nearer  and so we were lucky that this boy came just in the right time.
And one day I wrote to Yivo  you know  in New York  and asked them if they heard about it  and they told me that in the memorial book on Zelechow  you know  after the war there were hundreds of memorial books published by groups to memorialize their towns...the pictures of the dead.
You see  Tito is a major was criminal  but without Tito the war couldnt have been won the way it has won  so Im kind of caught in between.
Had a prisoner  this we were about we were in Germany at the time.
Are you asking me now whether I still -- now  I don't hate the Germans who were born after the war and have nothing to do with it.
Mostly  the Jews were not -- they had a bad feeling towards the Jews even before the war.
Now  as the war began to draw to a close then  how many times did he help to spare your life then?
Oh yes  well the war came  and I decided to work in a ca -- in a -- with an organization called the Auxiliaire Soc-Sociale  w ho were taking care of -- well really  what we later called displaced persons  but that is not -- they were called refugees then -- came into Paris from  you know  all the places that the Germans had already overrun.
The camp was under th e control  obviously  of the Br itish Army  but they had a lot of Hungarian soldiers who we re prisoners of war as it were  who were used to work in the camp doing various jobs.
My cousin had there a tannery during the war and did business wi th the English.
And he suffered a lot during hi s lifetime  because he fought in the...the First War...World War...World War (laughter) Fi rst... Okay.
And that time  it would ha ve gone if not bro -- maybe if the war broke out not in 1939  the Polish -- the second war  maybe 40.
Uh...The Czech student  whose name is Ernest  engaged himself into the Czech army that...the Czech army in exile  and he...we were all wanting to help the war effort to fight the Nazis.
And the tug of war between the sentiment an of emotional tradition on the one hand  and the not wanting to belong to anything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing.
And then he then he wa actually  I met him when he was discharged  because  you know  a lot of G.I.s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract with what was then called the war department.
He asked the people for money  and then this was the first two times  when the war started he was drafted as a reservist  as a doctor to the army.
Was there may be a plan to go to Palestine at all or to go to America?
Th ere were rumors before the war about the -- the probability.
After the war  when I returned to Treblinka and I found Poles digging...digging the land  looking for valuables.
So I assume obviously she would have found -- there were all these organizations after the war  all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations tracking down people.

When the war broke out  all the men were picked up and put into camp.
He talked about be fore the war how things were at home.
So he start the factory of smoking fish  and he was very successful with that because in those days   in the first World War  the Russian army had no C-rations like today  and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a piece of bread.
72 Oh after I ca -- After the war  yeah  yeah  yeah.
Head  head guard person  and that's all documented  and I as I said I bought the \ The Trials\  after the war when I was in London and read it studiously in horror - to read my own my own history so to speak  because I lived in a in a little vacuum  not really knowing that in another camp other things were happening.
And in Poland during the  the existence you know after the First World War  the  between the two world wars you know which Poland was in existence for 20 years.
When did your parents and even tually you first learn about the Holocaust  that is to say the full magnitude of what was going on?
But Slovakia wasnt involved at that at that Slovakia was involved later on  in 39  and th e there it has even had even the name  the the Slovak army  the Slovak  it was so cold [indecipherable] divizie   the first divis division who they sent  certain I dont cannot tell you exactly how many thousand people they sent to help to win the war with Hitler against the German  against the Russian.
At that time I was 22 years old  and I could feel that the end of the war was near.
So this is -- this is much later  this is after the end of the war?
But it -- the -- the ability to walk into a ger -- walk into a German position and talk to them as if you were one of them  this was the main contribution  as it turned out to be  for the war for us.
And needless to say  she got a job in a factory.
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
So when these people say -- and this is largely in the media  the -- the trials in The Hague where so and so from Serbia is going to be tried for war crimes  similar to the war crimes committed by the Nazis in Nuremberg  I think it takes away from the Nuremberg trials.
As soon as I left  we couldnt write a letter or anything anymore because th e war was on and nothing went smooth anymore.
And my father  may he rest in peace  always said  he was a medic in the First World War and he always says that the Germans wouldnt do that.
Yeah  you know  I was a part of it  but I was small -- no  y -- I was too young  and we were only like some  you know  listen to some news fr om Russia  whats going on in the front  how the Germans are already retreating  and to enc ourage people that soon  soon  soon  that will be the end of the war  and th -- you know  so we were listening to the news  writing down and then giving it to read for people  and so this was not exactly a big job  and -- But you did that?
So  what people did  they bought bread  put on cases of loafs of bread  this will keep us over the war  and so on. [
But anyway -- so  after the war  I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying  ﬁWell  what happened to your family?

Irving Hass: Flossenburg was bombed during the minutes what you call the – during the end of the war w hen we already in the forest Š they bombed it.

Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 247 Oh  this is pre-war Poland   before World War II Poland borders.
They wasn't well organized like after the war  so we decided we're going back to Poland.
Many  many years after the war my father told people he always took me along for his protection.
During that time Hitler threatened the allies or what became the allies by calling back all of the ships at sea and saying that if I don't get what I want  I'm going to declare war.
But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war.
The other thing that Lysinger explained to me  that I was barely conscious of from my earlier work with the Nuremberg material  was that of course  all governments in World War II  used the poorest paper possible  because they wanted to use their resources for things which were a lot more important than requisitions for paper clips.
And he -- so he -- this man and his mother somehow were hidden and they survived the war.
I think in contrast  I think I had been much more affected by the -- the war  though I did not see the -- the horrors that he did  but by the separation  because I was at an -- at an age wh ere I could begin to -- to think about things like this  and in -- in -- internalize them.

But yeah  I cant really -- So are you folks hearing any rumors in 1942 about what happened when the Nazis go into Russia?
He could have come the United States immediately after the war  because his cousin  his first cousin who lived in Vienna  and he managed to escape in 39  thats what I was told  and came directly to Washington  through family that arranged this for him  because in those days you just couldnt come.
I know what he did after the war  I know they were hidden with different families.

Incidentally  he went to the European theater during the war; we lost track of each other.
but there is something different when a war comes on when when you have a force that  you know  an occupying power that has this po licy.
And and th-the hope that we ma intained throughout the war was that they were relocated to Poland  and when the war is over  they will return.
So -- and we were never -- I -- this is -- this shows you the blessing  the -- during the whole war  was never hungry a single day.

And we didn't even have a chan ce to thank her  because after the war  not after the war actually  after the liberation  when my mother went back to her  and  you know  just  just to tell her that we're going back to our hometown and  sh e says  \ Please  don't stay in touch with me.
Did you recall your father speak ing about Hitler and Nazism?
During the war  I worked in it -- for the CIC  through -- through my professor  I had the professor by the name of Zahn.
So Did you keep any kind of a journal  or did you do any kind of writing of your memories of what you had been th rough during the war  at that time?
The fact that I was German  and everybody in the United States was against Germany   because of what Germany had done in the war.
Anthony: Were there any Germans living in Bedzin before the war?
n this years obviously before World War Two in a small Polish town which was about half and half  Polish   one of the most important things to know about this one can imagine.
S: The war did  yeah  and then what -- what -- what she told me was right.
Now why how that happened was that Utah before the war had a two year medical school.
Well again  they they documen t the family  and this is the entire family was affected by the war.
My question to you is: Over the years after the war  how did your feelings towards Germany and Germans develop  especially in the sense of forgive ness after a few decades  and so on?
After the war  I found out they were giving them -- they were killing them by giving them an injection.
You had your life to lead and these were just war stories that we had been telling each other over and over again over the years  and pretty soon that was history.
No  I never had the sense that -- she let me do  eat what I wanted and at that point in the beginning it wasn't always easy to get food after the war but we always had relatively good food.
That school received  got a new principal in the year 1934  he was a retired Army colonel who had fought in the First World War and also was a through and thr ough convinced Nazi ideologue.
Does he remember if there were any Soviet prisoners of war there?
And his grandpar ents were on the way to Interview with Marianne Liebermann January 9  2004 42Shanghai when Italy joined Germany in the war and so their ship was turned back and they were all sent to the camps and killed.
054 Lillian: My official schooling came to an end in 1939 when the war started  when they bombarded Warsaw and when the Germans ma rched into Warsaw.
Yeah  and so all the children in your school were Jewish?
32 So he survived and then he was kept in Russia after the war?
Before we had very little contact with protestants but during the war we were fighting the common enemy  then we got together and I got to know many Protestant ministers and we worked together and they tried to help and during the war they were brought together  the clergy of the different denominations.
This was a place where they put the people before they took them to Auschwitz.
I was a young girl with no sexual experience  and here I was among wome n who were prostitutes  who were mostly maids who worked previously before the war in Jewish households.
But the war seemed very far away ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 because fighting only took place in the eastern front  in Poland.
To preserve sanity  to function after 28 surviving this war  I don't think that we are 100 percent  but we try to pull on our reserves from our background  from our civilized way of living  from our teachings  our parents  and our teachers.
>> Frank Liebermann: After World War I there was a war between partly E ngland  France.
Interestingly enough  during the war we hated one another  now we're in civilian clothes and he offered me a job in his film company  that's how I became a f ilm maker.
Striker  who was the number one Jew-Baiter of Germany I saw him I went to the Nuremburg war trials one day.
You know  because -- because they were already -- hes a soldier  he was th -- you know  he served in the army.
>> Bill Benson: Up to the time that Germans occupied Hungary.
So where else did you go when you were in Europe visiting again?
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 93 We didnt go to school any more since the war started  so we didnt start the next grade  but this is just before the war  1939.
I hadn't seen them until after the war because -- By ﬁthem ﬂ you m ean your aunt -- My aunt or my cousin  her son.
And the next day of two days later -- SE: We saw the Germans running away.
After the war  the situation was marvelous  everybody was happy and very fond of the army and the generals and about the whole government.
That means  paniczka means like lady  lady  it-its war  you know.
I tell you  I saw -- I never go to war movies  but I saw ﬁSchindlers Listﬂ because I heard he changed later.
We entrusted them with several valuables because we thought that after the war we would be able to retrieve them.
Th is is '47 and '48  two years after the war.
So  once  I think I had a French guy  or  and I tried to communicate with him  he should tell me something  or explain how the war was.
It might interest you  by the way  to know that among the people we took care of  the first complete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to Russia when the Germans marched in.
But  after the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other levels  I would say that there was very civilized and under the worse circumstances- civilized and cultured approach to things  to human beings  to fellow human beings  et cetera.
During the 1st World Wa r especially during the occupation by the Germans of Belgium  there came all kinds of stories what the Germans did and after the war it occurred that this was highly exaggerated and a good number of these stories were not true.
While the old people that build the organi zation in 1917  after the first war passed away  slowly but steadily  we took care of it.
That became a little difficult because the CDJ  after the war  tried to gather all the kids back into the Jewish fold  which is fine  I mean  it was a legitimate concern of them.
So Mimi took care of me since I was four years old  til right after the war.
He had received in 1935 a cros s which was given only to all front line fighters  meaning people who for four years of the 1st Worl d War spent it on the front line  and how could the same men now deny him an ex istence or a livelihood and would throw him out.
To the day  six years after the war started in Belgium  my sister married a Frenchman  not the guy that she followed to Palestine but the guy she met on the train in Spain that went to the ship.
And shortly after the war broke out  perhaps a year after it  all of a sudden  the child was no longer allowed to play with me and then we learned that the father had joined the NSB.
They said  \ Well  if they will come here and fight  we will maybe help you to kill them both and will be war over.\
He was the war plants officer USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 194 for the Far East.
And it didnt worry us too much  because the -- the war was going to USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 3 be over anyway very soon  we all knew that  and the Germans would never do in Holland what they had done in Germany  to the German Jews.
One reason was that the German war machine  you know  took advantage of the fact that in Denmark there was a huge production of butter and bacon and all ho and stuff like that.
Well  I you know  I think we all felt well  finally theres gonna be a war  you know?
It was May the 8th  end of World War II and they were shooting in the air  celebrating.
Did the other children that you -- There werent many that I saw  many children  but -- Did you all t -- do you m -- do you remember if you talked about what was happening  about the war?
Weve had a 50 year reunion a number of years ago  and many of them showed up and -- that had surviv ed and we lost -- lost some of them in the war  but it was interesting to see that -- the changes that had occurred in these individuals only physically  but mentally theyre still in the same area they were in then  at the time.
These were all people who were deported  obviously  against all international law and without their consent  into Germany to work for war production.
We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in America because the war had ended.
And then he had taken Austria  Czechoslovakia  Poland  that was beginning of the second World War  they had marched through Sweden  Norway.
We found the camp of the British prisoners of war  and for some reason -- they were bombing London  but for some reason they were treating the British POWs very we ll.
And how we found out is some of these Hungarian Nazis  they wanted to help Raoul because they knew that the war is over  and he was like me too--\ Oh yes  I promise I help you.\
Not too many was Communists in Poland and still was some and very funny thing  after the war the Communists go to Russia and was killed later there by (?)
He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the Bavarian city of Oxbourg before the war and now he was rabbi in Springfield  Missouri and he and his family took me somewhat under th eir wings.
You mean in ni like when the war started  there was no more news?
He was a very clever young man  and he walked up to the German and said  ﬁShe is my best worker  if you take her away  itll hurt the war effort.ﬂ He thought hed kill him  but he didnt  he just left  and left her.
I wanted to disclose to them  which the army doesnt know if the United States population doesnt know what happened to American POWs during the war.
This was after 20 years  because we went to Auschwitz in '44  and this  no  it was 23 years  and this happened  when he told me this  it was in 1967  after the six day war when I went to Haifa.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 131 SE: If I saw now that I -- when I came back after the war  I had the seamstress and she was the foulks German.
Did you experience any anti -- any anti-Semitism when you were in Russia?
And so in other words  during that su mmer  there was already conversation that the war is coming  and people felt it.
I never I was never interested in in in in while I was collecting all the photographs  all the drawings of all these wanderings after the war I saved everything  without even thinking about it.
My father thought now the Netherlands was neutral during the first World War.
As a matter of fact  my cardiologist  his -- what was to be his daughter-in-law  worked at the museum and my cardiologist  I -- I had told him where -- where I had been in the war and he told me to contact her or I contacted her  I dont remember  but thats how I made contact with them regarding the testimony.
I could not talk before they know that I was Jewish.
Tell us what you can about those years for you and your family to the extent you can tell us about that between the beginning of the war and when Germany came in to Slovakia in 1944.
And  right after the war ended  they formed  when I say \ they \  I guess it was the Joint Distribution Committee from the United States  UNRRA 4 at that point  and some other committees  formed displaced persons' camps  we called them DP camps.
They remained  when we were sent to Auschwitz  they remained and were liberated later by the Russians by the end of the war.
And I got a job at that time  U.S. military people stoo air force  navy  I I should say air force  Marines and army were still going overseas to Korea  even though it was after the war  to Korea or Japan on ships.
Did you have a feeling that you wa nted to fight Germans  or -- Yeah  yeah.
Because look  before before the war  whe-when I learn history in the school  Lithuania was like  in a way  ene my of Poland   you know.
So after the war I had my examinations there  I studied medicine there.
Yeah  and since I had so called – in the eyes of the Americans I was a German  so I could get in under the German quota.
What did you do after you were liberated by the Russians?
You have already done a video interview with the museum in Washington about your early experiences and your experiences during the war  and really the purpose of this interview  is sort of to pick up that story from where you left off and take it up to the present.
We were very happy the war is over and all the miserable things are over.
And once was the war start  like everybody else  we we have to move into the ghetto.
And the -- So it wasnt so harsh under the Russians?
And this is after the war will be over then you will go back to your houses.ﬂ I mean  they did everything to avoid a revolution .
And thank you Mr. Brugioni for agreeing to speak with us today  to share your experiences  and your professional exper tise  as well as your personal experiences during World War II.
For us the war was not terminated when the 2nd World War ended and my own grandson who was seventeen was among the first victims of the war of liberation.
And Waffen -- and SS guards coming out and prisoners -- and prisoner of war coming out .
But at the time  war has what kind of meaning to a young teenager?
I was there since I was born and until the war started.
After the war 1946 I took couple of days off from duty in American army and I went to Bergen-Belsen  lo ok for my friends.
And I will start our interview by talking about events and life before the war  so that we can get a sense of what the world was  and what the world wa s for you  before it all changed.
But this fear in me that I'm in the war  I'm being bombed  I'm being left behind  this -- I wasn't home.
But  I was not this kind of Germany  it was like after the war Germany.
Would that have been because you had re -- Oh no  I -- I -- -- held onto the age that you told the Germans you were -- -- I had to do it -- I had -- I had to do it because of the Germans  you know?
September yeah  that was The fi when the war actually starts.
>> Bill Benson: But you were living with your sisters at that point.
I went and I looked out the window because I wanted to see what is a war.
This is my grandfather -- this is my gr andmothers husband  who was killed in beginning of the war  which I told in my story.
Women were not really  there were a lot of men that ca me back from the war and applied.
Did you hear anything about what was happening to the Jews of Europe ?
Was it a difficult time being Jewish  or did pe ople not know you were Jewish at the time  after the war?
Before the six day war  everybody was prepared that will be a war and the people were very courageous and they were trusting the army and the government that everything will be resolved in a good way.
And then you would return back to -- Then when we heard that they left  and once they caught us  the Germans.
Are you talking about when the war started thats -- thats how old they were?
So I worked for the Indian Tool Company which made stuff for the war effort.
317 stayed on a little bit in Germany after the war was officially over.
He survived the war at   which it was a trap for Jews mainly  and that's where he survived.
So we kept in touch with them during the war  and after the war  and now I had the chance  I went to see him and talked him into speaking up his own thoughts of leaving and moving to Israel.
Yes  but there were sections  you know  there were some who were living in their old house  there were some who were living But you had to did you have to move out of your old house  into the ghetto  or was your house in the ghetto?
Uh  being from Germa ny  my father was able to read through the cracks of the wood some of th e station names that we went through  so we definitely knew that we were going to upper Salezia  which is now Poland  and which is near Breslau  what used to be the German city of Breslau  and where most of the concentration camps that we found out after the war were lo cated  including Auschwitz  and a lot of the subcamps.
And I have no feelings of hate  and then  especially now  it's already after 40  50 years after the war  those younger generations  they are not responsible for it  for the co-co  what the parents committed  what crimes the  the parents committed.
So my father told me  don't ever  ever say and that stayed with me for many years  even after the war.
And after that my mother decided to change schools and I then went on  took a tramway actually to go back to take -- to -- to attend the school in the neighborhood wher e we had lived before the war  because my mother really felt those were the better schools.
Edna Friedberg: And then less than a year later on September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland starting World War II.
Well  the war had Im confused by that  because at that point  if it was the allies in Italy going northwards  and were talking in 1944  the war had not ended yet.
But he announced during the war and after  all the news  whats happening on the front.
And then I started and when we got we got to Nuremberg  some more people came in and I was assigned a German refugee by the name of Norbert Heilpern He spoke very good German and a broken English  but he was...and incidently  he'd been a soldier in World War I on the German side  and so it was often interesting and he'd often put on a little act for us at parties we had where he'd play the Prussian soldier.
>> Bill Benson: I think you mentioned that between that period when war began on September 1939 and when Germany actually attacked France  people referred to that period as the phony war.
So basically  before the war  on the eve of the war  in 1939  on September 1  1939  my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous He lived in a town near Warsaw called Wolomin.
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 21 No  I took French and I didnt learn German til the war started.
Now  Hungary had a very interesting story as far as the war was concerned.
It -- perhaps that was the way German Jews  who had lived in Germany for such -- and I dont mean that in any demeaning way  had integrated so much that they did not view themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed themselves as Germans of a Jewish religion  i-if you understand  actually.
And from then  I had to go back to Poland  I went back to Poland again from there.
They knew exactly where they went  because before the war  Italy was the best place to make furs and sell it.
And then well focus on from after the war to the present.
And they knew if German will have  will finish this war  so they will not needed them anymore.
Have you di-did you become more religious because of your experience during the war?
Something happened  either with the war  I dont remember what it was but somehow he was saved.
It was not easy to travel after the war because the railroads have been destroyed.
But he was in Warsaw til the end of the war.
After the war my father went there to look at what's left of the grandparent's 5 house that was gone but a neighbor came and gave father a stack of photos which he picked up from mud.
We did stay there until the end of the war  because my mother always told them that she did not want to be separated from her children.
But that occurred very rarely until  as I say  the Autumn 1939  and the outbreak of World War Two.
And briefly  would you tell me what happe ned to your family members  your immediate family members through the war years?
But anyway  it bothered me because I saw so many pe ople hungry in the war  and I was hungry.
You see  as I told you  we came to Auschw itz when the Russian offensive was nearing  meaning it was already late in the war.
It was even more than that because then eventually the war ended.
And then the sirens and we heard on the radio that Poland was attacked  that bombs were dropped on Warsaw without declaring war.
It was a -- a -- I thought it was -- it showed very realistic things and what I saw after the war  I dont think that the media exaggerated.
I think the people here  themself  werent that well off before the war.
What this time was something you know  like special knowledge  this was  you know  like high education  this knowledge  that when the -- the -- th -- the war start  I get fr-from this organization the motorcycle  and I was a line officer  you know  just delivered information.
Well  what did war mean to a young child like you?
So and after the war  we my parents got together with her again.
Were there other people -- were there people from Oashmiani who you stayed in touch with after the war  or -- I mean -- I did meet two people from Oashmiani after the war  but it was a very short-lived contact.
After the war I had an operation  a bunion operation  both of them  because they became so big my -- see this line here?
Did -- did people at school as you what happened during the war  or was it as if -- I dont know  the war happened to other people  it was never the people that you were me -- do you 97 know what I mean?
They were from the from apparently also  they were former Russian prisoners.
Considering this being right after the war and their hatred towards the Germans  we met them with enthusiasm  we did not feel any anti- semitism at that time on the part of the French or the French Army.
Th ey were not deeply involved in anything spiritual  I mean  they were 400 years under the Austrians  under the Hapsburgs before World War I  then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated  and they had to live -- make a living.
Yeah  and there are other incidents like th is after the war  immediately where people in Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she came to look for me  but maybe when we go into this  we can discuss it later.
America was still not in the war  but America had -- was giving for free  50 46 destroyers to Great Britain on generally supporting -- supporting the British war effort.
During the war what I have seen I really question if there is a god.
And after the 1st World War  during the 1st World War  had contributed a lot of money to the German war effort  and after World War I when that part of Germany where he lived uh became Polish  and he opted to remain German and he moved to Berlin  and he got a Cross of Merit from the German Kaiser.
What happened during the war too is people did get attached to their children and there were many legal cases in Holland after the war where the families who survived had to go to court to get the children back.
I lived in Swooz-ka after the war  I was liber ated by Swooz-ka   a town.
Even the Russians  the Russian front had stalemated  been stalemated for a while  so this was middle of the war and it could have gone either way and we were pretty fearful at the time.
A. The Cratons most of all  they come to the Yugoslavians after World War I. They betrayed Austria  they betrayed Yugoslavia too.
They had a close  ongoing personal relationship with the second largest political party in Germany after the war  the Social Democratic party.
And we were then ther e in June of I remember in June of 1941 when the war broke out with the Russians.
I mean  yes  if you want to take war is a bad thing in Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin March 15  2001 15general  but that was really so subliminal.
And fortunately they were not treated nearly as badly as the Russian prisoners of war.
And evidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers to jump to jump into the camp  to prevent the Germans from murdering the prisoners of war before they are liberated.
After the war  when we were still in that house  the brother came to pick up whatever they ha d. Then they said  I heard that there was somebody here  some shiksa here  who took away my dead brothers room.
He was hidden the whole war so she had a home where to go to.
So  do you remember any events from the summer of 1939  before the war breaks out  of in your life?
They are much closer to the last war we fought in  the desert or in perhaps Vietnam if theyre a little older and went through that era.
So if the Russians said no  we are not in war just to protect the Jewish people  we veto that.
So in 1939 when the war started September 1  1939  the Russians came in.
A nd -- but -- but from -- for us  fo r the family it was war  because my mother was alway -- all the time crying about he r sisters in Warsaw and their grandchildre -- For -- -- about her daughters and the grandchildren  in spite -- in the -- 39  in the beginning  before the war start  they were all in Wilna  at our summer house  and when their vacation finished they went -- the sister with the brother-in-laws went to Warsaw  and th e children was ver -- left with us.
So  even after the war  of course  we met for awhile a nd then we decided there is nothing in it for us anymore and thats when I joined the Zionist M ovement.
So  when I came to the Russian army  I found people who speak almost so well  how I am speaking Russian.
He came back in 1946  which was the year after the war  and a pparently while he was living in London his house was bombed  and he spent two years in a hospital.
And my parents did not talk about you know  throughout this period  until until the war ended in Europe   we maintained hope that they were going to come back.
My mother's uncle was there since -- many years  since the end of World War I ; something like that.
World War II began  of course   in September 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland.
Yes  I made quite a lot of frie nds but really we didnt keep it up because a small  a quarter of the people ended up in England  and a lot of those eventually got to America anyway because so many of them had quota numbers to get into America at a future date  an d so quite a few left during the war even  and I think we were sort of spread around th e country  and I in par ticular was sent away  straightaway two days after we arrived I was sent to a convalescent home by the seaside to scrub 12 floors for them you know  because the only work yo u were allowed to do wa s domestic work  so I was sent away straightaway.
Read something about the Pacific war  if theyre interested  read something about the war in Europe .
Yes  yes  I remember the  I remember a t the end of the war  I remember the dropping of the first atomic bomb.
There was a woman who already in the First World War did things like that.
He says  well  maybe something I'll go and expecting the war (374).
They went to Italy to fight the war  they were fighting the Americans and the British in there.
Yes  we were separated as children when the war when the Germans came into the town.
I think by mistake you said that you were born the first year of World War II; you meant World War I. A. Oh  of course.
So they met after the war  right away  as soon as she came to the hospita l  he came right away  and they were together.
I show him this and told him \ Do you think if I would be Jewish  I woul d be going to Catholic sc hool before the war?\
And were they understanding and want to hear what -- to listen to you and did you talk about what your experiences were during the war  to them?
And being over there  one night on a Saturday night  I was out on a date  late in the evening  I could hear the bombardments and the war started  the Russian-German war.
And then they put me on -- then I had to work on documents di -- di -- that was already in preparation for the war crime trials in Nuremberg later on.
We want to give them this money  and if he wants to keep us over the war.
But that was quite a dramatic moment wh en Churchill announced that we were at war  September the third  1939  11 oclock in the mo rning.
That was my end of the struggle  the unofficial war with Germany and the unofficial war started then.
And on the day the we -- war broke out  they asked me  ﬁHow do you feel about it?ﬂ And impulsively  I said  ﬁIm glad that ﬂ -- now this is when America got into the war  -- ﬁthat America is getting into the war  because that will give the allies more power.ﬂ And they looked 12 at me in disgust  and said  ﬁHow can you be glad about any war?ﬂ And I said  ﬁIs it better when people are slaughtered in camps?
So your youre in Sachsenhausen   its towards the end of the war  and how did you know it was?
The war broke out  so he gave a choice for my sister and he said  let's get engaged.
Ev en at that time they knew it was the end of the war.
Again at the time when we moved to Poland it was Polish.
So I was one of the 2 During the war  IG Farben ha d many holding companies  and/or branches all over the world  even in the United Stat es. (
This is a bulletin which is written by a group of progressive Jews in -- in Belgium   were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium state recognized  their capability during the war  which has not done  contrary lets say to -- to France.
And the war broke out and..uh...(sigh) within a few days  first waves of refugees started coming ...telling hair raising stories about atrocities committed on the population by the Germany army  by the indiscriminate bombing  by the German air force of crowded roads filled with refugees  with..with men  women  children  possessions  animals.
But  basically  it was the same administration  was called War Relocation Authority.
They did not want to take me back because I was not right to protest against anti -Semitism in Poland and Czechoslovakia and so I said: you know I am nit asking because I want to have a review for you  I have my own propositions and my own morality to fight against Nazis and you share my views  but to fight against anti -Semitism you have to share my views too and we are all Germans  East Germans too you belong to the German people  you are living today in the Eastern part but all Germany declare the war and the Jews and there was no more sharing my views and I said this must be all Germans fighting agains Nazis and not allow former Nazis to have important functions and to fight against anti -Semitism and to stand on the side of the State of Israel and you know what was the situation ofIsrael if Germany and the United Nations in the end voted against it and I took my liberty even I became ????
No  but what I was asking was  this is immediately after the war  and you had come across that one camp where you sa w the survivors  but when you are out walking on the roads  did you see any other survivors wa lking?
Italy was already the pact with Mussolini - Hitler and it was already war against [indecipherable] together with Germany agai nst France and England.
We were close friends  but he didn't fall in love with me until after the war.
And one day one my friends  and there was a general system w hich worked probably  he start to talk to me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation  what represent the German war  against become the Russian  how's our situation and start to uh convince me  I guess  we have to do something.
We never got any r eparation  we were never got a penny for what happened to us during the war.
So you were able to play for a while before everything was really disrupted and even though the war had already started?
They had gone– They stayed in Brit tany all through the war.
Now  Im not quite sure what that reaction wa s  but you know  after the war people did not want to believe  they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened  and they didnt really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war  and loss  and deprivation  and rationing  and everything else.
Did you know what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
And at that particular time  I used to talk to my family  why don't they try to go ahead  go move further east  but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one  that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run away from.
But for some other reason he thought he wanted to save the German Jews  he wanted to send them back after the war.
Some of that thinking would go back to incidents that took place during the war.
The other thing what Smuda  as I said  sin ce he was such an excellent welder  he had developed a technique since he didn't want to  to uh help the Germans to win the war  to uh  develop a certain technique of um  um  um sabotage.
Did -- did -- did the Holocaust come up in -- in a way that -- that was comprehensive  profound at that time?
>> Bill Benson: When did your mom learn about what happened to her two daughters  your two sisters?
When the war began in Poland  what are your first memories?
She couldn't go back to her original profession because hats was not fashionable after the war for obvious reasons  especially during the Communist system.

I mean  it was just a question of evil against good  and it was just impossible that Hitler could win the war.
My mother  fortunately  went through all of the war with her two olde r sisters  and most of the war with their father  before he was lost in Auschwitz .
So thats why my boys  after the war were invited to the big party.
That meant that the war and the front came very close.
And she is the one who suffered the most from the war.
Did -- did you think the war would reach Koretz? [
During the Yalta Conference  where they decided the war crime trial concept  said there was people who were involved on an international basis  who were supposed to be tried by the international court  which were then Nuremberg.
on May 18 th  2015  here at the Holocaust Museum in Washington   D .C. Thank you very much for having shared your story with us today.
This one had a tradition way back  it was for generations -- during the war  the first World War  it was occupied by the Germans and they evacuated us.
They were on a boat  on an Italian boat  in the Mediterranean on the day that Italy declared war -- rather  war on Britain and France after Hitler got to Paris with the 6 breakthrough in June 1939.
Feeling hope  and also based on the our faith  religious faith  and feeling that we were not the people who could cause the war  but rather to defend our honor  but not to kind of being afraid that we are facing such a mighty enemy  and such a ruthless enemy.
I also always knew that it would come to a war  even as a young boy.
And of course if we were bored  Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 96and if somebody knew something about the subject  there was a conference about that and everybody would cool come and so it was ordinary Prisoner of war Prisoner of war camp.
That was definitely the beginning of the end of World War II.
I was told later on they were hoping to exchange us for German war prisoners.
I have pictures from our life in Berlin before the war.
It was a labor camp  it was a slave labor camp  you know?
He was in World War I. I had a picture taken with me with my uniform and him.
As I probably mentioned  or maybe I didnt  I never  ever discussed the war -- the -- they knew I was Jewish  they knew I had a number  I was in Auschwitz  they knew I lost my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 177 parents.
02:16:56 When the war was over in our in my area  Limoges and Chateauroux  in the fall of 19-- oh  just before the High Holy Days in 1944  when I remember getting my cousins out of that convent  and I remember getting anyway  I just went there and got them and put them on God knows what trucks.
That was  of course  before U.S. was attacked in Pearl Harbor.
Nah  he no  he was I it was both of it  because he saw that Im not his son  but the son of his best friend  Karl Lasch   who was shot by Himmler during the war.
And some of th em got nearby  the camp outside of Lvov   where they kept the Polish officers  and and the you know  surrounded them  and took off their insignia  and told them that they are prisoners of war  and not to get into the ta into touch with with relatives.
Well  that was s hort -- about a year before the war  this was close to the war.
Because they had to put the Jews somewhere and they didn't want them outside.
For my father to cut off the beard was the worse thing because since his beard started to grow  he never touched a hair  even in the first world war in the army  he never touched the beard.
He did a wonderful thing  and by the way the Nazi  th -- his own colleagues took care of him  he didnt survive the war.
And there was a war and the Romanians fought against the Germans  the First World War.
Was there an announcement that the Romanian army is going to -- Yes  there was an announcement  yes  yes  yeah  yeah  there was a big announcement  very dramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall Antonescu  was broadcast all over when it 37 happened  on the radio  on the  you know  public speakers and so on  everybody heard it  and the war started  the -- before that  the town was al ready full of military  it was obvious to everybody  imminent that something will start sooner or later because the city of Iasi was at 19 kilometers  which is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia  which by now was Russia already.
This pi cture would be really the first one  because after the war I was so eager to finish my e ducation and there was the Academia and they took the picture.
It's interesting because my first exposure with the Nazi military was before World War II and I was in Switzerland with my parents in a town that's right at the border  the German border  called Reinfelden.
Most of them were those who escaped earlier to Soviet Russia and survived and returned.
No  see  I thought that you came prior to the Germans  that you would try to beat the timing of the Germans.
For example  in academic time I was  up to the 18 years old  I [indecipherable] up to the 1939 war  I was in academic team playing the basketball  and I was short.
But then everybody start turning around and looking  if you  you see all of us were separated  from families  from sisters  from mothers  from brothers  so we didn't know what was going on  I didn't know what's on the other side of the wall during the war.
I paid someth ing and I asked  and I went to the pr iest  to the town priest  and he spoke about it that they shouldn't ruin this anymore  becaus e right after the war when we came this is what we did  that they put a gate but it was all already torn and the Poles took the all nice (Counter# 577) you know.
Do you or Im Im sorry  did your family participate in any of the home front efforts during the war  like rationing  or victory gardens?
And in the meantime the war broke out  so that stopped everything.
And I was left afte r the war  and my father -- with my father and brother  but we were -- we didnt know about each other.
There were Germans  German troops  and Ge rman officers in that inn  and they were singing one of those lovely war songs about Prince Eugene  thats a boy  I guess  going to Belgrade conquering Belgrade.
Bill Benson: When you were liberated  when you knew you were liberated and the war was over for you  your family and other Jews that had survived came under suspicion by the Soviets.
Can you tell me when the war broke out with the Soviet Union in 1941 between the Germans and the Soviet Union  where was he?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 31 They -- They knew about it  and somehow th ey  over the years have told me that I am o -- too overprotective  because -- and they -- they blame that on the sort of holding onto them  and its a result of the war that I am the way I am.
It was very nice  but you know  that that was interesting  but of course  the war wasnt over  you know.
When the war had been   the war was still going on.
Let's begin with your telling us about your parents and their lives prior to your birth and certainly prior to the start of the war.
And then later on  when the Jewish when the Hungarian Jews were Rounded up.
In fact  I talked to a survivor  and really there are two stages of survival  one is survive the war  another one is survive the post-war.
Oh  ma my friend  they they digged her ho a hole under the house  a beautiful house  and the f whole family wanted to hide from the Germans in the war.
There -- They were accusing  well like now  they are accusing them of spreading AIDS and you know  in through certain times way back in history  they accused them of poisoning wells and drinking blood and all that  you know  its -- and lot of them -- I dont know who the leaders of the anti-Vietnam war movement were.
They actually remained in churches for the entire duration of the war.
Interview with Hannah Kalman May 20  1999 64 I would like to ask you a few questions about some of the things that happened since the war.
And..uh...then after this...what happened after this  the...the American came to liberate  you know  after...when the war was finished.
We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I  immediately  and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia  and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia.
Thats why we thats how we found out that the war broke out  because they came with those pictures.
And yet others  they really  they waited until it was clear the war was lost.
So that was the only time I really experienced sort of and that was after the war  way after the war.
There was already  probably year before  was known for politicians that Klaipeda will be taken away because the war around  they were taking Czechoslovakia  theyre taking there and there and there  that Klaipeda will fall anyway.
Did Ta nte Toos want to adopt you when the war was over?
The only one atrocity that we committed that people committed in a camp was a Spanish from a Spanish civil war his name was Santacara.
Also...while I'm talking I'm reminding myself...when the bombs start to come in  we went into a neighborhood not far from that farm where we used to live before the war.
They felt they could kill every last Jew  then even if they lose the war they won the war.
You know  you can just keep that ring but because Mr. Sawinski said my cow just died and I'm going to sell it and he says no  no  this has a tremendous emotional value to me so keep it and I'll -- you know  and I'll get you -- you return it to me and I'll buy you a cow right after the war.
They they they didnt they didnt want war no more than we did. [
So the logical thing would be to just learn to have patience and hope that the war would be over.
This was -- this happened after America give the -- started to war in Germany.
When we came there it was the First of May. Accident...accidentally  I remember the day exactly; because on the way  when we went on the...uh road  a old uh Wehrmachts man who was called up--he was this time about fifty--started to talk with me  and he still believed that Hitler will win the war.
So I stow away to Achen  which is right on the border  and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me that I gave to a railroad employee  and I asked him -- I spoke to him with a French ac cent and I told him that I had been in Germany as a French prisoner of war and that Id fallen in love with a German girl and Id come to see her and I needed to go back.
In fairness  I must say that despite the Cold War politics and despite the fact that it a gave the prosecution  the various pros ecutions ulcers  the War Department held fast until the last tr ial was over and I think that the war de partment deserves al l the credit in the world for that.
>> Bill Benson: It wasn't long after Hitler came to power in early 1933 that your father decided to leave Germany for Belgium.
The older was a a Nazi a big  not a Nazi bu t he was  before th e war he was a Nazi.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON Page 12 concerned that maybe repetition of the stories we had heard from our parents of what happened during the first war and were concerned that the Germans might come back  we left.
Nathan: She has three brothers  two brothers they were in Germany and one  where I found out after the war  because I was thinking he was in Russia.
He lost his mother and sister  never saw his father  and he said that after the war he and another buddy decided to go to Poland to look for their relatives.
Before the war there were some people extremist who were saying bi yda.
We didnt call it the Holocaust  of cour se  we called it the war  or the camps  or the Nazis  whatever.
So after the war when you went to synagogue  did you just go because of tradition?
And it was so cold I was shivering even my -- as soon as I her -- there was no radio  but somebody had a radio somewher e and I heard about the war.
She lived in my town after the war  but she moved away to Slonyim   it's a bigger city I suppose.
So if you know that situation  many of the Austrians came in and stayed  and very often became Poles  even better Poles patriotically than than some peasants who peasants or some workers who didnt have schooling or something  that as the ch-change after the war happened  there were many and during the 19 th century theres you probably know from history  there were several uprising against Russia to free Poland Yes.
I was  like  shortly before the war  when I was fifteen.
Well  toward the end of the war  I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a German  and who did fantastic things for the underground  the Dutch underground.
And the people who remained  they had to close up the camp and they sent us to a different camp.
They interned them  the families  all of them  all of us   for t he duration of the war.
with that information apparently  because otherwise I would have gone with my outfit and left Italy when the war ended.
I wanted to ask you if there is anything that you wanted to me ntion that I didnt ask you  about your life in this country since the war  and/or about your work at the museum.
The end of the war was May eighth  I believe  or May ninth  one of those two days  45.
Now when you were a little girl gr owing up  going to school  did you experience any anti-Semitism before the war from the Hungarians?
Do you remember what day or how long af ter the invasion started  the Germans came to Rozwadow?
I must tell them that th e war is almost over  that they just should hold out  that I just heard gun shot...shootings in the middle of the night.
When you think in those terms  how do you  how do the Germans fit in?
This is a war  there were all kinds of rumors going on  because at -- at some point  we were -- we were bombed by the Ca rtushas from -- from the other side of the river.
Are you with anybody else that you knew  pre-war or during the war?
Before the war  were you in any kind of schooling at all  in Lvov?
That was the end of the war  and Harry Interview with George Pisik July 14  1993 10Truman saved my life.
You left off with-you had just finished talking about your schooling and you finished describing what happened to you up until the beginning of the war  of being in school and all of that.
After the war it was Polish Jews  and now its all Russian Jews.
Did you follow the Nuremberg trials while you were in Europe ?
And the third brother  this very wealthy guy  he came to New York  he -- he -- he had a lots of money in Switz erland  but the war it came  so then he come to Italy with the rest of us  but when you come to the Italian part I w ill explain it to you what happened.
>> Bill Benson: On September 17  1939  shortly after Germany invaded Poland  Russia attacked Poland.
Was it a happy childhood  or did you experience any anti -Semitism?
Everybody by us in our section spoke German because our section was Galicia and this belonged to Aust ria until the end of the First World War.
>> Bill Benson: Peter  as hard as conditions were  as you've described it  for Jews in Hu ngary generally life became profoundly worse when the Germans occupied Hungary in March 1944.
And  after the war  to our great satisfaction  but not surprise  he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences  so  he  they recognized him.
Well  in those days  Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12  2002 37before the war s -- before the United States was involved in the war  of course  they -- they didnt care too much for the soldiers.
Larrys mother  also a German Jew was incarcerated in Theresienstadt  a -- a survivor  e-e-eventually in Auschwitz   and -- but she  like m-my mother  survived the war.
And they had already a couple of American Jewish pilots that they used to be in the second World War  went to help Israel.
I didn't mention that my sister was born two months before the war.
When– did you talk to your kids about your experiences during the Holocaust?
After the war  here my cousin in the center  she unf ortunately died about two years ago  yes.
Well  he was a -- a good man  until then  you know.
Harvard wasnt much before that  it was when Conant became president  which is one of the reasons Harvard got so far ahead of Yale  because Conant became president before the war  and so all the refugees could go to Harvard .
What they took from the Jews  they paid for the war.
At the end of the war  at the end of the war  by 1944  around October  we realized that the camp in Plashow would be liquidated because the Russians were approaching  and the Germans were retreating  so they were liquidating all the camps around.
I I got the Bronze Star uh from General Hodges towards the end of the war.
This was the old man who passed away after war  a few years after war.
Among the most important thing is I have established a contact with the Polish government where they were paying the raberats with [indecipherable] you know  before war prices  and for prices from before war  you couldnt -- a cookie  you know  cost as much as a days work.
After the war when he was liberated  he went back to Italy where he was from.
He spend a n extra two years after the war  extra two years  in a Russian prison  in the coal mines.
Okay  before the war  we live in a very lovely city  by the name of Volachisk -- Im sorry  not Volachisk  Proscurov  which is near Volachisk and Potvolachisk  where the rest of my relatives were born.
Was it near --was the ghetto near where you had lived?
He was a captain in the Red Army during the wa r  and at the end of the war decided that he wanted to get out.
And see  we -- we had something -- that the war is going well for the Allies.
If he'd be assassinated  thousands maybe millions of people would  would uh have survived the war and other things  but this  this was not to happen to happen.
It was something of an experience warped in todays terms  I would 53 say yes  but again from a child who is ten  eleven  twelve  et cetera  its a different because but  this was really my personali ty before the war.
When you saw a German soldier would that elicit any response?
And why don't we now -- why don't you help us to make an agreement with the allies that we could stop the war with them and we all join force against the Soviet?
And I still have anot -- One thing Im wondering about is when it was that you finally felt he althy again  after the war  and after being in the hospital  a couple different places.
He make a questions  how come during the war the Polish people  they had to save more Jewish people?
And  number two  we're already going into 1945 and there's only f our months left of the war.
Where were you when you first heard about the German invasion of Poland?
And of course  Salonika was where the main Jewish community was before the war  and those Germans had desecrated the beautiful cemetery there which was on a hill overlooking the sea.
5 >> Bill Benson: And  of course  the German Army did approach in June of 1940 when they attacked France .
In June  in July  1918  we came back to Czernowi tz and my father who got wounded in the war left  lived for year and half more and then he di ed.
From the Revolutionary War  to the 1812 War  to the ag.
They were able to scrape together 270 boys from the age of 15 to the age of 19  20 and thirty girls who survived the war.
I was a 4-F  but I -- I was born with a -- a -- a heart abnormality  which disqualified me for military service  but I still felt it was an event I wanted to observe first hand and I heard about the American field service  which sent ambulance drivers  as it had done in World War One  to Italy and to the first French army  which was then not yet back actually into France.
I th ink he re tried to smuggle me you know  we had those letters that th-th-these letters were August 39  and the war started September September. ‚
Do you remember when you were young hearing Hitler give speeches over the radio?
She said  you know she reme mbered the Germans from the first world war  so she said  in Yiddish of course.
And thats how we knew that the war is really getting close.
Had you heard of a man named Hitler by that time?
And they fe ll in love with each other and they got married and then  just in beginning of '39  before the war broke out  t hey  you know  came to the United States.
We have a very good friend  sh e grew up in Pola nd after the war and... Theres Bit-skie again.
Did you -- I didnt know him at all  I -- I met him after the war.
So you find that the element  or the class of people wh o were in that conditions before the war adjusted easier to the bad conditions in the ghetto than the better class of people  if we want to classify them.
I think there were 40 of them and lower bunks and upper -- my mother and I of course were together I think it was a lower bunk.
And that was th e end of the war for us.
People started um  digging holes in the  in the yards and erecting uh barricades  and my father was um  was upstairs in in the bedroom  and my mother cautioned everyone not to mention the war to him  and uh  didn't let him listen to the radio or anything  but I guess my father knew  obviously  what was going on.
In other place  in other place  before the Russian came  I heard they killed the prisoners over there.
When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in.
Vichy did not govern France since the end of 1942  when Germany occupi ed the southern French ﬁfree zone.ﬂ Elizabeth-Anne Wheal  Stephen Pope  James Taylor  A Dictionary of the Second World War (New York: Peter Bedrick Books  1990)  500.
It was almost hot  because this was in -- in -- I was there in May after the war.
Uh the going to war was not popular in this country.
That means she didnt even have one day to say  well I survived the war and maybe my grandson survived the war  maybe my son survived the war  or sons  I should say.
Yes  yes because I know he sent letters some  after the war.
And then with this Mr. Stanick in Bernau  for whose father I worked during the war  when I couldnt work for my old boss  who was Jewish.
So now Germany invades Poland in September 1939  what are your memories of that?
As you've heard perhaps or not  that in and in other parts of Poland  after 1945  when the war as over  and the Jews were running from the camps or from hiding  they still were not ready to give away what they robbed from the Jews  so they had one way of doing it: kill them.
So  basically  uh  basically  because of the rapid conclusion of the of the war... But why do you think they didn't just shoot everybody?
Later on  I was fortunate enough to meet some of these prominent actors and when I came back to Germany after the war.
And...uh..before the war  there was an American...as a matter of fact  an American group of young men and women that built a kibbutz in Asiv  by the name of Asiv ...American...I was there on the commemoration with General Adror at the time.
There was a girl  a friend of Ellens and mine who worked also with us in the leather good factory  she was half Jewish  and she was also arrested  but she got out and she told me after the war  that my mother was in that things -- in that camp there  waiting to be deported.
My father fought  as a young man  in the Austrian war  in World War One  and if he had lived  and come to the United States  he would have fought on the oppos ite side in World War Two  and that in itself is crazy.
I wanted to know how you got involved with what became what you just said  a political issue  but I I would like you back up just a little bit and and go back to the late 40s  and the 50s  when when there are a lot of things happening  not just in your life  but in in this society here  and news was coming out in Europe about what had happened during the war.
I was in the Polish army and I was a prisoner of war and then they freed all the Jews in March of 1940  they send all prison -- Jewish prisoners of war back to Poland.
We have found out  after the war  that they ended up in BergenBelsen in a transit logger about the same time  I guess  that the Dutch girl was there  Anna Frank.
I did a little bit in college  because peopl e would ask  where were you during the war -- the Jewish people.
And after he became a citizen  he went back home to get married  and the war broke out  and being that he was born there  they didnt recognize his citizenship  and he went into the army.
So they said I was some relative  distant relative and my husband was in th e war  he died in the war and not there.
Do do you remember do you remember when Hitler came to power?
But suppose I would say to you  most of the guilty never get tried  for-forgetting maybe in most crimes  but in this particular kind of cr ime  in war crimes  they dont get tried.
Did you ever -- ever relate that to your experience in Germany  in relation to Jews?
I re membered before the war  we were happy  we went  we came  and then all of a sudden  everythi ng changed  and that is where I had great difficulty  with that why.
He started out during World War II in the tsars army.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 52 When your -- When your daughters were growing up  did there come a point at which you wanted to talk to them about the war?
The text says: Already during the first days of the war  more than 6 000 Jews were killed  especially young men.
Yeah  he -- he -- he dr-dreamed that after the war he will open -- he will have his own bar.
After the war they were picked up and they had to parade through the streets with their hands on their head and soldiers surrounding with their 11 rifle and the people were shouting at them and so on.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned   of course  that your sister  Edith  I think  had been in the British Army.
As it was  Belgians hated the Germans anyway  as a result of World War 1.
Even after the war  she was clamming up  she wouldnt talk.
So anyway  um  that is our  till the Russian came  and they freed us  and then he brought us to Helm  which was in Niederstow  and we thought that the only survivors in from the war  but there came there more survivors from different places  and we  Esthe r Raab we met there  you know Esther Raab  and uh  and some other people  and then we moved up to  to Lublin  and uh  because Lid  uh Selma was Dutch  so there was already  there was a lot of Dutch prisoners of war happened to be  they wanted to send them back  and all the Dutch people.
I don't quite know why  but the French had somehow promised the German masters  because France was now occupied by Germany  to keep all the Jews there so that they could be deported to their death.
The Germans had demanded that an American pe -- ma -- officer come over and look at an area where th eres a prisoner of war camp so they wouldnt shoot and kill our own prisoners.
For example  through his studies he also finished a full degree in a secular university majoring in German literature and philosophy eventually obtaining a Doctorate degree in German literature and philosophy.
So  the 13 life in -- in Italy was a happy one  until really the war started -- the -- 38 was the beginning of difficulties.
After all  some of them were coming to relatives they havent seen since before the war or they had never seen.

Do you remember anything about what your husbands experience was like at the end of the war?
The War Refugee Board consisted of thre e people with the secretaries  the treasury  which was Morgenthau.
My brother Joseph was sent who was older th an I  was sent on the last kinder train to England   which was a refugee train to save children in Germany  and he spent the rest of the war in England without his parents.
Oh definitely  not because he was Jewish   but that probably didnt help because there was an antagonism between the you know  but not we did not feel that in Belgrade  during  before the war.
She had co me to France to see us  so J ackie -- when I talk about what happened during the war  he was always with us.
It was  you know  trying to take up something that could help the German war effort -- Right.
Were they scared that there was going to be a war?
And while I have nothing against people studying the origins of World War I  having at one time myself thought of doing something on the diplomacy of the late 19 th century  that set the stage for the first World War  it seemed to me preposterous that nobody had done anything similar  seriously looking at the origins of World War II.
Tell us about that period  what you can  about that period between the start of the war in September 1939 and when things really changed dramatically in 1941  then later in 1942.
But as a result of our having lived through the war with the wonderful nutrition we had  I have horrible teeth.
Well  in preparing for this interview  I did read one thing that right after that war  that there was a -- a few situations of anti-Semitism and that people attributed it to the Nazis had sown some seeds  and -- and then it -- it kind of was pushed away again  but that -- that it was hard right after the war  and some people were grumbling and saying  oh  everythings the Jews fault.
What have we not discussed in this interview that you would still like to -- to talk about with respect to your experiences as a result of the war?
At what point or were you ever before the war started aware of a man named Hitler.
I lived through the Twenties and the exaggerated responses to the first World War.
So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the war.
I dont remember now his name  but -- first name  but I remember very good name  Sigoua  who was the machinist of the first class machinist before the war  and first class machinist either are leading the -- in the express train  or the freight train.
But  of course  by the time he realized that he couldn't get Fanny and the kids here  the war started and the rest is history.
A large part of that gold  I think  was just transferred back  transferred by the Germans  converted into Swiss francs   and the Swiss francs were used by the Germans to purchase whatever it was they wanted to purchase   war materials in the first place  or something else.
So  what he owned was that mill  befo re the war  and the brewery  there was a brewery.
And then one brave lady  she came up to this German.
Of 17 course  I didn't know who Erich Kulka was  because Erich Kulka's name in Auschwitz...he changed his name after the war.
After the war  a l ong time after the war has ended I found out I was already in Israel I found out that one family was hiding not far away from us and the German patrol was shooting into the forest and the fa ther was hit by a bullet and he screamed the Germans came and dragged the whole family and se nt them to a concentration camp  but they survived the war.
That is on the terrace of our new house that my father completed just before war.
So there are lots of things that and as I said  after the war nobody ever thought about that we were in shock  that we need somewhere help or anything.

The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first sketches after the war  were not presented with an historic backgr ound  they're not even asked to read or to understand what they are drawing  what they are doing and so we have know the after effects.
it -- certainly the beginnings of one  and I think certainly by the time the three and a half years ended  there was more of it  and I think then  for that one year that we were still there after the war  I think there was more of it  and then some knowledge of -- of some new people her age that she -- his good friend and so forth.

So  were you at some point starting to imagine that the war might be coming to an end?

>> Bill Benson: I wish we had a lot more time.
The bad part for -- of that life for Jews was like that.

The selection of people -- and now also a kind of surgery to babies and young women after the war helping women to conceive.
But  by 1944  we were getting already messages that the Russians are getting very very close  pushing the German army back.
The idea of seeing them lose the war and having maybe one hour of freedom or eating one orange or seeing a tree.
So they kept us and then I was yeah  when the war was over I was close to Italy there.

And -- and -- and as -- as the war slowly sort of wound down to an end.
But there was name of my school friend who survived the war because she was in the group in ghetto that was in hiding.
It was a mu ch easier survival from what I just spoke to Bernard very recently and he was telling me stories  how they basically lived the same way like the rest of the prisoners of war  and they were able to get packages and they were fed reasonably decently  et cetera  et cetera.
And then I went to -- I was sent to Europe to interrogate war prisoners.
He said afte r the war is  the world is very hostile to us and he doe sn't want to  he  to bring up children  they should go through what he went through and I went through and my sister went through.

I have no problem with somebody like Joan Baez and all the other ones who opposed the war.

Thats how the money went down  I mean  the money was just worth nothing in Germany.

Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 36 That was go -- In fact I would say that the Jewish schools were  in many ways  even better than the non-Jewish schools  the public schools  because Jewish teachers prided themselves  they said  ﬁYou have to know more than others in order to come to the fore somewhere  somehow.ﬂ And th e curriculum was very strict  and I used to sit on my homework for hours a nd hours and hours.
It didn't cost and didn't divert anything from the war effo rt.
My cousin in Israel could only provide information about Poland before the war.
You know afte r the war  we were going to the Jewish community in Praga and the survivors used to write down their names in hoping to find other survivors.
and he was -- you know  he was alive afte r the war  and my father was taking care about him  he was giving hi m some money  but he -- he was killed by train  I remember  because he was crazy  he wa -- he didn t understand what is going on  and he was walking with this violin  oh.
Bill Benson: No  September 1  Germany invades Poland and Russia comes -- Rae Goldfarb: My part.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 >> Bill Benson: Do you know anything about what that was like for you?
It was not part of that  it was as of everything  when the war started  that was the churches were closed  and you could not gather.
I'm just going to do some... (Speed  sync take 2 mark) Do you remember the start of the war.
But he knew him from first World War  because I think after the first World War  Hoover sent money to newly resurrected Poland   and somehow he must have been involved in that money.
Of course  later on  we no longer  my father  it was too dangerous to listen to  to and maybe there wa s no radio anymore  but in the beginning  certainly in the 1st half a year of the war  we did know what was going on in the world.
>> Bill Benson : You would live under those circumstances until the fall of 1942 when then you were forced into a ghetto in Drohobycz.
And then the war...and then the war started between Russia and the Russian-Germany.
I remember him because after the war  again  he became the Red Cross doctor in Vienna.
Actually  what happened  the war  the Germans invaded on a Sunday morning  early morning.
I remember my heart by now an empty shell  from all that pain  from all that hell  it's such a long and awful war  my wounds forever an open sore.
Does that type of thing remind you of thi ngs that happened in Europe before the war?
So  let me ask you something  you were a very  very young child when the war came in 1941.
Like I say  it was a very musical home  and th en everything -- well  he had some standing timber and a sawmill  and a dock for exporting lumber  and he bought all of that on credit after World War I and lost the whole kit and caboodle in the depression.
When we had to  during the war  under the Russian occupation  we had to go to Warsaw   to German Germany [indecipherable] .
I do remember o -- during the war period my mother helped my father try to keep busy.
Everybody was there  but he was absolutely not afraid of them  and he told us  \ The end of the war is near.
Re -- during the war  because my parents were sending me to school  and in Romania -- In Romania. --
My question is  when the war brokes out -- broke out  were you alone  away from your family  studying -- I was alone -- Mm-hm. --
In the beginning of the war you could do almost a lot of things  but the Germans were not organized yet.
But I would drive by and talk to her on the side and she would smile and talk to me and it would kind of felt like we were for each other but not in...and I would write her love letters and maybe someday we'll...which I I believe I didn't believe that we would live the war through 02:03: because we used to get some scraps of newspapers  German papers  that the the German people would throw out their food into the newspapers.
Were you in touch with the family that had -- y-your foster family in Belgium at all after the war? [
But I learned early in the game during the war years uh I learned early that there was something very wrong with who I was.
On September 1  1939  Germany begins World War II by invading neighboring Poland to its east.
So apparently  during the war  my father said to Horsts father  would you come and get some of our precious belongings in case we ever have to leave our home and would you hold them for safekeeping?
Like my oldest aunt had tw o sons who had been married before the war  and they already had little babies.
There was a little town not far away  where from time to time people were summoned for various reasons  and there was always a great deal of trepidation and fear attached to that  because you didnt know it was usually somebody that they either want ed to recruit for some other work  or it was some oth or they suspected somebody of being what they called the bourgoi you know  before the war  and they wanted to look into it.
After the war ended in Europe  I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945  that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about 2 Jewish Daily Forward 3 Algemeyner Yidish Arbeter Bund in Lita  Poylen  Rusland [Universal Jewish Workers Union in Lithuania  Poland and Russia] (Yiddish); Jewish socialist organization.
And administration which would come later on was this Dr. Elkous   and then there was this other person who was  prior we knew from before the war  friends of our family.
And I  and I dont have any idea whether this is fear -related or whether this related to the war but whereas intellectually Im totally comfortable with making mistakes  emotionally  when people disapprove of something that Ive done or angry with me  it still gives me a pang of ahhhh.
There was something so -- Po land was strong and prepared for war and the whole world was supposed to help Poland.
Ah -- I should -- I should also say -- we should also say that before the outbreak of the war  your three brothers  who were also in Poland  went back  had been gone ba -- had gone back to -- United States. --
Maybe only letters  you understand  but at the end of the war when we left this  she -- she didn't receive any information from .
And have you talked about your war experiences to your children?
When I came back from the concentration camp  the first thing I went to was [indecipherable] to the Ponary  and I find out a ll the places where was the this  the -- the man who were  the beginning of the war taken from th e city  and this people  and the other people  and from [indecipherable] night where we were inside.
I dont know but Im sure they didnt build hospitals during the war.
So uh at beginning of the war  the Jewish people were around and concentrate in some big cities or small cities  but  in order to be easy to be controlled.
I -- I worked in Philadelphia for a couple of years and I -- I wanted to get into the war.
And she came back to the house to say somebody saw a German soldier and said  ﬁI have seen a German sold ier.ﬂ And my aunt said  ﬁIt must be English  it must be British.ﬂ She never understood th e war; she never understood what was going on.
After the war  and on our...so-called \ on our way home \  uh  for discharge.
After all  there was a war going on  so if everybody had to give their share  probably we had to work  we didn't think of anything else.
So this was a makeshift hospital and they had some Jewish doctors who practiced -- I mean  they were doctors before the war.
When the war started -- Mm-hm -- -- in Europe -- Yes? --
After war -- after Germany take Poland and Russian take firs t all guns  all radio  all instrument against the enemy  and in Poland was not -- you ca nnot buy gun  you cannot have some ammunition  because everything German took out.
You know  its the sort of thing we -- we said about the Germans in World War .
The war will end and you will pay me \  but Pollack concluded for some reason he has to pay.
Around 11:00 in the morning  the siren announcing the end of the war started blasting.
It looks very dilapidated and it must ha ve been taken after the war ended  I dont know.
Anyway  to make the story short  we became acquainted and from then on  we used to go out steady and we uh...it seems to me that that's  that's was our destiny (Laughter) and  you know  we just tied to each other  and Pela and I...and we decided that in 1936 we were married  thr ee years before the war.
What else would you want a younger generation to know about what it is that you saw during the war  and what it is that youd want them to understand about the Holocaust survivors and what they went th rough  that you witnessed as well.
So you thought liberation means back to where you were before the war.
But the things Switzerland did after the war  with the gold  and not paying out the moneys that people were entitled to and denying them what was rightfully theirs  this is what I resent.
This was before his first marriage  even  as an enemy alien  fron -- from England and he came back after the war.
And what puzzles me very much  because my father had been in the war.
I think my father was killed on the way or in Auschwitz and my mother was sent towards the end of the war.
And -- Im trying to find a -- fi nd a English wor -- when people who had been injured in the war  there was a -- a -- a league lik e that  and he beca -- soon became the head of 4 that league.
In every kibbutz and in every moshav  they went to war.
I worked originally with a fellow from the states by the name of Joe Levi ne  who lives now in Fort Wayne  Indiana and is also very active getting all the f acts during the war together.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 89 You know  this is the shape of Poland before the war.
So  as we passed the old cemetery  we started coming near er to the market square  and thats where a lot of Jewish people lived before the war anyhow  but now  of course  it was packed  because other streets have been cleaned - not cleaned  but cleared of the Jewish people.
>> Bill Benson: And by that time did know -- did you know what was happening to Jews elsewhere  that they were being exterminated?
And I barely knew what she did during the war  or -- I -- I sort of know.

When -- wh en you discovered after the war  the extent of the brutality and the murder in Europe  was th at -- that must have been shocking to you.
I was just doing the best after the war you have to understand  I mean we had things so good after all these things.
After war was end some Russian people  in this concentration camp was 5 000 Russi an army officers  and this people was stoned one guy (??)
Yeah  the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was til the war  til the til bast -- Barbarossa   til the attack of the Germans.

Tell us 24 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD about the end of the war for you.
Because m-my parents had friends that were Germans  and they used to come at our house  and thats why they wanted me to learn German.
It turns out that during the war he went through this personality change and he became a gregarious chatty chap.
The 1941  42  43  were years in which whilst the war was going on  and London was being bombed  my father was talking about concentration camps.
At the end of the war  does your father have to go through de-Nazification  because he was a member of the party?
As far as I know Mrs. Merkel was -- took all these refugees because she said they didn't take Jews during the war  so that's why she was  you know  trying to help refugees.
We were there because after the war you couldnt find an apartment  and my parents had a very small little room.
And this shot  it -- this is also my father after the war probably  but I dont know in what year it was taken.
And then of course  the war progressed  and I remember there was the first bombing was there  there were you know  there were siren  there were planes  we went to some cellar.
And  although that obviously was tremendous personal misery for these people  it filled me with a tremendous joy to see  finally  the hardships of the war hitting back at those who had caused all the misery to us  but also to other peoples.
We had  during the war  when we kne w that they are going to take our apartment away  that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto  we had neighbors.
And one brother was coming back from the war and he stoppe d in Vilna to look for -- for Blechman family and he saw my sister.
And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this factory was -- we came across a factory.
Being brought up in the climate of freedom  I probably am a little bit more patriotic than the Poles who were raised in the periods after the Second World War.
And I was saying that  because I was so young and this was such an impact on my life  that although perhaps I could not understand exactly what a war is  but I knew that I must survive.
And she said  ﬁI am going to start using this after the war  when we are all together and we live in peace.ﬂ And so  a nd she kept it and she had it with her all the time.
When did you find out of what had happened to the Jews who remained in Poland ?
Th e trouble is that an agreement was made with Saddam Hussein  which didnt provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and which didnt provide for any war crimes tria ls  and which allowed him  over time  to re-institute a dictatorship of the first water.
So you stayed there with the Debrackelaers for what was left of the war in Belgium.
crying) So my sister left for Palestine and my family was my parents  my younger sister and I. When the Russo German war broke out in '41 in June  where I worked they gave some Jews pink   means permit to evacuate with the Russians.
And the teachers too  and they didnt make The first day the war began  you mean?
who was just a farmer  but he had a lot of experience because he served in this Russian Imperial army during the Ru ssian Japanese war  so he was in Manchuria in China as a soldier  yeah.
Most of them were those who escaped earlier to Soviet Russia and survived and returned.
Now  in June 1941 is when Germany attacked the Soviet Union.
Second of all  very very  very many  even religious people  Yiddin  were in the front  on the on the on the nu but the first lines of the of the war  and this.
you you got to know this this Polish prisoner of war  whose name was Alfons.
They sent people that they considered enemies of the state to Siberia.
One brother was  before the war  a communist  you know  like [indecipherable] Right.
His memoirs by the way  are not just on the Holocaust at all  his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his very happy childhood and after the war  his experience in foreign service.
SE: Nineteen-four -- in the war -- 1942  or the 43 - 42 - 41.
What did they know about your background  in terms of the war and the -- the -- your resistance?
Just to show you so this might be the result of having lived thr ough that war.
In -- in March -- in March 1945  about six weeks before the end of the war  we heard through one of our friends that we sort of were socializing with  a very strange story.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 33 Yeah  well  well get back to that a little later.
So that ended up the War Refugee Board job  which I told you started in February 1944  and it landed until I got out of the army in October 1945.
>> Bill Benson: Do you have any recollection of what it was like when OSE came and got you and took you from the home of the Bocahuts?
A. We first learned that after the war  when Hildas mother came.
Actually  just before the war broke out my father wrote to one of his cousins and said that he was going to join the Dutch free forces that were in England by that time.
She stayed there  but I guess she had a pretty pleasant life after the war.
And he eventually came to the States  but his mind was not -- he was in his 70s  he had gone through World War Two  he was in a nursing home.
Some of the Jews managed to escape and come to the Russian territories.
he went to buy the tickets to Poland   they told him  you cant go to Poland  because is the war between Germany and Russia .
