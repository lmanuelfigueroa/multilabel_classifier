He was in Czechoslovaki a until the end of the war even after the war  fighting Germans and somehow he survived and he wound up in  in a camp  displaced persons camp  where he was in sort of citizens police  in camp police  as a policeman.
Were you aware  before the war  what was going on in Germany?
And the sons all run away to Russia  and they survived in Russia.
In France  we made contact with a relative who had survived the war in France.
Now I remind myself when the war broke out  he was 45 years old  forty years was old.
Can you tell us...before we get to after the war in Brichah which is a special chapter  during the war...during this period in the forest...first in Vilna and then in the forest  can you tell us about working with Abacostner during this period?
Yes  but I mean  it should have been a right fo -- for e -- for e -- there were many people in high school whose father was not in the war.
So all the records he had were little notes he made in a certain code which  after the war  he then transferred to a more elaborate ledger.
Yes  he invented the fir the bo the smokescreen  in the first World War.
You know  this was after the war  everything was was was very  very  very A2: Disorganized.

We kept strictly  there was nothing non kosher  I didn't heard this after the war.
The Russian  how do you call  the Russian prisoners  you know  there were lot of prisoners of war from Germany that came home.
And so the -- the war turned USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 92 out th-that of my mothers family  the only survivors  except for the brothers that were in Canada  were the three of us.
End of Tape #8 105 Tape #9 I know theres a -- a lot more to your story after the war  its very complicated  but I -- well have to do a lot of that at another time  but a lot of people think that when the word liberation is used  like [indecipherable] right  that everything is fine.
That's like for the weather  for rain  like you put -- the  the army people put them on and you tie up to here  during the Second World War.
Then came the war and I never went to th e gymnasium.
And how  as I could prove with what I have done before  many years before and uh especially in the war time.
There was very  very little food in Holland during that last winter.
Our time came  my mother  my grandmother  my sister  myself  in the winter we worked actually in factories  and we thought if you worked for the war effort  you kind of exempt -- >> Bill Benson: Be exempt from that?
Actually it was -- well  it was Hungary in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was Romania  Romania at that time  yeah  because it was always back and forth Hungary and Romania and back and forth.
Somebody gave me  or maybe I had a pair of slacks.
Yeah did you have any sense that a war was coming before September first?
Everybody left their belongings  furniture  beautiful things from before the war.
So my parents had to wait until after the war  until 1948  25 years after immigrated ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 to France to get French citizenship.
Was better situatio n because people can do something for me  but - and my friends  Mr. Melamid  Mrs. Melamid  two sons  and some other family  pay the 20 dollars in gold and go there  and said  Oh well be free  and well go to France  and there we be change for prison of the war.
I'll never forget that  I have had the privilege of meeting some World War 2 veterans  some who were in Normandy and I was able to thank them personally  you know  for what they did for me.
>> Nat Shaffir: Then we realized at that point there's no future for us to stay in Romania.
We  because I remember  this was afte r the war  I remember reading and learning about the roads being bloc ked by refugees  and I learned then that we were part of that group of refugees.
And 1930 -- 39 start  you know  war  and my fa ther was more connected with Jewish people and special night before the w-war -- before the war -- ghetto uprising  because you know  we have two ghettos -- two uprising.
And in what ways did it contribute to your understanding of the Holocaust?
Well  uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall  the 11 Chief of Staff  several days before this a commun ication telling him that the report of Dean Earl G. Harrison was very critical of the American Army in Germany but on the 10th of August  the day after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi Weiss  he received a cable from Secretary of War Stimpson telling him that the report of Dean Ha rrison severely condemned the American Army  that something had to be done.
And he at one time indicated to me that while our main job was to fight the Nazis  if he survives the war he will have to settle a few accounts with some people  that he knew among his unit  you know.
And I think you caught it right   though  when you said th at  after the war  it was not yet a very cosmopolitan society.
Later on when the war was finished  thank God  we won the war  so I stopped working.
And he was to the war; he was in the Army.
thats when the deportations started  yeah  two weeks before the war.
And pretty soon  two months later  the Russians came and liberated us and the war was over f or us.
So anyway they are bringing us as prisoners of war and I said  \ Bessi tell him  tell him.\
Anyway  so the war ended in Augus t  and I put in for release  because of the medals and si the time Id served.
Well  in Headquarters 3rd Army we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops.
In fact his father had captured the Kaiser in World War I and became famous as a result  and that sort of propelled him into political life.
He to ld me that he goes on the Aliyah Bet  and in 1948 he was killed in the Negev  in the war of liberation.
Q. Did you ever decide to go back and keep any Jewish holidays or religious aspects or was that was just a thing of the past?
05:10:14 Here  we just thought  well  hope  hopefully they not going to finish us off  that we going see 76 the end of the war; we just hoped.
And we went to Vienna and my cousin  my  my husband met my cousin and we went to Paris where I jus t had a couple friends  no relatives and we went down to southern France and we went where we never did go to the village where we  we stayed during the war  we just  it was  we had picked the wrong time of year and it was so death  really hot  that we jus t couldn't take the heat and so that's one place we didn't go to but we traced all the other places I had lived and it was very important.
So was there any  that was during the Korean War  right?
03:27:01 Irene could you describe the period of time when it looks as if the war is going to be over  what we seem to be calling liberation.
Li thuanians are also victims  because their deportation to Siberia  the -- the -- the terrible historical period after the second World War  when Lithuania was still fighting for its independence  and of course it is a very controversial 80 moment.
He had no idea what was meant by a war crime.
You know  we were both 16 wh en the war broke out in Europe and 17 when Holland was invaded.
They were good people and they...the Vermark  I don't believe wanted war.
In 1945 already the war -- 4 >> Bill Benson: Anna  tell us  do you remember going into the ghetto?
He never was in Ge rmany before he was... After the war.
>> Jacques Fein: Well  basically once the war -- once Germany invaded France and Paris -- you know  Paris was ground zero for the Jews in France.
But what about the war and the Holocaust and what the Nazis did?
So that was  I don't know if I'm describing the difference  but uh  before the war  I  we had a very norma l household  we had  I went to school  I was the oldest  we had my  my parents were we were not ri ch but we were very comfortable.
The war already broke Sylvia Green 115 January 11  1996 Page 115 out  but it was at the beginning and thank God  the way she died  it was Passover  and she choked on a piece of matzo  and the whole thing was not even a split second.
Rabbi Stephen Wise had a refugee center where they put the refugees who came from Europe after the war  so I stayed there for a co uple of days.
And we l eft -- we didn't leave in May  we left middle of June  about eight weeks before the war broke out.
At one time during the war  when the Germans were rounding up Jews to be killed  they also tried to get them from the occupied countries.
He was going to have  and uh  at that time there was unwritten rule  and I've check ed it out after the war  this  there was someplace there was something in writi ng  and someplace there was nothing  I don't know the it was   but it was an accepted fact that any Jew or any worker  nonJewish  who worked in these labor camps  uh  who reached the age of 50 was not good enough for the war effort of Germany.
And then after World War I  Posen turned to be Poland.
The war would have ended one year earlier  had it not been for that mistake.
>> Bill Benson: So once Paris was liberated in August of 1944  your father pretty quickly made his way back to Paris and then came back to get the family later.
But h-his family owned some galleries in Holland  and so from Switzerland he went to Holland and when the war started he was not allowed to emigrate any more and he was deported with his parents to one of the c -- camps in the east and exterminated.
So after the war  when it was served  I couldnt eat them for awhile.
Speaking of education  you said that you didnt finish high school before the war.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: He came -- the story that he came to France before World War I  young man  15 years.
In the meantime  he comes back there  the war ended  we're in 34 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD Switzerland  he's able to go to the offices of this lawyer  Kostner  who is still in Hungary.
Sir  you said it th-the whole experience in Buchenwald and the other camps  did it change how you felt about the war  and why you were fighting it  and your role in it?
You see  Kosovo -- I dont know if you recall from history  the historical thing  in the -- 1480  I believe  the Turks massacred  you know  the Serbs in Kosovo  and they won the war  and they were sit ting then on yugosla -- on Serbia for 500 years.
And so I think in December of 1939  I was move What were you still in contact with your parents once war broke out in September?
To me it would have been the first time I would have gone to synagogue.
And then we got some compensation for it after the war  a ridiculous amount  I hate to mention it  it was just nothing.
I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started.
The 45th Infantry Division had a lot of casualties throughout the war.
I was going to say did you talk about the war?
They captured those people  they captured the people after the war.
Thank God there is not  an-and I hope that theyll never be war  I dont want them to go through anything like that again.
And what happened is this used to be barracks before the first war.
I: Now the mayor was the father of your good friend  is that right?
I dont know what they did befo re the war in it  but USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 11evidently things for economy   for a -- you know  whatever it is  from -- for Poland.
And he told me at that time that there wasnt hardly any Jews  he stay he was hidden during the war  or not hidden [indecipherable] didnt know people didnt kn ow he was Jewish.
And th ere was a young lady  who was a war bride and she came to America to rejoin her fiance.
And I fou nd out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the war is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self -preservation thing.
And when do you find all this out  if during the war you dont know anything?
So tell us about when you got to New York  there was a dinner or a party thrown for you before you're going back to Palestine to fight in the War of Independence.
After the war  he came back to Germany and the I.R.C. got him out of Germany to the United States  where  I think  he passed away here.
All these years  till the war is finished  we were living in the woods.
And you didnt think there was a war going on  to them.
In those days  when people couldn't take care of their kids or didn't have enough food and the war was going on  people would put their kids in a convent  which was like an orphanage.
No -- my -- and then came the -- the war.
He lived on  I think  Narutoviska Street before the war as did Sergei.
Somehow or other I feel guilty about being alive and him not being alive or  for instan ce  the event that the war was over  and Hitler does not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun Brown  right?
And as the war progressed  was the next signi ficant event then  would have been the German occupation?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 23 Well  I got to Denmark -- well  I was there from March of -- you know  before the war was over -- from March of ‚45 and I went for -- it was August of 1949  to Canada.
Interview with Jacqueline Hieminga August 9  2016 70 Is there anything else you would like to add to what weve talked about today  that you think people should know about  about your experiences during the war?
Was that an important part of your identity before the war?
But he couldnt find a -- a job as an engineer  but it -- the first World War -- Wo rld War broke out  and he went.
And in Turka it was a chaos  it was a war.
Since I mentioned that things were bad for the German army  and it seemed like they were losing the war and it was like toward the end  so at that time some Germans...civilians might have been a little kinder and maybe they helped some because of the fright of what may happen to them for what they did.
Now  having seen the unfolding history  and we see here is about the the death camps as well as the slave labor camp  it assumes a different importance basically  an an importance  because it it it its a war itself is bad  but that that  to evidence the cold bloodedness  and the and a-a-and th-the depravity of what this this remarkable nation Germany I say remarkable  its has a of Interview with Richard Peterson April 6  1999 87culture  of art and beauty and [indecipherable] all pluses  had sunk to.
Did the end of the do you remember when you how wh ere you were when the war ended  when you learned that the war was really over?
So  I figured the Jews they go anyway to the concentration camp  why should they keep them for prisoners of war.
T hen you were mobilized for the Six -D ay War.
There were telephones  of course not in great use but still.
Then we met in my doing after the war  he end in New York   so her son became a dentist.
And a couple days later my uncle had a bakery  and they Interview with Andre Zalc July 23  2009 4decide of going to fra of leaving Belgium because of the war.
And there was the 1967 War on Israel   do y I dont know if you remember Yes  yes.
My childhood up to the First World War  which started when I was 9 years old  was a nice one  a happy one.
My biological father and my mother were  first of all  Germans.
No  from a no  this was after after war  sh-sh I think she came in 19 fif 60 60? ‚
You know in San Francisco they met for the  to put  in the Un ited Nations  that help to settle the war.
They all had  the younger ones had less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children.
Then I had it  such a stor y I will not tell about this because the war started  I could not bring her.
So I accepted after the war  according to my father  she worked for the British Army.
But dont forget that I was 13 when the war broke out.
Because I heard in the radio that your -- your f -- brother is alive  and is a prisoner of war.
Yeah  he was in intern he went to Hungary where the Polish army was destroy  he went with the other ones through Hungary and then from Hungary to France  because at that time France was and then when France fell  they were very lucky to have a ge neral  a commanding general  Prugar-Ketling  a very nice Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 34Polish name  who led them from southern France to Switzerland and they laid their arms at the Swiss border  and they were all interned for the duration of the war.
So the very first organization that you founded or joined was what and when?
Through the Soviet -- was arrested by the Soviets and released when the war began -- when -- when -- when the -- Liberation?
When the ghetto came  of course  like everybody else  we ha d to move in the ghetto.
He spend the time of the civil war in Crimea and he saw what the -- really the Bolshevi ks are like  and he never joined the party.
All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in Germany after the war.
And then you went Passy to– Yes  to live  and we lived out the rest of the war there.
So that was the havoc of the transition from war to peace.
I felt that I had perhaps an unfair advantage because I was still in uniform  and if you come to apply to a school after six years of war in a commando uniform with parachute wings an d your medal ribbons  the chances are theyre gonna let you in if your work isnt terribly bad  I guess my work was not that terribly bad  although I remember sitting in a life class and the very prominent painter who taught that life class looked over my shoulder and said  how many times a week are you taking life class?
When you met your wife  did she have any idea of what your history had been during the war?
I mean this was like on the first or second day of the war.
Munich has in the decades after the war grew enough that it may not be exactly part of the city  but it's so close to it  considered so close to it.
This is when the war was going on  and shortly after when there -- first there was nothing to buy  and no material  no money  you know  and all that  but I rememb er always looking clea n and neat  and you know  the war was not a reason to not behave properly  and not to look nice.
There was anti -Semitism in that town after the war started because a lot of Romanian  especially the Iron Guard regime  they were anti -Semitic and were pretty much doing a lot of harm  pogrom s  killing one citizen against another.
Or so -- so  y -- generally even in Holland af ter the war  there were all kinds of new ec -- experiences or so  about food  or otherwise.
And you have to cover the full time for during the war.
He wanted to know what happened to our apartment  which had been -- he didn't know that but our apartment was occupied by German soldier or -- the whole war.
This what he always said  \ I stick with you till the end of the war.\

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 44 How did -- how did your experiences during the war affect the way that you sort of saw yourself as -- as a mother or an -- an -- you know  here in the United States  how did -- how did that -- you know  color the way that you -- HL: You mean  did our daughter know what happened to us  did we tell her what happened to us?
And the other thing is that 90 percent of my contempor aries were single children because their parents were convinced that therell be another war  and they didnt want to raise any more  you know.
Going back to the stadium at Nuremberg  going back to everything they ever built  which was always larger than the person  ev erything that Speer desi gned  which was going to be in Berlin  right after German y won the war was on a scale that belies imagination.
And she used to give me an extra piece of bread.
At home  did your mother keep house  or did she have help in in keeping house?
So  really  your -- your own development as a young woman  imagining your future was very much interrupted even before the war started -- Before the war  yeah. --
There's not too many educated people  not too many intelligent who understand it's a war a nd we're all going to suffer.
You know  the war was going on  you were finding shells here  you know  artillery shells and it was very dangerous to -- you know  sometimes a lot of them got killed in order to build a bomb -- to build the -- the -- what you call it?
As far as I was concerned  that they were Jewish friends and these were non-Jewish friends.
So after the war  I went back to my aunt  who survived.
The war was still go ing on that this was secondary to --.
He was so fearful that he burned the journal and it was the history of the entire war  day by day  from the time he left Warsaw.
Next we went to the Russians -- the Russians and the Americans were closing in from all sides.
So I really wanted they said they're going to take them to south of France away from the war.
We somehow -- I mean  I was actually the smallest eater before the war.
Well  one of the consequence of total war is that the Germans suddenly decided that they were going to get -- they ca -- whatever help they can get from whatever quarter.
Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8  1993 60 When I found out  yeah.
And he did succeeded  went east on his own  crossed the front line  reached the Russians line  and became a soldie r. And for the entire war in the Russian army  all the way to Germany  survived.
Did you have the sup port you needed from the State Department in war -- Yes.
So when we went in this factory  textile factory  we start to discuss during break what  how to sabotage the work over there because they produce for the war.
So it was very soo actually very soon after the war ended.
But that was the last war between the Russians and the Germans.
Yes  because I went there and looked at the street and the house in 1945 - 46  right after the war  and also from my parents stories.
The German cou -- you know  aktiones  like in other cities  they requested  lets see  right away  1000 inslawnie 2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain  you know  ravines and certain places right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war  and they killed.
I mean  it had nothing to do with the war  I was brought up  you know  parents  teachers  God  you know  all that is up there  and you dont question  and you do  and -- and respect  and when your parents tell you something  you do.
And they figured so they said   well  even if  you know  the war breaks out  well just stay neutral in Holland and we have nothing to worry about.
Did you  during the war were you in the Army or– Yeah  I was.
Because he succeeded to wriggle himself out from Poland while the war was still going on.
But as I said  the director explained to us  we didn't believe him  but thats what it was  the older gene ration decided it would be foolish to get into that war.
My older sister happened to have had escaped from Lithuania to deep Russia in the First World War  and she came back as a returnee.
And and then  of course  fin you know  the occupation  we were living in in under the Russian occupation for almost two years until the the Nazis began the war on on Russia   you know  so Did your mother ever tell you about what that was like?
Yeah  and war was kind of a relief for me when it broke out.
It was already before the war...I mean...yes  before the war it was a million people.
And  of course  war broke out September 1  1939 so all the Kindertransports were done by that time.
That you couldnt get the kinds of things that you could before the war.
And here I saw eh eh another row of eh eh eh defense and eh eh behind right behind the fense there were already about fifty Prisoners of War; Germans  officers and men  sitting in the ditch.
Did you ever talk to people about your war experiences during that time.
And I must say also  frankly  that I feel what happened in World War two  when Jews were not able to defend themselves  I didnt want my children to be in a position -- you dont know when its -- could happen.
And -- Let me -- let me interrupt you  you had this community  some of whom had a -- so-some of them were relatives  and -- and this is now  were talking 10 years or so  after the end of World War II.
So -- so what happened  is -- this was  of course  before the first war under the Czar.
Th-The people are drained fro m the war experience with the Germans  and now they have to confront the civil war  where literally brothers are fighting each other.
And thats where we had the Lipizzaner horse adventure  and thats when -- where the war ended.
Well  he told me that my older brother as a matter of fact  years a little while later  my older brother  like I said in the beginning  that he and his girlfriend he Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2  2010 35had a girlfriend in Budapest he found her after the war because they were liberated in December  I think  44.
You come with us  and some other people with whom we met there  so we went there  and he had a little house and he had a basement for I don't know what  maybe washing or...we didn't have washing machines...and he gave us that and he gave...uh there was a mattress  two mattresses  and there was a... PAUSE - BLANK IN TAPE USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 19 ...Russians liberated Budapest and if you could tell us how the end of the war appeared to you and what you did with your husband and your daughter at that point in time?
In fact  when the war start  we used to hire by them  a few of them  it wasn't too many.
It was mostly  in  maybe 3 one third of the population  about 100 000 at that time  maybe a few years before the war  there were 100 000 Germans living in Lodz.
Not so much  uh  because of the war and what the Germans did  but the...all the misery that we had seen  of everybody.
But at that time I was small  the war was going on  and nobody and never asked any questions.
Okay  so we I then I I started working and th stayed there for until January of 1953  by which time I have had enough of the war and of the army and well  there there happened to be a a there happened to be something that no none of us knew.
They...I think they landed on the...on September 1st or 2nd  befo re England had declared war but Germany had already entered...start military ope rations against Poland.
So that you see  that's what we had to live with then after the war.
There was earlier a good Macedonian tobacco that they us ed to have  but before the war  yeah  I used to smoke a little.
Did World War II  in some ways aside from the bombing  did it ever kind of come up in co nversation as to whats going on in Germany  whats going on in Interview with Joachim Baer March 1  2010 28 Oh yes  yes.
And Boison was sort of a mystery character in the war crimes program.
