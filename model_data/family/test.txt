They were  you know  about about the happiness they had shared  about uh my brother's birth and mine  about the hopes they had for us  and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which which has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love  of the commitment  of the of the family  and uh you know  when the going goes rough as it was in in subsequent times  it uh it was a very comforting thing and I shall always be grateful for that.
44 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: When did you learn about the rest of your extended fam ily?
And the Galops family by taking us into hiding was also a form of resistance.
So they put me with the Bocahut family in 1941 -42  and just to let you know  my birth family was family number one.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
Okay  and did you  di d you -- did your family attend services regularly?
>> Bill Benson: Because in order to get an education  which was very important to your family  you had to be in Nairobi for that  not on the farm.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 113 Im sorry  cause maybe I didnt quite pick up the whole story from the video tape  but just explain to me -- you had -- you had already left the family and were already working underground?
And we had a large family  and uh I have fond  fond memories of my youth  yah.
Shabbat   I had to go to shul with my father and we observed Shabbat.
Very happy family  very honest  very I cant tell you  never forget never I can t even tell you how I was so happy.
But that had to be subrosa because we had to hide it from my dad because the the outside effect that we were to give is that we were a Dutch family and uh he wanted to forget about ever having been German.
Was that one of the highlights of your day  to spend time with that family?
So  can you tell me a little about the personalities of your parents?
Were you aware of the scope of what was happening to the Jews in Europe?
>> Bill Benson : So it took until 1946 before your family was back together.
Back in the ghetto  people thought by doing some of those things maybe will help them and their family.
It seemed more better ever the choice to go to live with these friends in this family house as to live in this relatively big house.
It's wonderful to see your family right here in the front row.
He came from a religious background  but he was not a religious man at all.
And was there family in Belgium   or was it No  it wasnt  it was just families that took children.
The family was in part very pro-German  very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that France had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on Germany and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light...with a light-heart  light-heartedly  .
And we immigrate to Israel  my mother had a sister there  and th -- and her family and w-w-we -- we came to -- to Israel  we d -- live in Haifa.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- your mom  now you're with your mom.
I am very glad that you have afforded me this opportunity of thanking you from the bottom of my heart in my own name and in the name of my entire family for all you have done to save my sister-in-law's life to whom I am forwarding this letter  your letter  so that she can write to you also.
And every Jewish family  of course  wanted to have their son finish middle school.
So she lived with us at that time and she went through that day of being caught and she made it through  too  because we couldn't show that she wasn't  was not our family so that was fine.
I lost family  I lost  I lost grandparents  and aunts  and uncles and cousins.
We came to a loving family that could not do enough for us.
I you could not the first time that we could dro could write to th e family  was when I was already published in film culture  and and al ﬁ Iskusstvo Kino  ﬂ in Moskva knew about the magazine  and used to visit me in New York   and and asked also to write for ﬁ Iskusstvo Kino .ﬂ How do we translate that into English?
It is a family there was a family  I mean  nobody is alive anymore a Christian family that came to settle in Starac howice at the time when the revolution in Russia broke out.
And the   who came to get them  he knew very well this family.
But somehow  you know  somebody was always watching out  looking outside if any...there was any Hungarian...uh...official or the gendarmes or the...uh...police anywhere nearby so that other people in the family or in the house could listen to the radio and could listen to the news and what was happening everywhere.
So  then they prevailed through the Ezra Committee to have me stay with a family in Luxembourg where about a half or dozen or more people were also staying waiting for further disposition of their situation.
We didnt talk to them for five years but was his daughters wedding and the daughter were in Florida at the time and the daughter came and said to meŠcame purposely to Florida to talk to us that she considers us like family Šand my–biggest gift will be if I come to the/her wedding.
So -- so now your family -- and tell me the year when you moved to -- to Friedberg  tell me also about you going to school in -- in Friedberg.
Well I think it had to do really wi th my fathers attitude that his family was the best in the world and nobody could compete.
The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes to let the Germans go on  so to say  building fortresses along the west coast to protect against a possible allied invasion and Denmark was suppos ed to be kind of supplying people for the Germans so the last part of the agricultural produ ction went to the German army and the last part of the industrial production went to  so Denmark as a matter of fact became kind of unwilling  but still partner to the German war effort   one has to admit that  but this  sorry yes... Let me ask you about the Jewish community a nd your family in particular.
In the fall of 1942  Marcel and his family were forced into the Drohobych ghetto.
We didnt -- because we said   first Ill finish school and then well have a family.
The economic times got better for us as a poor family.
So  there was a little talk about the family  but I don't really remember much of that.
But for some reason going there and finding out these horrible things makes me -- it objectifies it in such a way that I can kind of live with it sort o f. And you think this is a result of your family history?
So were these people were they did they change a lot  or did you have people come help her and and th-that became pa rt of the family?
But they would go and find out who are my friends  what's my family  they went in the ba ckground.
Yeah  but With his family  but wa s allowed to go back to Poland to visit his sister?
I knew much about Indonesia because so much of my family and my brother  so many had b een there.
Theres only one family  close to the railroad station  that tell us well  if you have to leave  come over  we want to give you dinner before you go on the train.
And  in the photograph it was three young girls  and two little boys  one of them were myself  and and bres to another boy like this  sitting the front  and three girls standing in the back .
>> Bill Benson: Would you say  Kurt  that in the time before Hitler came to power that your family enjoyed a relatively comfortable life?
Did you speak Polish and Yiddish in the house  or -- In the house  Yiddish.
She and four of her siblings and her mother and father were alive until the day when the Americans -- and they were in Theresienstadt  and the day when the Americans came in  the Nazis took trucks and ran over her family and everyone was killed except she.

Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 3 And then when did they begin a family?
Were you -- and -- were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?
My mother and her family came from the little town where I was raised  but they were very Viennese.
But we had  the building was ours  not ours but the Loki ec family.
And um...he was very close to...to his family  to his brothers and sisters.
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
Do you know why your family chose to go the direction it went?
And and our family just lived in that envi ronment and starting in '44  everybody starts saying OK  now now uh when the war comes in  how do we survive  because everybody knows that uh when the front comes over uh the German s are going to come in and then all the bets are off.
And he said to him  Im going to register my family  cause I want to get out.
The entire family  on his side  was in New York  except his mother and father.
My sister  with her family  she was studying in Leningrad with us.
Yes  my -- I grew up the religious family  but that was a way of life back home  my dad  we didn't work on Saturday  went to synagogue  my mother would prepare all the foods on Friday.
So  this particular case  whenever they met a Jewish family  there were many Jewish families in this area here  especially poorer Jewish families because it was at that time before the war restrictive  not so  no quality housing  I would say to put it mildly.
And did you have a large extended family in Edinburgh when you were growing up as a child?
We had many people there in our own family too that we re involved with Yi ddishkeit not Jewish historical  but the Yiddish language and the Yiddish literature.
>> Rae Goldfarb: My mother stepped right in kept the businesses going b ecause a lot of the family were employed in the business  too.
And so she had been asked by my father to get in touch with me  bring me news of the family  and to urge me to go and see them as soon as 69 possible.
>> Bill Benson: So your mother and family learned all of this at the same time.
Would you say that your your family was a well-to-do family?
The Germans were rounding up the Jews in this building and one of the neighbors  downstairs neighbors  pointed out to the chimneys to the Germans Uncle Farber with his two daughters  and that's how he was killed and my family hid under the floorboards.
I was a idealist once upon a time  but when you have a family and when you want something more of your life and I thought I had enough of -- o-of bad things in my life.
I was not much interested in the ba background of my f you know  family; father  mother.
Did your mother have any help at home in taking care of the family  and the household?
They had after your uncle was taken  they returned to you and your father?
They were living in little houses  they were living in one or the other.
And that apartm ent had probably seven or eight rooms so each room had another family.
They I didnt Would you say that from your mothers side of the family  her family was well to-do  because of this business?
But h-his family owned some galleries in Holland  and so from Switzerland he went to Holland and when the war started he was not allowed to emigrate any more and he was deported with his parents to one of the c -- camps in the east and exterminated.
But he was afraid that if he's going to take off  they're going to kill all his family.
Many years later we met the Erinches  that is to say we met their son and daughter-in-law and family.
What happened is when th e word came that maybe -- that the Germans may wind up and enter the -- the -- Austria  thats when he felt that he better transfer some of the -- the money  the family money  as a matter of fact  to Paris  to the bank  which is -- was the main branch there.
before the war and you did say some thi ngs about it in the first interview  but we didnt get your -- we didnt get the names of your family  your parents and your sister.
And so I took a I I I ge I got this  and it was I was one of the winners  and I took a postdoctoral fellowship for two years at Columbia   and at that time Irene and I and I havent said anything about my family life  but I will Yes.
And at the emanici emancipation  each one picked a different family name.
I think you told me that you could trace family living there in that area as far back as the 1700s.
So then  the the three male members of your family leave together in the January of 39  your father  your uncle and your brother?
There was one family actually he happened to be one of the wealthiest people  who were not very helpful.
I always thought to myself  I have to see guy and he's going to give me back my family?
They were fortunate for the moment because Shuls  one of their sons  one of my fathers brothers  and his family lived nearby allowing them to help his parents through thick and thin.
So hes separated from the rest of the family for quite a while.
We would have had -- our family would have been togeth er  but that was not to be.
We we  I guess we  that hap... that was the case of for our kids  all during the time in Sweden that again my parents arranged for a secure family life.
Well  tell me a little bit about your brother  and what your relationship was like in Vienna.
As soon as we started  we waited to see who is coming home from the family.
So while I was with this family  I actually saw my mother every six weeks for three days.
His family was in Russia   except for a brother  who eventually moved to America  they were all in Russia.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
And there are about twenty-some people of my immediate family that are on this side and  altogether they are ab out fifty people in the picture probably.
So w ealthy Jews in Croatia  being they were not organized  each one took a family in the house for boarding and sleeping.
My father was Orthodox  my mother came also 3 from a religious family  but not as Orthodox.
So I was there and so  you know  they have some peoples in the ghetto  but 16 Kolonia Rozyczka 21 they have family in Warsaw and they was young peoples  and they ask me if I want to bring them to the ghetto.
I took the violin  and I went back to my parents  which were held in that school.
Did you have other friends or other neighbors who were not Jewish?

Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 10 In her family  German and Russian were the language.
But that someone  a family lived in this community that had shared some of that history that their own families and ancestors had experienced over their lifetime.
Yes  they had some friend  some family were there in Bialystok  Grodno was real strange for them.
They were -- you know  they were part of his estate.
We're all advancing in age very quickly and I decided maybe it was time for me to put this on the record for us  for my family.
We learned that th at judge who lived in  who we traded apartments  was a special person and his family was very  very unusual.
A few weeks later he showed up with a ration card for four which in a way  gave us another loaf of bread every two days  another five liters of kerosene once a week.

We were supposed to be staying there temporarily because it was not a proper -- not proper -- its not a good place to have three more people in the house  and especially three Jews  because there were seven children  it was very dangerous for the whole family.

But Ive also submitted the family history to Yad Vashem and hopefully in the near future  they will also be honored at Yad Vashem.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
Because it could have ended badly  not only for me  but for also for my family  and and we dont know how far that would have gone.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
And then I just moved to a family that rented out rooms.
He wa s so attached to us  he was like a member of my family.
He belongs to the Hash omer Hatzair  Jewish organizations which go every year the young children go he never wanted to go  but When did you hear about the members of your family  about what happened to them?

One of the instances happened when all the men of our family were away on the work details and my mother was  that particular day  off and my grandparents  my grandmothe r was taking care of me when the German guards came in and surrounded a quadrant of the ghetto  and took us out for another selection.
>> Bill Benson: So  Jill  here's your father and your two uncles interned in Holland.
And Jew -- they were not -- they -- they be not -- that doesnt -- I ma -- I -- it was family and we talked about our -- we -- we filled all our holes in our memories about our parents and grandparents and that.
And  had your family been in Semeniıkiai for many generations  or had they moved there from someplace else?
16 So your family remained a unit... The family remained as...the two families remained as a unit.
So that must have been very depressing for the family [indecipherable] Well  it -- it was -- you couldnt e -- the problem is you couldnt even mourn because you had to be concerned well -- to do with -- you know  with yourself.
All I know is I all suddenly found myself in this little Swiss village with a farm family.
It was a very big g -- group of people what went to Sobibor  so -- and then -- if also -- after the war  everybody wrote us letters  and they want to know  ovwy the family was and if we know the family.
And then -then I was trying to get myself together  started to think about my family right away.
So  the other part was  while we had so many fighting groups  really  no one cared to provide the family camps with provisions  even food or clothing.
I have a wonderful family and grandchildren  daughters  son-in-laws  and its a very  very well family.
>> Bill Benson: In September 1939  the Soviet Union and Germany attacked Poland which really begins World War II.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 162 And what do I do?
My husband would come home  and we were again living a normal family life.
and that helped  you know  I had -- I had a family to go to  you know  and -- and so forth.
From the very first day of their occupation  your family and your community were immediately subjected to profound upheaval.
And  di di I already asked you this question  an-and the answer is no  but but to see these Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 132 two pieces together  does that complicate your your view of your family life at all?
My aunt and four children and my uncle  they went to Palestine in 1932.
Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20  2009 25 so all of the food and coats that you were being sent out  those are being sent from the family of the forced laborer?
What uh  what was the physical condition of your family and the Graumanns and the Janssens  at the time of liberation?
Her father  again  was fairly prosperous before World War I  but then  with the German troops advancing into Latvia  decided to flee to Saint Petersburg  and somehow during the war and revolution  managed to lose all his money  so he came back almost penniless  and somehow the -- the family never recovere d  th-they lived rather modestl y. Okay  about my childhood  yes  2 in the early years  we lived in a -- in a comfortable apartment  my brother and I each had a -- a governess  and as -- which was the custom in those days.
It was an apartment at -- we had one floor  my aunt and grandmother ha d another in the same building.
My mother was very orthodox and come from a very orthodox family; and my father was not orthodox.
Thats was the will to live  to see my family and this  and thats what kept me alive.
So  your mothers pare your mothers family  how did that show itself  the trouble that they had?
And there were other members of the family that were incarcerated  and they say her  shes crazy  saying that there are good Germans.
But then a couple of weeks 39 later in front of a movie house  I met the girl reunited with her family.
Were you or your parents aware of Nazi -- Oh  yeah. --
My memories are very  very hazy about family before the war.
About doing this so we could have it as -- in a family file.
I know somebody in our family had to earn a living and I was the logical candidate at that time.
And its quite a large family thats down there and theyve done very well.
Did he ever ask you those questions directly  about what had happened to your family  or did he -- Yeah  we -- we were telling them  but we told them -- we were telling them in a nice way.
So it -- your family being in the United States  was that the crucial thing that made you come to the United States  rather than going to Israel?
I consider myself a survivor thanks to that family that took me in.
And of course I was very  very happy to see him.
And so your father  your uncle  your your aunt  and your brother were there all together.
This is tape number one  side B  and you began -- you had begun to tell the story of this family.
Also -- And then -- So who were -- who were your re-relatives that were living in Israel already?
Uh  it was not a small family; but everyone survived  uh most with an interesting story to tell.
Your family had lived outside of the ghetto before this time.
I take it that that all of the boys in the family were dressed through him?
And we had  there was  we had at least one family of Indians  not Native Americans  but from India.
I ev en didnt want to do it  I dont -- didnt want to leave my family and my friends and th -- I never thought about that.
He didnt shoot  who had come to say that the family had to stay together.
One experience I remember is that when I was in hiding in the second -- with the second family  maybe a year into that  so lets say that 19 - 1943 - 1944  at one time I realized I dont understand that I -- I  or any -- or my mother  my brother  had to go through this .
And I left with when I came to Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 82Poland   I was looking for my family  so I will in Krakow again.
His family of course  they were all in America but  and th is one friend I was rea lly close to  she came also to America and I had contact with her.
In the second book  Im writing everything about this family  the whole life.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know how they explained your presence in their home?
So he was very good friends with the family of the Bestform.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 30 Well  it -- yes  yes and no  you see.
And then your family kind of liked you in a different way.
All I want to know  di d somebody from my family  my cousins  did survive  look for meﬂ. She said ﬁnobodyﬂ and she slammed the door in my face.
pause) So you lost members of your family at that time? (
I never met his wife  but the very evening when we arrived in New York and went to the family where I told you the young man who comes still  who is now 80 years old  he got stuck in Cuba.
Laughing) But the house where my family comes from was built in 1210  and is still standing--miraculously--in Eisenberg or Poleberg .
>> Margit Meissner: Well  the family that mother had found was a very nice family  had youngsters my age who were very welcoming.
We lived with a family  an older lady and her adopted daughter and I would help them -- help the older lady in the kitchen sometimes  because we would sometimes provide the food for them .
After she told me the name  I said  \ You know  this name sound to me so in my ears  I think I know so mebody in your family.\
Now in all the families  you have such a large family  did any members leave Hungary and emigrate either to Israel or to America or to some other country?
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone  who was left in your household with you at that time?
Now  you see  my family was -- let me put it this way  my wifes family was very religious.
I can't tell you general  because everybody every family has their Shabbat.
So he sent word out to New York that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple down to Savannah and get them lodging  if the the man in the family would take over the running of the pawn shop.
Q. Your father and part of y our family returned to Lodz?
Especially when you are young you were so tight in the family.
You mentioned that your family moved to Romania when you were young.
But that was mainly because he was not the family was very small.
Then we went to where we had to move to the house where only Jews lived.
Before we turn to that time  tell us about your first few years  about your family  your life  what it was like before the war really hit to your community.
My aunt  my uncle  my aunt's mother  and their two sons.
Then when the war was over  he came back for me and he said he wanted  would I like to come back and live with his family and I said  \ oh\  and he said well  mother and I -- I think that's how he called her -- mother and I talked about it and we have the sons but we need a girl.
On the road somebody picked me up on a bicycle  brought me to her parents  and from there on based on that authorization that my father wrote just before he was taken to Majdanek I was given to this family who had these exemptions  the yellow/white exemptions.
Tell me about how many aunts and cousins a nd what kind of -- what was the size of this family you were moving into?
Well  we lived with an uncle of ours  my father's brother.
And so I asked her if she would be willing for me to interview her Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14  2010 118using the family album.
It was not in the middle of the organization  but he used to come to our kibbutz  what we called  and I told him  \ You know you are the man that took my family.\
Not I  but my family  but my parents were always there  I was -- no question in my mind who - you know  who was the help  and who were my parents  those -- al-although I loved all my -- most of my nannies.
In the town  the little town that my father is from  there were five people and a boy that was shot in the house that one of these people owned but apparently the family that lived there gave them a room.
And -- So  y-you had a very promi -- you were in a ve ry prominent family  yes?
Talking to someone whose grandparents we-were involved in -- in my -- in my life  and talking about a German Jew  who went through almost the same as the European Jew.
So that you were in the hut together with I forget the fa na family name.
So we -- two or three members of the family lived in the very top floor of the house  which we didn't have to use  and we took over the rest of the house so that we didn't feel that we were kind of being part of an action to take the property away from the family.
My mothers family certain was more  they were not Hasidic  but they were more observant.
She got sick  the family  the family was still alive over there in Wegrow  they took her home.
And she is the only one of the family  that family  who never married.
In terms of the ages of your brothers and sisters  were you little  were you young?
So in 1940  I believe it was  my entire family along with the rest of the town Jewry were corralled into a ghetto.
6 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Susan Warsinger: Well  many changes happened in my family after the Nazis came into power.
They have more strength than to lose because they didn't have enough food to eat -- the other couple kids was -- your family had seven kids  too.
Yes  anyway  so i -- th -- my -- my two cousins  my mitha -- my mother and their father were sister brother  so that makes it -- make us first cousins.
Finally  took me a -- a day to go -- go different parts and different places to find my uncle and his family.
When you were growing up  was was the town uh mostly a Jewish town or a non-Jewish town?
Snyders  what they helped us when we came and they help us until... until today; and the Jewelers family and Brunners  and I want to thank you to Canada and Toronto  family Perlmutters.
And will you tell me something about your -- your parents  and ge -- lets start with your father.
And by that time  some other members of th our family  were either had left  or were in the process of getting Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 19 ready to leave.
Then once he -- he built a -- a bunker i-i-in the basement of this building and h-he -- he hid us there and then the German found out about the place because somebody told him that my father is hi-hi-hidd ing th-the -- the kids  the family  because my mother was there too.
You said there was a point after your family was taken away where Jewish policemen asked you a question and that indicated to you that he knew about your activities.
My father used to raise money among the other Jewish families to help them.
You have nothing to lose.ﬂ \ You run away.ﬂ I said  \ How can I run away?
They had the religious Jewish people living in one part of the town but my father belonged to the non-observant ones.
And just like our barracks  I mean  if you look at them  they were just these dingy  gray on the outside barracks  in which each family got a room  essentially.
And I only got...now started to live a normal life last 10 years and being able to talk about it freely and...uh...so people...maybe other people can know what's happen to my family.
And were you the youngest again  or were there other children?
27 Was there something in your upbringing  in your family life that gave you this?
I dont really remember a lot about my mother in those days and I certainly do not remember my father.

Now  I couldnt -- I -- I -- I thought about the people who were killed  but I also thought how my brother feels  because he lost the same family  but he also lost a wife and three children.
Yes  I had several friends and and and one  especially one whose parents were also friends of my parents.
My family was quite wealthy and they sort of isolated me from normal life.
My parents and and the rest of the family  but my my mother and my father  of course.
You mentioned your mother a little earlier and whats your  when you m eet up with her and see her  do you  do you usually talk about your family hi story at this point?
I got a job at RCA in New Jersey and later started a family.
I had about probably four or five family members who were really family.
No  there  and a few reasons for it  number one  first of all  pe ople like to marry someone who  with whom they can converse  I mean  who is on their level a nd maybe even intellectually  culturally and so forth and when I came to New York  my wife ha d an aunt there who knew this 57 family  you see.
No  I-I-I-I think -- I mean  my aunts were loving  loving aunts  and I had a loving family.
Can you give me some idea of the dates  as well as you remember them  the periods of time that were involved  and when your family actually moved into the ghetto if you remember the month?
You see we were not materialistically  we were not rich or we were not -- I guess my family was part of the in tellectual group in the to wn so our life has not changed much.
I had a older sister  two years older than I am.
So what are some of the stories that your mother would tell you about her own family  given that shes descended from royalty?
>> Bill Benson: Nat  do you know when your family realized the  or learned the full magnitude of the Holocaust and what happened to your extended family?

So the officers among themselves  from time to time they used the name So they had a picture okay  so   in their apartmen t  you the the Brandt family had Griffarts on the wall.
What efforts did your family make to find relatives and friends in Europe?
But the colleagues -- I still ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 remember my father's colleagues.
Then my father and sh e met and married and left to live in Zagreb  and thats how I happened to have been born in Zagreb.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 >> Suzy Snyder: But your mother's family did not suffer during this Pogrom.
And he was a refugee with his family in Zagreb and they were very Orthodox and he told me about -- they had a separate synagogue  they had the separate -- it wasnt a synagogue  it was a separate place where they went to pray or they had that -- I had no idea these people existed.
In my case  I did make some changes in my life especially not continue to be in the engineering profession but something to pick up the roots of my family  namely wine making  and have fun.
And he started 34 giving me what I call etcha petcha metcha   which means well you know there was some anti-semitism and there were the German Bund here and it wasn't so easy  and I said did you chain yourself to the gate of the White House as a protest because your brother and you family was being exterminated.
I succeeded in business and have a nice family  three children  grandchildren.
We were in  we were well off in Poland  didn't have to worry about anything and until it came the day that it started that... Tell me about your family.
Now  all of the people who didn't live in the ghetto area before -- Uh-huh. --
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
That was probably big property of someone that maybe was killed  or and the family was killed  or or ran away  because many Russian people were running away from tsars during that uprising that was in Russia at the same time.
Did you then move in with him  did you have an apartment together or something?
So were you giving some to your family  or -- No  I wasnt living home.
And so we really ha d a very nice family life  yes.
I have a Jewish mother  I have a Jewish father  and obviously I was Jewish.
And I was scared  so Ericas family  she had a sister and mo ther  father; they were very nice people  I liked them  and I liked Erica.
And they went to them  to this Catholic family  and they kept them three days.
And my family  in meantime and my father was shochet there  too  in Paris.
In our family they believe we don't want to live anyway without each other.
>> Peter Gorog: I came from a Jewish family  both sides.
My mother's was two sisters and three brothers  so we had a big family.
03:17:42 But for the ones in the ghetto that still had children  every day meant something and Gens kept on saying  ﬁIf we live through this period  maybe we can still live through the liberation.ﬂ I began to appreciate it many years later when I had a family and children.
150 One of the -- one of the sadnesses of these stories are how hard it was to become reunited with a broken family.
Tell me something Miles  or Shmoil  when you went back -- I now dont know exactly what to call you  when -- when you went back to Tomashev  and you realized that your family is gone  and the town  essentially is a cemetery -- 105 It was a very painful moment -- Did you -- -- very painful moment.
There was a friend of my father's  not family  who uh sort of picked me up and uh very dear friend of my father's.
Uh there were those who were  I remember th ere was one family  an elderl y lady with her grandaughter  and that was all that was left of the family.
So the whole family by th at point was in hiding.
Tell us what happened when the Germans came in and why they came in.
Our family has you know  is a family that had many Jewish clergy in it.
So your father was the only member of your family that you worried about?
What do you know about your father's decision to leave that early  and why he went without the rest of the family?
My mother and father worked six days a week and I came home by myself after s -- after school  because within a year they had saved enough money t-to -- we moved to -- above a grocery store further up New York Avenue  Jewish family owned  it was one of those Mom and Pop stores and we lived in an apartment upstairs and of course we took in a roomer in the apartment.
So thats kind of right now my relationship with -- actually the -- only now with the children of my rescue family.
But  but your mother never recounted to you why she  why her family had left.
And two greatgrandchildren are on the way  and our family is growing.
So I went with my brother and my father  a couple of uncles.
He always had a little notebook of some kind and I still can picture him sitting there and on some straw that we had put on the ground  making notes to himself and I uh dragged in one of my best finds uh a soldier who had gotten so excited at finding a a little urchin that spoke English and turned out to be a Jewish urchin  that he had come  had to absolutely come and see the rest of the family.
I -- I feel that he is -- he lost all his family.
She had left a child for safe  safekeepi ng with a Lithuanian family.
There is no way that a family would be able to survive  so I ma de the decision that I'm going to go to Grodno.
She had a a a a very Hassidic cousin and an extended family.
Both sides  one side of the family was extremely into art and one into music.
But I just don't remember talking too much as to what had happened.
In the old days  there was always a -- a nucleus and a f -- and a -- an extended family within one geogr aphic area.
My father had one brother  and my mother had oh  three sisters.
But they were very  very close  as a as a family.
I had only one sister and a small family were in it.
Did your grandparents live in a neighborhood that was predominantly Jewish?
I knew my family couldnt afford to send me to college.
At that time uh the family I had in Eu rope uh were my fathers brothers who uh lived in Romania and were still there.
It was some months later  though  before war directly affected you and your family when the Soviets occupied your hometown of Vascauti in Romania in 1940 .
In 1921 my whole family was in this country...my father  my mother  my two brothers and then in June 1921  my mother decide to go back to Poland and after she arrived in Poland  two months after  on July 31st  I was born in Poland  so that's my... Where in Poland?
So in 1960 when he came to visit us in Israel  he told us the whole story what happened to the family  to our family.
Uh I had the...I invited...my family was invited to that retirement party and uh I really cherished that thought.
There was a large family before the war; your family were your friends.
Some time before that   the Nazis came looking for my family.
My mother worked to support us  and I did the housework.
So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the ghetto.
Probably English  probably English  becau se I remember this business of my grandmother would walk in and it was like subconscious  Id switch to German  but I think to Daddy -- and in those days all the refugees I knew and my family also  we were very careful not to speak German in the street.
Yeah  then we you know  I stayed with a family that hadnt had any children  and I was th I had the roommate  who was a refugee from Poland   thats we lost total track.
You mentioned that your family was Or thodox  can you tell me specifically what religious traditions your family observed?
Not that weve been yes  well  we had a my father had a sister who also perished or it was my mother  I think it was my mothers sist sister.
I think that parts of the family were associated with the Hasidim.
But to me she is that child  that beautiful 13 year old lean child who evidently knew nothing but fear and love in her - this enormous love for the family and this fear of what Hitler's era did to her and the war came.
My family lives here already for  my ancestors came here in the 1600's.
She had been a maid with a Jewish family in Frankfurt who left  and she was extremely fond of them  and then was very happy with us too.
My brother was married  my older brother  and he was with his wife and my mother and myself.
Bu t we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas  it meant it was for our family.
At Tochow there used to live a sister of my mother  with her family.
>> Bill Benson: When your father lost his job and walked out  what did he do to support the family after that?
I went into the toilet  threw out all my pictures of my family  of my brothers  whatever I had with me  my parents  all documents under the name of Tenenboim  all my passports  and my documents th at I had and I had to destroy because I was sort of a deserter from this pa rticular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim.
The Fein family was family number four when I was 10.
So I -- my family didnt send it to me  so the Joint Distribution  they gave out -- what th ey did  they didnt give out individual affidavits  they made a group  lets say hundred people and one affidavit  and the organization took care to show the government that we will not later stay in the -- in -- in -- and not to make a living.
And I think thats another reason that you know as a family weve always been close because it ends up that fam ily is  ends up being the most important thing.
One of my family  my older brother which was younger than I am  but he was the older of the brothers  he got rewarded and he went for seven days there.
Because I knew a lot of religious people who– like in Sandys family maybe they didnt eat in their home   but they would go out and eat stuff that they really shouldnt.
No  I was going to ask you why  because ofte n  certainly in my family  the anger at the Polish population is sometimes more severe than to the Germans.
And often we had the same dresses  but then we had to be different so that nobody knew that there are three people of a family who wanted to have eggs or meat or bread  I dont know any more what all  we had to stand in line.
And there were two families living only in the two bedrooms and there was another one unoccupied.
So I stayed as an au pair with a family in Cambridge  Massachusetts.
She was an -- I should have brought a picture  because I do have pictures of her.
Oh  I really dont know very go What did your family make their living My my father was a builder.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 >> Bill Benson: And you knew.
Our family was already in big trouble because our father not only lost his business and couldn't provide but now he physically was removed from us without any kind of knowledge that he'll be taken care of or that he will come bac k. So my mother was distraught.
But much smaller than ours beca use they just didn't have a big family but we had a la rge apartment.
>> Bill Benson: The question is when you were with the Bocahut family  do recall playing with any other children outside of the family.
Did you talk to your siblings about what happened to you?
So he went to the archives in Philadelphia to see if there was any family who could help.
We had nothing to do with the family that was taking care of us.
12 - fif - 25 grams of bread  then they rationing and so much little -- margarine for each family and little -- I think it -- they have -- it -- it was over here  what they call it  like oh  Jello type  little Jello  if you want I should  yeah.
So we we left we le ft as a family and we arrived here.
So what do you remember about the actual beginning of the war in 1939?
My daughter  later on  when she moved up to -- near Peekskill  across the road was another family  a young family  and th -- and she was a daughter of a hol -- of hol -- two Holocaust survivors.
So  what she did they got married  and then he said  ﬁWell  now well go to Libau.ﬂ So  my mother was under the impression that he would stay in Riga and m ove in with the rest of the family because she was not interested in going to Libau.
I only recall that uh uh...I told you my sister was...came to us  and afterwards she went to uh a peasant family.
He was telling about his family  he says he had a wife  he has grown children.
So he was the head of that whole family  with my mother and I and luckily her sister  who was sent to live with us.
Now  you know what I was thinking  given the relationship of your mothers family to your father  does this mean that when they got marri ed there was no dowry  which would have been traditional  because they didnt go to the wedding  I gather.
I didnt have any grandparents or cousins  or people from her side that she could relate to.
>> Bill Benson: And then you were born  of course  a year later.
So  we had we had to manage cour se  we had to live on the re the savings of the family  and it was very hard.
Yeah  with their family printe d on it with a long letter of what had transpired during the year of what they had done and what they had accomplished and where they go.
Even though you were there two or three weeks  what was it like for you and your family in the ghetto?
My great uncle brought them over  and eventually also my father's next younger brother  and my mother and I jo ined the family in New York in 1940.
Yes  Im Jewish  obviously  yes  and from th e same  from the same type of family.
Of course  you know  I met the family  but wh at did I do here?
What did happen to your parents  and how did you learn about it?
Before we turn to life under the Nazis and your family leaving Germany  let's start first  tell us a little bit about your family and you in the years before Hitler came to power.
There was Pesach in our family which my father could not conduct but we had an uncle who did know the ritual and he usually conducted the Seder.
And of course  you know  I would like to know more about  you know  how -- what my family did  or I -- you know  I -- especially my mothers side of the family  there is nobody living to know about their childhood and I know nothing  and I have lots and lots of pict ures  and I always kne w that I -- I always know that I knew more about them  because my uncle lived there  too  and so I knew about them.
So my aunt  my uncle  the whole family stayed behi nd.
And  uh  he tried to explain that I had other family  my father was in the United States and they would find him  and all that.
What happened to you when the war broke out  how did you find out.
So I  and it's not  & RG-50.549.05*0001 57 they are still not what you would call a truly mi ddle class family  that most of them still stayed in  you know  auto mechanics and this a nd that  that part.
And my uncle  see I had a few relatives who left Hungary 25 years before that.
He said  \ Well  we have a pa ckage here for the Buergenthal family.
Lets turn back now to your family  and your immediate family in Marseilles  and your father is released  and your mother is tried and found guilty  and then gets another lawyer  and is acquitted.
And then -- >> Bill Benson: Your family had been there for a long time?
She eventually died at about 92 or 93  she had always been in the family.
Tell us what that meant for your family  including your grandfather  Aizik  for them to move you so quickly into the ghetto.
Let's start with you telling us about th e prewar years  about your family  your community  your life before the war began.
We had formed a Boy Scout group  and our scoutmaster  Boy Scout master was the Schraeder   a Schraeder family that owned a hardwood store there in Durango.
Tell me a little bit about your family and about your life in Freiburg.
I recognized I was still unprepared  I was obviously unprepared for freedom and selfsufficiently  and I was driven only to contact my relatives in the United States in the hopes that my brother might have survived and and when the family was separated back in early 42 my father uh instructed us all of us to contact to contact our relatives in Europe because this is how we will find each other.
After a while  one of the sons of the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization  anti -fascist movement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over there to him.
My sister and I used to go into the city everyday to get our ration stamps on our real names and one time the citizens who were handing 6 out the ration stamps...the German s were looking for something or other  and they put us in the back of the old school until the Germans disapp eared and then I don't know exactly how...before the Germans uh came to arrest the family and I think...I can't...don't know how my parents found out.
Like they say there was killing in -- in -- they killed a Jewish family once in awhile.
And my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious  very religious people  and my grandmother had 16 children but only four survived because...uh...the children were...died in the infancy  and after 12 children died  she..there was...uh...folklore in our family telling us that she went to a very famous rabbi and the rabbi told her that he...that if you wanted your children to live  you have to dress them only in white.
But they were separated from their family  their children  their husband  who sa y  if you didnt -- if you stayed at home and you took care of me and the children  you did not have to worry about that.
It was probably more because of my frequent ear infections that influenced that kind of sheltered life than having grown up in a middle class family.
I have an envelope for you from your family in Poland.
And she brought a little bottle of perfume for me as a gift for letting her family know that her brother was still alive.
Every time the Germans attacked the forest  the ambush or otherwise  the big forest or small forest  the family camps were the first prey that they attacked.
I had a lot of trouble with that car  but I kept it running just to get better dates and which it happened to me and but the thing is this  I still I was sitting in the car one time  I never forget  and I said  enough is enough  I say  I should settle down and start living a family life.
Interview with Norman Miller April 15  2013 92 Do you see family traits in your children that you also saw in your parents  and other members of your family?
Maybe you didnt go back because you didnt have any family there anymore?
Okay  what Im interested in is what is happening with you and your family in this environment.
We were living in an attic apartment with my maternal grandparents  my m om's parents.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
Interview with Adi Eisenberg 6 August 29  2014 Then your family moved?
Can you tell me what kind of can you tell me a little bit about your family?
My aunt who looked quite Jewish  she was wearing some kind of you know Your father's sister?
And then wi all of the whole family  like my mo I remember my grandmother was there and my fathers brother also lived there  and they had ma ny children  like at least four or five children.
How many si did she have sisters and brothers in her family?
Well  that is interesting too  because at at any number of times  in the history of this Zekanym   Delvecchio   DeLugo family  you have first names that sound Catholic.
Do you feel you lost a part of your childhood since you were so young?
Stay in Poland and if you hear that somebody of the family is there  they always let you in  the Russians.'
So her little boy and her hus band came to Birkenau  and somehow  they found out  you know through the grapevine--in camp the grap evine goes all the time  they found out that the transport of woman is leaving and they went to that particular point  and they realized that that transport of woman were the family of woman  you know   he realized it's his wife  so he start  they started to talk to one another  shout rather  and her little boy said  \ Mommy--.\
I had wonderful family contact but also working within my uncle's company gave me the opportunity to meet not only Jews but non-Jews.
And  of course   there was a mad scramble to get rid of the Jewish family and find them another place to live.
And one of the cousins  there were four children  one came.
Actua lly  it wasn't so much a family camp because there were hardly we did not have any children in this group.
>> Bill Benson: At what age did really understand what happened to you and your family?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 12 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: German who name was--who's name I'll never forget.
And the rest we just  I dont know  see  I -- I had my parents.
And what kind of connection or correspon dence did they have with their family?
What langu -- by the way  what language were you speaking to your mother?
And they were very happy and I was very happy to see them again.
So your family now is in mainly California and Florida  but not New York?
I recall much better when I was then brought to this family.
And her daughter  Jennas daughter  when she got married in Louisville all the neighbors got together  five of us and we went all to the wedding  to her daughters wedding  because she didnt have any family here.
When you were growing up  did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?
Bill Benson: What happened to your father after they took him away?
And when I say my family  I mean the immediate family.
I remember that there was a little dog in the family.
'Cause I was brought up in a very warm and loving family my parents had.
>> Edna Friedberg: Your mother became pregnant while you were living there .
But th ey -- he wasnt Jewish  her -- her husband  she was the one who was Jewish.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
End of Tape One  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 30 Beginning Tape Two  Side A This is tape two  side A  of an interview with Jerry Slivka.
Did -- did you go back to being sort of religious  or would you wa -- after the war  were you going to synagogue on Sabbath  or you were not doing anything any more?
People who applied wrote in about the age of the children  and a photograph  and a little about the family and family background.
So when your children were the ages of 13 to 19 which is when you had your difficult times  did that remind you of what you had gone through  when they were the same age that you were?
And she did come with an aunt of mine  who also wanted to come to Germany.
19 So  here you were  the director of the Displaced Person's camp  youre dealing with everything  fought in a war  you have family here.
When did you find out that you had to go to Auschwitz  how did you find out?
But my father came back -- the rabbi didn't come back but my father came back to the attic.
We went in one direction with him  he packed something with his family.
But I think I went to the– several times during the holidays I went to London  to be with the family.
>> Bill Benson: And I'm hoping that before we end today you might say more about what that was like for you to begin learning those things about your family all of these years later.
So the family had moved from Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 26 Koralice.
I Im sorry because I didnt when was the time to ask  I didn't  you know  b ecause I know I dont know much about my my histor family history before and all this  who knew maybe a little bit more  or sure more than me  was my sister   but we didnt talk about those things.
I think a 16 family house--what we called a Greenenbahg--the 'Green Mountain' in Kovno.
But even after the liberation  I stayed in her family because I had nobody.
We went to Warsaw with our uncle and his two children.
Okay  I have to I have to interrupt here for a second  because I want to find out  very briefly  what happened to various family members.
Now maybe my father went to see his cousin and so on  but this was not a place  Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27  2017 40 even though it was this family site on my fathers family my mothers family was in Bologna but we didnt go there  Im quite sure  because my father my grandfather couldnt go there.
For instance  both of my uncles they went out of the ghetto.
I came in with th e Berger family  was -- they didnt want to send us with old  ragged clothes so they went out -- out of the way to buy new wool suit for us  with the knickers  pants or so.
There were times when the house where I was hidden with the Madna family was searched.
I did not have a family in the city I was born.
And the danger wasn't over for you either because in 1947 there was the beginning of the uprising in Kenya so your family decided to pick up stakes and were able to get into the United States and begin a new life here.
This is our family: my brother who is seven and a half years older; I must have been close to five years old in this picture.
And we came into the town and when I looked up at the town -- I dont even recall now  I remembered my grandmother had family living in this town.
And the two boys in that family  Michel   15 ye ars old  and his friend  Michel Deneaux   took -- my parents put their life belongings in a backpack.
I can tell you only that I had a picture in my mind of a family portrait of my mother  a very stately  white collar laces  and very po but thats was that what I Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23  2015 9 [indecipherable] that that portrait was stolen in Russia with the few belongings we had  and thats all I can tell you.
And its kind of strange  my father said  ﬁWell  why dont you take the cows to the pasture?ﬂ And my father dug a dugout for the family  in a garden in the orchard  so they were went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture in the back way back  beyond the village it was a communal pasture.
And what did you do  what happened to you after liberation?
So  there must have been a lot of people in Russia  but they never made any attempt -- any effort at knowing the family  or I wasnt -- I didnt know their name or anything.
If it was two people  or a family  there were different amounts  and we gave them checks  and they went to the bank and cashed their checks.
In Dusseldorf so me of the people did know  who know the Lennebergs  which was a family who ha d lived in Dusseldorf for a long  long time.
Did you have friends who were part of the Jewish community?
>> Bill Benson: So by the time your family is back together in Brussels  it's the fall of 1944 and  of course  the war would continue until May 1945.
But the family [indecipherable] in Belgium around two or three  you know  lets say  people.
So really  theres five Jewish family were the key fam ily in town.
Yes  th-this somehow my father used to say that his family came from that would be west from the southwest of Bohemia .
What led to the decision to move you to their home?
And so I trie d to get information about my family.
I said  ﬁDo y-you think that by giving me money now  that it will bring my family back?
Maybe if somebody else from my family comes and ask tell him that the sister is alive.
Would you describe your family at that time  pre-war  as being middle class - Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 7 Oh yes. --
But last night  it was an apartment house  next door  there was a raid and they came into the apartment and they found one person in that family who did not have a permit with this particular address and because of that they took her and the entire family and they disappeared.
She was the only one in the family  but she was always the -- the doubting Thomas in the family.
And then  you know  we were so wrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family  now are we going to tell the children?
I had two brothers  a mother  and my grandmother lived with us.
Had your family ever talked about what was going on politi cally in the world?
And thats how it all came ab out  thats -- so there are two branches to the family.
You describe  and when you talk about ever ybody  theres a kind of security about your household and your family for you.
I was lucky  I had a couple of uncles who survived  several who did not.
So tell me a little bit about your family -- the family you were born into -- about your father  what kind of a person he was  your moth er  and some of the values they tried to -- let's say  share with the kids and so on.
I have no recollection of whether or not she knew any of the members of the kibbutz from her hometown  or maybe from school days  or through family.
And at that point we only  we couldn 't  you wake up and you are tired  oh  the first thing with my mother  grab what she wa s mostly interested of c ourse  the family should get out alive.
I built it with him  because the Hasidisha family of seven wa -- th -- they -- they -- they didnt have to lay a brick  they couldnt do anything.
How many were you altogether in your family at this time?
>> Bill Benson: And by doing that the day you were born in 1933  your family was anticipating there was a day that they were going to have to leave.
On Sundays he would go with the other men in the family and sometimes some of the boys.
It took more than us  and it was a family that I knew and I met the children.
You got the family tree of the Hockenheimers   which goes to the Suss family  my grandmother.
But the family were very s upportive  again  they didn't agree with me  but that didn't affect their affection for me.
And when we wanted to see the family  we used to go out of the house and go to other streets...on other streets.
It was just my father  my mother and the two of us.
>> Josie Traum: Well  my grandmother  her sisters  my grandfather  his family.
But I did find out through a friend with whom I was talking about the Holocaust one day when I was first in Greece  and I -- I gave her the -- I told her -- she asked me where di d I hide  and with whom  so I told her the family was Pavella.
Its a little bit like the Civil Rights Division  fairly small family.
Did you feel that kind of international horizon as you were growing up in your family   that your father had such a such a world view?
And only -- I dont know what happen ed to the rest of the family  but it was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 8just one -- some -- it was Jan Vyat  maybe.
And you went to the United States and to Argentina in stead  but did you ever go to Israel?
When I think about eating  the thing that I remember the best is when I was staying with the Runjak family  sometimes when the Ustashe we re there  and we stayed Mr. Runjak was a painter.
My fourth aunt  the fourth child in the family was the only one w ho survived until 1976  I think.
I think we have to stop the tape before we -- End of Tape Five 92 Beginning Tape Six Steven  we were talking about your leaving.
Unless you hit some unusual people that went for money  but some people didn't go in for the money because they were afraid  and it was ------- to be afraid because if they caught a Jew in somebody's house  the whole family got killed  so  I could understand that in a way  and uh  as matter of fact  while we run away  one day  we were in the fields  and there came two  the wooden wa gon horse  uh how uh how uh  a wagon with horses  2 people  and they didn't know that I speak Polish  so I went on one  and Selma went on the other  and when they drove away  the woman said  \ Oh  we would take care of them.\
Again what happened other than the  the fact that I had so much family in Poland but the fact that I ha d friends over here who at that point being 17  18 years old drafted into the army or signing up fo r the army maybe  whatever going into service.

And then they took my cousin -- my cousins  my mothers first cousin  and her husband  and who else from my family.
You described to me she was the black sheep of her family.
And the hardest thing we -- we were doing was trying to get people to write affidavits for other -- for people still left.
Did you feel German at that point  or just Jewish  or both?
And the large family of your I think youve talked about your father having come from a very large family.
6 Now this was the apartment that you shared with your husband or was there other family?
We have to go and we couldnt live by hisself  he lived with another family.
>> Bill Benson: Susan  while you were going through that  your father had escaped the country.
My fathers family lived in Maramaros  Dist rict in Felsoviso  my mothers family lived in Kiskunfelebyhaza.
And he said  \ Yeah we went to this family 31   who has a piano and were going to try to see how much we still remember.\
Does your family recognize that about you   the kind of attachment to bread  and will they tease you about it or even get a little frustrated wi th you: ﬁWhy are you holding onto these bread crusts?ﬂ 3 Bread (Polish).
So you decided to leave Israel and come to the United States ?
Yeah  I mean  there was -- there was -- I mea n  there was the fa -- the family -- the family thought that -- that you know  this is gonna be a -- a period of time were in -- let you put it this way  I grew up in the -- in the atmosphere wh ere people would go to -- to -- to Italy for [indecipherable] difference about going to the United States and Italy  but the idea that -- that you went to -- to get your professional education abroad  in Jewish middle class families was not such a very strange concept. [
Lot of people have gone back to take care of the cemeteries  of their parents  or family  whatever.
The political prisoners property  whether it was a dress a sweater a hairpin  when they were taken  put in Auschwitz concentration camp and given a uniform  every little item they brought with them had to be registered and stored  so in case they were transferred to a different camp  that each and every item had to follow them or  if they died  that their property was returned to the family.
Because in Poland  if a non-Jew helped a Jew  the whole family of the non -J ew was hung on lamp posts.
And I was stuck there like for a day and a half  and turned out I was sitting next to a French family there talking away in French.
They were minding their own business trying to make a living for thei r families  living in peace  a loving family in Belgium who worked hard to survive  not to be burdens to the country  and for no reason to be picked up middle the night and to be taken on trucks and trains and cattle cars and to be uh  uh  uh beaten up and  and  and then dying concentration camps in  in ovens  what do I tell my children?
My uncle  no Who was the person you coul d relate to during this The during the what was they put me w ith a family Mm-hm.
Thats mean contact document was only for one purpose  to save your family.
Okay  and did you feel like  I mean  because originally you had sort of thought you were going to Palestine Yeah  well. --
Now  what he did  you see  he took wat section of Warsaw  and an y person -- and ki -- family that was not Jewish  they were forced to move out from there  but they we re allowed to take all their belongings  everything.
Maybe if she wouldnt be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow leave the family and go.
>> Bill Benson: On that night  which was just this horrific night in 1938  over 300 synagogues in Germany were burned.
I think he al so was grasping and groping to try to find his way back to his family.
Now  all this time  of course  you are st ill preoccupied in some way with whats happening to the family?
They had a cradle made out of wood and she would look out the window and children were on the sidewalk playing hopscotch and she participated then  she was in an apartment upstairs and many times the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited  but she never had time to really play with children  raising the rest of the family.
And I never told the family that I was Jewish  but I di d tell Danka that I was.
Tell us what you can about the circumstances that caused you to be away at that time from your family  as best you know  and then what happened once the Germans occupied Yugoslavia.
Dinner was just the family  but everybody was invited for  you know  right now I think they woul d say this is a [indecipherable] wedding  you know  because you had little sandwiche s and drinks and that was -- you know  that was that and everybody came out.
At that time I still was staying with the original family who knew about all the invitations.
So as you can see  the family and friends and everybody thought I was really after that incident in Minsk  shot by MKVD.
So we had to move out from our house  a big house we had.
>> Bill Benson: And this is the family that your father  as I recall  helped them out.
So  if you could tell us -- tell us about your mother and father.
Well  outside is where the we were  at first  living on the in the small they put us with the older Russian family  wh ere she had she had one room  and we had another room.
So it was the -- you and your mother and your father -- My father  all three of us.
Tell us what happened during the uprising with you and your family particularly.
And -- What do you remember about when you were grow ing up about the role that religion played in your family life?
And I was with my brother in law and my husband and my three year old son.
Otherwise -- I mean  we were part of the Jewish community  and there was a Jewish community paper  and I remember they had a lot of family announcement of course  you know how it is  it is like patting on your shoulder  the big shot this and the big shot that.
And was kind of interesting  I have one one granddaughter  and okay  my children are ar e half Jewish  so my granddaughter is has one Jewish grandmother  me.
Anybody who would get married and didn't had family  Grandfather was taking care of them.
So one of them was able to come down to Split and stay with the rest of the family  and they were saved.
>> Bill Benson: Now your mom  your brothers and sister and you.
I went to a private Jewish school  because my parents believed in  uh  a Jewish education--but secular  not religious.
It might have I wasnt if there was the first family  maybe in the first family you would have been able to tell them how you were feeling inside yourself.
Its Andel Burns Chalmers   and he is the one that I worked with very much  you know  send me to the consulate and talked to the who arranged with the consul that my family would get out of France .
My whole family since early  youth will all cherish life and want to make the best out of it.
Survived the war  and when the war finished they went to look the Lithuanian people  where their daughter were.
I said -- my cousin said 31 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD who I was.
We moved to an apartment where one and a half rooms  two families lived.
Was your family  your mothers side of the family very Jewish?
After all  she was family  a nd here was this totally depressed person.
He had two kids of his own  and uh he just couldn't get away from his camp often enough to be with us  so he he spent long periods of time with us  Charlie did  and tell us stories about his family back home to help him feel better.
We were my mom  my husband  myself and the two children.
I came to them  and my aunt went to the same place as my .. family from Usharot to take the papers.
As the Nazis were nearing Banska Bystrica  the family fled to the mountains where they were caught in a massacre at Stare Hory.
Tell me about what you did when the war broke out.
After the family was split -- was just my two brothers and me  they took out my young -- my older brother family -- the younger fro m the -- the second -- the second boat.
I dont think my sister Leah was -- she was much younger  obviously did not know how to -- to write  but the Van Luhrmann family also showed me books  and they were actually -- because  as I said before  my sisters had gone to a Catholic religious school  so she would show me books  little Catholic books that my sisters were able to read.
And my -- One of my -- my fathers youngest brother  he and the whole family went right in -- in -- in -- in the -- ri ght in the beginning  when they took the first akcha.
01:11:34 And it is there that I witnessed while we lived  s till the whole family intact  that I witnessed a massacre.
And he found a lot of details about the history of the community  and myself and my family  and so on.
On a  which was a real freak accident because normally one person in the family always had to stay home.
Did you feel the difference between yourself being from a not so well-to-do family and the other kids or not so much?
And so  when I first was presented with this contraption  of Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 33 which to eat  I must say I was slightly puzzled  until I watched other people in the family  who knew how to cope with this particular vegetable.
a Jewish family  the next day they came with a -- Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 39 I see.
And then between Warsaw and Sied lce is Minsk Mazowiecki and we decided to go back to our first family town when everybody knew us and we knew that if something goes wrong  we will get help.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  very soon after  you were forced into a ghetto.
Did you ever hear from him  or know that any of his family ended up in Australia?
Because I say  they don't know what they have  they should appreciate what they have  they have parents  they have grandparents  they have aunts and uncles and cousins and they  such a big family  they don't know what th ey have.
At this point  di -- what did you know  or what -- what did you know about your f -- your family  besides your brother?
Not that you can feel anything else  but the pain tells you Well  another thing which was difficult fo r me to talk about  especially here  where you have single people  who fortunately were able to start a life again and have a family.
With -- with some degree of frequency we -- we sh -- meaning -- our immediate family here tried to visit Polish neighborhood  we have hired a -- a nanny for our little Joe  hi-his daycare provider when he is not in preschool  who happens to be from Poland.
Bill Benson: What happened to your father after they took him away?
And would you have considered your your family  you know  on those circumstances  in those times  well-to-do?
>> Bill Benson: And in 1955 is when you came here.
So it gives me a sense of what it was like for my parents  for my family and I enjoy it.
There was one lets see  was that a that was a a brot her of my fathers  and his family.
It seems like your early days  your affluence  your family education  all of that really helped you survive the war years?
Also I liked her family and the family gave me some  something  yeah  helped.
But she was able to help us out in that part of our family tree  so the internets a great thing.
And you were in Durango   your family lives in Durango .
Let's start our conversation with you telling us a bit about your community  your family and yourself and those years before the war actually began.
She got a report from her son so she wasn't quite as nervous as she should be  but she -- she was -- she was okay with it  and we -- we stayed with her at the flat  and I got to meet -- you know  Interview with Michael W. Wolff 17 a couple days after we got there she had a bi g party and all her -- they had a big family.
So  they somehow wrote that my mother didnt have to work  which was worse  because then we didnt get that piece of bread  but the Zhaglietska family shared with us  you know.
She went to live with a Jewish family in the country.
And we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted to talk to us was in connection with what was going on in Germany.
So anyways  he became acquainted and their doctor and they told my father the day our familiar visit  Hungarian office and their family  I think the officer sort of liked them better than his own family and he told them that he knows his wife was looking into a Catholic charity to look for a place to work for her  you know  like a maid.
I ha ve uh come from a family with great linguistic skills.
And my folks said that I didn't have to support the family if I went to college  and that was all the help they could give me for going away to school.
And I must say they were very nice  they sn -- you know  send the papers right away and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006 24everything that they needed to do  they did  to get us ov er here as a family.
What did that mean for your family  for all of you including your grandfather  Aizik?
He had family here  you know the whatever remained of the family had come to the U.S. Did they sponsor him in?
I was not in the family camp  so -- so I can only tell you what some of my friends told me happened.
They was looking and I was looking that the there was some very interesting hats  furs  and and I went down and I asked because uh my family was not never in the shelter.
Apparently it was his only possession  a small goat and people with wheelbarrows and carts and everything and my brother had a girlfriend and apparently her uh family called and said that they are going to flee into the interior of Poland and suggested that they would take my brother and me along and my father insisted that should be my brother's decision.
And to convey to the next -- first of all in your family  its where the nucleus  where the -- where it starts  all those things.
My grandmother  on my paternal side was the older sister of my aunt.
And sh e's telling me that every year for many years now  they have a family reunion  because this cousin was and she came w ith her sister and they started this because people lived in different places.
And they were also very curious  these -- th-th -- that family wa s very curi -- there were questions.
Yeah  and your apar so when did you find out about what had happened to the relatives who stayed behind in Poland?
T ell us about your family and you in the years before your family moved to Palestine.
And can you please tell me the names of your parents?
>> Bill Benson: During that time  Fritz  did your father make efforts to try to emigrate from Germany to get out of Germany?
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
And it wasn't the best  at least not in my family.
Then of course my father was the youngest child in the Racimora family.
They would make these out  you know  where one person in the family had supposedly converted prior to 1938.
It was lucky I would say I was the lucky one to be with the family together  in this particular area and they took us the right next day and a was the man in charge and I remember he had this family too.
And the contact was with the Polish school  you know  all of a sudden I have Polish friends  Polish teachers and I was in touch.
After the war  Susan married and immigrated with her husband Herman and their family to the United States.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
Right  its another small town and Where was your fathers family at that point?
You have -- you -- you -- you -- he -- he said  you came from a good family  a family who loved you.
The time in the when I was born I had basically a nice family  a wonderful family.
After this postcard deal I would have been sent -- my family would have been sent to Auschwitz  any one of those killing camps  and killed.
Well  yeah  shes -- shes Jewish and the -- shes the only child.
And so thats the reason my mothers mother and my mother and her family moved to Vienna.
And also my parents fo the families were in Poland .
Well anyway  we went to the th eater  went to all kinds of -- But this is as a family?
Therefore she had to move out of that apartment and come back and live with my grandmother in that Jewish ghetto.
Tell me about your your family  tell me about where you were born  the circumstances  your mother  father  brother  sisters.
of our family  this killing  the second kill ing – Was in their shtetl one of the --- I dont know how to call it --- a soldier  a gangster.
And his parents lived in Beckum  a small town  as a Jewish family.
Mr. Fagiolo   can you tell us a little bit about your background; where you were born; wher e you grew up; your family  and so on and so forth?
It was  again  pretty horrible  because we had to go into their homes  sometimes kill the family  as well as the individual  because they we they were well armed  and they would defend themselves during the execution.
Because there were a lot of people  they were a big family there.
And so your father  your uncle  your your aunt  and your brother were there all together.
I mean  well  sometimes when people were in high positions in companies  the family didn't see them much becau se they were so busy.
And I was really throwing myself on the floor  I have no family  you know  only my si yeah   I had tro I have to backtrack about my father  he didn't want to come out.
And do you remember if your family -- I dont think we paid anything.
And I say  we are all th e family  except my sister's husb and.
And they settled in Pennsylvania where they raised a child and lived a very beautiful life all these years until  of course  she heard what happened to the rest of her family in Europe.
She was at one -- somebody in my class  who I was good friends with  and she had a large family  so that must have been fairly -- she had a younger brother and two older brothers  and it was like a happy household  and I loved going there  because it was a lot going on  and you know  pl ayed with her brothers  and attention was paid  and meals of mi-milk and cookies  or whatever.
My mothers family in Poland did not speak Yiddish because her mothers side of the family was Sephardic and that was the -- obviously the s -- the Spanish side  it was not -- it was the Ashkenazic that spoke Yiddish in the house.
And we get into the house -- she was a remarkable lady  my Aunt Eva  and -- by the way  they all spoke German  of course  and English  but my German was almost nonexistent  because I remembered a little bit from my grandmother  who spoke German  but I alwa ys spoke Dutch.
Bill Ben son: Marcel  the Sawinski family  the family you stayed with  they must have been incredibly brave.
Besides  I wanted  by any chance of all  maybe there was someone of my family  who by -- by any kind of way  survived  and if anything  probably that would be the place to meet them.
After two weeks   he came to me and gave me a ration card for four people which means I was able to get additional five gallons of kerosene on a Thursday and I was able to get a loaf of bread again for my family.
She was the only Jewish family still living in that small town  and life was just miserable for her.
My mother also got a job working as a housekeeper for a family.
Or has it been mostly when you talk now  it's been to your own family members?
That was when we met the people who said they'd helped our ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 parents.
And after what happened  after wh at she heard  what happened to that whole family  if youd ask her sing  she says  my harmony died  I cant. [
40 Yeah What other conversations were go ing on in the family at that time?
Excuse me  but do you did you have brothers and sisters?
What sense that made  I cant tell and it probably didnt make any sense but we walked towards the city of Krakow in the unit of eight members in our family along with many  many thousands of other families.
You see  my family  like many Jewish  central European families  my family was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 38 very large  but dispersed.
Now Babcha the other one  Babcha Laks  from Solsnoviets  she pe rished together with her family there.
Or would take me to his home to visit and be with the family.
And can you maybe talk a little bit about the previous trip that you just took this fall  this past fall with your family?

Before we turn to the war years  tell us about your family  your life in those years before the war began.
We didnt have an American certificate  even though I know from my reco rds  and my mother  that she had my father had applied to go to the United States already in the 20s  but my mother didnt want to go becaus e she had all her family in in Germany.
But otherwise they -- they didnt have to get that much money  but if they were a family  so that helped  you know.
>> Bill Benson: Will you tell us a little bit about your father?
End of Tape #1 7 7 Tape #2 What did we just say?
The whole family was friendly and he told her that the day they would come for my father that he would let he r know.
We had family in  in Berlin that I stayed with  and here they told me they can't give me the certificate  can't give me the permission to go because of my eyes.
And for a young person  of course  it was easier to leave  unless you were -- of course  you -- you were very attached to your family.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 >> Bill Benson: When did your parents start to make their efforts to try to get the family out of France?

And -- a nd -- but the Franks had family in -- be -- in Basil  we knew that.

Well  then I was discharged  in fall I was discharged  and I went back to Boskovice  and stayed with this Hanark family  who came back.
Thats when we started to tell them what happened to their grandparents.
And the interesting part is that he thought it was only men   and that thats why he moved to escape  because he felt that once he was in England   he could get his family to Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 34 follow him.
>> Bill Benson: And when your father came back  I think it was 1946  I think  a year after the war.
And the family talked him into marrying her sister who se name was either Mira or Perella[236].
Describe the things that happened in the early part of the 1930s that have made you and your family aware of what was going on.
So later on I found out that they didn't only do that to our house in Bad Krueznach but they did it to all the Jewish families that were living in our town.
And I -- but I had -- I wont bore you with these stories  I had the most dramatic and memorable reunion with my family whom I had last seen when I was eight years old in DP camp.
Alex's 19 -year -old grandson   Tomer   was drafted into the Israeli military at the end of 2012  making him the third consecutive generation in the family to serve in the military.
And so it that probably was something that drove us to well  my parents never never said that you know  the fact of getting good grades and so on  was Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27  2017 136 something that in my family was always everybody always had  so that that was not an issue.
She said  \ Nobody saw them  but we know the Ge rmans just found them a little while ago  a whole family.\
Did she  was there  did she understand your hist ory as a Jew and as a Jew who had more or less had gone through the Holocaust and what youd experienced with losing your family?
My intention was if were going inside the ghetto and see if I can get in touch and can find my family and see if I can find Lisa.
Even if they would take from ever family one night to be a guard  so my father used to pay for somebody to be a guard for the day -- for the night.
She got some kind of scholarship  and she lived with a whole other family.
And I studied in engineer  so the cultural values of my family was very high.
She raised her family and she had so many children  .
As it happened  my wifes family invited me  because they were people who were not bigots  and they were friends of the guy who became president of Yale  and whose daughter was my friend  and of Gene Rostow   who became the first not the first Jewish dean  but a Jewish dean of the law school.
And I'm sure that in the beginning that's what happened in my family.
So they actually mailed -- the entire family  your father  his father  everyone sent– Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff.
The reason I was born actually in Budapest  my mother came from Budapest and her entire family lived there.
So it -- we didnt mind it once she got well  and we had a big group of people coming to wit -- to meet us at the border -- at -- I mean there  at the -- to see us from the boat  it was a lot of her family  that she had more than mine.
And my brother came in voluntarily  so the family won' t be separated.
I think right -- I think when the telegrams came from the Red Cross that -- that the family was -- was gone  and of cour se in the newspapers  the American newspapers  when you started seeing the pictures of the camps and the liberation of the camps  thats when the realities really struck.
Then they killed the family over there the rest  in the cemetery.
So Henry was not sponsored by a family member  but he was sponsored by Joint.
They -- The -- That was the time where thous ands of thousands of Jews were coming to Israel from -- those people who were remnants of the -- of the camps in Europe.
Were you aware of what  the nature of what was happening to Jews in Europe?
However  once again tragedy struck an d we have been married 39 years and children start to make preparation for our 40th wedding a nniversary and on the fourth of July 1988  Gary and his family we pick them up at the Syracuse Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2 or three years old and we went to our house.
I came -- I was raised as an Orthodox child  I came from an Orthodox home.
My mother was not workin g. But  you know  she had to clean the house and clean the floors.
And in every building  in every apartment  who normally lived a family of three or five  lived 40.
Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the Ghetto.
But then things got bad  but again this midwife found another family that was wiped out  by the name of Schmitz.
My mother was a born Ne uberger  and sh -- Im sorry  she was an -- a born Marx  and the Neubergers married a Lanksdo rf  and the children all came  more or less from that family.
So every time an order came out for so many people  every building and every family had to supply a certain amount of people  and everybody of course wanted to stay in the ghetto as long as possible because as bad as things were in the ghetto  we knew that Kaiserwald concentration camp is going to be much worse and we had heard already rumors to that 7 effect  so when the order came that that in our house so many people have to be volunteered to go my brother and father and I consulted.
Now all my grandparents came from large families  9 to 12 children so.
We didn't talk much about getting married and raising a family and all that  but I'm wondering just in general  if you could quickly talk about if there is anything over the last twenty  thirty years that you think  were decision you made  were things that were directly related or effected by you're experiences during the war?
And then  in the discussions  and as I said  I heard not only within my family  but also in my -- the circle of friends  who were personal friends  all interested in mountain climbing  all in terested in going to refugi for hikes.
Wherever you ride you had a DP card...I had what I got...they let me go and you showed that...nobody asked for money and nobody asked for...mine mine...I had just a feeling to go to see  to to find somebody from my family.
Im very happy with my family and even with my sons because they developed in very good and useful people and I am very happy about that.
He had seemed to have been accepted as a member of the family even though they were not married for a long period of time.
That's where my family is from  my father's side of the family.
That was  he was living with his sister and the family.
My home  my family and wor k. Then for awhile th ere  my second child  my husband was promoted and I could be a homemaker for awhile  so I was a homemaker  but I want ed certain things  like music lessons with the best of teachers and everything that wa s good for my child ren  so I started using my dressmaking ski lls because I didn't want to leave the children because I didn't have parents at home and I felt that my children should have a mother at home.
I know that many many people are sacrificed and killed  but not my family.
And he always  my husband always would light a candle for this man because you ne ver know who has family left or who didn't because uh  families were wiped out to the last .
In this 1946 photograph we see George with a group of survivors  all of with whom the Pick family had been in hiding.
And th e family I took my concentrated [indecipherable] my escape kit  and gave it to them.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
They would say  ﬁDon't worry  every beginning is -- is very tough and -- and you'll see that everything will turn out goodﬂ But this whole other family  you know the -- all those children  they just came  saw us  good-bye and -- and left and here we are with those 13 dollars from that time.
But I just wanted to clarify– It was my cousins  my fathers brothers daughter and her family.
There was one Polish -- a younger man with a wife  they got no children  he was hiding  there was a somew -- not far from Warsaw  in a little town  they was hiding in the attic six people  family  grandmother and so on  six people.
And one family  they convinced us -- they were my husband's neighbors before the war.
Well  let's start at your earliest recollections  and describe your family.
It had to be some kind of a holiday  because this was the wo rst time of my life  not to have family sit at the table  just the three of us.
My parents did not want to leave Sialishky  here they had thei r family  neighbors  their home and their free life.
But he was afraid that if he brings his family here his children would not be Jewish enough.
My  the whole family  fr om the time that the Russians were  my family did not sleep at home.
Uh so as we walking towards the field where this action took place  uh my brother who's eight years older than I  and he's uh robust young man and a woman came by with a child and she grabbed his arm and latched on to him and just to be part of the family unit.
There was another ItalianAmerican -Jewish family that ended up in New Haven   the time that we were here.
These were young women who were married and having children  starting a life again  starting a family again.
He's dead  and they took care of Weinka with with the family  but I asked one question.
Then in 1923 my Interview with Tracy Strong June 11  2009 4father was appointed to the Boys Work secretary for the worlds YMCA in Geneva  Switzerland  so the family all packed up.
Tell us about the ghetto  what that was like for you.
So there was no sense for him because he was he wasnt let to go with his family.
His father was still alive and he was so proud of me that I can go and keep the family together.
All my oops no  Ive I didnt even think about my family at that time  especially under the Soviets  I wasnt going to to fall into the clutches of any of any system like that any more  so I just wanted to go west.
Okay  can you tell me where you were born  and when you were born?
And also with my aunts and uncle through my fathers side.
About your family  where you lived  what your father did for a living?
And Rottenberg had some family in southern Germany still  and he asked whether he could help him to -- to bring them out.
The first floor was inhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews.
Other than that  her son Alexander  who was my unc -- my brothe r -- my fathers brother  Alexander Laks  with his family  they surv ived.
I  when I was working at the iron factory I worked there for about 15 years and after that I went to Germany because from my wifes side  o ne of the family there  used to live there and they had this store  a clothing store.
And one of the  the thing I should quick tell you that this  the Pariser family who housed us and was so good to us over the years  two  two of the children who are older than me but  one lived in Chevy Chase and got ovarian cancer.
Th-The terrible thing was down -- my family was a beautiful family.
One nice day we heard that the place by these German people... the Gestapo came they couldn't live without Jews  so they took in a family with two children and the Gestapo killed her husband  not with a shot  but like with a butt  not because he holds Jews.
He went to the United States with his family and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 8 he had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know  he got -- he got his doctorate in psychiatry in New York.
I dont think that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever  but he was a work-a-day architect who always kept his profession  whereas the rest of his family was spending money like crazy and ended up paupers  many of them  after spending money like mad in one direction or another.
What were your emotions like when you realized your family me mbers werent coming back to Vienna?
We laugh in my family that we have very stron g women in our family and the men who marry in better beware.
Tell me in general about... Tell me a little more about your family.
>> David Bayer: My last word is going to be -- but I still am upset for my family.
Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 18 Well  when you look at houses here that were built for well-to-do people in the late 19th  early 20 th centuries  there are often two staircases; one for the family  and one for the servants  you know.
And his father died early and his mother was a bit s-strange and -- but she came  so we had some connection with his mother.
So would you have considered your family fairly wealthy  or well-to-do  how would you have described it?
And I tell him I want to go -- the first thing to go to the ghetto to see maybe so mebody from my family is alive.
Tell me a little bit about the personalities of your parents.
By the way  the girl he married  the whole family survived.
I was the only boy in the family  and they were really treating me – I was thinkin g right now.
Tell us about the ghetto and what conditions were like for you there.
Did your family ever -- your parents be st friends then were Jewish?
So they tried to draft me  but I got a couple of deferments  because I wa s the sole support of the family.
And 8 let me tell you  that was  that was a strange feeling to be in the same prison with the people who  who murdered your family.
>> [Question Inaudible] Were any members of your father's family  the Jewish side of your family  interned in any of the camps?
Also  once I was on Swiss soil  I was legal  because my family had obtained an immigration visa fo r me.
We knew there was a part of the family  he has a sister who immigrated to Palestine in 1932 with four children.
I was actually born in Berlin Metta but my family  my mother and father moved to Aschaffenberger about one block from Rathaus Aschaffenberger on Apostel Paul us Strasse and we lived there and thats where I grew up and I went to the Hohenzollern Gymnasium until the spring of 1938 when I was kicked out  being Jewish.
On my mothers side  there are quite a few cousins all over.
I do it be cause I feel an obligation to my family who perished  millions of people who perished  people who came out affected much more than I have been.
We got to a place and my father knocked at the door and said   ﬁCould you house us for the night?ﬂ The family   just wonderful people  they kept us three weeks.
I  too  wanted to catch a ball soaring in th e air; I  t oo  wanted to feel grass under my bare feet; I  too  wanted to take my family  my parents and friends for granted.
And my mother was  the two brothers and two sisters and me.
They were in the ghetto and they were the rich aunts in the family because they had a hous e in Hungary.
Her-Herman became the principa l of a school and I think -- and they have five children and they in turn have children and I think they have a very good family life.
And at that poi nt  one had to show that one had family here or friends that could vouch for them  that th -- they wouldnt be a burden on the government.
I could I could take for the food I could take milli ons  and I give this away to my family.
The girl  I forgot her name now  at the cemetery says– she wasnt pressuring anybody  but she says  ﬁMany times people dont think about it now  but later on suddenly they think they would like to be maybe near a dear one from the family.
Yes  oh yes  we -- we was all the time a very political family.
Wed like to hear wed like to lay the groundwork  and th at means where you were born  when you were born  your family  who was your family.
I have you know  I have quite a few memories of of Ryevka   you know  I I thats a I remember very distinctly that the barracks  you know  and stuff  that we were put in  you know  and the the tiny room what we shared with this other family  the the Gorky family.
>> [Laughter] >> David Bayer: I only could tell you a last word is I miss my family very much.
What about the Polish culture and -- and within your own family  wh at kind of things were you taught?
So I went with my brother and my father  a couple of uncles.
And anyhow  we -- we were very  very posey family  we used to do most things in the kitchen.
So we eventually had to abandon and move in with one of the family.
My mothers family was partly in -- was mostly in Opin   Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 21some in Breslau and some in Berlin.
I worked there my first job was to work as a live-in maid in New Brunswick   for a nice  little Jewish family.
I had uncles and I had cousins  and some cousins were very rich.
Concerned about the safety of their family  the Rosenfelds registered their children for a Kindertransport  the informal name of a rescue effort that brought thousands of refugee Jewish children to Great Britain from Nazi Germany between 1938 -1940.
Except a later date  they -- there was a little girl who came from a family  and we have some teena -- no  pre-teenager  you know  thing.
And we had Jewish friends  you know  because the -- Right.
I'm the happiest guy in the world and  and right now  my children follow our footsteps too  and I have a good family  I have good children  I have a  a which al so  it's not directly  directly from my wife too  because uh we all created  created a very close family  a very close family tie  because that's all we have.
So between January of 1940 -- oh while reaching the destination  I sent a message to my mother in Wilaka a friend who was leaving for Wilno because he had a family over there.
Can you tell me a little bit about the ship and where this historical event intersected with your family.
But to get the family together at all at once  its very difficult.
So somebody in the family who had a factory  a clothing factory  took me into hi s factory and taught me how to use a sewing machine.
Well  the two families  my mother's family and my father's family  did not come from the same place.
And then his o ther sister had married another Jew who  another Jewish family called Brega .
>> Bill Benson: Here you are  this young Caucasian child  living in a household of an Indonesian family  we saw the photograph there.
His first wife died and he had from this wife  four a nd then two  six children.
Its it for example  we talked about in your family and raising your children.
>> Bill Benson: And I believe you had relatives in the United States.
He didn't want to do that because we would--especiallyŠ Anthony: So your mother was the gutsy one in the family?
I think he influenced the whole family a lot  with his very openminded and -- views and with his goodness.
My childhood: I was the youngest son of a family of five sisters.
And then the question that comes after that is  who was your family?
I think its a cowardly attitude to say  ﬁI cant watch these thingsﬂ because if my family could go through it at least I should know and get upset by what theyve been through.
Is that what youre thinking of  the -- the actual  you know  family members lost?
I -- I really just meant that distinction between those who hid their Jewishness  and y-you were really  as a family  not doin g that  but also assuming this membership in the Lutheran church.
I knew th at my family was brought to Bi rkenau on the third day.
On occasions here and there  and we...we kind of became very fond of each other; and he was also very instrumental in helping my family  'cause since he had evidently money  he was able to obtain some goods from out of camp  and always got something extra like a bread or maybe other things and would give it to my mother and father and they...they had to promise him that he would not tell me  they would not tell me  because he did not want our relationship be affected.
She was you know  there theres some people in my family you should have interviewed rather than me  because my cousin Anina married a man Interview with J udith Heimann November 21  2011 21called von Malk  who was also a Jew  and my I will say my aunt arranged that marriage.
No  none of my family lived like they had a lot of money.
Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 106 Yeah  but we were known for we were not our family was not known for actual in grou the whole  like okay  not all of those seven  or eight or nine villages of that I am talking like a bunch of villages around Semeniıkiai   when my father was seni   were th moved  like families moved apart  in individual plots of land Thats not at the same time.
F-First of all  I collected all this materials from the family  and members who were alive after the war.
Again  everybody was hoping to find at least one member of their family  very few found anybody.
Uh  we were  uh  a lower income family  but I wasn't even aware of  uh  highe r incomes or low incomes.
They spoke Yiddish when they didnt want me to understand which was e nough so that I did understand Yiddish.
And in our family  it's always the kids who make the decision  you know.
Did they start to react differently to your family after the Germans came?
My wife  my child  who was -- Israel was at that time  ‚37  three years old -- four years old.
For instance there was -- Then  it came out that in the -- during this -- this whole time  they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 12 were hiding this German family.
>> Bill Benson: Where did you actually reunite with your father?
You know  Ive known about the Holocaust since I was a little boy  but o-only in stories and some friends of the family and from some books.
In my case  we were from Warsaw  but Warsaw was destroyed.
>> Bill Benson: Frank  why didn't you go when your father went ?
Was there anything else that your family did ta ke with them into the ghetto?
Here is this family being helped and sheltered  allowed to survive  when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews  and yet they did.
People who died from spotted fever mostly or from starvation and the family had no means to bu ry them.
And  and the hope was really making us imagine better things  so one day -- it must have been again in March or April  in March  I think  March of '45 -- they put us in trains and they sent us to so-called ﬁFree work.ﬂ Each one was assigned to some deserving German family or on a farm to work and this  Pepi and I we were assigned to two villages not far from each other in the northern part of Germany near Rostock.
Were your friends -- did you have friends who were non -Jews?
Some cousins  relat -- I -- Is that your father -- This is my father. --
But there was a combination of my mother who came from a very religious family and probably she did not keep that at home because she married a man that was not religious.
Tell me a little bit about whatever memories you have of this first town that you were living in  where you were born.
And there was a rabbi -- I remember vividly  there were teachers.
Did they tell you stories  your family stories of what was going on in Vienna?
And memories from family gatherings either in the gazebo or just sitting in the courtyard in the early evening are really etched in my memory.
Did you think about  I mean at this point  wh en the war is well underway– at the time you were in Starachowice  you were separated from your entire family.
She didnt know anything  that I am Jewish  you know  and I came that I was  I know them.
Do you think your father  in 1938 or even before  was thinking about how to get the whole family out of Croatia?
And can you give me the name of your parents and your siblings?
Do you remember what your family talked about  if you had any plans?
Uh...Cantor Mandel  in Budapest around 1941 with all of this happening  what was it like for you  for your family  inside the house?
He said  so I dont understand this man w ho did this thing  who who caused me to live and my family to live  and you know   so now that I can have children of my own.
My father expressed his gratitude and he said as a family he would like to stay together.
And I was very upset later on and I went back to Debrecen and my friends family came back.
Because I do not make distinction between those before Hitler and after Hitler and meeting the family and political trips.
And...uh...they put our names in a paper in here...in the United States so...probably in the Brooklyn paper or whatever  and a friend called up my sister that she...because my sister would talk about her family.
Was just living as a I mean  obviously it was my family; but they  they weren't wealthy.
But she lived in a small apartment -- well  it wasnt really small.
And a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 woman  a Czech woman from Prague.
Did they ever speak about what had gone on in Germany in the 1930s when you were older.
And the Pristers all lived apar t  so this was mostly Sternberg part of the family.
And you know I say theres always one in one family.
Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the Ghetto.
It seemed hopeless the imme diate family insofar as they have not gotten out.
It affected everybody  affected my family  you know  and so also affected me.
My mother  father  and three of us  my sisters  all three kids.
Oh  I might mention that even though my wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement  they did hide non-Jewish resistance in their attic.
And th en  th-the when we became already strong  we had the radios an -and wit big radios and wh at music and dancing like like a normal family.
We all went to the church  and 7 the priests there recognized my family.
But after a while she  the woman  took the baby to the gestapo and told them where my sister was.
Did you talk about Germany and Hitler with your parents a lot?
However I survived  not a Jew  but suddenly I felt that I am back a Jew.
My -- ma -- my older brother  of course  was in Israel all the time.
While we were there  we learned that my mother's two sisters were also there in the vicinity and my mother's brother was in Bari uh  with his family  so we had some family that was still alive.
And my fathers family with the five boys especially  there was a sort of a tutor  another another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these by this big family.
At first he went in Brussels  but with the same family.
So then he finds a family for you to live with?
Applause] Susan  thank you so much for joining us  for being willing to be our First Person today.
And I know when mother died that they had had the names of my brother and my aunts and family put in.
There was Christos and Thermas Bokoros   and we knew them  we became fam we became family friends because their sister Elestair was married to a man who was a colleague of my fathers in in the bank.
Now  none of them was good  even  just  did that  maybe  there were older family people  they had wives and children  so maybe he had some compassion for somebody and he did it  so  but most of them  there were  there were  they were terrible  they went off for 3 months   winter vacation  and because we had a lot of people brought nice t hings  especially when there came transport from Holland  they brought nice stuff with them.
Because if he had been  he would have saved his family?
It was a short -- and vacations  while we lived in Karlsbad  I spend with Mothers family in - nearby  it was 60 kilometers from Karlsbad.
I don't want to do something to disgrace myself or my family.
All the whole family  mom  father and hes in this photo and the other small child.
And you've said that where you were born is not really important to the story  so would you describe your family and perhaps your earliest memories.
I had a job by f by a family with four children  ages 10 to two.
I would like to go to your family  this family now.
Uh being Danish of Jewish family I can see both sides of it.
Of course  the more people were coming in  the more we were crowded  and we had to kind of accept anothe r family to live with us.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 97 Did you say something in your first interview that Jules Scurvis had told you something about the fate of your family  or am I misunderstanding?
He to ld me he obtained it through the help of some non-Jewish family and this was authentic.
We already mentioned a little bit that the the Count  or the Duke was high nobility and the family did not speak Lithuanian.
But we became very close friends with the Ravensbergan family and we would spend many weekends traveling there.
Now my par -- when people here send the -- the necessary papers   they were not official enough to allow a family of three more to make a living here.
So  you right away have this balance  you can balance this  whether Genia was greed  it was pure greed  or whether it was other motivation  I dont know  but she was member of the family for years  I mean  many years  so that she did not prove to be a friend  as good a friend as she ought to have been  because she was treated very well by the family.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
We were still in the country  the family was just able  my father was just able to send the fami ly away to the country so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the city and I can actually rememb er the  the war starting.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 4 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: quite worried and I mean as  as a ten year old you  you always try to have fun and go around and  and with your friends but you sense this unease in the family at that time.
>> Bill Benson: Why Rita and family didn't join other family members and go to Israel and came to the United States instead?
Interview with Hedi Pope November 6  1997 40But we had a a family  they you know  they live sort of on the on the as you come in.
And Mother was living in that area  before they moved into Warsaw .
There was another family upstairs that was Jewish and they were from Poland.
In our house in the ghetto  all the family came to us from other streets.
Apparently they were above 70 or even more  deciding to leave their family behind and going to the Holy Land to die there and to be buried in the Holy Land.
And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.
It was in the family for gen -- a few generations  and my grandmother and then my grandmother took in her two sons -- sons-in-laws -- into the business.
One of the reasons that we came about the change is because of the anti-Semitism that we felt when we came with the name of Ipp  it was felt by the rest of my family  which were already in America  that it might dr aw attention  as though our accent didn't  you know so that you had to change your name to be Americanized  change it to an American name.
Initially my mother and I stayed with the Madna family and then my mother found an apar -- was a very small apartment.
So could you tell me where you were born  when you were born?
Yeah -- no  no  I s -- I would stay for -- for weeks and come back  which was not very good for my family  I mean it was -- its terrible what one does to ones family  really  you know.
Well  it all it well  in almost every house in that I know of  I mean  certainly every other house  had a Jewish family being hidden  including our own house.
Well by that time  the first wife  I was divorced and I was in the midst of a second wife.
Cause I you know  grew up without family  so its you know  when I hear about family problems  I I dislike it.
You were born in Riga  Latvia  as I mentioned earlier  in 1936 but your family stayed there and certainly yours was a short one before you moved to Budapest.
As soon as the Germans arrived and we noticed how bad it got a nd everybody started running in all directions  my father  my parents -- we were still intact  brought my sister and her baby to our house.
And after -- in the 50s  were -- did you hear from any family members or people back there  were you in co rrespondence with people that you knew?

And even her parents  they ne ver requested a name  they Im sure they have deaths on their family too  but they sti they kept on telling my son  if that means so much  the names  to your parents  give it to them.

And it was very nice to have her in the house.
So I drew up a family tree based on this information.
Yeah  we had a German family there and  like I spoke to them too.
Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family?
Let me ask you  your parents  what did your father do for a living? {

I says  the price of livings going higher  and my family was getting bigger now  I cause I had I had two two child ren right in a row  one right after the other practically.
And they procured these papers for me  for some other people  including a friend who was part of that distant family by the name of Albert Herszkowitz.
And so its sad time  but what I was really amazed to see  how many friends we saw all the time  family and friends  also.
I knew that town before the war  because I went to visit his mother there  his family  his mother and father  who liv ed already with his sister  who was converted.
Without anybody But the six of us became like family   because we had nobody  really nobody.

Then some of the Sawinski family had some Jews in hiding and they didn't want to keep them anymore.
The only family I know  the real family  were the Munzers .
But no  no  but my mother  of course  spoke German with her friends.
Oh  but I mean in your family  was there somebody who knew how to play?
The Jewish family  girls are not supposed to work which was very terrible for me.
who -- who vouched for my family  for who -- I am where Im coming from  so I felt all of a sudden so well in that center.
How do you think you were able to form a bond with your wife  for example  thats lasted as long as it has and youve created a family thats been very stable together.

And because of that our families were put in a camp.
>> Bill Benson: And once Hitler did come to power  soon after that your parents made a huge decision to leave Germany.
And I think it's probably something that remained with my family when they went to Berlin  even.
So  I was first on the outskirts of Vienna  and this family who I crossed with  their names were Fisher  and they were related to my stepmothers first husband.
For inst ance  my -- not my -- my -- my cousin  Mia Bauer Pinkas  she had the large family on her fathers side  th-the Bauers.

But one family that did go was my uncle with his wife and two children.
Can you tell us in a few word s about your backgroun d  your  your family lif e  your school years in  in Czernowitz?
What -- what did you hear  and what did you know about what was happening back in Germany?

Was there ever earlier -- or ever  that you remember  any talk of your family leaving Hungary   perhaps trying to go to a neutral country  just out of Europe  lets say.
11 Anyway  the custom was that the black men  the young men who worked for the family   would walk us to scho ol  carry our lunch boxes  and pick us up.
But that family was my  the closest family because they were taking me to their country home when I was visiting them a lot with my little cousin.
They were coughing and they didn't want to endanger the other people  so they did not hide with the rest of the family.
But up until then  to tell you the truth  we didn't allow ourselves to think that they would take all these kids that came with me to the gas chamber...my mother  my grandfather  my grandmother and th e family that came with me  that these were the ones who went to a gas chamber to be gassed for no sin committed.
What now  were you at that time were you living with your mother and father?

Can you tell us about the liquidation of the ghetto  or are there -- excuse  but I dont know all the details  were you deported before the liquidation of the ghetto?

I know th at your family was religious  but I'm trying to get a sense of how they were integrated with community was.
Certain things -- for instance  we had -- before we ran away  we give to this Christian family to put away for us.
And so it was a very special my on my mothers side was a close knit family.
And to find out where the rest of the family was  she really couldn't tell them because she didn't know.
I say  whatever happens to me  if they take me out  they kill me  so they kill me.
And then the man was waiting outs ide  to-took us to the -- the -- his house  and started to ask about his family  he didnt know where his family is  and [indecipherable].
Y ou know  in my life  my family didn't ever betray me.
A nd -- and then there was a family -- there was a family dinner after that.

So we were on that  the whole family under the comforter and kept each other warm during the night.
Was Rollig  R-O-L-L-I-G. Would you say somethin g about your family background  your   your father  first his name and then what he did?
No  because in 1938 in Vienna   if you were Jewish  if you were part of a Jewish family  you really felt that you were Austrian before you were Jewish.
Uh the next morning my parents decided that uh there was one family by the name of wh o all along had lived uh way ou t of town.

Mostly my mother  my father and my brother and sister and my  my grandpa you know that.
When I was in my cousins apartment  it wasnt -- not very big apartment; other people helped my parents to get out -- of ghetto.
Y ou know  we had a huge family because my -- my grandmother had five boys and five girls.
But in my class  I think in 1941 or 1942  there were two kids  a family of Polish -Jewish immigrants -- or refugees.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know  once you had shelter  how your aunt and your mother were able to start to make ends meet so you could at least eat?
ﬁI thought you wouldnt be here  maybe you shouldnt be out.ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  its supposed to have melted by the time I drove home.ﬂ But I miss it  and I feel like this is my family.
My father  my mother  my sister  myself  and I think my grandfather.
Has  what is your feelings now religiously in a sense of  you said your family was quite secular.
We had a six room house  for family of six its not too much.
>> Bill Benson: When you went to Berlin  what was it like?
Speaking about your uncle  so you had an extended family that you were Yeah  my mother had two  had That you were close to.

And we went up the podium  and we thought that was it  the oath of office  and then the mayor started talking about the Willner family  and first of all it was the father  it was son is really taking his place  and then the mother [indecipherable] family  and this was completely unexpected by me or my wife  or my son.
Before that arrived  were you aware that -- did you have any sense  or did your mother or brother have any sense of -- of this -- Oh  I think my brother had a very real sens e. Whenever I discuss  for example  the trip on the San Louis with my brothe r  he always says he doesnt -- he could not understand  even though he was so young  he could not understand why  on the voyage going to the U.S.  before the boat was turned around  why were all these people dancing and doing all these jovial things  when they had just left their families behind  knowing they probably would never see them again  th ey had lost family members.
But he didn't lik e the family because they were too religious for him  so when he grew up  he didn't want to be a ba ker  so he became a shoemaker.

So then in the year 1938  when Hitler finally took over  what were the things that began to happen to you and to your family?
I assume that there were Jewish families  but that it was not a predominately Jewish . . .
talkover] Did you have  you mentioned that you had  you had many Jewi sh friends and that you had Jewish friends in your family an d your father had Jewish acquaintances and yet there  there was a growing perhaps sense of anti-Semitism especially after Hitler came in.

Even when I came back to my town--the reason I went back was because I thought maybe somebody from my family was alive still.
Like I said  my children were surrounded by survivors  they grew up with survivors  thats -- was their family.
Well-to-do family  the boy always had a little money  so we got along fine  and the food we got there was quite poor  and yet you could smell  German houses don't have ventilation systems like you have in modern structures  so you generally know whether somebody is cooking a roast a block away.
It is the the grain of the Jewish family  you know.
I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family and also I had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation there  too  because he was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that.
So this was very  very  very -- it -- it was terrible for me.
On my mother's side of the family only one brother returned  one person returned.
In the ghetto of course  the situation was disastrous because we had to share - in the ghetto we were assigned a room to share with another family.
You know  you keep on eating and eating  you try to full yourself up and and that was the wrong thing to do  bu t nobody said  and we were too naive to understand the whole thing  so When you were liberated  were wi you with any family or friends that you knew from before the war?

Frank Liebermann: Well  first of all  my grandfather  my mother's father  had a hobby of genealogy and he traced the family back to about 1700.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
They might have reverted to Polish because  still  my grandmothers sister and her husband came from Poland.
Now -- Also -- also  the children did not know we were Jewish.
Interesting  coming from a farm family himself  or a farming village himself.
My family was conservative   we adhered to all the holidays.
All the other members of the family  I mean  my uncles and their children  my aunts and their children  were living all around me  (?).
But the family camp was not close to us; it was close to the other people from her home town  or as we would call them in fighting groups of the trap.
And that wa -- no  the ma -- ma -- Im sorry  my mother was here  the rest of the family  right.
When Hitler came to power and I know this is probably hard for you to remember but you may remember through your parent s reactions or your brothers reactions  was there a feeli ng of fear about what was going on in Germany?

My mothers family was  my mother had family in Vienna who were Christian.
And that again  before -- beyond the stock taking  helped cultivate in me the sense of family and what -- how important  I mean the solidarity and the family solidarity is a very bi g  important value for me throughout my life and I believe those hard times instilled that value  and my mother deliber ately instilled it.
And she did come with an aunt of mine  who also wanted to come to Germany.
I have read...I have read a great lot about uh the Holocaust.
What did your parents tell you about their own childhoods and growing up?
I think if I had been like the woman who saw her family slaughtered one by one in the Polish forest  I dont think I could be like -- sitting here  talking with you like this.
My family  when I was growing up  kept me sort of isolated from the business end.
>> Bil l Benson: And  Susan  the deportation started and you and your family were deported to Riga  Latvia.
I would hope to get there with my grandchildren so they get a tangible sense of heritage  of -- of family history.
So we left that morning  after that wonderful family had housed u s that night.
That...that...that...I didn't know nothi ng about it  you know  and then we used to go...I I stayed in that farm from...we stayed there...there were another another another family that I...they were old...it was a very old Jewish man who was very religious.
What happened was  in the time that we were in Palestine  another brother of my father's  my Uncle Theodore  got to the United States through his wife's family.
I was very attached to my family  so when the war broke out  I worried so much about everybody  that Austria was not interesting to me.
Theres no home  no family and sincerely  many kind people say  ﬁNesse  you talk about the Holocaust and we dont see tears from you.ﬂ I really cried that time the last time.
What did you  personally Im not asking about your family what did you  the child  see?
Before we talk about the start of the war and the events leading up to and following the German occupation  perhaps you can start by telling us a little bit about your family and community life before the war started.
>> Rita Rubinstein: My grandmother was with us  my aunt  and my father's sister and her family  a nd also an older later -- older  probably in 40s 50s then.
So you were -- he was very close to your family anyway.
There was the Zi za  the Runjak family  my brother and I would spend some time with  especially Ludbr eg Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting.
I dont know how he felt about the Korean war  except for the fact that he was drafted and he had to go and he -- he was sort of brought up in a well-to-do family and he never experienced anything like the six weeks of basic training.
You know  some people look at their glass half full and some people look at it half empty and I thank God for [indecipherable] yes  it could have been different  but you know  life went on  I have a beautiful family.
I dont know where they found all these people  but it was -- it was a horrible -- I -- I think -- the whole horrible to s -- to think that the whole family -- of course  it happened to our people  too  but there is was visible to me.
>> Bill Benson: During that time what were your parents doing in Belgium?
We had two rooms and the ot her family had one room.
That his family could not endanger everybody else because everyone wanted to live and they had the right to live.
They were concentrating with each other and we all became survivors as a matter of fact we became like a family.
The hope of seeing my family again  that they would be still alive  somehow they would have escaped.
And we had a few cousins and my aunt and uncle and we wanted to be in New York.
It was a family affair and there was no room where to advance.
So  what it meant really  was that we had I mean  their families and so on and so forth  that we had family in this country  family is also whom family members in Germany had occasionally visited  as people once in a while did  not as often as they do now flying  but in those days by boat  and once in a while visited  so that the idea of another country where there was family  seemed a little bit more plausible  I think it would be fair to say.
But the whole family worked there  the sisters worked in the office  the three sisters.
Uh  well  we -- I know my parents were very  very upset.
Had you had any contact with your parents during this period?
>> Bill Benson: One of your relatives had left Germany in the mid 1930s.
It wasn't easy  actually  for people who are more or less established to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave.
I hav e them in my family tree but we  they do not wish to maintain contact.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: My mother's family  fortunately for them  besides the grandparents  they all left long before World War II.
And then we got introduced to each other  with my wife's family.

You know  you its that kind of I he he thinks that beca use I never had a family  he thinks that he is my my both parents togeth er.
So my case became in a court  in Israeli court  and it took long time in Israeli court  and finally the Israeli court decided that I have to be removed for religious reason from from Goldschmidt  from my foster family.
From then on  I was going here  and working  and go to night school  and – and joining like wherever I look ed for some family stuff Š somebody to find in the United States.
>> Bill Benson: At one point when the war was over and your father is back  sounds like there is an attempt to re -establish kind of a normal life  people getting jobs  tell us what your father did to get himself reestablished at that time.
Then when I went to my parents  it was my mother was an artist.
A : And we've tried  you know  to -- as best as we can  you know  to instill that in our family.
Bill Benson: And what's your family was considered -- because they had businesses and were considered bourgeois  your family was fearful that you would end up getting sent to Siberia .
My sister  as I mentioned before  had been working with the family in Hamburg  so they we re all in Hamburg.
And you know my father was helping various other more distant relatives.
He had his family and his sister  so -- were older than I was -- or he wasnt  but th-thi -- he had older sisters  and they taught us how to dance  and -- and they were the -- the hoi polloi of the area  actually  for that matter.
So I came into my house  my father was happy to see me and this and that  he had one room  my father  my sister  the other ones  another family lived there  okay.
So she retained that period of of of the family as though it was encased in am ber.
In Buczacz  this family that we lived with  their daughter had survived and I did get to s get to see her in the United States eventually  but Im not really sure.
I had known people who left Germany  who are not Jewish  because they understood that this was a country they couldn't live in.
Uh with family values  the old traditional values being perhaps even more respected than if we hadn't been through this as a family together.
Because they had a family  they had still business to in Germany .
We record this as family member names  so that we have everything accurate.
I couldn't understand everything  but that Hasidishe family  they were quite fluent in German.
And not long ago when a Catholic did want to marry a Protestant  he had a hell of a time  not very long ago  fifteen years ago  ten years ago  he was an outcast in his family.
And they left me in the care of the French family who owned the hotel.
And they came by with these big bins of food  and dol ed out enough food for every family.
The irony is that when that family was relocated  the f ather said -- allegedly said  \ At least my children will have something to eat.\
All right  I will tell you about my family first  but before I start  I wanted to say something why I am here and why I was hesitating for a long time to tell my story.
So  of the rest of your family so that s three brothers.
And so we start asking them questions  we were bombarding them  they were the first humans inside  I said  so what happened to the whole people  what happened to the family? ?
Now  was there any talk of your family of trying to leave that area  or at this point?
I had very good friends and they never knew I was ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 Jewish.
Get your parents  school teacher  principal  rabbi  or priest to help you but don't leave that person unattended.
They spoke Yiddish and my father was probably Russian and Yiddish.
But we were  of course  stra ngers and first stayed with my family in Tilburg  and later on I came to live in Amsterdam.
So there can be -- even though the number of my mothers family is finite  when I see pictures of hundreds  they all become related to me in a sense because anyone of them coul d have been a true family member.
Thats why I s it was a meeting on the From the family.
A. Yes  he came here -- he was invited by -- there was a very famous doctor who invited him and he went to England and he got a heart attack in England and then Doctor Goodmacker  you must have heard he's the one who's making the family tree  and he took him over and he came.
I cant afford that salary.ﬂ But I said  ﬁBut we were such good friends.ﬂ He said  ﬁWell  from now on  as long as youre in Aspen  every Friday night  we will have dinner in my family home.ﬂ So... and we did that  just every Friday  I usually work late Fridays  so they had an early dinner  just so I can come.
For me  it felt that our family lived in this town forever.
Well  the Zhaglietski family are still with us  but in the meantime  we find out that my father was in the the as prisoner of war  and somehow landed in the pri as a prisoner of war with the Zhaglietski .
This was -- we stayed with the family  with the Sawinski family.
You so but some part of your family was in Krakow   which would have been part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the 19 th century.
My father  mother spoke Polish but used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
My sister used to be so beautiful w hen she was a child.
But thats important for our family  that he was retreating with his people.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.
The uncles and their families we were 80 people strong in our immediate family.
I think I think that Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Otz an d and maybe the rest of Mary s family that she was close to  I think they realized that I felt different.
The family I lived with  the husband worked in a shoe factory owned by a Jewish man  and he put a sign up on the bulletin board  \ Anybody willing to take one of these children that are coming\  so that's how they got me.
I'll tell you the true  I don't  I went through now a lot  too  last year with my husband being very sick and all the family wanted me to put him away and I didn't  I took care.
I was so detached from my family  from life  from the outside world  from life itself  th at I never thought about them.
>> Bill Benson: When was your father able to begin to resume his work and his life after the war?
Ill tell you right away  from a viewpoint of the family type  they really liked me a lot  but I was never included.
And I neve r went up to look how they a-accommodated with a -- a family occupies one of the three s ections of the bunk  or above each other  or -- And how -- how were the -- do you know how the bunks were set up?
So how did the family  knowing that your father and at least one other relative were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 in Holland  how did you make your way to Kenya and what did that involve?
Uh...I remember a family by the name of Deutsch  father  mother and two children who...they set up a shop in the most busy street in Lisbon which is called the Sheadu.
During the war did your parents ever talk about the political situation in Europe ?
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo : My family  they all came from a small little town which was then in Poland before World War I -- was in Austria .
>> Bill Benson: When you finally reunited with your father  what was that like?
It its again  it helps to document that side of the family  and their experiences  and what what happened to him  and what happened to everyone.
My mom and also my aunt  my mother's sister  was with us at the time.
One of the reasons  while we ar e on this subject that we had knowledge of what was happening on the ninth fortress is because one of the young men in the early selections was taken out and got hit in the foot  and when they hit him in the foot  he fell into the grave and his mother a nd the rest of the family and th e rest of the people fell over top of him.
Even you come back to Holland  I reme mber I walked all over and -- and all the places where the whole family was and -- and it was nothing there.
Yes  there was money in the family before  but he also did very well  and I remember my mother telling me that he would come ho me and take out from his pockets lots of money saying  ﬁYou have brought me a lot of luck  Clairehen  Claire.
So one of his brothers -- two of his brothers  one survived but the family just lost the connection during and after the Holocaust with them.
Then we got a -- eventually what happened to the family that went eventually to fr iends was that my aunt was taken from the street of Paris to a death camp.
Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 2 Now I know you have been interviewed previously so we wont spend a lot of time on your war time experiences  but I would like to get a sense of what happened to you in the sense of who your family was.
My sister was nine years older than I  and I had a brother  a little boy  who was almost as old as I was.
So then what -- And you se -- oh  oh  excuse me  but during that period  all the time th e -- the Germans would shoot -- execute people  there was one innkeeper  he got caught because he and his family had been receiving some weapons parachuted down.
Can you tell me a little bit about your parents and grandparents ?
Did you talk to them about what did happen to you during the war?
A. Through my mind that my family is probably no longer is alive.
During that short period  four peop le of our family died.
37 Yeah  because it was a more secure family who had some men  and Auntie Ada  he was a lonely woman with a child  so she wasnt very secure.
Of course  school are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning  half d -- half day school on Saturday  so we just arrived there wh en the children left  and I was waiting until they are all out  and then I walked in with my family and took them into the school building.
The question never was an issue  because my mothers family was n-neither.
Did anyone else live with you in the house  or the apartment?
Okay  this was Mr. Bozym  who was the father of the -- of th e family and he was a carpenter and he is the one that I worked with at that German infantry unit in the -- the artillery unit where I was injured working with him at the time.
So  can you tell me a little bit about your parents  their names  and any siblings?
The Gorky family  were they were they easy to be with  even though they were strangers  or was this difficult?
So were -- were you observant as Jews in the house  and you went to synagogue?
And when you went to school  you went to school with non-Jewish children?
Do you remember wi -- in your childhood  wa s it a very religious family  in spite of the fact that your father wasnt raised th at way  but because of [indecipherable] My father adjusted to -- I would -- I would have to put it that way  my father did a good job adjusting to -- to my mothers orientation  re ligious orientation.
>> Estelle Laughlin: We were the only family of three in the group.
And did you have a family by then  were you married?
And did you observe the hol -- the Jewish holidays at home?
To the best of my knowledge  my family has lived and was born in Germany for 400 years.
We did-didnt have much land  it was just like a small farm.
So one of the things I f -- my father -- I felt my -- with my father  was j -- he -- my famil -- my fathers family originated in the medieval Frankfort ghetto.
No  its too dangerous  and Ill tell you  I couldnt take a part in the running away  anyway  because they told us that if someone runs away  first the family and then ten other people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one.
And that was pretty brave because if they had been found out by the Nazis  their family would have been not doing well.
>> Bill Be nson : During that time  you still had your mother and father .
And some of my family went at that time  like my aunt went to Palestine at that time  in her -- thir -- in the 30s.
>> Frank Liebermann: As we got -- as we located the relatives that my grandfather found  my father took a trip to New York and also had the family job of finding out if there were any other relatives because on my mother's side there was a family -- one of the family married Michael Gratz who became prominent during the revolutionary time in Philadelphia and founded a college.
>> Al Munzer: Well  unfortunately  the husband and wife in tha t family had a fight  and the husband denounced his wife to the Germans as hiding two Jewish children  and so they took his wife and my two sisters.
I only lived with that hope that I will meet my family.
And luckily -- I mean lu ckily  but luckily  none of my family actually went and were killed  but we saw it all around us  obviously.
They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place  putting on a show and inside they were actually really making  sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and  and  so I was always  it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at what seems safe at the moment.
And I think this is little bit too far gone  so the family notice something too close friendship here in between us.
And so the only family I remember thats from the town  but we had really nothing in common in -- except they were my pa -- father patients.
He had the family face and the age was also right.
He was no big intellectual  he was and kind of frowned upon by that part of the family  because all we wanted to do  my sister and I  was go to college.
And so anyway thats the family  and I worked half a da y and went to school half a day.
The family moved to a neighborhood of Iasi where Nathan's father  Anton  was able to keep cows and his mother Fanny bartered dairy products in exchange for tutoring their children.
>> Bill Benson: Your grandparents and your great grandparents  tell us what happened to them during that time.
And we kept  mother kept a kosher home and I re member sitting upstairs with the women and the men were downstairs in our synagogue.
>> Susan Taube: We have how many doctors in the family?
>> Bill Benson: And then you were born  of course  a year later.
I have one other memory that is funny things that stick in your mind  which I dont think I told anybody about in the family.
I left the same day for Switzerland  where we had an exchange program [indecipherable] family  and we were due a few more weeks.
>> Edna Friedberg: What other members of your family were with you when you arrived?
And then in July -- >> Bill Benson: That would have been your father.
Yeah  I realize it at -- at very young age  and the question was just what you have to do  you have to start to be like [indecipherable] resistant to this  or you have to find some way -- ways how to in future support your family  and things like this  and do anything against  lets say  your family.
What are can you remember what are some of your earliest memories?
And I to ld them the experiences I had during the war  and why they don't have family  and I urged them  one day you will have a family  and you will tell your children what went on  and sure enough  my children know  and now their little children  my little granddaughter wants to know what my number on my arm is.
As a matter of a fact  I didnt mention it to you  but my parents had four children.
We had a  I had a favorite dish which was called Pechaf which is a  there was a Pecha but this was not Pecha   this is Pechaf which was our own family thing.
Whether this was a family that lived there  I cant remember the connection.
Also we were there like six weeks doing nothing  just sitting there and talking about your family  about your home  reminding yourself what you did when it came a holiday and things like that  doing nothing.
My wife family had kept a kosher home  so we started out with that in mind  but we are quite liberal by now.
She got a -- and I'm happy that -- mostly happy that two children that raised in a nice way  you know  and I am happy  too.
You mentioned a couple of times that your family before the war and now were not observant of the faith.
After the services there was a Je wish family in Berlin who had lived under ground  meaning they had been hidden by German gentiles all during the war and who had come back to their home which had not been destroyed  wh ich  by the way  I found out that the house that my parents and I had li ved in was bombed to the ground.
Did you want to go back to Hungary at that point?
>> Michel Margosis: Connect with my father  with the whole family.
Heres a very  you know  quote  normal family that was split apart.
The one question I wanted to ask before the tape is going to run out is what did  happened in your family when school was no longe r possible for you.
Did your uncle regularly send money so to your family and to Taya and to his father.
And he was connected with the family  was th e son-in-law and this doctor  this Mr. Wilhelm   Dr. Rayakovich had to ld him the story.
Who would you say you you were close to  of those who were surrounding you?
So Im but  you know  I dont think its one thing to read about horrible things in the paper  or in history books  but when you see it through your own family  or your mother or grandparents  its very dark.
No  no  no  not the family  not the -- none of the family.
29 End of Tape #2 30 Tape #3 Now  I'm just trying to remember where we were when we stopped.
I dont know to -- to this day the name of the farm family who took me in.
So when my mother explained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster  Rya being an altruistic  kind and religious teenager said  well Ill take her home and hide her with me  without any thought to the consequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself  her family  the entire village  the future  I mean  you know  nothing.
And did they know your parents were Jewish  and what that meant? (
And the family was always firs t. And other things which I heard when I was home is that my mother was pregnant but she had a miscarriag e and I was very much the child that she wanted so much and I wa s loved unconditionally by my parents.
My father had been there and he came back before the war.
She sees -- runs in the family  my grandmother was shortsighted.
She survived -- no  she survived not in my aunt s town --where she was taken to that Christian family.
And my mother -in-law  was a very energetic woman  and brother -in-law were in the familienlager [ Ger: family camp].
When she refused to leave the family nest and go to such a faraway place  he left without her.
But then when my father was -- when we moved into the -- into this ghetto building  my father went to work and he was the only one who was -- of the family who was able to go out and work.
And where were you with part of your family s till  or living alone  or living with your mother?
So he already had a kid  a first kid was born.
We stayed only one night  and after the Aktion was over  the next day we returned back to the ghetto  and by that time we lost everything  a lot of my friends  a lot of my family.
And so due to a local partisan pastor  who was also the town doctor  we were able to get away cause he had made a certificate saying my father had a dangerous illness and couldn't be moved and he also arranged for my family to get fake ID's that enabled us  with fake names that enabled us to finally leave this village and the rest is recorded  you know  what followed after that is recorded in the original video I made for the Holocaust Museum in Washington.
>> Manny Mandel: We were sectioned off into a men's section  barracks  into women's barracks and family barracks.
And as a matter of fact there is a family tale about my English knowledge.
After that  tell us what led up to the uprising and then what the immediate effect was for you and your family.
What about being aware of what was happening to the Jews?
3 Holocaust  let's start first with you telling us about your family  your community  and yourself in Kozienice before the war began.
His pangs for family were strong enough  and we were able to do that.
To obtain an education  to become a successful research chemist  to serve my country in the army and in the civil service  and to have a loving family to be immensely proud of.
I know many of my family went to Palestine  but I can tell you that already ye-years before that  in 1933  when Hitler came to power  already in that ti at that time they had what they called Hasharah.
Early on  as they were there quite a long time and and became sort of a part of the family  I mean   really even had Christmas trees for the maids  which we enjoyed too  at Christma stime.
indecipherable] Interview with Susan Berlin March 7  2003 28 Can you give me a little insight into what was going on in your family with your parents and -- and their feelings a nd their anxieties  their worries  how you were feeling during the 40s when the war was raging.
So when I started to prepare for this road from south...he was from Yugoslavia  which was south  ....uh...to the cold vicinity of Kovno  Russia...former Russia  my own family asked me  \ Are you crazy?
And her family had never really done anything for me  that I told you [indecipherabl e] were invited to any of the things.
And th-the rest of his family were in the Soviet Union  that we never met them  we never saw them and I dont know them up to -- up to date  even.
But you know  on the other hand   I am so grateful that things turned out relatively well for our family.
Do you remember your parents ta lking about the Nazis before they came in  when they were in power in Germany in 1933?
Uh my family consisted of my parents and an older brother  brother who was six years older and it was a as I remember it a nice life really for for us.
We tried to ev erything what the Germans say  I remember  once  uh  out of the window that I saw a whole family from my hometown  uh  walking  whole family  father  mother and children  and I  I just  I  uh  uh  was maybe sure that they wouldn't see me  but when they would have seen me  wh-what would I have said?
There are there is this thought among psychologists that children who have been adopted  and know that they are adopted  Interview with Annette Fein November 7  2008 48and had the good luck to gr ow up in a in a loving family  sometimes nevertheless have a feeling inside that someone at one point rejected them  because they were adopted in the first place.

Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 19 Yeah  sure  yeah.
So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for the family.
Like  when my son was Bar Mitzvah  Jake had a large family that came from all over.
So anyway  the police tried to get to know from me where I was hidden  but I didn't want to tell because I thought I know there was another Jewish family there  and they have a chance then to  to get away.
We have been back to see this family   his children and his children's children.
And then my family engaged 41 her to teach me Italian.
Okay  if you want to continue telling me recollections of -- of this early period when the Nazis came.
>> Bill Benson: Now  although your mother hid with you the neighbor  the neighbor  you told us  eventually arranged for you to end up with the Madna family.
We were put in a one -room -- one room with several families in other rooms.
Tell me a little bit about your father  your mother  and any siblings you might have had.
There was here a family o -- which  she was a survivor  and he married Eva  a lovely woman  and she was so nice to us.
And he and his wife and son had one room  and here -- the landlady gave my parents a room  but she had no other space  she said she w ould in two weeks  and my sister and I were in 43 another building that belonged to her  under the roof.
And being I was so young and I had -- I really had an aptitude to learn quickly languages and I learned it within a few months.
And was her family also in this Vinnytsia - Kiev area?
Tell me a little bit about your mo ther and fathers own family histories.

My mothers family has lived there at least since the middle of the 18th century  as far as our records show.
I -- I can -- i -- by -- in my family if I say turn left  all the kids say turn right.
Did you ever talk within your family about what had happened during the war or was this kind of a moot subject?
>> Bill Benson: At some point soon after you were forced into the ghetto.
So this he was  my father was the first victim from our family.
break] So you remembered we were talking about where in Italy your family returned to.
Thats partly the family situa tion  but still  youre always on trains  theres really no really permanent home  my -- all -- everybody rented  yes.
I had two little cousins  a girl my age and her brother who was maybe three  two or three.
And she was hidden by this family in Holland  a Christian family in -- who had another girl  right  a daughter  you know.
Mother Mother had more expression I think basically and she enjoyed things more.
Uh except at certain moments when I felt that it wasn't completely like other families  like like the Swedish playmates were  like they had their family life uh because we're living in a foreign country  all the time speaking about going back to Denmark.
There was one family that took in some Jews  but they were already sleeping on the floor  there were so many of them.
The Meyers were not the church going family  much to the disappointment of my grandfather.
This is all pre-Nazi  and Did you did you have best friends amongst all the children?
My grandparents spoke and I guess my fath er knew Yiddish  but we  you know the children  with my mother and father we only spoke Hunga rian.
Some of it is instinct  but you mentioned that your family is -- is a family full of very strong characters also.
Did your parents ever explain what was going on in Europe to you  or did you just hear them speaking with other adults?
Her family  which was another family in Ludbreg left also  and had left be fore this proclamation and they cleverly did not return.
One of them wa s that if the young people in the family would register  the old people would not be taken.
And everybody got a corner of a room  a whole big family got a corner of a room  and agai n you had to sleep on the floor.
It was a large family so I was too young for then to know the details of it but it was a very friendly with his brothers.
Grandmother - after all  we had a tremendous family  extended family  on my mothers side especially.
My mother's family  my mother's birth mother  real mother died in childbirth in 1904 when my mother was born and her father then re-married and the woman whom he re-married then ultimately came to live with us  that is in the same city when we were in Belgium and Brussels  I guess that's the time when I remember her most vividly.

In fact my first job in America was as a governess  for a family who went in the country for and he was a plastic surgeon  and he kept telling me  ﬁI will not charge you.ﬂ 6 Andzia Ptasznik USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0078 14 Of course those were my childhood days  and really  I was absolutely green about everything.
Used to have a big big family from my mothers side  and my fathers side.
Were your parents able to get anything out of Germany when when they left?
Can you tell me his date of birth and where he was born?
From my one and only aunt that came to the United States just before the war and pictures from her and making copies whatever I can get  anything and as many pieces of information I'm able to collect from the couple of surviving members of the family and it's basically genealogy but I am not going back very far because right now I'm not well  but I want to do this for those of my  members of my family who were killed and even those few who survived and I would like this  to give this for my children  who did not know their aunts  uncles  grandparents or cousins  so that they will know their family  at least through these pictures and whatever information I can gather and write down for them.
Well  I came from Budapest  Hungary; my father had eight seve n brothers.
But they were not in a Jewish home in a sense that I'm not religious at all.
There were several people in New York   as well in Chicago   who knew my parents.

phone ringing] Yeah  i-it was many  many years later  in California that I  by accident  met another member of my fathers family  and actually a second cousin.
And her last maid  she had been with my grandmother for many years and she was a ve ry faithful family friend and she was the 87 last one who could afford even to buy black market food  but she was a very modest and simple person and she claimed she didn't even need all the food that she was getting on her ration cards.
Now let me ask you something  cause it strikes me that you -- I dont know if you feel somewhat schizophrenic in the United States wh en youre 20 and 21  but when the war happens  and your family is over there  and youre here re latively safe  that must be really hard for you.
Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 3 An-And your mothers family?

Marcel's family fled German -occupied Paris in Vichy in the summer of 1942.
And  and being that I came from a family that that there was no such a thing as ever to take anything uh  without asking  that was a very  this is what shocked me that I could have changed that much because when I was in a recuperating place  and I was there in Prague  uh  be-because at the train station  the red cross was handing out sandwiches and packa--I was on my way to Budapest because this was our meeting place  and somebody recognized me  a friend of my husband's  of my late husband's recogni zed me that I am the fiance of  of this Joe Klein  and  and he recognized me so he came over a nd he said  \ You know  Joe is alive  and he is here in a  in a recuperating place.

And I went there  and I asked about the family  and they told me  \ Yes  they're alive  they  they survived the selection and they're working in a factory.\
And as went to Lodz  we could sit in...in the... It was already a Jewish organization there  and we could put our names on the list to find family.
And in addition to us  one of my cousins -- the uncle and the aunt who we stayed with  they had a son and a daughter.
And -- And tell me -- and tell me a little bit also about -- about religious holidays for your family.
I was -- I had to -- to assume always the worst as far as the re st of my family is concerned.
A si a sister  I think  a sister-in-law  or a sister Interview with Paula Blue August 7  2009 52of my my aunt  my uncles wi fe came to visit her family in New York   and she that ti and my uncle said to contact contact me to come to Canada .
And the oldest sister came to the United States and lived near us and as I said  I considered her truly an aunt and a member of the family and had a lot of fondness for her  and m -- when she cam e to -- we had her come to the United States and when she came to New York and couldnt live there any longer  we moved her to Rockville and we looked after her there.
And from the postcards that your family sent to you  did you have a sense that their life changed over those two years?
After the Night of Broken Glass nobody  no Jewish family  wanted to stay in Germany.
People who had said  ﬁNo  I cant help you  Im too frightened  not for me  but for my family -- what can I do to help?ﬂ And I suspect that in any underground movement  but I -- I only know Italy  when there is this kind of naked brutality  people will emerge  who will take fa r higher risk to help the victim than they had been willing to risk before.
And then the discussion with the family and my father said  no  we're going to stay together.
Therefore they already were involved in the family business  while I and my younger brother were going to this very famous high school.
Here I am again  no belongings  no clothing  just visiting this family.
My mother suffered a nd my family  and they explained we agree with you.
Did you have any sense  up to that point  of being a Jew?
We went from Warsaw to this town where my parents were too.
What was it like growing up as a Jew  particularly since your family was as prominent as it was?
Jill's family decided to emigrate from Germany  and in May of 1939 they left for Kenya.
And I told them the story of my family  showed them photographs of me with Mima and then at the very end  I said  you know  I have almost no memories of Mima except that she used to sing a lullaby to me.
The book that I am referring to  which is my collection that I put together so far  which is a work in progress  I have entitled  ﬁHolocaust documentation to the suffering of the Lakritz - Weber family  1934 to 1945 .ﬂ On the cover is a page of my family  my father  my mother  my brother and I on the beach in the city of Kiel  Germany when I was a little over two years old and my brother was a -- a few months old.
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother as people.
And then the family had this In 't Hout family  they had a larg e circle of frien ds and a large circle of family.
Yeah  that That you that the the larger family the whole f the yeah  they all survived  right.
Well  I was the youngest  and I didnt have  but as I told you in one of the stories  that my sister-in-laws had little children  a four and a six year old.
And Hani a  of course  was the main force behind it because she was the family genius - she had all the books.
>> Bill Benson: At some point  Estelle  you and your family were still in the ghetto.
The night that we arrive and called Be lgrade at midnight of April 5 th or 6th and speak to the family  and they say ev erything is quiet  we shouldnt be crazy.
They have two children  so I am a grandfather and I have two grandchildren.
A My mother  my father  my sister  my little brother and myself.
And the the invasion came to Holland  which was in May of 1940  my parents  all of them  all of this family  was already in the United States.
Okay  well first  a slight correction would be that my family would not be cared for.
Do you count yourself as a well-to-do family because your father was a physician  or was that not as such a prestigious post as it is in the United States  for example?
An d I was going to start Hunter College in September  but my Aunt had a big family reunion.
Here we are  mothers with children  sisters  everybody was holding on to each other not to lose somebody because the crowd was big.
And we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family  \ You are free but you have to come back very soon.
Now  I understand that Life went on  and you knew that politics we re about changing and the family people coming to prison– The constitution remained everyone is equa l  but Adolphus was saying that this was a Christian state.
Oh sure  you know  we first thing we saw was that they were ki pu putting them making them wear Star of David  yellow Star of Davids on back and the in the back  on the front.
And that theyll help us and everybody from among the nine of us had family in the United States  so we should come to  go to Paris and from there the organizations w ill take over.
Now  a day late r  hours later  I lost my whole family and I didn't shed a tear.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 17 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: other working places.
My parents spoke Yiddish to each other  Russian to their kids  and we kids spoke French.
So my my father sent my mother and then my younger sister Lola to Hungary  to Uszura   it was a a city about about 30 miles from Michalovce   because she had there her family.
I dont -- I think -- I dont -- See  I dont remember exactly h-how old I was at each of these things  but I sort of made little friendships wi th people  and there was a little girl called USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 27 Joanie Cummings  who lived in the next hous e  and her mother was divorced  which was pretty unusual at that ti -- there were a fe w divorced people on the block  actually  but it was still kind of unusual and I remember f -- we would talk a lot  I mean she w -- she came from -- I mean  I came from a family that really treasured  or -- or was intent on education  and she came from the exact oppo site.
My first instinct was to go to a Christian family we knew over there.
My father didnt have any relatives in -- in Vilno  where I was born  because he was born in Poland and he had a sister in Poland  in Zamusht.
My uncles and I have lo ts family  and everybody been dead  killed.
They es caped  they ended up in the Pyrene es with quite a few members--her sister was there with her family.
Last year we had the niece that we met at the wedding with her family and some they came with a big group of tourists and they came from New York and one of the stops was the Holocaust so we met them at the museum there.
My sister is -- lives in Israel  and she also has a son and a daughter.
Tell me a little bit about your family  with your parents  starting with your parents.
I had one nice experience  you know  I lived in and a very strange experience I lived in a in a room whic h I rented from also a refugee family and I got quite friendly with one of the girls.
The first time that the whole family and my circle knew about it is in 45 when they started to show the films.
I remember my family I had in Amsterdam knew about it  and they sent me some sometimes things to jail  but  I do I was in a cell with  seven several eight  nine women.
I have a Jewish mother  I have a Jewish father  and obviously I was Jewish.
So Ill I dont know  I mean it theres so many changes in that just in the medical technology becaus e in my family is so many doctors.
Laughter] >> Bill Benson: The fact that you had a car was unusual  that the family had a car; r ight?
They said if they dont find him  the Jewish community would not find that man  they would kill the people from the house  this family.
There was only one more family in Celleneuve  thats the one that told u -- told us about the apartment.
His was an unusual family in that most of his siblings -- and there were 12 siblings -- had all  except for one  preceded him in death.
Did your parents have to work at that time  outside of the ghetto or inside?
They wanted that many young people  let's say single people  the oldest from the family  supposedly for labor.
>> Bill Benson: So now you're forced out of your home and forced into a ghetto.
They were the only Jewish family  in fact  that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return  actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning  and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisanheld territory in Kordun.
If you refuse -- and they said if you refuse  then you will not belong to our family anymore.
I understand moving away from a country  and from family  and going to another country and starting to make a life there.
Was this a fai was this an area of activity that there were more Jews than in other areas  or was this just a pure coincidence that we were I think was that I I dont know for a fact  but I think a lot of Jews  for instance  our family  my father and his father were worked together.
They were always close and I was thanking God that we did not have my -- money -- enough money so the whole family will go to -- to Minsk  otherwise I would have not been able to -- to run away and then -- and this is what happened to a lot of young people who stayed  did not go away because they could not leave their mothers or -- or fathers.
And then in July -- >> Bill Benson: That would have been your father.
I heard that there were two marriages and that it was a mixed family.
So for we moved in an apartment  it was in the Bronx.
Well  right now I'm happy in the states and I have my family here.
And was that okay with you  was it -- Yes. -- [
And there was the school  of course to which I went.
We gave up the hope that we will meet anybody or find our family more or less.
He took me for his hand and for a hour  he walked with me; asking me all kinds of questions and family.
But anyway  this policeman warned my father that things were going to get really bad and that he should get out of the country and get his family out.
What did -- what did you know about your -- your parents at this point?
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
Then my aunt she was the aunt  my mother's sister  her kids  four of them.
Lets now talk about your mother and how they met  about your mothers background?
And they be ma my English fo ster family remained friends with my parents and came to visit them in the United States.
Some didn't talk at all about it and some only to the closest friends or family members  what -- what really happened and these were not extermination camps  they were just sort of quote everyday brutalities committed by the SS.
But it was three days and I came over to the family and everything is fine.
Do not ever talk about your family and things that happened.
We didn't have too many people that came over  but it was largely a family affair and mostly grownups.
You dont have a family  with the same mother and father  and they have three  four kids  and all kids are the same.
They were -- they were also horrified  but it hadnt affected them as badly because many of our Jewish friends had family who had gone through some of these times  so they were more inclined to feel the horror that had occurred  wh ereas some of our American friend who were not Jewish heard about it  but it wasnt as hurtful as it was to us.
And..uh..the ...uh...I guess it was the family of the guide told us  \ Well  the only thing you can do is try it on your own.ﬂ And she said  \ Wait until about 2 o'clock when the border is unguarded.
And I got to talk to her  and she said her mother was Jewish.
Were you -- and -- were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?
And of course I was looking for somebody that I knew from my family  of course.
So that was very much so -- one of my limitations was that being from a observant family  there were many things I didnt do.
We we each member of the family was assigned to sit guard behind the window.
So the memories and the -- the -- of the tradition were very strong with me.
Obviously  everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were very  very few employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family.
And they cannot talk to their children  to their present children and family about it at all.
I remember being asleep in one of the back rooms of the house and my sister Debbie coming to wake me up and carry me into the living room where the whole family was sitting in a circle.
The first ones we were able to bring here  my somebody in the family was engaged to somebody and I dont know  anyway  that was the first one to come  be sent an affidavit.
I was treated like part of the family  which at that particular time was again a novelty item for a Jew.
Did did you talk about when you were home  around the dinner table  the family.
But all I can say is that I hoped  til the vi ctory and even after that  to see my family again.
Again  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 some other people were living in there.
And we became very friendly with him  and I liked him  and -- but they moved to North Carolina and distance has its  you know  way of cutting into family ties  so I dont see him any more.
At that time  we were four children and my mother and father.
Yes  we had family  and pulled up to them for a few days  until we found . . . .
And my uncle from my mothers side  they are not religious at all.
Who were you with at the time  who in your family were you with?
>> Jacques Fein: A number of years ago  1986  I think  Judee and I visited a family.
What -- what a -- a funny sense it must have given you  of having been able to survive  when your own family was dyi ng.
My brother was in Harrow with his English family  and my sister was in Buxton with hers.
How did you learn about what happened to your distant family?
You take me  a little girl comes into -- married a guy that most of the family is Christian  Im Jewish  very  very brought up Jewish  come from the concentration camps  my husband was in a labor camp.
And since the whole family was in Grodno  resident family  they let them all go -- including me.
I have a very nice family and I hope that we stay well that I can do more what I want to do to help other people which is very  very important.
They left property behind  their pare nts  his parents  family  everybody behind to do that.
But anyway -- so  after the war  I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying  ﬁWell  what happened to your family?
Zolly this age had -- abou t 15 months or so  the grandmothers are both very proud and keep a very possessive hand on him  this was the latest sign of the family.
And it was that the f -- the four of us  our family and the other family  we were just walking.
Do you remember the name of the family that you sta Monk .
One member of that family  a nephew  this was a guy who was a communist who was actually in jail at the age of  I dont know  maybe 18 - 19  pre-war Yugoslavia and who was killed in -- it was a national hero and was killed in -- in the jail.
>> Bill Benson: And were able to stay at that point?
Who in your family was with you in the DP camp?
Yes  the families  if they were caught helping a Jew  they were in great danger.
So this was only one member of the family that because of Germans  but was buried Wa so what when did he die?
She brought us some bread with a little bit of butter on it  and again some kind of milk.
Did you have much contact with Polish people who were not Jews  or did the Jews pretty much stay with each other?
That I was not -- we were not alone  my family was not alone in having been helped.
We were put in a one -room -- one room with several families in other rooms.
Do you remember your parents talking about politics or talking about the Nazis in the household?
Slowly  slowly he started pushing  asking if there was anybody Jewish in the family  maybe t he father  grandfather.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little about your parents  besides their occupation.
So   we decided  since we have the horse and buggy that they gave to us  we'll send them to my mother's family.
My mother did write to family members and they finally did send Streptomycin.
Did you know any Jewish people when you were growing up?
Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really ostensible reasons that people would su spect  or even somebody would whisper and say -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews  whereupon both the family who were doing the sheltering  as well as the sheltered  knew that it was time to -- to move.
They figured that when the 9 ROUGH DRAFT COPY NOT A VERBATIM RECORD Germans came to arrest Jews  th ey would torture them to find out where the rest of their family was.
The -- these people who had to live there together  that means that two  three family in one room of the apartment  one corner  this family live on this mattress.
And a part of the family went to Shanghai   including him.
So non -Jewish family start to understand  and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost.
Because I believed in family and being t ogether  to the place where youre born  where you have friends  where you have family.
So they moved us with a whole family  but who -- we rented the apartment  they were [indecipherable] five people  six people.
As -- as far as I can -- as far as I can remember o -- for my family only.
We were put in a one -room -- one room with several families in other rooms.
You see  I had a father   my mother  a sister  br other  and the youngest brother.
She was very good to me  very good to me  because I caught on just like that  one  two  three.
And And in Germany  who whatever the the head of the household is the whole family considered stateless  takes on the nationality of the husband and the father.
And neither would my mother or father  or within the close-knit family.
And when the Germans came  her husband came and he warned  actually  my family.
And its amazing if you think about what the results of that sort of thing is because I wouldnt have met my husband if I hadnt been at Wellesley and I wouldnt have had the family or the life Ive had or any of those things  except for when I went to college basically.
Because my father was afraid  if we sleep separately  we going to be to taked we gonna t-take we lose ourselves  like this Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 66 That your brothers were like this we were one family.
So why dont you tell me what you reme mber about the circumstances of the choice being made to go to the Philippines and how the other people around you  your family  the Jewish community reacted when you told them what you planned to do My father as you know was in the lumber business.
The people lived a few houses down the street  was staying in the same street  playing with the same kids  same atmosphere except that this family was a little perhaps a little mo re  had a little more empathy for refugees than the other one.
And I was assigned to Nu ssensens who were lovely warm large Jewish family with two sons.
Some of us stayed with the brother and his family and some of us stayed with friends  I think.
I would go to the piano  which was almost in every house of a middle class family  and I would pl ay whatever I heard people singing and so they started me very early -- I was four years old.
They found a Catholic family to  with whom I could live in Geneva.
Which leads me to ask  in all those years  or even -- even before they left Germany  were -- your parents did not live in a Jewish community  but were they religious?
And seeing that I was a refugee at one time  we kind of did little sponsoring.
But when I came back after my escape I went down to Barnier de Bigor  because there I had friends  and I knew the family  Spearer   who liv ed there  would probably take me in because that's the family I stayed with after I ran away from Coterrey  and then I was deported  and then I came back to them.
When were you -- when did you have to go and live in the ghetto?
She was born in -- in the German part of Czechoslovakia  and sh -- that family was religious.
And how come you were the only one in your family that decided to go?
>> Bill Benson: He made it out to the United States.
We are not a religious family although my parents had a kosher home  for one reason.
The family we were not a big family  four kids  father and mother.
And the man said  I'm going to Budapest and to my family  and I will help you  and put up the kettle and raised it up like a helmet and right over the head and the water right over the head and spilt it.
A deportee from Hungary  called Magda  who was 14 years old and had lost her whole family  was a kapo.
There were a couple Jewish families  but these people very much older.
He had three brothers and one sister  so at the time of the Anschluss there were my father  his three brothers and his brother-in-law and father and various of these uh family members were liv ing in different parts of the world manning 2 branches.
But once the ghetto started  they were able to move back.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what happened to your parents and about your brother as well.
And the day he died  before the age of 12 or about  I suddenly became the old man of the family  and I had to take care not only of five grown-up sisters of mine and a constantly sick mother  but I had to take care of four horses and six cows and 12 chickens and porcupines.
Because  you know  if you  for a whole year  you know  show no heart  no not n-no interest in in somebodys life  and twice a year  you know  you want to show other people that you are a good family  you know.
>> Bill Benson: And  Peter  when you were in the ghetto  you were in there with several other relatives.
At that point were you placed with a family  or was it an institutional situation I was and when I was Evacuated.
Do you remember talking about it with your parents or what your feelings were?
Now-- Tell me-- Before we go before  tell me about your life before the war  about your family  about your childhood.
So Did you have any other relatives that you left behind in Germany?
My two sisters were placed with a very devout Catholic family.
I wa s delirious after the blood taking  obviously I became very light headed and delirious  and we walked hand in hand in the line with my family and all of the sudden I kept on standing aside  I  I left the row  I was outside  and as the gun was pointed at me by the German  somebody miraculously pulled me back into line and stuck something sweet in my mouth  and that revived me  and because I kept on running after the  the trucks.
So I briefly told him what had happened to me and -- and also that I wa s actually together with a family of friends and that we needed some personal protection and then he -- he told me I should  as soon as possible  bring the whole family  he wants to meet them.
Saturday nights when we would have company  in the 1950s if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn you would have bagels and lox for dinner  and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk .
Interviewer: When did you realize that you had lost your family?
And all of 25 - all of the family start to work -- to work  you know  hard.
Some  very few  found family and made new lives for themselves.
If they are 2 years old  I hear people speaking but they speak their family story what they heard.
Probably it was a combination of being worried that they would leave me again  maybe it was that I had a new family name  I had friends  I was in school  I was comfortable  and it was very difficult for me.
He had to learn that somewhere  either from his family or his cultu re  in the neighborhood.
>> Bill Benson: What was it like for you and your family when you were forced into the ghetto?
So my immediate blood family from the war is only two who are alive.
And the waiting in Toronto with the family would not be easy  I assume.
Now I was in law school in St. Lawrence University  Brooklyn  and at this time...it was getting clos e to 1940...it was in '38 and '39  and my family managed through an organization called HIAS to bring into this country some of my relatives who were in the German occupied areas and when I...when I heard their story  I just made up my mind that all this was...one man was responsible for all this and his name was H itler and somehow or other I wanted to kill him.
And there were he had a sister and a few a a a big family.
So sh e initially passed me on to a sister and then it turned out that the sister had a neighbor who was a member of the Dutch Nazi party.
It was my father  my mother and myself and my younger brother.
Uh...in the...in a building which was left by the Petschek  1 which is a banking family in...in Prague.
You know everything was....I know their family and they know our...our family and me.
So when when you were growing up  and you moved around in different places  was there something that was different between you felt was different between your family and other kids?
When Anne Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27  2017 133 and I were engaged  and all sorts of people in the Italian-American community here were so excited about the fact that this Italian was marrying into this great  great Yankee family.
We -- we sold -- we've sold it to the European part of family.
And you stayed in Berlin about how long  do you think?
mentions just in two words that the r oyal family was approached by Baron von Neumann about this.
And it was a little bit more  and maybe the mother came to his mind that she was bothering him  bot hering him  said ah  anyway  some people has to be left  let the woman with the family be left.
In our group was my grandparents  my other grandmother  three aunts and three children.
There were a lot of other people  yeah  the families  yeah.
During the years when Papa knew what's going to happen we took all our jewelry and fur coats out to Switzerland and left it with this friend in Geneva  not with our family in Zurich but in Geneva.
So  I took her to a doctor  took her to a family doctor  of course.
>> Bill Benson: George  again  because the full brunt of the war would not really hit Hungary until March 1944  70 years ago  the lives of Jews  however  in Hungary  certainly including Budapest  changed significantly with the start of the war.
And a few years ago  I went back to see if her family still lived ther e  but they didnt.
I just...then I start raising a family and...and...you know  working as a salesman and everything went by the wayside.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
In any case  my mothers family  just to complete the picture  consisted of her parents  a brother -- an older brother and sister  who incidentally  went to Israel in ‚37 or ‚38.
Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23  2014 45 But we were fortunate because we could live with parents and the immediate family alive and the ones that sacrificed I didnt really know that well.
End of Tape #2 30 Tape #3 Do you know anything about the family that saved you?
My father had three  two or three other sisters and his parents  they perished.
>> Bill Benson: You would  of course  eventually leave Kenya and the family would emigrate to the United States.
Suddenly you know  it's again these inconsistencies that he would give his life for the family  but while the family was still his family  he didn't know how to handle them  I mean  he was beating us but now suddenly he would give his life to save the kids.
But there was a nice family in Portland   Maine  which at that time I didnt even know what Maine was  and they needed somebody to work in a clothing factory  and my husband signed up as a tailor.
Also  when we were growing up there came a point where Davids older sister  since we saw th-this family more often  they were living in New Jersey  Davids older sister was away at Brandeis for four years  and then went to Stanford for graduate school  so Interview with Harry Gelb December 13  2001 14we didnt see her for long periods of time.
And he he found out that he has a family too.
So  the very first question is  could you tell me  what was your full name at birth?
Well  I would say that we ha d a very nice family life  in spite of not having a father.
We were being married by the Grand Rabbi of Luxembourg  who was a family friend and going to the left this is Uncle Jozi   and then Auntie Lena  my fa thers sister who came from Israel for the wedding  and Leon  my husbands br other  and his mother Clara.
Did you at the same time long to be w ith him  since youd lost all your family?
I stayed with a family in Ulanow (Counter# 208) and every day I was just going over and just bringing them fo od.
Part Swiss  a great -- a grandmother who came  and I believe she was with one of those she di -- the family must have been one of those sects  relig ious sects from around Bern who came to Pennsylvania and then went on to Ohio.
>> Bill Benson: September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland and World War II begins.
Interview with Henry Stern June 8  2016 20 But  by asking you questions about your larger family  I have many purposes in mind.
I spent really all my years in high school with my friends rath er than with my family.
There were so many people in the family who were much more deserving to survive  and I was chosen to be the one.
And...uh...they would walk around there  talking about problems  families  the anxiety  what happened to other members of the family because they did not know.
And uh...and my brother also provides a very rational uh reason  which is that he probably thought that the family would be better off without a male.
And the jailmate of him  did you hear what happened to the family of Rabbi Frieder?
Was it an average family  was it [indecipherable] I-It was average -- average family  yes  average family  was average family Warsaw  average family.
We...I stayed in Ascunion  together with the other people for the whole school year  because things started in January and ended maybe in October and then for the summer holidays I went back to my family in the community in the country.
And then a family came who rented it and they wanted to buy it.
>> Al Munzer: Absolut ely  a tremendous risk to the family.
And you had no idea what was going on with Jewish communities in other parts of Europe?
And I know from our neighbor  from my mother  fro they were very you know  like part of the family.
Where were you born; did you have si blings; what was your family ci rcumstances what were your family circumstances; who were your mother and father?
break] So  you come into New York harbor  and youre met by family  relatives there.
That is  your parents situation and your own  how close your nuclear family was to the same fate.
You see  I cannot bring back my parent s  my family.
Would you say that your fa mily was a religious family?
Then that family had to go  this I do not know really where.
Can you tell me where you were born and when you were born?
I was there in the previous reunion  but this reunion I wasnt there.
10 And the employees in the Moudzoukos family  they would cover the local spectrum  they wouldnt be more Jews employed than -- than the Greek Orthodox?
There were still  yes  and the others then  the sexton and his family later I guess were able to go to Columbia  South America  so they di d escape also  but we left before they did.
Now  these people were not Jewish but they  of course -- but this was family for them.
And not only did they do that but they went into all of -- if there were any 5 stores left that were belonging to Jews -- and  of course  they weren't doing well because not so many people bought but there were some stores left because some Jews did shop.
Well  it seems yes  Ive had some relatives left in Germany.
And your father was present... We were all together...the the family except for the brief period where my two sisters and my cousin went into an orphanage which...I don't remember how long they stayed  whether they stayed a month  two months  and then the nuns said my sister...my sister was too old to really be considered uh an orphan.
My father came from a very observant family but his mother died at childbirth with him.
And the reason she worked there is  she didn't have to fin ancially because her family had enough  she wanted learn English language and figured that would be the easiest because she was going to America.

And the family still lived quite well because they  as Hungarian citizens  and at that time Hungary was sort of partners with Germany  they coul d purchase food and necessities in the so-called volk-doych stores  which were off limits for the Polis h people and definitely off-limits for the Je ws.
In our family as it happened in many families after the war when there were hidden parents and hidden children the main story in the family was that the parents were hidden and survived the war.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
I did not want to approach her  because I thought  what if she asks me the question about my family.
I also  again realize the importance of a monument  as when I ca me there to visit with one of the ma -- recently with the Madna grand -- one of the Madna grandchildren and they took tremend -- he took tremendous pride in seeing the name inscribed  the Madna family.
My home  my family  my community  my earthly possessions  six years of my life and went thro ugh a living Hell.

So  can you tell me a little bit more about your early childhood?
>> Bill Benson: Steve  you described that the leaving of your home to go to the ghetto as one of your grimmest memories.
What are some of the earliest memories you have of your family all together?
He will go either to Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 12Israel or to South America  because or to America  because we had family all over.
Had Jake been in this area for a long time  his family?
But those people are deprived of all contact  family  frie nds  reading.
No  first we bought a house  because the Germans werent there yet.
There was a ghetto in Krakow where all the family was  including the grandmother.
They were very conservative and the father came from a family that had a plantation in the East Indies.
Because I had on my fathers uncle was in the United States.
The family was reunited  at least that part of the family.
Yes  he was in the German army  and it wasnt until the war was over that his father told his sons that they have the items belonging to my family.
Were there were there people who also helped  or tried to watch out for your family?
S-So the -- the king and the crown prince  and the family and part of the government went to London?

Three names -- anyhow -- and -- and Santa Claus went around and gave out the gifts and the men were really shook up because a lot of them are family people.
We had some non-Jewish  and we had a good relationship to them.
Now  I want you to tell me about Bucharest  but one question  did you or your family think that maybe you might be better off under Russian?
But because they were apparently  what they were doing was interviewing family – they had a committee on which this Doctor Moses sat  and he– they determined who was going to go.
And what are some of your earliest memories from your childhood?
Before we turn to the war and the Holocaust  tell us a little bit about your family and your community from what you know in those years before the war began.
And also my parents fo the families were in Poland .
But we had relatives in Israel  and they told them to come.
They took over family -- a Jewish family that had es caped.
And he liked it so much because he found all the family here that he didn't know.
And now  New York has the advantage that we ha ve family there  however  since Dave was so sick  which I mentioned  in Germany  the climate affected his health  and he wasnt feeling well.
They all know mo -- mo -- especially w ith all these interviews  and my own film documentary and my songs that I have written  theyre mostly about my family.
Well  the -- the local men's haberdashery was run by a Stern family  and I knew them very well.
My mother was pretty proficient but my father there  never  I mean he spoke Yiddish.
One of the places was the Swedish Embassy in Warsaw and there was housekeeper  Polish family  and was very devoted Chri stian.
I had some fr some friends  and By this time  did you know what had happened to your family?
Well  obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships.
Because questions are asked by people close to you  by your family.
So this is in December  1942  when your family is escaping through the mountains.
You and your family survived and 90% of the other Jews were dead.
When it came to saving his family  he was really a tiger and I love him.
>> Throughout the span of the 10 years  you lost a lot of family members  and I was wondering  I'm sorr y about all of your losses  I was wondering if when you lost your sister Faige if you had the time and energy to mourn her loss in the camps  what that was like?
Im a member of the Sachs family of of refugees from Germany.
Especially  I was extremely  extremely h appy and jovial  how do you say  because I knew maybe I will see my par ents soon and my brother  my family  so it was my wish.
They were friendly  and I dont know what they was thinking about me  but Frieda was  you know  in a different position  see  wi -- number one  she was from a rich family.
An uncle of mine  the one that my brother lived with  in the family  he was taken in to concentration camp earlier than Kristallnacht.
So as things began to shift  and friends could no longer play with you  di-did your family ever consider sending you away  or putting you into hiding  or -- No  there was no question of hiding at all.
Then how many children did they have  your mother and your father?
So one Friday night in April of 1946  this Jewish family told us that they had obtained questionnaires from the American Joint Distributio n Committee to apply for visas to go to the Unites States for us -- for us  mostly girls who had returned and some fellows too.
But I knew that he wasn't there; and I was the man of the family  of sorts.
And I remember one time that was in the -- late in the fall of '41  we were coming from work  because my job for most of the time through that cousin that I have mentioned that was a  a makher in the ghetto with the other famil y. Unfortunately  I don't remember the name of the other family  and they didn't survive.
What do you recall or know about liberation and then about the reunification of your mother and your sisters and you?
Doctor Kleinfeld  the -- the lawyer  we went to visit his family quite often.
I had two older brothers  an older sister and three younger sisters.
No  my mother was from Poland but my father was from Germany.
And so his family was in a totally different part of Poland.
And today was a great dinner  because we ate so much.
That was  you know  only in our mind  nothing else  nothing else mattered till later on  start  you know  we start to relive the whole bitter experience  try to look if anybody was left of the family  or whatever.
>> Dora Klayman: The only family member whose grave is in existence.
My whole family and my parents  thats the last I saw of them.
First of all  I feel guilty that I left my family  am still guilty.
And then I was recommended from one family to another  and became great friends with all the families.
It's paradoxical  but I felt safer in the German family than  within  with  than with  among the Poles.
During uh these early years  tell me a little about your parents and the family that you grew up in.
And for many  many years having lost my family  having lived in so much fear and terror  having felt myself abandoned by my family  by Jews  by the rest of the world  it was probably inevitable that in personal relationships for many years  I would construe a small slight as a rejection and then respond in kind by either more forceful repart ee or by running away.
So she went to the periscope family who took her and then later when I came out of the hospital  me in also.
Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood memories before the war?
I am certainly pro- Israel  and I have a lot of family there  but I never called myself a Zionist because I did not want to live in Israel.
The town where we lived  it was comparatively not as many Jews as other cities around us  and we...at at that time I had a big family  father  mother  just older brothers  but the family from my mother's side and my father's side was qu ite...a family about fifty  sixty people  which only me and distant cousins...two cousins are alive in Israel and one in New Jersey and from my family I'm the only one left alive.
As we went down the street  I did meet my cousin.
And what was your relationship to your mother and father if you were so close to your siblings?
The war was over in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 some sense.
Were these  did anybody have family members perhaps who had been in that hospital.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 25 Okay  did they have trouble from the community  because they had a Jewish family member?
Our own family was my father  mother and two sisters who were quite a bit older.
What -- How was your family  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 4 grandparents and parents  a part of that town  particularly  of course  of -- of the Jewish community?
And my mother had sisters in Berlin and some of us were together mostly with family and relatives in -- in Jewish France.
Would you say then  that at least from your mothers side of the family  they were well-to-do  because of this business?
She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a distant member of the family  that came when during her illness  and she spent some time with her.
What did that mean for your family and for you ?
And he immediately showed his World War I wound  and I dont know what happened from there  but they let him go and said  but you and your family have to be gone in a week.
I traveled back to Borek Falecki immediat ely and inquired of neighbors  of my former employer whether he has seen any one of my family members.
M-My -- me -- my s -- my sister  and a -- And you said there was a -- -- sister -- I had a sister in Israel  another sister.
5 Were you able to help your family by vi rtue of your position other than the food?
So they came up to some compromise  but still  not enough to maintain the family.
My family  my mother  came to France in the early `20s.
So when -- So when you were called to serve  and it was clear that -- that you needed to do so and that your family would be taken care of  I guess -- I guess what I want to ask USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 69 is  what was your attitude when you went to serve in the army  representing the United States?
You classify them as Dane s of Jewish extraction or Jewish religion or Jewish family.
As far as you can tell  your family was k illed during that liquidation of March  1943.
My family consisted of two wonderful pa rents and an older sister  Tchiya.
But then he said  you know  he got in contact with some friends and some society that is a possibility to go to America if you got a family in America  and he had his fa ther and three brothers in America.
So I told them  ﬁLook  I know the people  the family of this boy that went with them together.
Once I got in touch with family here  my relatives rather  they used to send me packages.
The -- as I told you  the my -- my mother was Russian -- well  I mean  not Russian  w-was educated in -- her childhood in Russia  so she knew Russian literature very well.
I dont quite understand what– The fact of your association with the Holocau st and your immediate experience  losing family members and so forth  gives you a very different personal history than American Jews  in the sense of the fact that youve seen this incred ible tragedy close up and felt the effects very directly on your life.
And since life is not forever  this one day was also important  because this was the last day that we were a family and that we were together.
So -- but we were very lucky because my mother was very liked by all the people where she brought things for the family.
Do you have any  any insights in the way that you've rebuilt your life and the way you have survived and lived and raised a family and made a home that you can share about how you  how you look at the world now after all of this has happened?
That there had too many...you know  he had been turned in  and he just got frightened and he said  \ Sorry  there is just nothing we can do.ﬂ And they gave us the name of a very rich Jewish family that happened to live in that town and they said maybe they can do something for you.
Did he ever discuss  or did you ever think about the fact that -- that the tradition  the religious tradition that had so let your family down -- let his family down  was the one that he joined?
She was happy  she loved me for being able to get away with my life.
In 1938 the family tried to obtain visas to come to the United States.
Well-known family that invited us  and stuff like that  but generally speaking  there was no effort on part of the the the French Jews in Marseilles for an outreach towards the Jews from other countries that had showed up.
It was not yet a Ghetto  and the other part of the family is in Warsaw.
My fa ther  when he was in Tarnopol   he was away from the family.
Actually  I dont remember any contact with any children except my cousins occasionally.
How old were -- were you when you first heard of man named Hitler?
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
Tell us what happened and then from there you went into the ghetto.
So when my fa ther went there  they thought my goodness  if this Hauptmann can save a family of four  surely he can accommodate more of us.
And there was a thrust to rebuild themselves  to rebuild their families.
So that when your father  your family   spoke Hungarian  it was not out of love  but just for – Irving Hass: Just before they were educated and they spoke the language.
My grandparents have -- had six children: three boys and three girls.
It was always very protective  but it wasn't - you couldn't earn a real living that way - or support a family.
Before we turn to the war years and the Holocaust  tell us just a little bit about your family and your life before the war began.
No  I never even thought its just that I knew her and I knew her family  that I know she was Jewish.
Can you tell me a little bit about your parents and grandparents ?
7 >> Bi ll Benson: When you first entered the ghetto  when you were forced to go in there with your family and all the other Jews were forced in there  you shared with me that as you went into it  you remember holding Dora's hand.
We had one teacher  that she was educated  but they were not Polish citizens  that was a Russian family that stayed here in Poland somehow  and that they were not supposed to not not forced to return to Russia.
>> Bill Benson : Steve  before we turn to those years  tell us a little bit about your father.
So  can you tell me a little bit more about your early childhood?
As far as I know  before the war  there were about 40 members of our immediate family -- uncles  aunts  cousins -- and the only ones that I am aware that survived was Max Bolimow sky  my uncle on my mother's side  and Fevek Wiwerman  whom I mentioned before who was my father's brother in law.
I suffer tremendous  now Im older and have more time  that we have no family.
It must have been somewhere beg inning -- >> Ronald Coleman: Did you travel with just your family or were there other families in the community that traveled with you?
>> Bill Benson: In both your sisters' case  of course  as well as your own with the Madna family  food was rationed  food was scarce.
From -- From 1989  and then 1990  me and my wife went to Isra el  we met my brother and my sister-in-law and my nephew  the f -- buc -- my brother came from Lithuania and the family there.
So the -- the staff with your family would in f act be fortunate -- perhaps more fortunate than their families in the -- in the mount ains  in perhaps having more food.
You were from obviously from a welltodo family  and suddenly you're taking handmedowns from other famili es.
Before the war -- during the war already  in 1940  in 1942 more or less  there was a Jewish family in Holland.
There were two little houses  so he let us live in the house  so it already was painted  and we just moved in.
And you didnt know any of that family other than your fathers brother?
my mother was a very religious person  and we were not wealthy.
Only when we find the people  when we find the people then my my husband will give me the photo from the family.
He was a very well-known family in Budapest and he was the new owner of the store.
73 By that point -- excuse me  let me back up a little bit  I want to focus a little bit on your gram -- on your fathers family.
I just  you know when and mommys family was you know the y were all mommys  my mother had one brother and they were very close.
Her family hail from a city called Volos  which although is in Thessaly  its at least 200 miles from the area where I was.
A lot of times  even now  I think why me why nobody else from my family except me.
Now a lot of people would not  who had lost their whole family  would be afraid to love that much.
My husband was working  and you know  my -- I have a beautiful family.
Then I was sorry that I said it because it is not the children's fault what happened and I was very happy that they went to Germany and I am sure they were talking to their parents or if they had still grandparents that this was a normal family with normal children with no stinking and no smelling.
But you knew your family was - your mother and your brother - were safe?
So I  I hid because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Germans  Hungari an Nazis and the German army and their...and then I went to hide in a house which belonged to a friend of mine  uh family friends in the and from this house I went to a hospital to hide because I didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in who gave me the keys to his apartment.
They lived with us in in this house so uh it was my parents  my grandparents and then four children.
And although Ive got family there  my first love was there.
You know  if you just talk about your family as... Well  I just can talk about one brother.
Before the First World War  my father was from a very wealthy family.
And here I came into the ghetto...t hey sent us to a small ghetto and pregnant  alone  not from a strange town  without any family  without nobody.
In particular the Daria family  two brothers and a sister and they all took part in this effort.
They brought it over there  and the Poles used to stand in line and get milk for their family.
He was a very important member of the family  Baa-roo-flasker .
But but my cousin was very he was very attached to his mother  and to grandmother.
Plus  there come a law that all Jewish family should turn in  some such and such a some day  two pairs or two pairs of shoes  three pairs of underhose  hats  and everything.
Harry lived with ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 the Vanderlinden family until September 1944.
And I visited my  the old folks are not alive anymore  the Christian people that helped my family  that helped my grandparents who by the way were deported to Lasenstadt   the ghetto and also pe rished  including an 80 year old grandfather.
But when we went over -- when the memo rial was established in Gliwice  I mentioned I took my family to.
And the Jews from the United States  tourists used to come  family members looking  s earching for family and some of them finding.
At this -- at that place  we were -- had part of the family  two -- I -- one -- my youngest brother and sister stayed with -- with aunts in another city  because it was near where they stayed when my -- when my -- our family left Shasnich the next day after the war  they stayed there because we did not know what will happen to us.
And we we everybody knew that thats because they have a family in amer in America .
Could you give me a sense of your family a little bit?
The only ones that were left was one that I knew there was somebody in Argentina  Uncle   and someone in Israel from my mother's side  the family and they were alive and it was later on that I got in touch with.
So we came on the we first went to Paris  her family lived in Paris  so  to say goodbye.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
My mother already was born in Germany  but that wa s the other branch of the family  and he had a couple of factories and my father worked for my mothers brother and he introduced my mother to -- to my father.

And did they know your parents were Jewish  and what that meant? (
I discovered that no one else has survived  none of my family  and the part of Europe  Germany where I was liberated  became...was destined to become the eastern  the Russian zone  now part of eastern rather than East  Germany  and uh the Americans wanted to uh put uh on turn us over to the Russians because they were shipping people that were from France and Holland to France and Holland and people that were from Poland and Czechoslovakia back east and that day the Russians didn't...they put us in a truck and brought us out to 23 the town  outside of the town where the Russian's lines were.
Anyway we got to know some families and three families moved together to a lovely section in the suburbs  living they cost that way so we each family got two bedrooms.
There was no smooth family -- was no different the family  we know about this.
This is my maternal grandfather  my mom and dad  my mom's brother and his wife.

So what happened  as you remember it  be fore the war began  and as it began in 1939 September?
Jewish famil y -- if a non -Jewish family gives a Jew a slice of bread  they would be killed.
And he was looking for of course all of his family.
So I was taught -- I saw it in my family that there were certai n thing that we dont do.

So your fathers family  going back ho me now  when they were growing up  were they speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian?
But all the others  my aunts and uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
So they decided to esca pe Germany and go to Poland and that was Eastern Poland where my mothers family lived and also my fathers family resided in the same city.

So he had to say no to us in the beginning  but later on  for some reason he could do it again  and he asked -- he asked our family if they -- who -- who should -- he could vouch for one more person  who should come.
My particular experience was that my life continued after the war as it did before  because my father was the head of the family.

Well  first I wanted to rest up   I wanted to m eet my family  tomorrow you come to work .
When you lived with the other family  did you go to school?

My fathers family  its a family of butchers  Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16  2001 9kosher butchers  but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20th century was really the Im sure Im not telling you anything new  you know  the German Jewish community had been  well  had the opportunity for the first time to assimil well  to try and assimilate or at least to practice by choice  and the tendency was away from from religious observations and to assimilate  to try and a ssimilate.

Can you tell me a little bit what it was like in the town where you were born and grew up?
And it was really the Jewish people that lived there were really all my relatives.
It was on the water  and 27 after the war  the royal family used it as thei r summer palace  and the family couldnt get the house back.
And...uh...we tried to rent an apartment there and to have what ever we had...the few suitcases go and  you know  we used to live with my father's family there  which graciously took us in.
Whatever  it was a terrible time of real tu rmoil and repression  and in 1938 after the Kristallnacht  my family in Holland tried to get me to Holland with a children's transport.
Tell us what happened to you and your family once the Germans came into Belgium.
I felt very very very lonely at those days and very isolated  and I remember also the whole family once was rounded up uh downstairs and then we were...something happened.
Tell me something about your -- your family  your mother and your father  and your -- you have a twin brother  I gather.
So  all we really had are my mothers sisters and my mothers brother.
And you know  okay  my family is is scattered  and my life is different  and I did not get to study medicine  which is what I really wanted.
Then when we were trying to leave for the United States  we were trying to take him with us because his family  there was nobo dy.
So  I had family at that time in Shanghai  my father and my mother.
Was all time very -- my father was very  mother too  very hard working people  very ambition  and very good Catholics and try to rebuild our family ag ain and we start again  business  and we go through the occupation time.
And  in my fathers family  the mother of my cousin over here studied at the University of Geneva in those days before World War I  and Grenoble in France.
This minimum people will remain here and we will see what will happen after 24th Nove...uh November and in the same time my husband finds some some somebody who finds for us a empty flat in an earlier Jew's uh family and we became a...we became to live with this uh this second identification what my husband bought in the very beginning and I wanted not to see that I will live with another name  another identification  but this was the time 28 when this was the only way and we went in in a house in uh near to the to the Danube  a flat like a Nilos family  this Christian name and and we get this flat.
We found a place on Wulecka street with a Polish family given to us by the Russian government.
Not only did she decide to let me go but when you're having your child hidden  you really -- the parent  my mother  was not allowed to know where I was going because they knew when the Germans would come say to your apartment  to where you were living  they would actually torture you to find out where the rest of your family was  you know  where your children  where is your husband.
I was taken by an organization to the southern part of Holland  and to a family that I had never met in my life  didnt know the people  and -- You say an organization  do you know th e name of it  or who those people were?
Others traveled south toward Romania and survived  but we traveled due ea st until the taxi ran out of gas  and then we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse and cart and kept going east.
So you see  we are two people of one Nesse Godin 34 December 14  1995 Page 34 family.
And did he sell this  or was this also for the family?
Some people more afraid than others and also I might say its a tremendous venture to pick up your family  your  your  your life and move it to wherever.
You know  they burn the people  the family  and here we have to dance.
There was a mother and a baby and two boys and two women.
And my mother will feel more the injustice  or -- or -- or more protective  or -- I think that she feels that she paid with her family so dearly  that we should be spared.
I hope nobody is in a position like that  but being at the border to Spain and not going over  this proved to myself  I had enough feeling for my family and other people to not have done it.
Would the people know that they are death camps  like my family and my sisters  we could run away.
So in my mother's case they knew my mother was also a wonderful knitter.
This  I think  has been really helpful and insightful  to talk about going back  and what going Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood April 27  2017 128 back meant  you know  to both of you  and in the different instances  the experiences that you had.
And so we dared  we thought he couldn't be a gangster and  of course  it was a very small town  everybody knew each other  and he took us straight to where my family lived.

In in that they they he comes  and he asks who is who is the man in the family.
Well  let me say a little bit on my family history?
It come to me she got married to Dewey Storms family.
But well  now this is the question  who will de will win the war  and Smetona was convinced that Germans are going to lose  and he didn't we didnt know about that tim e  but we knew  you know  later  that Smetona was against that  and thats why Lithuania didnt didnt attack Poland at that time  because of Smetona and of thinking  which ou r director told to us [indecipherable] Would you say  you know  would you say your family belonged to a particular kind of political wing in Lithuania   or was it fairly typical of  lets say the mood in society?
I had gone to my older apartment -- our -- our apartment where I lived with my family and had told the woman there where I was living and to please forward any mail that she would get and to please let me look in the hiding places that we had around the house.
While you were in the ghetto  what did you know about what was happening in other parts of Poland?
But Warlimont -- mind you now  he s general of the artillery  a three star general  came to me one day in Oberoszul and to ld me that he had a proposition  that he would like to visit his wife and his children  he had three children  two daughters and a son  at Tegernsee where -- where they lived on -- in Bava ria and that if I would take him there so he could visit his family  he would in turn make ava ilable to me  all the minutes of all the meetings of the German generals staff  bound in volumes all the way back to 1792 or 32  when the generals staff was founded.
And when he and my mother traveled back to Germany   they went to his family  and at which point the family sort of disowned him  because he had married outside of Catholicism.
We lived in an apartment that was for our small family but in our apartment there was my father's sister  Rivke  with two children  whose husband was taken to the Russian Army.
Her mother lost everybody in Auschwitz  but her father had a family before the war.
What was the language that you spoke at home with your parents?
Did you go to war -- did your parents and you go to Warsaw first -- Yes. --
His family was not very well to do and neither was mine.
>> Bill Benson: When did your mom begin telling you what happened  her story and all about your family and did you have to encourage her to do that?
>> Bill Benson: Henry  your family suffered a terrible tragedy in 1932 when your brother died of an infection.
Im glad that they are all married and happily married and –they have more family nowŠ in-laws and so on.
My fathers family lived in Krakow  and one of the family  a dist -- more distant cousin that I never met  owned the factory that Schindler took over  and he got 14 members of the family onto Schindlers list  and so -- but a lot of them did perish.
So this side of the family would have spoken Ladino at home.
You see  when she was born  I was very envious of the fact there was a baby in the family  and so I always had a sort of slight guilt feeling that I 26 wanted to get her out of her crib  because she displaced me from parents' bedroom when I was a little girl.
Yeah  we had a -- we -- not only did we have a party  that party had to be catered by a kosher caterer because my aunts would not have attended if there wasnt a ko -- was a weird family set up to be [indecipherable] So you were very divided?
So it was a very they were very socially socially accepted  upper middle class family  and the factory that they owned was my grandmothers parents factory.
ﬁWhere did they come fromﬂ] I dont remember  from a camp  from a Polish camp where the family --.
Theres a plaque on the community building naming people  a nd many of my family member honor to their memory.
When we contacted the American Red Cross a nd as far as I know they never could trace what happened to my family  so we just assume d that they died.
Did your mother work outside the home  or was she at home?
However  my relatives wanted me to come to the United States  okay.
After World War II  he decided he couldn't help his family.
Wa-Was your family religious at all  or completely RG-50.030*0580 27 In Mizrachi  a couple of times a year.
They all kissing me and hugging me and my God  then where is my mom and my dad  and where are the Schtolzenbergs   which is another Jewish family lived in that building  and they knew th ey were they left for the United States much before us.
Could you describe what happened when you arrived in Auschwitz ?
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your siblings at that point.
And my mother -- my mother was really the religious one.
My father  you know  th -the -- that he survived the war.
Do you remember the enactment of the Nurem burg laws  either as a specific act or even do you have a sense of what the impact of these laws was on your family.
Can you describe a little bit about the neighborhood where your family was.
So you are staying with this -- in this family [indecipherable] Family  right  now that didnt last -- Uh-huh. --
And he was crying  also  because we lost the rest of the family.
I spent a year with a secular Jewish family  one that was not religious.

Even as much as Father was away  but when he was around  as I said  he was a typical head of the family.
Did this make your family become any closer to the Jewish community in Berlin?

But nobody from the family  lets say prior to World War I?
Even with my family or anybody  I didnt want to talk about it.

You paid them off  you could bring over the famil -- or some from the family.
So I knew that that there was some sort of family.
So we met quite a few people  acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this Jewish committee  we found that nobody that from our families had been re gistered so we kind of already thought that theres nobody there from the family.
Tell us  when did you learn what happened to your parents?

Did you have a lot of re latives  like grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins in your town?
My aunt  my uncle  my aunt's mother  and their two sons.
Like your grandfather and you talked a little bit about your parents.
In these two rooms  my brother and his wife   and my mother and I slept  in this basement apartment  and in the other room there were about four people who slept  and we shared the same toilet.
My grandmother had  she was the oldest and she had five sisters.

I found my youngest uncle in Israel who went there before the war as a khalutz 10 and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in Russia survived  and then they found little Jace k  and they came to Israel as a family.
Yeah  so we went to the airport to pick him up  the family and I. And I couldnt wait in the waiting room  I was so anxious to see the -- see him.
I didnt want to stay in a country that I suffered  and that killed my family.
And in addition to us  one of my cousins -- the uncle and the aunt who we stayed with  they had a son and a daughter.
But when I came  I wanted to know him  after losing my whole family.
Although it didnt affect my -- the warmth of the family  or our happiness together.
All right  that doesn't matter because I was not in danger and in Switzerland I have this enormously big family.
As I told you  she was she came from very wealthy family.
My parents were obviously heroes th at they -- and the letters are amazing because here they are in this horrible situation and they were concerned about everybody else  about the family which was trying to get into South Africa  got there  had to leave  the ones that got to Australia.

My parents corresponded with their family as long as they were able.
It could be somebody outside the family  but I think that it nevertheless saved a certain amount of people.
Being there  especially  especially on the bridge we went back you know  my my fondest memories were of the meadow  all the family and my grandpa.
And your information about your family after that  were you able to find out anything?
I just hope that in my own generation and in my own family and in my own children...uh...not only I hope but I make sure that there is awareness of the fact that we're all brothers and sisters  that we're all...to the extent that we discriminate or deprive of rights another human being  we do it to ourselves.
And my mother was  the two brothers and two sisters and me.
And theres the extended family as I mentioned  my dads cousin  his parents did not survive.
But anyhow  my other daughter and her family have been back to visit Allen.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if at that time if your mother and the other adults  did they begin to have a sense of the enormity of what had happened during the Holocaust  what had happened to Jews throughout Europe?
In fact  I dont think that well  there was a Jewish family  these are the people I met again not too long ago.
And when I lived with this Dutch Jewish family  uh  I was of course sent to sc hool and I was told that I could not have the name Helmwood in Belgium it was too German and the Germans were still hated from World War I so they gave me the name Eddi e and I  the name I kept since today  until today.
My family was in four generations in the same place--in that little town of Strehlen  what is very famous by a very famous man  name of Paul Ehrlich.
So  of course  that to I think she I would say she were was because of her mystical sort of I mean  she comes from an if her brother decided to become a priest  so there is a really something deeper in the family lore  into that sort of  direction.
Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood or w as it mixed?
Its a big  legal type of a component involved here  that the family is using legal track as a blackm ail.
She just -- she thought that I was too  quote  h onest  and that -- you know  that that -- so she wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to acquire a family  in a sense.
So then slowly  in 1985  she let us know  even though we knew -- I knew from records that she had been taken in to Poland and she spent some very  very unpleasant  indeterminate num-number of months with a Polish family that -- right now I can almost surely say abused her  in terms of her being a child who was taken into a home to be taken care of.
He had walked from Elsenor along the coast knocking all doors available asking the same question  \ have you seen the Pundik family?\

Do you -- did you then go back to your apartment where -- where your family was?
No -- no  observe -- no -- family  old family in Poland  in Poland most people was a Catholic  you know.

So there would be what associated with the royal family or the aristocracy.
The first floor was oc cupied by the family and on top of the floor was a very big attic which was the maga-zeln where they kept all the business things.
So  due to the fact that we we re not in a Jewish kind of because some courtyards  they had 20  30 families  and mostly Jewish  you know  so if the homes were plundered  you know who did it.
This family was willing to ta give us part of a a floor  and Im sure my father had to pay.
And did they know your parents were Jewish  and what that meant? (
And my parents lived in a two -family home  which was shared with my father's sister and her two children as well as her mother -in-law.

My fourth question really was to the museum  what are you planning to do with all this  you know  as far as the St. Louis is concerned  but thats not a -- thats not a -- a -- a family issue  okay  in that context.
What kind of contact did your parents ha ve with the relatives who stayed behind in Germany?
So they uh--to even though they had good clothes and good sheets and good baby clothes and if you gave away to us  it didn't mean anything because we didn't use those baby clothes and we didn't use those sheets and uh so we uh came home and found there are mashed potatoes in and it was like in a pound to uh you know you were so happy that you would give your children and your family a big treat with the butter but it wasn't meant to be.
At home  did your parents ever talk much about the world outside  the political things that were going on?

So out of a family of five -- my mother didn't exercise any professi on as she was a good housewife at the time.
He was one of the siblings my mother had been with in Berlin.

>> Bill Benson: Jill  tell us  your family itself  you just recently  I think  learned that you can trace your family living there in that area in Germany back centuries.
So  we didn't have that and then an uncle of mine lived in that house too so we all moved into one place.
Did your father and his family realize at th is point that their lives were in fact in danger?
Uh  and there actually was a set of twins in the family.
My grandparents -- my father's parents and many of his sisters and brothers  except one  they lived in Poland.
The other one needed a four-year-old with USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 15 dark hair and blond eyes...uh  uh  blond hair and dark eyes  so it would fit in the family.
Tell me about Monas family  and do you share a lot of values?
She became a member and she married under the family  a very good friend of mine.
She he is the son of my Aunt Rozina   who we who we saw earlier in the family picture of my father.
Now  in the ghetto  they bring us back in the ghetto yeah  but what happened?
Of course my mother took the extra effort to place with me with a family and some of them just went over.
Did you talk much about your experience  di -- what happened?
And so there was a tremendous drive to try to recreate the family.
So could you tell me where you were born  when you were born?
Because so many knew what they did it  and they came home  they told their friends and their family  and things like that and they knew what's going on.
And he came to the barracks that was thing about the slave labor camp: on occasion they allowed you to go to see the family  you know  if there wa s a husband and a wife  or a brother and a sister  or whatever.
My family went to their gynecologist at that particular time  and asked him to take charge of my wife.
How did your family how did your mo ther res react  how did your brother how did your brothers react?
But they were so strict about their criteria that the family was afraid they wouldn't let us in  because they really weren't hoeing fields  they were country people and cattle dealers and they did have farms -- ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 >> Bill Benson: But not raising crops and things like that.
Yes  that was towards the end of June then  yes  yes  and I stayed there until September and then I met a family on the beach and they asked me if I would come and look after their children for them  of 6 and 11  and I was getting in English money  25 p a week and they we re offering me a pound a week or so mething  and so I obviously accepted  ended with going back to London so I accepted that job and the ch ildren were as I said six and a half and 11  and I was 15  and they asked me to do the cooking and the cleaning  and if the children couldnt go to school they asked me to write the letters to teachers  so somebody must have had great fun reading my writing  but still.
Suzy Snyder: And how was your mother through all of this?
The Sawinski family  if you go through the Holocaust Museum  you can see where the righteous names are  the Sawinski family is there.
Our lifestyle was -- yes  was a middle - middle class Jewish family.
His article was saying that if this money -- he accused the museum being guilty  or be the building  for Jewish pi -- intermarriages  because after all  I gotta take the other side  a Catholic child  who is married out of his faith to a Jewish child  the other family feels just as broken as this one.
Q. Do you remember your family talking about what their plans were  what you were going to do?
So what probably happened was that the mother was Sephardic and the fa ther married into the family so all the -- Kids. --
What do you remember about how you and your family were received in the United States as refugees or as survivors?
And when we even go to parties  I always felt alone  no matter how many people were there because I could really not relate completely to anybody except to other survivors  no matter even if I r eached out to you I couldn't get that close because you reminded me too much of what I could have been  and what I will never be  and when I go on vacation  I take along my whole family  I even feel guilty for enj oying because I always tell myself \ how can I do this?
>> Bill Benson: George  during that time and the time leading up to the spring of 1944  when the Germans came in  how did your family manage to make ends meet?
Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 73 Do you remember where the rest of the family lived in Brooklyn  what part of it?
When I escaped from Warsaw  I went  you know  to my family.
But it was so good  because we were still together  a family  six of us.
And they all lived one next to another  the same corridor  different apartments in Warsaw.
In our group was my grandparents  my other grandmother  three aunts and three children.
The only people that did return were two of my uncles o n my father's side .
As a matter of a fact  I didnt mention it to you  but my parents had four children.
>> Peter Gorog: Well  obviously I learned a lot from my mom who shared a lot and fortunately about two years before my mom died  I did a video interview with her just about the Holocaust and family history.
And someone survived in their families even  like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived  you know?
Which is  my uncle was my father's brother  and my aunt was my mother's sister.
You see  I come  I don't come from an Orthodox family  but my old relatives were Orthodox and watched o ut for me I should learn the Torah and everything else.
But at that point  we were yet  the whole family was together yet  until the  the selection th at they made.
And then we...uh...came to the United States because his family was in the United States.
So it was -- it was in the family for a while?
Laughter] >> Bill Benson: So your mom and dad did get here together in 1946.
And then you stayed with them for a few I stayed with them for a few days and then they got me a position in Brooklyn where there were all two family homes  with a lovely Jewish family as a companion to their daughter  who was my age yeah.
And was she also from the same part of Germany as your family was?
This is tape number one  side B. Okay  lets talk about your own aspirations then  for your own family.
So you had three s -- three siblings  and -- and many a-aunts and uncles  you said -- Yes. --
And one brother was coming back from the war and he stoppe d in Vilna to look for -- for Blechman family and he saw my sister.
I had only one grandmother  of Mothers -- from Mothers side  the father died already and she died when I was three years.
But sure  my friends -- my friends didnt have that education  you know  I -- I -- in a way my family was -- it -- and interestingly enough  my cousins  who -- we have the same grandparents  practically none of my cousin have remained even Jewish.
Because  you know  my mother never went back to the town of Zaleszczyki because all our family was in Krakow.
In fact  there were three brothers in this family and they lived in Philadelphia  not too far from me.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 100 Wh-What were Mar -- I forgot to ask you  where were Martys family from?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 >> Suzy Snyder: Do you know why?
Your family went to Antwerp  Belgium in 1938 and then in May 1940 you went to the French border  but you were stateless because your parents had been from Poland.
My mother gave some private lessons to various people who wanted to learn German.
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?
I was born in Lublin  Poland on August 8  1920  son of a middle class family.
But no matter what came up in politics  we discuss it at every dinner table  and af ter dinner and -- and we had a friend from New York who came and visited at one dinner and he said  I would give my right arm if my family would be willing to talk about politics so much.
And my father moved us and his whole family his mother  his sisters  brothers  and a niece who was my generation.
And he  when he heard that his whole family was deported  his three children  his parents  hi s sisters  and his wife  he wanted to run after the train.
His family consisted of his mother  a brother and a sister-in-law  and they lived in one room.
When the Russians came in my mother started talking Russian to them.
Whatever I can help with the family we will do together ﬂ and so on  so on.
What was -- What were the habits of how your family observed their faith?
Did they know that you ha you had a living father?
Interview with Annette Fein November 7  2008 38 Well  a very good friends of th e family.
The other family was way out and so I lived with them.
And -- s eez -- and s-she got then married again and she kept her marriage secret from the family  so that she gets a pension [indecipherable] thats her pay.
I met the family over -- they had a married son  two or three kids; and a married daughter with some children.
>> Bill Benson: And to that point she had no idea.
Did you talk to your husband about what had ha ppened to you during the war?
You can help my older daughter Lilly who has to take care old my six young children because my wife goes outside to work to bring in some food for the family.\
They were the only Jewish family in this entire co mmunity.
And that family  I think  moved in with  my brother was clearly an infant  so I don't know if they moved in just before or  he was born  or right after  so that's not clear in my mind.

And at the end  I'm sure it would have been the whole family.
And the family in the United States kept agitating that I should come and spend a year there  just to forget about what had happened or -- and I think the reason they did that too  because they were hoping that my parents  particularly my father would ultimately come and be reunited with his siblings.

Well because I do family history I have of cours e I mean I have several thousand names and there are lots and lots of victims.
So  religiously  again  which it was a big upheaval for people like 14 in my family at that particular time.
And to then have people who knew you  and also talk about their own lives and their relationship with you  it simply make s the story  its like talking with all members of the family not just with one member of the family.
Don't....\  It...it was just unbelievable that somebody from the family is alive.
She was at Meyer's the hous ekeeper and the family Meyer lived next to it.
And I lived in a house with some peasant people  peasant family  and I was a maid there and I did whatever they told me to do.
So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there  mostly Polish though.

Moise Weiner: In my family  my father and my mother  no.
>> Bill Benson : Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in September 1939 to start World War II .
We went from Warsaw to this town where my parents were too.
So you were never by yourself until you got to the family.
Bill Benson: Marcel  didn't some of your family members join the Communist Party?
So one of our the girl the family under us  Rusterveld  where the f man was  you know  forced into retirement  he had a daughter  she was a couple of years older than I  Alsa and she ran errands for us.
From Fathers family some went there  and -- to Israel  to Palestine at that time  but I dont know whether many people went and frankly I dont know if -- Did you have friends that -- that went  yourself  or -- No  and through [indecipherable] went there who only -- I only know of them  and they were a cousin and her children.
And the next day her husband  Monsieur Galop  came with a cart  and we took whatever personal effects we could take  which was very little  actual ly  with us.
So we had some social workers from the Kultusgemeinde who came with us and they had they were going to be allowed to leave the country  but their family was held hostage  they had to return.
He was a very self-involved man  not really a family man.
Then when your parents put you into hiding  was it that time that you were adopted by another family ?
Then it takes took time a little bit  they start coming from the other side  they told me that my family was killed  all of them in one day  they took them out  they killed everybody.
And they had many Jewish friends  so they they  they were  of course  interested in it.
And my father  and I had an older sister  and she took care of my grandmother  and my grandfather came and my little brother and my mother and my sister that survived.
Before you tell us about your journey out of Europe and to the United States for safety  please tell us first a bit about your family  your community  and yourself in the years before the war began.

He was in the forest  he was and they  my family  my relatives were going.
Even in our own family we had several nieces and nephews who who sort of looked like her and even had dark hair.
>> Bill Benson: With such harsh rationing  food was very scarce.
I had cousins  girls  but they were older  much older than I was  about 10 - 12 years old.
As I said before  my mother lost her mother  brother  sister  and some nephews plus some cousins who were taken to Auschwitz who never came back.
And thats the family that lived opposite us  our -- our house  Hedda Ricardo.
And your fathers -- your fathers family  were they middle class  or -- Yeah  my -- my [indecipherable] what I have been told -- I didnt know too many of them except the ones who were living in Germany  some stayed in Poland.
And so we made our way back to...uh...Romania  where most of my mother's family had lived prior to the war.
And I dont remember this  but it was repeated in my family ca -- so many times  that Mr. Rosenstein told my father that theyre going to have signs on buses that Jews cant ride a bus.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 >> Bill Benson: And from what you know  as you said a moment ago  she was taken to a different camp than your father.
Im not very close to much of it  except for my grandmothers sister  whos e my grand-aunt  and Ive been -- she used to have a kibbutz in Israel and I was there several times  and Interview with Dustin Dezube December 7  2000 12I visit her every time I go up to Israel  and some of my cousins  but besides that theres some family I dont know.
His was taking care of his family  and I could understand that 'cause he had to take care of his family so in that respect  it was a great childhood.
And we became also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family 8 reunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the homes  the children's homes  to get the children back into the camps for family reunion purposes.
In the split of second  I was able to to see my whole life  all...I  I...in that split of second  I converse with my family; with my sister  my my parents  uh friends.
So the night before that happened  he wrote a note which I have...was given to me after the war  where he authorizes my aunt to hand me over to a Jewish family in that small little town in Slovakia that was supposed to be protected from deportation because they had what was called either the yellow or the white exemption which could have been bought from the Slovak government.
And -- and then her family came from Warsaw  the sisters with their families.
And then Busko was liquidated before Starachowice  and they send them all to Treblinka  the whole family.
One of the distant relatives had gone through the trouble of making a complete family tree of their relatives who went back to the late 1700's  early 1800's  and  lo and behold  in this family tree my father then found his - a cousin.
And was your house in the ghetto at the time or did you have to move?
You mentioned that -- that your family was -- was religious and -- and -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 33 They came -- They came -- My -- Both my [indecipherable] that was life in the -- in the country  were Orthodox  but in Liege  they didnt keep it.
For a substantial period of time your family was able to remain hidden from that.
I mean  here I was starting this new family in my new life  you know.
But I had lived in Vienna for most of my life.
The next day You went back did you go back to your house?
Thinking of this wonderful family  wonderful aunts  and going from house to house -- that that this is wh at childhood was all about to me that tied me to this little town that I could not -- I mean  Zagreb-- the big-city life could never make it up to me  you know.
He came back  spoke to the German supervisor  told him that his family was in Kaunas   and he had a nice job  could he leave.
Then the pers -- the family hid us later on  too.
They were my father's brother and his wife and two daughters and my mother's two sisters.
We found there a Jewish family who let us come in and have a little bit water  a tea  I dont rememb er even if it was food.
There were four sisters  and she was the oldest  and my mother was the youngest.
It was the middle of the night  and she saw her family in her fever.
It was a triangle that the family just tolerated because the boyfriend was a much nicer pe rson than the husband  everybody  so there was even humor then.
If I don't like it I can't leave you because I'm family.
And I had my family  we were all together  and I had a couple of friends.
So when I went in hiding and lived with the family  I had all s -- always -- I couldnt sit there  eat myself  so I had all this food for the whole family.
And I loved my little brother  and he was born in May. So I said  I think I was born in March  but I love May  because the way I held on to my family is remembering things about Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 42 October 8  2010 them  not as much about me.
Family life: I was married; I had four childre n  four boys.
Did you or your mother know the family that you went to in Paris?
And my mother was one of 11 children  and so it was quite a large family.
And it -- it simply said that every possible protection is give -- to be given to the Jackass -- fact he ordered in one word  I guess he didn't realize that it was a first and a last name  family and -- and also that we are supposed to be supplied generously with food.
Hopefully it will give you some idea what happened  at least to my family.
He sent a letter to my family many years after this telling him this story exactly as I'm telling it to you now.
Do you have any knowledge of why this happened to your family?
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?
Survivors very often ask me  or people who suffered tragedies like recently  the fires and the floods  they lost the pictures  but they still had family members.
Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 36 Oh  she -- To -- for the fact that you had to go to this boarding school  th en you went to a -- -- actually was  I think totally obsessed with mothers and father and the family.
We were my mom  my husband  myself and the two children.
In August 1943 Marcel went into hiding with a Polish Ukrainian family.
But that basically is the last time I saw my parents.
And they came to our 4 home; and they told us that they were all made to leave their homes and relocate their particular family to warsaw.
In fact  my grandfather offered my father that if he moved to Breslau   there was enough of a Jewish community that he could continue to practice me dicine  and if he needed a ny help -- he had been the family patriarch.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 >> Bill Benson: Do remember what it was like for you to know that just a few years earlier you were a Jewish family having to flee Germany because of the Nazis and now you are a U.S. soldier there and the war is going on?
And the Duca da Oustar  a family wi -- a -- being ther e too  I mean  there was a tremendous dispute.
18 During first of all the war  my -- independentl y  my father and my mothers family went to Vienna to leave the city because it was dangerous to stay in the c ity  and Vienna was in Austria  so -- so they were used to the notion that -- I see. --
But of course there were some Polish families there that my parents knew.
But they were very Orthodox  and I found myself at that time becoming more and more estrange d to Orthodoxy  and they noticed that  Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27  2010 16so I was moved to another family  the son of the Rabbi de Sola Pool  the head of Shearith Israel of the Sephardic synagogue in New York City   who was a sort of son of a famous father who wasnt doing quite so well  so it was difficult for him.
We had families  we had parents  we had grandparents  great grandparents.
Not true  because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends  but they were not that close because the children could have been very close and we went to school together and everything was fine  but the parents of that group did not really want their daughters to mix so much with the Jews  so we were not kept very close with them.
So  we got the family trees of both the Brochs   and the Frankels .
Like I talked about that family who were almost going to be killed because they were restless  getting restless.
My father came from a very lo w class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary.
I suspect maybe there may have been a question in that case of mobilization of kids to the army  and these were boys of the age that they would have been mobilized in Yugoslavia  ma ybe thats the reason why they went there  but this was also a family that had a Precepteur   a French male governess  and then an English male governess  and they spoke Englis h and they went to school in England  both of them.
Was it an apartment  or an owned house  how was it?
They could 85 retain their clothes  they could retain their luggage  and they went into a camp which was from then on called the family camp.
I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when it ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he wanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I should call the family to see what everyone is doing  my father's brothers and there were uncles and aunts and so on  and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there was no answer.
History 2 was the history of the big family  big kings  but not a big country.
Was your fathers  was the family movie theater destroyed on Kristallnacht?
But the British army  and later Americans ar ththey in the every dis family  every ind ividual  grown -up individual  every day  or every two days  got a package of cigarettes.
I mean you see your whole family languishing in  in  in  in  in  in  in (cough) in bowel movements and this kind of things  and this was a terrible scene.
>> Bill Benson: So you lost virtually everybody in the ex tended family.
They just walked and they separated in half  four and four  and they send my friend and her family on one side and my father and mother and brother on the other side.
And I met many of them  and one of them  who was one of the big glass manufacturers  and was the founder o-of which is now a very famous glass museum in Wertheim   they they offered my family this wonderful mansion Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23  2017 16 overlooking the castle  and provided us with a VW convertible  because they happened to be on vacation  and they just turned it over for us to utilize.
And so Was there a large extended family aunts  uncles  cousins in Berlin?
And I want to know about your family too  but we start with this  okay?
There was younger  rich  but one year... We were a happy family.
We knew that there was one sister of my father's that went out to Palestine to work on the land before 1932.
As a result  you would live under Russian occupation until June of 1941.
And in th e main platz  he -- he-he-he put like a -- a set -- like a footstep and h-he -- he -- he took my father and my father on hi-hi-his way to the -- t-to the ma-main market  to the pla -- platz  he -- he said s -- something -- somebody was passing and he -- h-he said  tell my family to - to -- to run.
01:21:41 But when you ask me  ﬁDid they love each other?ﬂ They may have been in love for a very short time  but again to give you the 19th century  when he married my mother  who was  of course  a virgin when he married her in 1905  he sai d  ﬁIf you don't have a son or a daughter in a year  it's over.ﬂ So  in other words  he wanted to propagate and I don't know -- I don't know whether these stories are true but this is what I remember in my family and there are other things that I remember which are not showing love.
1929  okay  why don't you tell me  ju st so we can  to start this  a little about your life in France before the war and what your life was like there with your family?
A-And can you speak some about the friends that you had  or that your family had?
They had worked  they had done  they had earned their house  they have worked hard  and you have not only in money value  but you have things that are handed down from family tradition  and kids who have pets.
Then we saw the farmers and they told us that what they did is they went to...you know  this is this is a little village with little passage  little road  not even a road  leading to the house  and they brought the family from the house to the main road and they questioned my my mother and my mother said that these were not their child ren...her children  and they were there for her...their health  wh...which was common practice  because we cam e from coal-mining countries and a lot of 7 children from the schools were sent to the country  but they didn't take it and they asked where my father was and my little sister said in the hospital  and I understand the German slapped her for lying.

Lets start -- lets start going all th e way back  just talking about your family a little bit.
>> Bill Benson: I was going to ask if you saw your siblings.
They allowed only me  but because the Polish officer didnt understand German  so I take this opportunity and I left all my family there in this village.
Certainly having kiddish and having the Friday meal and having having the relatives uh who joined us  but mainly after that then people were dropping in for coffee and cake and then then the the events of the week and the events of the day were discussed and I got out a lot from that because first of all it was a wonderful family...family uh uh atmosphere in sp ite of all the difficulties we had around us because the diff...the economical si tuation in Germany during the in flation and then at the time of the Depression was not easy  but there was a warmth of a of a Jewish home which which I appreciated very much and I think formed me an d and and therefore my my my rightful family and my my love for family  it came from there uh a nd which was held up in all as I say in all...in spite of all difficulties.

Yes  but they were I think Spaniards and Cubans or some thing  and one fa mily I remember leaving  left because I think somebody paid them a lot of money for them  but I think they were just family if I remember correctly.
If you had to estimate the the extended family  how large would you say?
I don't think...my father had the brunt in trying to pay someone to get the family released from the citadel and when I went to Brussels  I didn't know about the gas chambers.

They could -- they also didnt have any relatives of his to check if  lets say there was something in the family  but they dont know about anything.
I try to avoid this  and I can see this in my own family  but th-this is something that makes me me.
To look  and then I -- there were some tenants and there were some friends  which they -- the family  which -- a Gentile family.
We when she he knew that she was living to to Britain   to London   and av nothing else  so anyway  for me was to find  like us finding old family who I left many  many lost many  many years ago.
If they were family I should have brought you one I have--I found a hil- hilarious one of my brothers from the Pyrenees experience in France.
And and on my 90 th birthday  the town archivist did a major story of my not only of my family  my current family  he went all the way back to Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23  2017 65 1803  its its a a major story of about three columns  of the life of the Schwarzschild family  you know.
Can you tell me about what happened to you  what you remember from that time  where you were?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036 15 Now  before we go too far  Im trying to weave in your own family life  alongside the story of the community.
The family there was not enough beds  to sleep in beds and a new life was started out for us to live under the German occupation.
Im not sure exactly  but my mo my fathers two sisters  their families  they had three boys  one had two  one was a hardware store manager  he had his own little hardware and another family on his side dug a bunker in my aunts my aunts backyard.
Lithuania small little town  where we lived with my grandmother in their house  the -- all little houses were -- on Fridays  the baker -- there was a bakery open  on the Friday it was -- things so -- baked for the whole week for the family  and so on  so on.
My mother -- this was in late September 41  my mother went to the police office  and the Latvian police official tr eated her with utmost re spect and sort of said in almost so many words that he has high regard for her family  hes not going to do anything against her  and shes just going to renew her passport and no questions asked  which was another example that -- of some decent Latvians .
And so I went to live with them  was the family of a mother and three sisters.
I only heard of one family  that they had been taken to prison  but they had not been shot  or something.
Those were the Polish friends of my parents  and we were very close.
No  no  no  no  they th-the my they was married [indecipherable] all lived to ge my family was holding together; Papa  Mama  my sister  my brother and me.
So  when we came  we started to look and look  and even tually we found an apartment with a Polish family.
But in no other way  I think the people  when we first moved in  since ev erybody was refugees  my family were also refugees and there wasn't much made of that.
Did they open you up to things that even y our family wasnt doing  in some in some ways?
But as I said  I had my family there and they really saved the trip for me .
There was a lot of employment even not even  but in my family  too.
I have a very good life here and my husband ma de a very good living and we raised a wonderful family and wonderful kids and were really very grateful t-to God and to this country for letting us in to to do the work and we hope to be able to do the work as long as we we can go on.
And the whole family was gathered in the living room  sitting in a circle.
And -- like my -- my daughter-in-laws mother  from -- who is from Poland lost practically all of her family.
One of our rela tives fed meat to the family and they never knew what are you feeding.
There was no name  that that was just the Warsaw ghetto.
I wanted to ask you about this -- this is sort of a museum kind of centered question  but since you received this notice that this search was going on for survivors  and youve come into contact with all this informati on and been thinking about it  and maybe in -- in a different kind of way  or through a different kind of lens  and come here to Washington  and youve answered this question partially  but how has this brought you either any kind of new understanding  or specific kind of information a bout your family that otherwise may not have happened to you?
We had one other outlet which was quite important to my family.
Tell us please a few words abou t the background of your family.
I started in New York Cit y  and I went to grammar school there  and one year at DeWitt Clinton High School  after which my family sent me to a military academy in Stanton  Staunton  Virginia.
Thanks to my grandmother  at the time the Jewish people spoke German  the more cultured families wanted expose their children to German at home.
And they said later  they said  yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didnt want you to fall on your face without family around.
And you said one family got special tr eatment because they informed on others.
So I left the fam -- the -- the -- the Bozym family  jumped on one of the trucks and just went east  you know.
This is the house where Halina and her family stayed in Jaroslaw.
So we got to gether and because there was not  as I had mentioned before   technology  so parts of  when we would get together they used to  the family used to sit and tell stories  remini sce  you know?
Later on he -- later on he worked for my mothers brother  who comes from a well-to-do family and they -- th-they were more -- they were more Jewish oriented.
And the extended family numbered - I cannot begin to tell you because I wouldnt really know  but really  a very big number.
And it was a Protestant family  supposedly  but later on we found out that my grandfather was really from a Catholic background  which he never admitted while he was alive.
He had to witness how they murdered  not killed but really murdered  his family and then they murdered him   a horrible end.
My elder brother  who was ten years older than I was  escaped somehow from the ghetto and would  and went to the province hoping to find some wor k. He was already a married man and he had a boy five or six year s old and he was hoping to find some work so that he could come back to the ghetto and some how feed the family  but that was it.
117 Spearhead (Polish) 73 How did your family  when they found out well  I guess they knew what you were doing they found out you had survived.
To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in Belsen?
So to shut me up  she found a bunch of pictures that she carried with her  and gave them to me to entertain.
So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for that decision.
And my father's mother  my grandmother  who lived with us until she passed away  we lived together  told the family that she believed her ancestors escaped the Inquisition in Spain and the family moved -- we don't know where to but landed up in a city Crefeld  also about 45 minutes from Holland.
Some people did that but never saw their families anyhow because by the time they reached the Dutch concentration camp  Westerbork  their family already was gone over the border.
I had the Galops family  and the Communist neighbors recognized as righteous among the nations.
And the woman told me that her family -- she burst out in tears and she says  you know  my family is from Ebensee and I am so ashamed.
The Czech Republic was founded in 1918  but my family  as well as the neighbors and most of the po -- of the population experienced a very strong a ffinity to Vienna and to Austria.
Okay  lets talk now about the beginning of the war  do you remember the very beginning and -- Everything I remember.
My father was a very  very religious man  came from a poor family but they were all educated.
Were your -- what -- what language did you speak  did your parents speak at home?
Again  congratulations to the whole family  and thank you very much.
Do you have any sense of guilt that your family did get out  thank -- fortunately.
And what are we going to do now without the family.
Keep family together  be happy and -- and the rest comes by itself.
And they did this work  you know  what they call root work  family.
And I had a hard time  sort of  forgetting about it  that even after I left all of my family and lost them over here  that that man would have the audacity to ask me  one person who remained alive  in these words  with his cruel words: \ Are you still alive?\
We sat down in a family and sometime it happened at the dinner table  sometime - there was never too much reaction from them on -- on an -- on an -- they understood it  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 37 but then on emotional point.
Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 79 Well  its Some  for example  might get more involved with their immediate family  their children  grandchildren  and it can be time-consuming.
Only to...to know that we belong something  that we have a family.
Well  whole family  that means my parents  and one sister  and me.
Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17  2010 6 So so what did they what did your family do for a Shabbat meal  given that theres no heat?
They helped him in Fuft  they called his family  they gave him money for the train  and it wasn't  this was not toward the very end of the war  and his wife  my aunt  was allowed to send him a package once a month  of maybe 3 lbs of food and uh  she woul d come to our house to make a package  it was so painful for her to do that  and uh  I have asked his three daughters to record what he did and what uh  what they actually found uh  what they found  they came to my grandmother's and they were uh  she was under arrest  she was then in her 80s and they said  um  she said  \ Why have you arrested my son?
Did you -- tell me about your first experiences with -- dealing with Americans other than your -- your family  who were immigrants as well  like -- like the people at the tailor shop were -- how did you -- They were actually very nice people and there was a very nice lady  a nice Polish lady who worked there also.
Any other Well  its just that I I guess I was a a very  very lucky child  because my English foster family was just just wonderful.
So I went with my brother and my father  a couple of uncles.
Did you all talk about the war a lot after it was over?
Just that  about my family  maybe  my daughter graduated at my and went to college and when she finish she was employed at the bank  she did some business college and she went to  she get a job at a bank and she became Barbara Farkas 81 December 9  1995 a assistant manager  she didn't want to be a manager.
End of Tape #3 19 Tape #4 Well I think when we stopped the tape you were talking about that  you told these people their family wasn't there.
My mother may be more likely to want to stay here  oddly  because my father had been able his family  his sister and his mother  after the war  had joined us here  or were going to join us if we but he thinks in terms of going back  maybe.
Moshe -- I dont remember  but anyway  he ultimately moved to Israel.
The -- the -- he married a woman from a family that -- that had lots of aunts.
>> Al Munzer: Well  my mother -- my parents knew the Madna family quite well.
And the police picked me up  and I do recall that I was sitting on the policemans lap  with a policemans cap on my head  waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough  till they found -- till I was found  I think my brother came to pick me up  an d then reunited with the family  so I was saved.
Did you tell each other about your experiences during the war?
They knew that we were a different family from all the other friends they had  because you know  we were -- there was no grandparents  there was no immediate aunt s and uncles.
An aunt still corresponded with the non-Jewish family  we visited there.
To the best of my recollection  the early childhood was a very pleasant one: a life of comparative plenty  of wonderful vacations either in the mountains or the Black Sea in Bulgaria  with fine clothes mostly bought by my father on his business trips to Paris and other Western European capitals  a peaceful life  a very family life.
Because my family was survived  and my mother  my and and th the home is here  our business  which was a big lithography  painting Well  this I wanted to ask about you.
My first trip to Israel I met some of his friend s and family members and they told me what a charitable person he was.
So  did your family like listening to the radio  maybe going to the movies  plays  you know?
So the director ate rather well  and one day  it was before Easter  or  I think it was before Easter  or around Easter time  he and his family had a baking contest of some sort  I mean they cooked cookies forever and the smell penetrated the building.
I assume the rest of his relatives in Lukow  aunt s  uncles  cousins  Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.
I believe di d. So that here in the  and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not le ave Hamburg.
So my grandfather was actually taken before my grandmother and mother.
>> Bill Benson: The question i s  D id you ever reunite with either the nuns or the famil y that took care of you?
So we did a good job  a very close -knit family  our family is now substituting for the family we lost.
It was hard for me be cause since I come from an orthod ox family.
What -- what did -- what was your house actually like  or your apartment.
At this time  my father was the only one of our family of five that spoke English.
And about his family  did his I mean   his Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1  2010 37 Yeah  he had three there were nine children.
You know it was by the name   hierarchy  you know  what they wanted for the Je wish gemeinde  they had to -- listen they want to save their family.
I want to come back  I said earlier in this interview  that Christmas played a special role in our family and I meant that in many ways  it played a role as I grew up because we always had a Christmas tree and we   and Santa Claus came and we had gifts.
My son was young  went to Jewish Family Service  got no help.
107 No  no  we were there for the SS when they needed somewhere to send this -- a message  yes  or when they needed -- lets say it came a -- a prisoner to the door  and they couldnt communicate with them yes  so they would ask us  yes  yeah  we did -- Now were you also standing when they took the family camp  the Theresienstadt camp out to be gassed  were you there?
I...I would like to know what happened to you after the war.
It was the family we were friendly with  Francois and her husband  Marcel.
So  we moved and this apartment has been giv en to us by the Judenr at because they knew which homes were in the ghetto where you were permitted to live a nd  on the basis of how large the family was  they were so to say its like my father  who was running the department of supplying the labor force to the factories  there was a person who was in charge of allocating living quarters for people.
>> Bill Benson: You're in the ghetto  but you're able to go into the town?
And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his family  and they said  ﬁCome on over.
project  which publicizes the photographs of over 1 000 Jewish children orphaned or otherwise separated from their parents during the Holocaust in an effort to identify them and connect them with surviving family members or fri ends.
We'd like to know a little bit more about you  your background  your family.
In the beginning I thought and my brother bought so that our family didn't be hungry.
So were you brought up with a life of music  a nd culture  or what kind of family life did you have  other than bridge for your dad  and opera for your mom?
But on the other hand  I really -- I didnt see a real future and I -- I thought  well  you know  my parents were killed  my sister was gone  my grandmother was gone  my -- I had family.
If you could speak to your father today  what would you tell him a bout your life  about your family?
And he pi not only protected his life  but the whole family.
It wouldn't escape me  especially  especially to see people who do have family  because right after the war  people came from Russia  people came out of hiding and here were those families.
I did not tell you the story of mine...how did I bring them...by that time I already had my entire  my living family  my father  my mother  my sister  my brother with me in hiding on the Aryan side.
And this is our house and there are my brother and sister.
Again grandparents were  I never discussed it with my grandparents obviously and I never discussed my grandparents Zionist attitude but the rest of the family  the Interview with Adi Eisenberg 7 August 29  2014 younger generation was ver y Zionist.
Were -- were peop -- was their solidarity in the ghetto  or was everybody out for themselves  or out for their small family group?
Oh  I want to say anyways  it was a an orphagenage   and then the Jewish Family and Children Service asked the kids where they want some of them had relatives in New York   some of the and  of course  every I wanted to stay in New York.
My brother-inlaw said  ﬁYes  no problem.ﬂ And we knew Smoller  because he was for a certain time sleep ing at a family nearby in the -- in our -- in the same ar -- in the same house  neighboring door  and there was no place here  so he slept with me in my bed  we slept together.
Well  first of all  it was really interesting  because my aunt  who said shed never go  since I was free  and her family was going.
And were there other Jewish families that left  do you know?
They said they just treated -- we were part of the family  whatever that meant.
Do I forgive the Germans for what they did to me and my family?
If somebody got a slice of bread  you wanted it for your family  so we decided whatever one got it was for him  or for her  and her family  and we took turns.
My father had three  two or three other sisters and his parents  they perished.
And seeing the family  and then the I stayed in the I wasnt I wasnt discharged yet  but I was able to stay home  and I worked with GCA Ground Approach Systems   cause Gilfillan was building radars and stuff for ground approaches  training  and I was Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 63still in the military  so I went to Mines Field which is LA International Airport  but the military side of it  and I wed go there every day and worked to put radios in planes and tune them up and stuff like that  cause the pilots were practicing landing with that new radar Gilfillan built.
Well  the first time that happened is when I was pretty young  four or five years old or something and when we lived in this nice part of Esson  the very affluent part with big back yards and we liked to play in the back yards and my sister and I and sometimes one of her friends also and we were playing there and the house next door was owned by a family who had one son and he was usually pl aying there by himself.
At that time  we were four children and my mother and father.
But after about  oh  I'd say six months approximately of peddling coffee he realized he could not support a family of five by selling coffee  and yet that was about the extent of what he knew.
But I had a lot of cousins and brothers and my father had family - brothers and sisters and I wish somebody would be...we tried right after the war and nobody.
Oh  because of -- because I realized that my family from Czechoslovakia will not join me and the second best -- I wanted family -- was my uncle  my fathers brother  who used to be extremely wealthy  in Czechoslovakia.
She knew the family and she was married to his uncle  you know.
And so we had to let that one who'd worked for us -- Ma ria who worked for us forever and we knew her whole family  I mean  she was wonderful  and we loved her.
And Gadiel with his family went out and  and Bension Schmidt he didn't come out.
And do you remember any discussions with your father as well  or mostly with your mother as you were leaving -- getting ready to leave?
I  too  wanted to take my family and my friends for granted  as all the people should.
I think -- I -- I didn't used to be this way  I think I was more in line with -- with my mothers expectations of -- of a more ordered society  but given what I do for a living and seeing the tremendous variety of -- of family behaviors  and the -- the treatment that people visit upon one another and upon their children  Ive become much more tolerant and -- an d accepting of the variations in those behaviors.
Tell me a little bit about what your life was like  before the War.
And so not only did your family not consider returning to Austria  but they wanted to stay put?
This p hotograph is from between 1940 to 1942 and shows members of Marcel's extended family wearing Jewish stars.
That would have meant crossing a border and difficulty in getting in touch with the family.
Can you repeat the village name  because I didnt quite catch it.
Was one family  Melamid  four people  two -- a -- a wife and a husband and two boys  and also was the third girl.
Simcha at some point before 42  everybody else in 42 except for my father and his family.
Interview with J udith Heimann November 21  2011 30 And nobody in the family had been friendly with him  but my grandmother was always friendly with him.
And so I got to know my Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 44sisters through my mothers words and also through her neighbors  the Van Luhrmann family.
If you were with one of your family  maybe they were picking it out of your head like the monkeys sat there and pick.
Hes the only one actually of the entire Deutsch family who survived.
I think the only Jewish family is the girl that I lived with in the end.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 34 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ny all along  because Poland and Lithuania and all those other countries did not exist for 200 years  they were al occupied by the Russians.
And this family took us in for a couple of weeks until a neighbor reported us to the police.
Here she has to work everyday so there were some days that all the family didn't meet because one is working afternoon.
Stayed in Lithuania   had the big big farm and cooperated with with that time occupant  and made pretty good   and the family rich now.
When you were back in -- in Frie dberg  did you also look for your family?
So it could be Im sorry to interrupt  but it could be that things could happen during the day to a family member  and you wouldnt find out No  no.
And we lived two to three families in a two room apartment.
Tell us what you know about what happened to your parents  and how you found out.
uh...a lot of people le ft  but I choose to be with my family  and I did not leave.
By the end of 1941 they forced you and your family and other families i n your town in Dokszyce into a ghetto.
Tell us what you can about going to Auschwitz and what happened once you arrived there.
And so  and I was in contact basically with this one man who had been the organizer of the family and there were three families that were friends besides Marcel Coulier and his wife and then two other couples and they were  they had form an organization as the friends of Dr. Bonet  which is the name of this pastor priest.
May I ask...when did you find out what had happened to your family?
So the family really had to scrounge around for basic food stuff.
My brother in Harrow   his family was as wonderful  and in fact  his foster mother eventually came to the United States  because his their daughter eventually married an American serviceman  and then brought her mother over to the United States .
And then the word  you know  from other Jewish family  we we my I think we found out from the through the grapevine that the men were leaving the police station and that they were being sent to Hamburg .
You are not going to play music the way our family plays  in Vlasenica.
And being he was an aristocratic family  I knew they would be in the telephone book.
And what I'm going to do  what my plan is to ask anybody just to  to direct me to a Jewish family.
Uh he uh uh interpreted the the the the experiences in Germany and Austria uh much more correctly than others did and he just did not feel that he wanted to to risk his family uh to the uh to the sort of experience that was happening in Germany and uh so we were going to leave uh the uh...we were sort of stashing money away.
He asked me to go to a dinner to his family.
You know  I have a nice apartment  I have a wonderful family  and I have Im free.
And we all lived in a courtyard  the whole family  cousins.
I had an aunt here in Washington  who was my mothers sister  who le ft Russia that time.
>> Bill Benson: At some point  of course  the Germans came in and they liquidated the ghetto and sent most of the people there  including your family  to their deaths.
And I came to him  he said  ﬁYeah and I was afraid to tell you.ﬂ So as adjusted our family is and as we are very Nesse Godin 72 December 14  1995 Page 72 different.
I want to stop you be cause I want to make sure I understan d. The rest of your family who was at home with you?
Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 116 When your children when your daughte rs were your age w-were the age that you were  the 16 year old  17  when you we nt through such terrible  terrible times in the ghetto and losing your family  did that remind you  did that bring back those times to you?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 25 \ I don't know.
Although she was Jewish  my mother worked w ith the Mother Superior sometimes  collecting money and doing charity work.
>> Bill Benson: Although World War II began in Europe in September of 1939  the full brunt of the war and the mass deportation of Jews in Hungary didn't occur until 1944.
Exactly the same kind of -- were you close with your father?
Where in the family were you  were you th-the youngest  the oldest  in-between?
And Rachels sister decided go together as a child and with the family  both sisters.
And this co -- this oh -- this -- this father of that family  by the name of Bozym was his last name  B-o-z - dot - y-m  Bozym.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
His parents owned a sock factory  a very small one  but they Interview with Harry Gelb December 13  2001 32manufactured socks  and he ca me from a very  very large Hassidic family.
So  in a way  I started thinking abou t my family  and I started thinking about all these people who perished  and this writing pr obably was a way to put my feelings into papers.
And she was coming out  and everybody like sheef I mean  I mean shefson  you know  like animals  the little animals that go  went the whole family went after her and they went out.
I mean  did your family stay No  no  no  no  nothing.
It was a tight family  close family  and -- and you know  I inherited the -- the -- the devotion to the idea of family from -- from my own parents.
And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.
How do you think it's effected your own views about your own family and having a family?
This is also how they formed a relationship with the family that eventually was to hide my sisters.
As I said  in 1943 and in the end of 1942 a nd '43  then they the close friends and the family started getting involved  and I don't know.
I really felt guilty  and I thought I owe my family some time of myself  not job number one  job number two  and then thirdly comes my family.
And -- And that made me very  very happy  because you must remembe r  my family  the von Halle family  and I mentioned to you  I have a family tree that goes back to 1672  all von Halles  and here were wiped out  at least my part of the tree was completely wiped out.
So once I was -- the little girl  and the third one came.
When my family came to the...to the ghetto  we were very poor because everything was taken away from us.
My f oster sister sort of takes pride in the fact that she counted five and a half religions represented in the family counting me as half since I was so little  half Je wish.
January 17 of 1943  our friends found places for us with a family who kept us from -- till the end of the war.
My father  I should say  was horrified and forbade me strictly to do that because not only did I endanger myself  very often the Gestapo would then also arrest the rest of the family  but I just didn't want to listen to any advice of caution and also I couldn't stand being so cooped up.
In my case  my parents decided that  as a form of insurance so that if one person might be taken  deported  at least -- killed  at least the others who survived would have a chance  so they decided that the family ought to split up.
And she found  through a whole long story that I cant go into now  but she found a police officer called Oskam  was his last name  O-s-k-a-m  who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer  came from USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 5 a completely Nazi family  and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the underground  and was hiding about 30 Jewish men  women and children  in the little village not too far from Utrecht.
My parents and his parents didnt say anyt hing  and that was -- he put me later on on his list as a family member  and thats how I ended up in Terezin.
Yeah  my father was extremely religious  due to the fact that my grandfather was religious.
In Stutthof   when I was there by myself you know with many nice Jewish women but no family  nobody  I didn't have a cousin  no one there with me  a few women from my home town  a woman came over to me and said to me they don't really keep children in concentration camps.
What did happen to your parents  and how did you learn about it?
The first thing that there was  that I lost my whole family  and so I was very  very  very shocked  you know?
And I have a lovely family  and my ch ildren are very attached to it  and thats the way it is.
We always had a family or two or three that were very friendly with and visited when we went there.
In the ghetto  when just be-- while the ghetto was being formed  or just before the ghetto  he knew a family from Lvov who were socially or politically active in Lvov before the war  and through them you could get a lot of things .
And I knew that he is there hiding already in the forest  so our plan was that on my father will come there  well stay for a few days there with this family  with a Christian family.
Because you said in the beginning your family goes back three generations.
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?
The other thing I told ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 you I discovered later.
And here was this family  there was that family and that was as far as the interaction.
Did your your entire family made it back; they all survived?
The other one  I vaguely remember  but the family  my blood family  my uncle decided either send me to another orphanage or to Palestine or to even an orphanage in South Africa.
Tell us about the ghetto and what conditions were like for you there.
And we brought my son and my husband  so it was around A family thing.
Well  there was over four years terrible hard work and far away from from family and with strange people  and most of them was uh were hardened with hunger because it was...everyday was uh think about uh bad...was was uh hunger all the time because it was very short of food.
So my mo ther's  the Lipkovich family  there is nobody survived.
Here I am 16 years old and I describe in the other tape how when you were 16  you were considered a family on your own and you needed your own stamp of -- of security  so you wouldnt be taken away.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 23 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: full concentration.
He called his whole family  brothers  sisters  brother-in-laws  uncles  aunts  nephews  nieces to his house and closed all the windows  the doors  and put in all the ovens the gas  and they killed themselves.
And my mother was the oldest of six girls  and one son.
Yeah  interesti ngly  well  there was very little left in our apartment  what was left  a couple of boxes  and I don't know why they were left there  this family never touched.
And they were -- the family was isolated th -- in the street.
Af ter going through hell  losing their family  starving  everything  they we re killed.
And its still my great desire that we be -- will become a happy family someday.ﬂ And then he ends with the words  ﬁOmnia vincit amor.ﬂ That is Latin for love conquers all.
Im sure it went to his family  but he never offered me a slice.
He doesnt know where I am  or where the rest of the family are  and -- and he has no answers  you know  nobody can -- can tell him.
They were a... you might say uppermiddle class American family with some problem s and they thought that getting two Hungarian refugees would probably mitigate their circumstan ces.
My parents brought several pieces of silver which I have since distributed to our children.
W hen we got acquainted with a local family  their name was [Niederberg ] .
Interview with Alan Kalish October 24  2003 124 [indecipherable] and stuff like that  and he -- he -- how -- how they got through the war  and you know  the -- how this family  I ju st read a book  I dont remember the name.
All right  now youre finished being in Berlin  youre back with your family in Breslau  and how long did you stay there?
I always -- I always was able to do everything that -- that I wanted for my family and with my family and you must accept that and I -- I'm accepting and I want you to accept.ﬂ And he reminded this to my daughter  and this was an 18 year old and -- and I would like to see which -- an 18 year old that is not religious would be able to do that an-and to have the strength and the -- and the wisdom to - to talk like that or to write like that or to feel like that and to think like that.
Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood memories before the war?
Otherwise  when I went -- you see  my two daughters  I have two daughters  they live in New York City  and when we used to go and vi sit in New York City  I used to get together with them  because its like family  you know  we were always together.
You know  we were -- used to know the Jarket Lerman  the strong  the assertive  the decision maker  the p -- the power in the family.
Then there was the butcher of the Hesse family  near where they lived.
It was an English family Nash yes  changed from Nashinski   yes.
If you are from that family \  she said  \ I work for the shoe department.
We six girls found there a girl of 14  who had lost all her family  and we took her under our care.
I know much more -- when my cousin of the -- the Uncle Ephrai ns daughter  when they finally eve -- returned from Vorkuta and when he found his family and when she came to visit me  she knew nothing about Jewish customs or anything.
No  I mean  it was normal  like a two-story house here  and upstairs we had one  two  three bedrooms.
But anyway  so we went to see her family  in which theyre just about all gone now.
I worked at Allied Chemicals in Morrisstown and I was renting a room with a family.
Your parents you said were very active  Jewishly  in community -- Yes. --
A few days before I had an uncle  my mother had an brother in France who survived  and he contacted the family so we got established a contact and in a few days money was coming in and packages were coming in and telegrams were coming in and May 1946 we came here.
There -- There -- They regarded me as a member of their family.
My father went 1910  and the rest of the family came 1913.
Tell us what happened and then from there you went into the ghetto.
That was the last time that my parents saw my sisters.
And we saw there there I met a girl from Yugoslavia   she was on a bench sitting  I warmed myself in the sun  and then I met the girl Truwik from our city  from Dabrowa  they have a store with leather goods  the ver very fine family and we talked about it.
In a way of thinking what I would do if I would be with my family together how I would find out.
Yeah  this is my family picture  which I got at the Un-United States.
And we had a few cousins and my aunt and uncle and we wanted to be in New York.
And I remember when they wanted to isolat e the sick children  they had to needed space from another family  so they displaced them a little  and tried to tell them the space here was just as good  whatever was left when they moved the other children.
And how did your mother also work to support the family?
He had the stolen in the pocket  for the   the family sent  and he was hungry.
Because it really shows the story that by th en you had built a life here  and a community  and a family.
And there are documents to that e ffect  and so starting in early '44  the family starts becoming concerned about how to survive the transition and this is when these very bizarre plots get hatched  and everybody does them very secretly on their own.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 You have so much to tell us in a short period of time.
Well at the expense of sounding whiny  I woul d say that my family like many  many people got screwed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and my parents had to start from scratch again and never could quite build it up to where they had in Holland.
And then later when I was about 12  again  my brother and others in the family were in the Maccabi  I was a member of the HASK  which was the Crotian academic sports club  Hrvatski akademski 6 sportski klub  which still exists.
And so your father  your uncle  your your aunt  and your brother were there all together.
As you can imagine  I was the youngest  real ly the youngest.
I just screamed at him that why he said to me we should go back home  I was -- I dont know  I was -- my mind was completely -- I was co mpletely confused  you know  and -- but a funny thing happened that that boy  that cousin of mine was the only one of his family that survived  and not so ma -- and he was very religious.
And as part of that  tell u s the meaning of geltungsjude and what that meant to you and your family.
It was not my family  and not my grandparents  not my parents  but some poor families from out in the village.
Well I think  without be ing religious Jews  we all  always did have and still do have a feeling of being Jewish.
You go this way  Tatarska 3 -- that is little small 16 cottage  one family.
Can you tell us a little bit about the town that you born in  and that you grew up in?
And my mothers wealthy family in Warsaw   they had arranged for us to be smuggled over the border August 31 st  1939  you know  together with the family.
who has written in Israel  has written a family history  and he says its true  I dont know how he knows.
I come from eight people  six children  three girls and three boys and my father and my mother and the rest of the family  my father's side was six brothers and three sisters.
In talking about the synagogue  can you tell a little bit about how religious your family was?
And he was an insurance man  of a great business family.
And my family was -- by that time  where I was born there were what you would consider today Reform Jews  not very religious Jews.
A little bit further lived a family with three boys  and we were all -- so you had -- yeah  in Germany  the stuff was getting -- is Hitler  so one of the boys then turned out to be a Nazi  and the oldest was a Communist  and the in-between was in-between.
02:09:00 So your family decided to move to the Italian zone?
Did your parents have contact with any family members who still were over?
This is  or was my family  a nd this is how it was for me.
Can you tell me a little bit about your uh childhood?
Thomas Buergenthal 66 November 28  1995 Page 66 Have you ever written about your person al experience  whether it would be for some sort of publication  or even maybe perhaps for your family?
And when the other families came -- the rest of the family  my mother was pregnant with me  and she go -- ju st got married and they couldnt come to the United States.
My aunt -- my uncles wife had family in Isra -- in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 93 Palestine.
The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family  when the  the farmer whose  who had the horse and the cart went back  eventually   was caught and lost both.
One ince -- well  my Uncle Zelig I remember c -- his army unit was passing through Kowal and he said  I want to visit my family.
He said  not from your family and not any other Jew is alive.
Her family was shot  everybody of he r famil y was shot.
Sounds like it was an upper cl ass family that you were born into.
Th really  I began to realize that what Id missed  is after my mother passed away  you know  that I didnt have a history  I didnt have the information of my father  and I didnt have know at all dont know at all what my fathers family anything about my father.
Sure we knew like before I went in to be a maid and the family sat together and we talked and we had to play cards with my father...we griped  I mean like any ordinary teenager.
That's all you think is about food  having food for the kids  having food for your family or whatever it was.
So my best friend wa s a Catholic girl next door  which was a Catholic family  a -- with five children.
The other great motivation was to try to restore  wherever possible  some semblance of family life.
In the meantime  while we are having some lessons in our home and took care of us  we lived together as one family  15 boys.
On the other hand  I think that she  because she has such a family duty  and her family is a very  very [indecipherable] very famous family in Israel.
And were these relatives on your mothers side or your fathers side?
Now that -- that was the turning point for your family.
I think that mostly thanks to the family of the Radziwells  because they heard in Nesvizh there might be a big palace.
If you come from a Polish farming family  a Jewish family  somewhere in a shtetl  where the father was a shoemaker  and the mother did the household  and -- and life was fairly primitive  but wonderful  but then  thats not my background either.
I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to get from England  London.
When he came to the family farm Shairtza and he said  come with me  when was that?
Today it was an interesting story how Jewish people got killed.
My mother  my father  my brother  my sister  my aunt  my uncles  large families.
Now  let's start with   I guess  your father's family -- brothers  sisters that he had.
Did your family ever tell you what hi s father and mother and other family members were thinking or saying duri ng these days?
So the group that you are traveling with was just your family ?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 25 Had you known at all  at the time or late r  right after the war  what had happened with her family  how they had hid  and how most of them had not survived or whatever  or di - di -- they -- or they werent familiar enough to you that you wo uld even have known about it?
I guess what Im trying to get a sense of  was there something about your family life  certain values you grew up with that in some way prepared you or motivated you later on to do the sort of work you did?
And what was your first impression of Germany when you got there?
So you had a house  just your family had a house?
I would make sure that this goes with me  plus my nona's bag with family pictures  and the little gold piece that you will see very soon.
How was it that your family -- describe to us what happened that made it possible for you all to not be sent on the trains to Auschwitz.
New York  because my uncle ha -- had -- was there  my mothers brother.
Anyway  they -- the family had a house in Athe ns  its 18 Corniavo Street  but the Greeks had taken it over and they could not get it back.
That week was critical for us  because while we were there  during that quarantine  a very good friend of our familys in Amsterdam  Mrs. DeYoung  informed  by telegram most probably  Westerbork authorities  the Jewish people  or the council people who worked there  that documents from our family in Switzerland  with Hondur an passports  and also  I think  Palestine visas were made available for us and our pa rents and brothers.
Talk about something that had to be for the entire family a tremendous cultural shock t o go from what you had experienced -- >> Jill Pauly: A lot of funny stuff  really   now looking back.
Also  did you want to discuss a little bit about what happened to your family after the war?
End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 18 This is tape two  side B  of an interview with Frida Wallenstein.
So the first arrest was everybody else in the family except for him and his wife.
And I... They start asking me where I live  and I didn't want to give up my family  give out my family.
I mean it did we were the the same type of people  th e same type of family  and th its just fate.
And it went something like this  you know  I can take a ll this love loss of all my family  and she really never lost her whole family  if youre only a good girl  if youre only it was very conditional.
And then she lived with another family out of London and eventually landed up in a hostile.
Was your would you say your family was well-to-do No  no.

And what was the communication betwee n your parents and family or friends back in Europe?
You see  we became like family with the five other people in hope by just supporting one another maybe the life would not be as devastating.
Did you feel like you were a German as well as being Jewish?
Finally  the end result was that I was put into---with a Jewish Family and Children's Service in Boston and they took care of me.
He met me and he told me that my family  my father  met him on the station in Harkov  thats a city in Russia.
And so we walked out of the apartment and we went to Mr. In't Hout's apartment an d it was just a small was a family of four  a husband and wife an d two children  a boy an d girl about my age.
>> Bill Benson: During that time  Rita  when your mother  of course  realizes that she's lost not only her husband but her parents and many of the family  what did your mother do to help make ends meet  to make sure that you could survive  have food on the table?
Yes  I think I told you before  she became a maid to a German family  came from Germany.
But theyre -- theyre two friends -- I have other ones too  that I can depend on  and I consider family  but you realize  I dont know why  it scares me sometimes  because I dont want to get depressed  I dont want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you know  left alone or something like that.
But I am still very lucky  cause you saw pictures of my family from home.
Yes  but I can understand them better  because when I came out of the camps  I spoke English very well  and I had to speak German to my mo ther  and to my family.
Uh...My daughter  Tamara  went to Switzerland to live with the rest of the family after she graduated from high school.
That's when my two sisters were taken to the psychiatric hospital where both my parents at that point were hiding  my mother a nurse  my father as a patient  and there was a mini reunion of the family then.
When did things start to get really very bad for your family?
They did and for that and thats a small maybe price to pa y in view of what others lost but dont forget I lost my family too.

DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 33 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: 4th.
It was very important to me to have a child  because I always wanted a family.
And my father rented a room and we went with my mother  we stayed there.
I didn't realize that  I'm missing  like I'm missing that side of the family.
And I am saying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War  my family sort of stayed to stayed in the geogr aphical locations they were  but all of a sudden they were citizens of three different countries  Czechoslovakia   Hungary and Austria.
We were more really writing of how we can be together and start as a family  be [indecipherable] him and me and my sister  whether -- wherever it would be that we would be together.
I thought for creating  for  for creati ng a new family  new life for ourselves  for the goal  for  for me to survive  but in the circumstances  in the time  I could have laid down and  and died  it was very easy to lay down and die  but the that's the easiest thing  a challenge  that's the reason we hold life ---------a challenge.
And it is in  he and uh it came out that the whole family was burned alive.
That -- the two uncles  my father's two brothers  and two sisters that he had.
I -- you know  those days is my mind was all mine  to see my brothers and sisters and maybe some from the family.
Now  you seen it on the Anne Frank movies that people were stealing bread from members of the family.
I had a feeling of  everybody knew  of impending doom  of th ings that were going to happen  but I wasn't totally wiped out or down in the dumps about it  I had a rather good feeling about it  and when it came time for our responsiv e answer to the guy that was doing the selection  my mother spoke up  she became the h ead of our family unit  and she explained to the guard that her husband and father work on the work detail at the airport  the aerodrome  and the aerodrome was an extremel y vital part and in order not to disrupt their well-being  and with her immediate pr oper response  we were allowed to go home as a family unit again  and we survived that selection where a lot of people didn't.
Can you tell me when your family moved to Hamburg ?
It was this family which my parents save life 12 people.
How you know  how do you fit in as a family  as Well  we we were rented an apartment  which we kept the entire time  in a middle class neighborhood.
They would take them out of school and they would work as maids to bring some income for the family  and also learn to be nice young ladies  the way city people were.
Family - 16 my first son was born in 1950  and my second son  1952.
And my relatives lived in the German  many of them in the German part which was then Poland.
And I assume that your family a ll went to Treblinka.
Are you angry that you had to go through what you did and have the losses that you have and other people your age living over here did not have to go through that?
The Garih family fled south but they soon returned to Paris where they were subjected to France's new anti -Jewish legislation.
Did you -- How did you tell him that your mother was dead?
So when we got to Adelsheim that time  there were two people: one person who said his parents had brought food -- his father brought food over to my mother and father at night and that his mother was very concerned because if she had been caught  something might have happened to his family ; and then another woman who said they had traded things with my parents for food.
Now when did you -- were you able to see your parents at times?
My grandmother had  she was the oldest and she had five sisters.
I remember an episode that we come to the Lithuanian family talking about the exchange  so the it happened that we also had to give them some money.
I just remember I was the one person who I knew growing up who had hardly any family.
He was hoping to find some trace of the family which could help.
I enjoyed being with a family b ecause I hadn't had a family in all this time.
I became closest with Aunt Belkas daughter  she had only one daughter  Rosalie also -- popular name in my family -- and her fi ance  Stanley.
Our family was well off ; a maid  a cook  and what was very important to the generation of my parents  a governess who taught us perfect German because at that level of Hungarian -spe aking society  you had to speak perfect German.
And your mother talked to you about going to Baltimore  and the family that you would be staying with and what you would be doing?
My father favored my sister over me  but my sister  we have a strain in the family  of petite woman  my sister had that strain.
And -- And -- And I want you to know that every family  from the Holocaust survivors  they take pride in their ch -- kids  because its like a double accomplishment.
Did you follow the events in Germany in the early 1930s?
Applause] Esther  thank you so much for joining us  for being so willing to be our First Person today and to have family members here.
I took my wife  my son  and we went to Shanghai.
And we were a very happy family  and Antwerp is a beautiful ci city by by the ocean.
At that point it was my mother  my brother and I and two other kids and my grandmother.
So this family  their home was conf iscated  what did you th ink at that time?
Yes  I think that the young people should try to reach and meet  maybe some survivors  or people who -- whose family suffered to -- to form a common bond.
And -- and there I was with them  with this family.
Now did you  w ith your family  did you observe religious holidays and go to the synagogue regularly?
So you also get a gift of knowledge of Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 39 She told me about my mothers family  and about my mother.
So there was only one family  but otherwise there were two families  either a three or a four.
Not just a single family or two or three devoted citizens but an entire village and their neighbors.
Im not sure  because eventually our family got so separated  that with all the trips and spending time first with both parents  then with one parent  you know  you lose a lot of Yeah  of course.
To be closer to their family  Henry and Doreen moved to Bethesda  Maryland in 2000.
>> Bill Benson: When the war for you is over  it' s August 1944.
And she was very  very unhappy and that made me unhappy because  you know  I loved my mother very much.
And she was helping with  y -- you know  the thing -- the house and keeping the house clean and -- and cooking  some cooking and my mother wa s away working.
Now  when your family put together your request  who did you approach to be your sponsors in the United States ?
Not as such because being within the family and the school  uh you know  if I ventured out into the non-Jewish community  it was normally my parents' acquaintances.
Did you have communication with your parents while you were with the Fuerst family?
They -- they seemed to feel that th -- were Jewish.
Would you mind if we tried to find a family  a foster family  for your child  which will keep it until you come back?\
All in all  you know  the biggest share of our family got out  ex cept for the kids from Koblenz  they all -- they all perished.
>> Bill Benson: You would remain there until the war ended in Belgium which was in 1944.
>> Bill Benson: When he left you  where were you at that point?
Who was  as it happened in a Jewish family  she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother.
But with her  she has the same problem as I  when she dreams  she dreams also about her family  about her ho -- about her youth.
And aft er a while they put another family with a little girl who became my best friend  in our apartment.
So there was a lot of interaction between a non-Jewish community and our family.
Now  my sister was with my mother's family and  until one day came a selection.
When you returned home  did you talk to any of your family about your experiences in the war?
What was the impact on you  as best you can tell?
Because this was a village  you know  with a lot of farmers.
In -- I draw  I write  I cook  I do everything  because the whole family is artistic.
Al Munzer: Who had taken  sorry  my sisters  denounced his wife as hiding two Jewish 9 children  so the Nazis took his wife.
Thats -- my family called me Xenon  that second name Xenon.
Now  my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen  the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the time...I was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said  \ Though (that's my Hungarian name) isn't home  we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son  Emmy  and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into labor camp.
And y and that Not only that  almost every one of these PWs managed to find a Jewish ancancestor in his family.
He said the family of Simon Topas which means  if it were my brother  in the unlikely event  it is not he who wrote this --scribbled that name-- but maybe his son or his daughter who marked this in order to look for someone.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 Again we had a problem.
So we were so it sounds that your par your parents were assimilated into Polish?
There were seven sons and we had the family  a nd when their it broke out  they went there were a lot of bandits there  because there was no Polish police  there was no Russian police  and people started robbing.
From a child my -- my direct experience was about the reality of that happening to me  to my family  to the neighbors in the immediate -- Right. --
You said that your uncle tried to help your family leave Poland and come to the United States  where was he living at that time  your uncle?
And you just mentioned that you recall the very early memories of your mother and your father.
I had two little cousins  a girl my age and her brother who was maybe three  two or three.
There was a bunch of children in that family   near the Eiffel Tower  actually  in the heart of Paris.
And there were about  I would say  three or four more Jewish family.
This is tape number three  side B. And I think I would just like you to speak a little bit more about your family.
My grandmother and my grandfather  they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.
It was it was really a a deep friendship which developed and which it lasted for a long time after we left Bel...Be lsen already and which manifested itself whet her there was uh many weddings  for in stance  occurred and we went there together and there came came came and there came came came all kinds of occasions and we 45 were we were always together and and and uh I would say in this re spect  I must say  Joseph and were very inst rumental in developing an atmosphere in whic h you did not only (cough) discuss business but also asked  you know that Yiddish expression ...what is going on with the family  what...and people then revealed what what what what their their innermost...what's bothering them and so so you knew you had a place where you coul d exchange not only views but your mood with with with friends.
So  in this house  we had a bedroom and a kitchen  and we didnt have anybody to live with us because he wouldnt allow the Polish owner would not allow any more than just one family.
When I finally did get hold of my family in the United 4The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.
I go to Nice and to Monte Carlo while Im there.ﬂ He said  ﬁMy family lives in Cannes.
Now when you then got married and started your family  did all this time  did you think about your family that you had lost?
So when they said  ﬁYou are the president from the family circles ﬂ I took off my wifes mink stole  and I said  ﬁPlease meet the president of the family circle.ﬂ He said  ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ So I said  ﬁIf I wouldnt be able to buy a mink stole  I would never be a president of my family circle.ﬂ They didnt like it.
Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 190 Did he lose many members of his extended family?
I had forgotten the addre ss in Brussels that his family lived at  but I have been there since.
Did you know  or did people in your family know   about the Germans; what the Nazis were doing in Germany at this time?
And we had a family en terprise  a sawmill in this Novi Rozenkov near Vsetin and later in Vsetin.
We had friends that were my mothers and fathers friends who had children.
I mean  a-at this point there was only happiness in the whole family.
Now there was only one family  I heard about this for years  there was one family who decided not to leave.
One  cold  if you will  cold -- cold calculation  if -- that if Germany is to enter into the family of western nations  it cannot ignore this chapter  it has to do -- do something with this -- with this problem.

And I didn't  all I knew is that sh e owned that place  I didn't know  I had never been there  what it was like or so  but I went to her and  of course  I told her also that my parents and sister had been arrested and I told her that whether we could make some arrangement that I and also a family of frie nds  that's a couple and a daughter  could live in that cottage.
But then  in 1932  my family moved to eastern Poland   which was [indecipherable] .
Even today Israel  I thought Israel would be the mirror for the world  what we went through  how we can show an example to the world  how we can live like a family.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 >> Bill Benson: But relative to that.
>> Jacques Fein: From what I know they were a French Catholic family.
And then when we got back  after we had gone to the house and were talking with this family  the man turned to me and said -- he said  I saw you when you came to the kitchen -- you saw what change we made there.
My en mine parents is my father  my father was a very religious person.
And by happy circumstance  we shared a -- we shared a ba throom with another family  on th -- the -- on -- outside of the apartment itself.
As the family eked out a living  each one of us working for the Yankee dollar  in order to survive and thrive  strangers in a strange land.
Well  in 1950 I started to  you know  get my family  Im married and I have one son  trying to get a job  the job worked  an d I wanted something else.
Anyway  the family lived in the apartment in the back  the Runjaks.
He was a very lovable ma n  good  caring  very caring for the family.
And I didn't do it  because I didn't leave family and friends.
And you know  some of them had children  and I suspect that there were  you know  close family friends.

We worked on railroads and everything to correct whatever   and then we even worked in homes  big family homes Š in – 7 in their garden.
It took them -- they never really adjusted to what happened to their family members.
And that whole 41 family is very...they are very closed-mouthe d about when things go wrong.
You want the family  you want your children  you want a roof over your head.
So you were with your mother and your father and who else?
In 1941  Germany invaded Yugoslavia and their ally Hungary occupied the part of Yugoslavia where you and your family lived.
Can you just tell me something about your childhood  your home?
But the others  the big family  everyone was killed by the Nazis.
A My mother  my father  my sister  my little brother and myself.
My father was a Hasidic Jew  very religious  my mother...the whole family was very religious.
Stricek at that point  he was born in 1885  he was old  and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moments notice  and he was he would have never made it.
More we were not allowed to have  but certainly the the the war fever developed into a pitch and uh then we were bombarded from England with a requ est to try to somehow uh change the date of the departure to an earlier date  and it took tremendous efforts to do it because all the children and all the parents had to be notified and things had to rearrange  so anyhow we were able to to to uh uh to uh have it  to change the departure date from Septem ber 1st to August 29  and I decided then uh on account of the situation not to be the leader of that transport because uh my then wife was in Berlin and I and my parents and my sister and I felt responsibility and and I was concerned that if something would happen  especially if a war will come  I will be cut off and I I felt that uh uh I could not have done this toward my family and this is the reason why I was caught in Germany.
And his father his father had a Doctor of Jurisprudence from Heidelberg  so it was in the family.
Yeah  but I think it was more my father  of -- you know  and so I think  ﬁWell  how could my mother stand?ﬂ I mean  I dont know whether she was close to her brothers and sisters  but you know  you -- it was kind of a reasonably clos e knit family  and -- and so  how could she stand listening?
Applause] Irene  thank you for joining us and your willingness to be our First Person .
And then of course  as time went on  there were other than Jews that -- that had to get to Sweden.
To this land  our ashes were taken  put gently death to rest and our children walk proudly  for we have Israel at last.ﬂ That's -- it -- it -- it's such a victory  in a way to -- to write something like that  that -- I -- I always  I wrote -- i-if I'm -- if I'm made a birthday for my children and my -- my family couldn't be there  I wrote a poem.
Well but so he was bor -- he was baptized in the Protestant faith  and then my mother lost her husband during the first few weeks of the first World War  and became very ill with tuberculosis  which meant she -- thanks to the help of the friend of the family  the victor - Queen Victorias great grand-nephew  the count of Coburg and Gotha -- not count  Im sorry  the duke of Coburg and Gotha saw to it that she was put in a -- in a -- a sanitorium  and she survived very well.
How long had your family  either on your mother or your fathers side  been in in that locale?
And another one who was a her husband and family had a bakery in Miskolc and she was -- she was a strange lady.
I am a nephew--I was recognized as being part of the family.
Not the kind or thodox family because our part where I lived in Silesia was belonged before to Germany.
And they -- they dont think that the way we do  that Jews were killed only because they were Jews  and there were different reasons.
Remember  this is May  and my family went out uh May 19 you see.
Uh...When I was in Israel I found out that about 147 members of my family were taken out to a flield and they were all shot.
>> Bill Benson: Yet  for some reason  you remained -- >> Marcel Ho dak: It didn't affect me that much  but it would have affected my brothers and my family.
There is on that original -- on the counterfeit document was the same birthday  and the same first name.
It was a -- yeah  yeah  it was a close-knit family.
Let's wait a minute and... because I want to put another role of tape on and we're just about to the end of this role... so... End of Tape #1 10 Tape #2 Before you tell me more about your family  after you got to the United States  and the war got really into full swing  and the United States got involved  tell me what you heard and what you knew from the perspective of what you knew then as well as you can remember.
At that time  af ter Krystallnacht  the whole world saw and the Jews also knew  even those Jews who still loved Germany and they lived in Germany for a long time and they had family trees and they had ancestors  they saw that you cannot live in Germany any more.
Nobody knew where we were because the lady that took us across never showed up  and we were sitting in the apt all alone  the 2 of us  until somebody from the family came  I don't know how many days later  sitting th ere crying we were.
Within days your city of Lwow was occupied by the Nazis and your family was forced into a ghetto.
After the war  did you ever think about going to Israel?
So we couldnt get married in Holland and I was very depressed and -- and my whole family was gone and I -- I looked for them  I went to -- always looki ng to every town and was nothing there.
But my grandfather -- well   he housed some of the soldiers in th e First World War.
It was a very wonderful group of people from all over including a Kalnick family from the steppes of Russia.
Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg 26 Somebody came to our house one day  I remember that  and told my mother  and then she was hysterical  crying  and somehow  you know  we found out what it was all about  that she was told that her whole family was  you know  was killed.
Because my parents had left Poland  they lost the Polish nationality.
Before we go to the State De partment  could I ask you about your  is your family Jewish?
I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't thin k that my parents could have afforded that  and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family  so that we had to find other ways out.
Of the -- no  its was -- I -- my re-relatives  not family.
He was wonderful too  but he was wonderful to our family  to us girls.
You came here with nothing  with nobody  no language  no family  no money  nobody.
All my old friends were gone  and even though I came from an absolute non-observant family  I was always as a little child already drawn to being more Jewish.
They took me ou t from the yeshiva and they set me up from the Jewish agency  Jewish Children and Family Service in Montreal and they even send me to a public school.
Because I had an older brother who was 18 years old and he was already employed as an electrician in the city of Lodz and he helped out already with some  what do you call it  he sent some money home  helped out the rest of the family.
No  no  it was a family that they were in the -- i-in the forest  a husband and wife  and they survived in a bunker  and they came to Koretz.
I had three brothers and I had three sisters and I was  I was the youngest one.
All of these people were killed  all except our immediate family  in the Holocaust.
However  he stopped in a little town in Holland called Dinksburlow and there he was -- he was given a contact with a family by the name of Pagrach  P-a-g-r-a-c-h.
Was established the young ones belonged to a fighting group  the older ones -- you know we had some older escapees and couples  married the -- and -- and a family up front  you call it a boyavoyee and a family.
>> Bill Benson : You would live under those circumstances until the fall of 1942 when then you were forced into a ghetto in Drohobycz.
My husband is orig inally also from Holland  and that family was very lucky  they made it just in time out of Holland before the war.
When I was there  they put up tables and everybody  the head of the family have to stay first.
Bill Benson: And I was going to also ask you  tell us about the interactions between your family and other Jews with the Christian community in Dokszyce.
Then we went back and in the meantime  my parents moved from Paris to Nice.
We were put in a one -room -- one room with several families in other rooms.
And do your on your fathers side of the family  do you know if he had brothers and sisters?
>> Marcel Hodak: I found out from that book that what happened in Bride -les -Bains  what happened to the family  I found out we were all together  in reality.
My father had family in Poland  and my mother had family in Poland.
Ah  so the family didnt move  you were -- No  I dont -- -- you went to school.
It was always more fear and terror and lack of perfection which for a family with children  if the law abandons you and you are thrown at the mercy of these people who now obviously don't want you  it's really a terrifying event.
Tell us about your family  your community and what life was like before the war began.
My mother actually was most of her time in just the family and then the war started then.
Once they put us into this ghetto  this area  each family received one room .
And did you have non-Jewi sh friends as a young child?
But this is the way I remember my family  and to me  looking at them right now  is very important and very meaningful.
From the time they we re very little  they had a party where they invited all their friends and they played games  they had one day when they wanted to go to the favorite re staurant for dinner  just the family and one day where I had to make their favorite di sh at home.
Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 3 Did your family have a long history in that area?
And I did it quite often for the family  they should have what to eat.
So  so many of your family members just scatter and perish?
He she had a sister  older sister who lived also in Przemy l. They all who had they had three children  two boys and a girl  they all died  m-my mothers sister and her family  they all died.
A I see -- I told you that my father was in the quota  so h-he -- he knew why he did it  and -- but somehow  I think that in the family  he wasnt taken very seriously because -- because he -- he said several times that this is the train  which he will ta-take to go to see Italy .
I don't think they meant to make me feel that way but I didn't feel part of that family unit.
And the last time I saw my family  un – we unloaded.
My sister is -- lives in Israel  and she also has a son and a daughter.
With all the family  with all the friends you had  you had to make it on your own  whatever it is.
And there was my father  my husband and my older brother.
I was a very still  very frightened as a girl and it was interesting in our family that after the elementary school there four years  I asked my mother that I want to go in a private Jewish school.
And so you wh en you went to Warsaw   were you living by yourself?
So to return to your family  on the banana boat to Panama -- Yeah. --
Tell us about life as you know it during that time with the Madna family.
Me  my mother  my father and the two brothers  my tw o brothers and my mother's sister and aunt.
And being that she -- her name was Gerszono wicz and the other people were not related  but they also have the same name  and -- and they talked her into stay  so that we stay with her -- this 131 family  and my uncle came  and I came to look on my uncle  and I found out -- and I went to -- I wrote a letter to a Polish family which lived ne arby my uncle in the vill age and sure enough I got an answer from my uncle  I was su rprised that they survived  a nd I rushed to go to see them.
Tell me a little bit about your family and growing up in Bivolari.
I saw her only one time when that family has written a letter to the Doblinkov family that they have the other sister a nd they probably want to know  maybe they can get rid of her and send her to me.
In this 1946 photograph  we see George with a group of survivors  all of with whom the Pick family had been in hiding.
So then we moved to another apartment  a one bedroom apartment.
So your mothers It was my mothers side of the family.
We ch ildren perhaps because of our age  by this time I had just turned my eighth birthday in Decemb er before we left  and uh the uh children of the family Meyer  one wa s younger - I believe he was only five - and uh the other  the the girls - on e was a year older than myself and one was exactly the same age.
Or maybe I was brought up in a nice family home and I didnt have any upsetting situations.
And then I went to high school  and then I went to college.
What did you do  how long di d it take for you to be deported  what happened?
My father's mother and also my father's sister and her husband  her two children  and her mother -in-law.
My -- my family and two other families were housed -- it was -- one of the things in Capostiano was that it was a sof-house.
My relatives in the United States were not in a position to take me so I was placed in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  with a fo ster family and that wasn't an ideal foster family.
A. As I told you  a time came that you couldn't even save your own family.
And so he had a lot of frie nds who were not Jewish  and we had no -- no -- none in particular [indecipherable] my family.
Tell me about your family and about what it was like growing up in your family.
There is a picture in the book of my mothers sister  younger sister Zosia who hid the Katz family  and Ludwig   supposedly with a new haircut  but he was six feet four  so the change in outlook didnt it was just question of time when he would be.
Were you aware of what  the nature of what was happening to Jews in Europe?
So he  of c ourse  has taken the not the family albums  he took the his from from the jail  with all his friends  and the and and they started  you know  telling that my father was so bad  that my father was beating them  and and and things things that I was listening  I I dont even remember any more.
When you became reunited with your cousin and the other surviving family members can you tell me what that reunion was like and what you spoke about?
You know  when I saw the Sards family  I swear to you  I saw -- I saw them.
I felt that if that family -- the name of the people were Baker  if the Bakers werent -- in Folcoff  Pennsylvania  which is near the airport -- if their home is not safe  my home is not safe.
So when my mother was taken away and my husband's family  we all went together with my dad and my brother and my cousin and my ant and the children--we all lived together.
They were all survivors  so within the family  issues of discussing their past are certainly -- were n-nothing to hide  this was part of their joint and several backgrounds.
They were very decent family  a Catholic family  and they really paid him the market price.
Who was it that was sent to the chambers right away from your family.
Does it relate to a family member or -- I think the Johanna is some grea t grandparent.
But my parents  of course were part of the Jewish community  but we were not Orthodox  we were not -- we were secular.
Well  as I indicated  my relatives on both sides of the family had uh in the last years when it was possible immigrated out of continental Europe.
Did you -- did you go back to Poland to see your mother?
I think our way of life was so different  but they were definitely part of our family and considered part of our family.
Okay  I made the equivalency and then I finished x-ra y technician and my husband was very unhappy that I am going and I'm looking for a profe ssion because the European men are very proud people and it was  it was very upse tting to him  he cannot support his family in a certain style.
And then they went to another family  where the father was a diamond merchant.
The Jewish guys used to help one way or the other  the family camp.
End of Tape One  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 29 Beginning Tape Two  Side A This is tape number two  side A  of an interview with Norman Belfer.
He was in the army and actually it's one of those things th at he was on furlough and his parents invited my family and children to come over.
Later I found out that she said to him  Look  you're alone  your family was killed.
PAT LYNCH: Not really  I didn't um  they were having a hard time finding their family members.
So anyway  when he returned  she told that he doesnt want that other woman any more  he returned to the family.
I can remember carrying butter and bread in my underwear to bring back to the Ghetto and to going through the sentry and being afraid that when I remember one time (sign) it was so bad and this was after a while that I  with another boy  I decided we would stay out and we would not go back to the Ghetto  but we missed our family so much.
7 >> Josie Traum: You know  I didn't until I came back with my aunt.
So  there were three other children in the family; a baby  a very young child  and and Beverly  who was I was seven  she was five four or five.
It was totally out of his character and his family and so forth.
So I remember ri ght there in the customs  where someone from the Allens family took me  and I took the accordion a nd played quite well.
We were the only family  that I know of  of three people.
The importance here of talking about the family is this  Babcha gave -- she was pr -- gave birth 13 times  but nine children survived.
>> Bill Benson: But you also weren't part of the family structure and you remember that.
And then the family Lithuanians told you next day about the shooting and before they shot them  they told them to take off everything at least.
But most of all my aunts and young uncles were killed.
And little children and I wrote in my story that that was the most  the sadd est thing because we remembered that our family were killed.
My father was an MD  my mother was a housewife  and between the years of 1922 until 1933 there were 11 years with a normal family life  nothing special.
Your whole family will be killed  and you will be killed.
>> Bill Benson: And you would end up staying with them.
And th-then I grew up with my mothers other family  and and got to where I felt like I had another family.
And I was telling my daughter-in-law  do you know  I -- in the middle of all these celebrations and its so wonderful  see Jewish life continuing an-and ju -- my cousins parents were survivors and its wonderful  but Im standing there and all I can picture -- and this is a picture that Ive studied from medieval times even  and they herded Jews into the synagogue and then set them afire.
>> Suzy Snyder: Were any of your father's family persecuted and interned in camp?
Uh they brought in all the Jews that lived in little villages  one family  two families they brought.
This is the Katznelson family which 44 the Katznelson [indecipherable] family which was [indecipherable] very  sort of known family.
But still we were...we would like to stay in one place  because one precious thing was left to us--the family was together.
>> Bill Benson: When I first met you  almost 16 years ago  you told me about the Schoen family and they had gone to vote.
You know  the border to our family was fungibl e because they lived right on the border.
It was a lovely place to be and we did have a large Jewish community.
And the friends that you had  were they Jewish and non-Jewish?
When he was cleaning the area in the market this old farmer came by  and he said to my father  I'm really sorry what happened to you and your family.
Tell us how that affected your family and how quickly was the effects felt once the Germans rolled in in May of 1940?
In fact  in the family over here there was there was the Luchs family are you are yo u a native Washingtonian?
That had a profound effect on your family in  of course  leading them to conclude that life under the Nazis was already horrible and was going to become worse likely.
I -- Certainly my parents were very interested to s -- an-and worried about their relatives not knowing what happened to my -- her brother  and th -- and the -- and the family  and I -- I -- if Im -- Im going to look it up when we conclude this interview  but -- so they -- whatever wa-was ne ws on the radio  and in the paper  they kept up with  but when exactly -- I mean  I guess I learned it as everybody else learned it.
Did you know any of your cousins or aunts or uncles or grandparents?
My husband had a tremendous amount of respect for my mother and my mother had very much respect for him because  not only because he tried to work so hard and to establish a life and hav e children and a you know  family life and taking care of me  but just the fact that he was trying to hard in everything and to pleas e her and to please me and to just try to make a good life for all of us  yeah.
Before you -- we get on the ship coming to the United States  what was it like to live -- I mean  did you have contact with German citizens in your day to day life?
We left them the family jewel  we left them -- the store was taking away by the Germans.
And one of them was a Jewish lieutenant and his family was from Ukraine killed by Germans.
And your when you came home  woul d you tell your parents about what was going on  what you had experienced?
I was probably a graduate high school  and there was ready to go to college  to university.
Lets talk about your family at that time  was it a religious family?
I would guess that maybe they were sort of more from Germany and her father  Zehngut  had a branch of the family that was in Eisenstaedt  which is  well it was the mining area  probably more to the east.
It showed that I had roughly 250 family members in the empire.
And they wanted to know if the family members were farmers.
And I re member my family taught me that my does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others  which had a tremendous impact on me up to this date.
We had to stay behind and we j -- we just felt so abandoned  because wed been a family for so long.
Tell us about Kristallnacht  what that was and how it affected you and your family.
This was 20 years ago and I asked him whether he knew a Jewish family nam ed Meyer.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 7 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: my family spoke fluently German  they never asked us about our religion.
But before we turn to the war  tell us a little about your family  yourself  and your community before the war began.
Now  at home  did you still speak Yiddish  or had you switched to Hebrew?
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
That I know so many people are looking for relatives and I dont think there is a better person than I am and dedicated more to that cause because I  myself   have the feeling and I know what it means to lose family and not to be able to see them again.
There were people  very leftists  you know  opinions  one one one one doctor  he was a friend of the family.
Now I have been trying to find the heirs of this Dowana family.
And that time we knew that while there -- some number of Jews were killed  well th -- lets hope it -- maybe theyll stop the killing.
The other part was that they were also looking for people who were sympathetic towards getting the Jews into camps  helping them get into camps.
Only one person was successful to a certain extent  a limited extent and it was Ruth Gruber  I dont know if you heard of he r  who arranged with Secretary Ickes and Morgenstern and so forth  they arranged that thousand that they permit a thousand Jews to go to Oswego  one of my family  and we also went to Oswego.
And my parents found out -- I don't know either i t was too dangerous or they were taking another Jewish family.
So he divided between son...the son was by one family  and he wa s by another family.ﬂ He had to have in the morning girls.

Yeah  if you could be so kind as to continue about  about  how whether [talkover] years before the war and if you encountered any other cases of anti-Semitism directed or your family encountered cases of anti-Se mitism and then well go on with the war years.
Her parents had -- well  her f-father was born in Li bau  her mother actually came from Mitau  which was the capital of the former Duchy of Courland  and her family  I think  had lived in Latvia for quite a few generations.

And in the evening  he made sure that I always brought something home for the family to eat.
Anyway  so my mother and my two sisters came and life continued with them.
Each one went to see if he could find anybody from their family.
It was very upsetting to me  and Ive ofte n thought of Memorial Day times during these difficult times  and now here we are back again in a situation that is just so horrible to me  so horrible to me  and I dont know what to sa y because every day you see not only all these Americans -- all these young Americans and old Am ericans being killed  and thousands of Iraqis being killed  and each of these  like me  has a family  has a mother  a father  has children  some of them  brothers and sisters  and we just wipe them out  like so many ants  you know?
Well  on my father's side  the family has been living in Denmark  in a number of cities of Denmark  almost for 300 years  which in the terminology of Danish Jews  it's called the Viking Jews of Denmark.
And then he found out that his mother and his brother and his sister and the in -laws and the cousins.

No  then I was Dineke de Jong  that was -- but I didnt go because I knew one family there whose son was also in the resistance  but I didnt -- for th em  that they were in risk that they had somebody in hiding  so I never went to that church or anything.
I as a young child  who had to be hardly ten years old at that time  I remember hearing my father ﬁoh poor brother of mine  he has to be in a bunker.ﬂ Or ﬁpoor brother of mine  they dont know where he is.ﬂ But I think being the youngest of the family.

But when I was in the Warsaw ghetto it was still the ghetto.
What kinds of plans did your family make to to come across?
I didnt want to know German people or anything like this  but in the last few years I -- I have two very good friends who are German.
And so I had to find another place to live  so the first thing we did is I went to the 92nd Street Y. And they didnt have any rooms av ailable at the time  so they suggested that 24 there is a family thats looking for a border  and they have a room  and we went to see them  and we arranged to -- that I would stay with them in their -- in that room  and three meals a day  and my uncle was paying 40 dollars a month for that ro om and board.

Did you e -- did you or anybody in your family  do you think  ever f eel guilty of the ti -- you know  I mean -- not -- That -- that -- 79 -- not that it would be rational  but -- not that it was a rational thought  but that people -- I know pum -- some people felt oh  you know  its not fair that I survived and so many other people didnt.
Ye they want it was couple months only possibility to go to America and he went to his family  but other brother went to for France  and ask for Asylum.
And I decided since I am one of five people of the family  I will go and I will take a chance and see.
There were six children  four brothers  two sisters  my father and my mother.
I had -- as I said  I really  really lucky person.
So apparently the local priest had spoken with Mrs. Runjak and said to her  and I'm quoting her daughter  said to her  \ What are we going to do about thes e children?\
July 7th they started Axias  means transportation from Rzeszow to Belzec  and with this first action  this was July the 7 th  my family was taken and naturally Rozia with her uncles were taken the sa me day to Belzec and she perished in Belzec.
My family  for example  when we wrote to the Lubavitcha Rebbe  a letter  nu  and got an answer in Vienn It was Vienna was partaged (sic)  parted four four four Four sections.
I said to my mother  I said  \ Look  whatever is going to happen  it all...my father and all rest of the family and all the rest of the Jews has to happen with us.
When the Germans invaded France in 1940  Alex's family moved to the south of France  where the collaborationist Vichy government took power.
As long as I was between my family is what matters.
When I came to New York in March of 1948 and I gathered with my wife to the family  until 2 o'clock in the morning when I told them.
Can you tell me a little bit about the town that you lived in?
In order to avoid that  the men got in the family car  there were five of them  and kept driving for 24 hours  and then they went into the woods  and they came out just before the sabbath in Cologne.
And I knew I had to build my family and build something and you cannot build when you work for someone.
Not that my family didnt come  but it was a different background because he had a brother  he was a shochet and some rabbis in the family.
He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself  and he tried different approaches.
My father had one brother  and my mother had oh  three sisters.
So Paris was the fashion capital of the world  so mother found a French family that was willing to take me in  sort of like a paying guest.
You were maintaining your contact with your family all through this time?
And then they wound up back in France  and like I said  my mother had five family of five.
Even though my first language was Russian -- well  as you know  we had a very diverse family with my parents being born in the Ukraine and my siblings in Persia and I was born in Belgium.
And a big percentage is  if the boy marries a Christian girl  the family stays Christian.
05:18:40 So  first I think  sometimes  yes  then I find out that  then we start looking for  if somebody's alive from the family  so I start looking for.
And I was able to fill a -- in a little bit on her family tree  and likewise she was able to fill in a little bit of my family tree  because a distant cousin of my fathers was an editor of the Jewish newspaper in Shanghai during the years of the second World War.
When you meet people either from the same types of experiences  or people w ho have had other types of experiences  but can't talk about it  who might have nightmares or a hard time having family relationships  what do you tell them?
Like here  you have to a certain amount of I I had a school I had to go to school for another year.
I dont know how my family survived  because of me  because I was such a young baby.
Has a lot of charisma that he' s going to marry into a very rich family  and of course both parents were disappointed as far as that goes.
That you did you go to synagogue  did you keep kosher at home?
I lived because I was stealing a little bit to support the family.
I have a picture where sh -- you could see a family picture and shes wearing -- shes wearing a wig.
Tell us if you can what that meant for your family and other families live Jews living in Holland.
Tell me a little bit about your family before the war?
And we  there was some alarming talk but I cant remember that within the family.
Well  for one thing  since I was the olde st in the family -- I saw no future there  for one thing.
He was there and we went to visit him with the family on the kibbutz.
She wanted to get another name because she new very well if one family member somehow held back by the police  the whole family goes to hell.
Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 18And of course Rebecca never had any children  so that the family tree kind of stopped there.
But coming back to those times so we we left we left the ghetto  and my mother remember from her young age that her father was taking the family to sp end the summer to a place called Sandomierz on the south on a a little bit south of Warsaw on the bank of the Wisa river.
Then  my father's family lived in   and my mother felt that I and my sist er Ruzia who was 2 1/2 years older than I  that we should somehow be closer to the fa mily  to know our grandparents.
Somebody was in the family a blo nde  from my mothers family  they was all blonde.
And I had my baptism certificate  which was the life of the whole family in the future.
It was expressed after the conference of Evia  and the only family I know who came to America at that time was the personal physician of the Crown Prince of Greece  a Dr. Miller  I think  with whom my father afterwards was in touch in the States.
You know my uncle  her husband  came with his family in the 1920's  thro ugh Ellis Island and he went back to visit his hometown in 1937 and that's where he met my mother 's sister  who was a very  very beautiful 21 year old girl.
She had moved to Israel  1951  I think  married  had a -- Oh  so she -- she left fairly soon from that family?
I dont know if I understood all the reasons why she left  I just you know  I she was wa one of our family  and I Right.
So  when you left Germany   do you remember anything of what you were feeling  as you were leaving?
>> Bill Benson: So what was it like to arrive in Israel for you?
Cause New York is overwhelming if you come from Germany  and my family -- I had an aunt here  who was very well-to-do  and was very nice to me  but I didn't fit into that type of society at all.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 19 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: little boy and--and um--uh that was it.
Some were actually blessed enough to be reunited with family  and then a lot of them were sent to Israel.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
And Hungary or Budapest had about 185 000 Jews at that point  20% of the people who lived there at that time.
There again I became...or not again  but first I became a teacher in a very interesting family.
In the same apartment with us lived our  move d into the same apartment  moved our family.
But my grandfather was doing quite well  and so ma -- and my mothers  you know  my mother come s from a family of 3 three brothers and four girls  so it was a very pr olific family  and they were each one in his own way  very situ -- well situated.
And go to the synagogue on Sabbath  an d of course  all the major holidays.
And I remember decorating a Christmas tree with a family in the -- an outlying village.
You see  evenwhich they are here  from one family  the mother  the husband and wife a nd two little boys; they survived all.
Unless you are– especially if you are in a working-class family.
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother as people.
My family moved to Strasbourg in -- when I was three years old.
Could you let me know a little bit about the beginnings of your story; where you were born; who were your parents; what you know about them?
Pause - drinking) Now we lived a happy life until 1938 when the Germans came and expelled my family.
Now when you traveled with your family did you go by train?
And  of course  when they saw this woman with three children living with the Galops family  they started some rumors  you 8 know.
My mothers brother -- the younger -- the baby  the youngest brother.
On...I...I had three other brothers born to 2 my family in Germany.
The interesting thing about this is at that time  the way milk was delivered  I was living with a family  Haimy.
It was iron store and the Germans so they came in.
Anyway  so we stayed there because we had to stay because our family in Focsani was under the Rumanian and German occupation  while we were with the Russians until August of 1944.
Was it a very your immediate family  was it a very religious family  or a secular?
Counterfeit documents usually had the first name exactly the same  birthday the same  but the address and family was a different.
And one of the things that the little museum has been able to do -- for instance  when Jutta was here in New York about four weeks ago  and she stayed with us  she told me that one of the pr ofessors from a university here in New York  her family is from Halberstadt  she thought she was alone in the world.
My fathers father  I mean  he was more -- you know  more Jewish  but -- but we celebrated the Jewish holidays  all the Jewish holidays.
Everybody was al most Orthodox in my city  but I was probably the most Orthodox in my family.
Well  I was the youngest  and I didnt have  but as I told you in one of the stories  that my sister-in-laws had little children  a four and a six year old.
Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10  2014 4 How far back can you go with your family?
Did he have any extended family who didnt leave Europe and did not survive the Shoah.
My great -grandparents were living in -- they had a house there too.
N-No  ther ther I dont know who th ey were but I dont think they were Jews.
Excuse me a minute  I [tape break] I told you before about eza Eliezer Lidovsky   who didnt want us to leave the ghetto the first he was a older person  had a family in the ghetto and he it was true that he will be the first arriving in the in the in the woods.
I wondered  just speaking of your family  I want to back track a little bit  because I had wanted to ask you  you mentioned that your grandfather wa s the head of the Jewish community.
Th ey find out that they supposed to be killed because the Germans  they knew  they did after five  six months when the people work in the crematorium  they were sick and tired  you know  and disgusted.
Did you have a house  or did you have an apartment  do you remember?
What was it like for your family in this new culture  not just with respect to religion  but with respect to the culture as oppose to what you had b een use to in Poland.
Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8  2013 39 I see.
He was...he had a apparently large family  and he was always in the need of money.
The woman who helped you now  can you tell me about her  versus the woman so this family that hid you  the Seventh Day Adventists Yeah.
Did you -- did you spend a lot of time with your mother and your father  or more time with your mother as you remember?
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
Eventually David returned to Panama before coming to the United States to start a new life and a new family.
So  it -- I -- I have no explanation why I didnt talk to my family.
I was on CNBC  we were -- the whole family was on ABC Good Morning America  and -- it was amazing -- amazing time.
And in my -- and the house was -- that wasnt destroyed and I found in the house was a family of -- you know  I dont think -- I think its a Ballousha family.
And it was two small rooms  two small r ooms  and -- but my grandmom said  ﬁWell  bring your family here.ﬂ And -- but I stay with my moms relatives in Dnepropetrovsk another year.
And and then I ask  my very ne xt thing  to answer your question in a roundabout way  was that I was looking for a boy named [indecipherable] who was where I was working on a kosa  the son of of a well-to-do family before the war.
Q. Was there any effort to figure ou t whether you had family still alive?
My father a t dinnertime -- we always had dinner together  that was the family thing to do -- told us that we had to be prepared ------------ and maybe we should accumulate some more food  because for a certain time things are going to be going on that are going to be bad.
>> Bill Benson: So what -- to your knowledge  what did your mother do now?
No  I have a good life  and I enjoy my -- my family and my husband  and even retiremen t isnt so bad.
Fir first of all  I I met her family first  where and then  as time went on  we we got married.
Yeah  yeah  no but -- Now  you -- you -- -- it is hard  with my bi g family  it is [indecipherable] -- y-your mother had to clear the apartment and it was your father that everybody was worried about.
And uh... Other people from your neighborhood or from your family in Vienna... No.
Since the Weiss family was living under Hungarian rule and Hungary was an ally of Nazi Germany  paradoxically you were sheltered from some of this worst atrocities for several years.
Yeah  with with with the fam with family things  and we since we were Orthodox  that that added an extra burden  cleaning the house before Friday  doing the Friday rituals.
I  I always tell about it whenever I speak; because I always feel maybe this child had nobody left  nobody maybe survived because apparently  nobody could if she was there and  and she was among the children these were young people  then she was probably the oldest and her whole family probably was wiped out.
11 What kind of -- how did you communicate to learn what was happening to family members?
My mother had a good relationship with those Jewish people  because she was running that orphanage  so she needed some funds.
And after the war was lost by the empire  Hungary was carved up  many of my family members ended up in what is now Slovakia  Romania  Serbia.
He lost the whole family  but to take out a girl  for a wife  you know  to live with her and she has really the looks from a Christian with a brot her.
And Im now engaged in writing a history of how my family inter acted with the German culture over many Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 90centuries.
We are single people  without the family  and naturally we moved in.
Have you learned anything from your subsequent visits about the Bocahut family to have any insight as to how they would explain the presence of two youngsters in their house?
And I remember that evening particularly we went to one of the relatives that had a bigger store and so on and all the family there and the other people did the same thing with axes and sticks and whatever  ready to fight.
So  the fa mily members came  and you know  one family member then brings another family member  and pretty soon... I think today there are close to three million Turks living in Germany  a country of sixty-five million people.
I liv ed with the -- with the family for a week.
So we went into her house and she telephone her husband that we are alive  that we ar e the the only from the family.
So would you say you  unfortunately you weren't very surprised that your family members didn't return to Vienna?
The part where we lived on the little farm house was out of the Jewish area  so we had to move in into a smaller....   well  this was a ghetto without walls.
I used to get a little bit of butter  a little bit of  you know  milk...I used to smuggle in into uh back into Warsaw into the Warsaw ghetto to help the family and then in 1941  in 1941  January 14th  our child was born.
It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family  you know.
So together they did a very nice -- had a -- had a very nice life.
You were nearly 4 1/2 years old when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939  when World War II began  and of course  the brunt of the war Hungary would come later.
Yes  my wife  she had -- she had the sister there and a brother  they passed away since.
Well  they came because the Warsaw by then was being bombed  life wa bombed out  and they came to us because my father and the the father of that family that was the name was Zhaglietski.
And then I stayed with an English family that took I think they were paid by the government.
Y-Y -- I mean th-they say  you came back and theres no -- I mean you dont have no family  you dont have nothing and that -- it -- it why -- didnt i-interest me very much to be in Proushinna.
I have very few pictures of my family because my mother and my father were afraid that when they would be searched  arrested  that their identity as Jews would be discovered  well -- in this colle ction that Im going to leave with the Holocaust Museum  I intend to supplement it by an index of each page and each document and each photograph and each so forth.
She was raised there  in a family of uh six children  three boys and three 3 girls  and my father met her in that city and ag ain we may want to come to his story  at least parts of it  as you want to pursue that.
>> Bill Benson: How many of your family were murdered during the Holocaust?
appropriate  but -- one thing that I wanted to ask about  specifically  just from looking at the other interview  I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what your family was like fr -- you know  from -- from your childhood.
Can you tell us a little bit about the town that you born in  and that you grew up in?
At that point it was my mother  my brother and I and two other kids and my grandmother.
We my father and I and Aron asked for permission just to go to Slonim to see somebody survived maybe from his family.
They were a very good family  very loving family  but they -- as was the case in Germany with the -- with Jewry  the -- they were German first  Jewish second  perhaps.
We -- we grew up together  we took dance lessons together  we -- we ate at the same table f -- we had the same family  but truly  truly  to find out what shes really  really thinking  what really went on  we -- we didnt start to really do until 1985 in Jerusalem.
It was part of a -- some kind of a family and they had 16 small homes around it  where poor peopl e were living.
My parents and -- it might interest you to know  they were more German than Jewish.
>> Al Munzer: I remained in very close contact with the Madna family  still very much a part of the Madna family.
crying) So my sister left for Palestine and my family was my parents  my younger sister and I. When the Russo German war broke out in '41 in June  where I worked they gave some Jews pink   means permit to evacuate with the Russians.
Let's do everything we possibly can to imitate the Madna family and stand up even in a sea of hate.
It just so happened that I knew the whole family and I also knew the friend of my husband  and he said  \ Do you have any money?
Grandma again  had a little girl who helped run this place  and as a result my mother was supporting that family  and the tutor's family  and she had two aunts and one uncle.
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
Something happened to me after I moved out of my original family  and established my independence.
Well I had four uncles and four aunts  all married with children.
Do you remember if your brother ever talked about being frightened or anybody in your family bei ng frightened about what was going on in Germany before they invaded?
>> Edna Friedberg: In recent years your experience  your love for the Madna family  has actually given you some new relationships with young people from Indonesia.
I would be the one to Kaddish5  I would be the one to carry the torch  to be the head of the family was the Kaddish after my father.
I mea n  to my family I was supposed to say  but -- End of Tape Two  Side B Beginning Tape Three  Side A This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.
Across the street fr om us there was a Jewish family  the Stochi family.
And -- and my other aunt  who lived in Danzig with her husband -- nobody from that family survived  from my mothers family.
It wasn't really until we came to this country that we lived together much  much -- because we had to -- much  much closer a nd we became a really close family.
>> Gretchen Skidmore: So you and your family felt like you had full rights in your town and in your community.
Now originally did anyone plan on hi m becoming a Rabbi considering all the studying that he was– He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking over the hardware store  Im not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the studier of the family.
No  strangely enough  when I moved to New York City  because I got married on west coast  we -- we decided to come back because my husbands mother became ill with cancer  and I said  I lost my family  and I love your mother  we have to go back to New York.
>> Bill Benson: When your dad was gone  did you miss him?
>> After you left the Bocahut family  how were you able to reconnect with your Jewish identity?
To identify the moral values of -- of what she -- what she learned through those experiences  and through seeing the loss of her family and the rebirth of an entire generation  and now s-succeeding generations o-of -- of Jews in the post-Holocaust world.
He had appropriated the finest chalet in Onzbock  for his family.
Can you imagine that they took the all Jews and the Polish chief of the police with the family and they killed them too.
Speaking of being in the Protestant section  was your family religiously Jewish?
So all the men in the family went to a camp.
Did your family ever find out any of the facts or any of the rumors or or any information involving him being turned over?
But there was other branches of the family that could stay Of course  because they They werent as wealthy.
From my family  my mother was the only one who came back.
Henry Kahn: Well  we lived -- we lived in a small town not far from Stuttgart and my parents were very friendly with a family over there.
I just know that the English visit -- you know  the English royal family  and many of the English people  did not appreciate my father at all because of his private life.
Bratislava became So so you did have family in Vienna when you went there?
There is also in the Bible there is such a name of -- Chronicles it's called or something  so I -- the first I did note all the events was happened with us  with our family  or with the people of the small ghetto from the beginning of the war till now  and I put also daydreams.
In Vacha  local party members damaged the family store and imprisoned Susan's father in the Buchenwald concentration camp.
Lets talk a little bit about the background of your family.
See  if you have a strong mind  it is -- it has to do with la -- religion  and my family has a strong -- we have P-Presbyterian  and -- and you cannot tell me you want to become a Jew  or you wa nt to be -- that is just not the way.
I visited Hungary not that often  and I met the family.
But putting us into the ghettos was really so terrible because you 7 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD take -- we were a fairly large family.
On my mothers side  my mother had a sister and a brother.
So I went with my brother and my father  a couple of uncles.
He took me there and I went -- while he was driving  I was in the back of it  and I told him that I'm not going to die  he's not going to put me in the gas chamber  I have all my family living.
And now of course I was very upset  and I didn't know what happened with my family.
In the light that Budapest family life more or less returned to normalcy  because the ones who remained  remained intact.
Theres some correspondence with the brother  but only for the first generation  and then the family records were lost.
My two grandparents  my father's -- my father was an only child  and the only family we had we re his parents.
Tell us about your mother and father  their names  and where they grew up.
What I did  actually  when the camp was closed  I had to go back to my family because I was sick.
What is -- what i -- what is it about you and your family  you think?
I wa s just devastated with  wi th all my family gone.
My uncle found out where my grandma's family was going  they were going to Transnistria.
I remember one boy  he came from a very rich family from Rotterdam  the  ah had a very big uh  business in spices  they did business with Indonesia  and his wife went to the gas chamber  and this boy  I reme mber  died in  in  in  in a week  just that he couldn't  that  all what he saw what was going on.
Were your parents -- did -- did you go to any kind of community activities or anything?
So clearly this was a family on its way out o f religious tradition although still very deeply connected to things Jewish.
Bill Benson: Frank  Israel wasn't an option and so you began to look elsewhere toward the United States.
They were there for 2 weeks until they got the permission to proceed to the...uh...place where my father was born a nd where our family lived.
And I cant help myself  Im thinking about my family  my aunts  what I would give if they had survived.
Would you continue telling me about your family identifying as Germans?
M y mother didn't want to go because family ties to brothers  etc.
In 1942 members of Marcel's family  including his grandfather whom we see here  were deported to extermination camps where they were murdered.
My brother and my sister live in Canada and you know there were a lot of people who went to Canada.
So  when you were at home  you spoke both English and German?
Uh then you know  most of the family had fled  our family; however  my father's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the trains which which were bombed  came back with her son David and she found her apartment occupied by uh by other people  and she came to stay with us.
So you were living with your mother  your grandmother  your sister  and your brother-in-law?
What was your family life like  friends  that sort of a thing?
And we were together with the family  so I think this was -- it was not a bad choice at that time.
And within something like 6 months or 9 months  we were married.
We lived in an apartment with one room and one kitchen ; th at's all   a two -room a partment.
The -- We had  in the neighborhood  we were totally integrated and in the business community  you sa -- s -- have  lets say  shoe stores  there would be several of them  one might be owned by a Jewish family.
And when she was in Szydlowiec  she found letters from my uncle written to the Jewish communi ty asking whether anybody by our name from our family is alive.
And so on this one summer  we were going to this island  and I thought to myself  maybe we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 103 should do some constructive family project th is year.
Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends  did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?
Because that was their way of making up for the family that was lost  that philosophically our feeling is  you cant replace whats lost  but you can better what can be replaced.
We had a lot of -- I had a lot of non-Jewish friends  of course.
Sharing my life story with you this afternoon was not my desire to sha re my anger or anguish of my lost family.
As I said -- well  after -- well  this is a lot later after I got married and we settled out here  we would do trips and national parks  you know  and driving trips and a lot of things with family.
She start crying  she said  ﬁTake him away  I dont want him because I have three and I expect another one  and its very dangerous for me and for my family.
This was a very close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not.
In the ghetto  was a total idleness on the part of all the family members other than on different days.
Linda asked me to...for you to slow down a little bit and tell me a little more about your family.
In Im also the only one in the w hole family that that moved to Israel and that became that decided Israel was the place for me.
Our house was very open  a lot of people came  mostly Mothers family  my father didnt have family.
Yeah  and were you in contact with your sister and brother and the family still  when you were in California ?
First I was waiting to see how my sisters and the rest of the family will come out.
So  there was another house where a a Ukrainian family lived  in Tuszcz .
Had you had any contact with your parents during this period?
That English...uh this Norwegian officer explained them why I was in there as one of Jehovah's Witnesses  and that so many from our family were already  uh  executed  you know.
Your family stayed in Poland much longer than many other Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.
He took it to the railroad [indecipherable] he was -- he knows me  and the family.
So  I remember  one year I was living with the prof essor  the professors family  and for the holidays  I also had an aunt living  an aunt and uncle in Radom.
With my mothers was a tremendous it was like wi like having grandmother  ma my moms aunt.
When the Germans came to od  what happened to your family?
My aunt  my uncle  my aunt's mother  and their two sons.
>> Bill Benson: You told me that at that time you don't believe there was really a lot of anti -Semitism  at least that your family was aware of  in that area.
Tell me a little bit about your fa mily  the the family you were born into.
He was very...was uh German...was a very intelligent guy and he uh he always asked me  noon  noon....lunch time where I 9 come from  like my family  if I have a letter from my family  because I was seventeen year old  eighteen.
So this is the Finzi -Contini family head This is the book is being written Thats right.
>> Bill Benson: Fred  as you said earlier  you left Germany six weeks after the war began.
When you were gr -- not you  but when your family  in the 1930s and your sisters were talking to each other  it was in Dutch?
You had to move into the ghetto  and how long were you in the ghetto?
And my uncle  my beautiful family  they just escaped Poland .
They did give us a place to sleep and they did give us food  but we  both of us felt we would like to -- and they helped us to -- to get a room by a German family  the first one  Frau Beans  I think  I dont remember  a war widow with a son and with her aunt.
And ye t I came to the United States with my--t he whole family is from my father's side.
Me  my mother  my father and the two brothers  my tw o brothers and my mother's sister and aunt.
I was living with a Doctor Demoraski  his son -- his son was my friend from the school -- so I was living with Doctor Demoraskis family in Miendvyrec.
To get home to see if anybody from the family had survived.
And Id like to find out exactly where his family is  but I could never find out.
Actually  I want to go back a minute and just ask you about your family and were you married at this point?
We had family in New York  but sadly enough  the one in New York didnt I dont somehow or other didnt want to help  or wh atever.
I was drawn to that family so -- so much  because they had such a nice attitude  and they were so full of faith  like nothing could happen.
But what we had is the honor of the family that spent 15 years paying off.
And I went to   to work in one of the factories  again a cousin  where they taught me how to work a sewing machine and so I was making some money there and then I finally met a young man  an American born college graduate and he somehow talk ed me into going back to school  because my family wanted me to and I still saw school anti-Semitic in everything the way it was back in Europe  so I didn't want to go back.
Before that  she had herself  what she made from th em  she could pay for her own  to have for the family.
By a gentile family  with his wife; and he got four children in the war.
We were a very close family  always a very close family.
And it was very hard for a family of eight or ten to go - nobody  no country in the world would take them  and of course we did not have the state or vision   so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there would be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity  have the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do.
And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to di e a natural death shortly after Germany invaded Poland.
My mother had two older siblings who lived in Berlin and so she joined them in the 1920s.
And now my mother has died  my f brother has died  and I I have my children  thats it.
I was also sort of forced into the reality of being Jewish after my father lost his job and he told me that he lost it because we were Jews.

Could you please give me your name  your date of birth and your place of birth.
>> Bill Benson: When you were in the boxcar with your family  did you know where you were going?
And I stayed behind with the family who had the young child.
And I had a letter from Deleon and that all came back but he has a family and he is in Australia.
So  it was not like -- like it should have been done  but according to the other family members  he was good   because the other family members were worse.
We knew that we  know  were not part of the original family  we were old enough that -- I mean  that -- had it been  you know  five years earlier  may have been different story  you know ?
So the people start to  to talk and I heard in our family  talking with some friends  talking about what happened in Germany.
It was my father  my mother and myself and my younger brother.
And  again  comes the case  I am with all my famil y  with my family and with Edna's family  all together.
Tell me what when do you know something happened to my fa mily  your family?
They saved my life  but  you know  I wasn't part of the nuclear family and I felt that.
But when he died  its like something  a clock in me says well  this is  if he left you and he will never come back and you have to take care of yourself and you're family.
He was from New York and he came from a family  very nice family  he has one sister  and he had parents  obviously.
And that's how my aunt and uncle and cousin came out and of course my father.

So this is another aspect of it  you know  that Hania was always spoken of the genius of the family  which she really was absolutely  and Krysia was really strikingly beautiful  I mean  she wasnt just pretty  she was strikingly beautiful.
Also  my favorite aunt  you know  the one I told you about who was left in Berdenau  and all her family was gone.
I had uncles and I had cousins  and some cousins were very rich.
I am now probably the only survivor of my immediate family because my brother passed away at 54  he had pancreatic cancer and died.
Did you talk to people about your experiences during the war?
Did it influence how you raised your children  do you think because of what you had gone through?
Well  we had we had a small farm  th at that belonged come down through the family.
In our group was my grandparents  my other grandmother  three aunts and three children.
Do you know how many ge nerations your family lived there?
It was part of the option  but somehow  it would have required to leave the family  to leave my father and go away  you know?
So my mother  who was German...her family was there for centuries....and I  we became all of a sudden Russians because Lithuania belonged to Russia at the time.
We were still together  the whole family until about April of 1942.
And do was this then your world  the world of the courtyard  your family Absol your mother and father  nobody outside.
What were the two options that he gave the family and what did the family do?
There were a few who had done quite well  4especially an uncle of his who became quite well-to-do in America  and the letter  the answer we received from the family was well  we have a bad recession and depression here and you would only add to the number of people unemployed and you better stay where you are  and that was the answer.
And this is the way then finally I took 3 months of absence  of vacation to find my family.

Leaving my mother 1 with this huge  rather large family when they were... I think at that point he was probably like fifteen or sixteen.
And people who were -- somebody was taken away from the family  whatever it is  after awhile they -- lot of people  when somebody died  they kept the body at home  they didnt report it to died  in order to get the food ration card. [
I felt it maybe a little more keenly being older and I loved my family there dearly especially my grandparents  my maternal and my paternal grandmother in her  on my fathers side.
And they couldnt believe  because oh  the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there  th-the -- ye -- you know  with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live  and he picked up some Jewish  he is not Jewish.

In those three years  from the end of the war until 1948  uh we found out how a few of our family members had perished.
We were from Bruno the first transport  it was Gae transport  I was the number Gae 484 and it was the first family transport to Terezin.
First of all  my father asked this policeman  he said  ﬁLook  I've known your family for so many years  known you since you were a little child.
And the worst thing probably is the occasional dreams that that my family appears a nd not in a favorable position.
But all -- were all of you able to come because of -- Through my -- -- sponsorship through s-someone in Ikes family?
And that your f -- you had the losses  extended family losses that you had?
Right away  as soon as they saw a Jewish person  they give to the Germans  to the gestapo.
There were times that this was difficult for them  because I remember when there were occasions that -- for instance  holidays were difficult in this family  because holidays is something that you have everybody around  and not everybody was around.
20 No  I just remember a family friend of our s by the name of Sidra  who was a very close family friend of ours  they were in the small ghetto to start with and when it was liquidated  he was an expert electrician and so was his son.
So the -- otherwise  my parents were members of the Jewish community.
Okay  so tell me a little bit about the about Count Plater   his his family and and who was he?
Up to that point  did you have any Jewish friends  were there any Jewish families living in your town?
My parents made the very difficult decision that as a form of insurance to make sure that if one person was taken  at least another one might survive  that the family would be split up and we would hide in different places.
You tried to -- to get into the ghetto and locate a place  and we f ound a place which is like a -- an old house where we used a downstairs and another family used upstairs.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what happened to your parents and about your brother as well.
And can you tell us a little bit about where your father was from and your mother?
Briefly tell us why they occupied  just very briefly  why they occupied Hungary that late in the war and then what that meant for you and your family.
When -- by May she decided it was probably best if I go  so she made arrangements for me to be adopted by the same family or by -- by a member of that family in -- in -- also in Glasgow  Scotland.
But there was this -- this very swaggering woman  very  very different from -- yeah  the -- the very quiet European women we -- and that was -- that was intere -- and then we -- we took the taxi to -- to -- to Brooklyn and joined -- and stayed with the Vanderpool family  who had -- since th ey originally -- they i-initially had lived in Williamsburg when they came to the United States.
Did you have much contact with people outside of your family?
I I really  as I said before  there was very little business talk  and children were it was just like like not in front of the children kind of a kind of an attitude  which seems strange  but thats thats the way  at least in my family was the way.
Tell me a little bit a bout your father and his background  his his family.
And my mother said well  I hope we are going return to Poland.
Did you have to go back to where your home was?
So and that was based entirely on the size of the family.
But I went to live with another family not too far away and  in a sense  in hiding.
Our  our house was destroyed  and I mean we knew that this is  this was a Jewish apartment  but still it was between this or living in the street  in the cold snowy January ﬂ so he said  ﬁCould  could you do something  could  could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?ﬂ And so my mother came up and she said  ﬁWhy cant we just divide the pl ace between us?ﬂ And here it was a two room apartment with their family  four people  five people in their families and two  my mother and I  and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this  there was just something that all of a s udden hit me.
Plus the family  all the family that we had  and we had quite a large family  we had I believe over 80 people  members in the family.
What was it like to be a little child in that family in Copenhagen.
Before we turn to that t ime  let's begin with you telling us a little bit about your family  your community  and yourself during those first 10 years of your life.
There were many Jewish people who either came back and found someone of the family or they established again a family life.
It was a small town where a German family  a German family  was a small synagogue  they hid it from the nazis all these years and protected the Torah  the scrolls  the holy books in the basement.
Her family was not -- the woman who saved all of us  her family was not saved b ecause they were rejected.
I didnt get the help I expected to help  although the family each other -- helped each other when they came  so with me  when they spend the money  and other USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 49 money came from my wifes family that she had in New York.
Did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?
And the same thing -- those camps are  you know  I want to mention  there was a lot of camps  UNRRA camps  they were especially for Jews.
I did realize  like most everybody else  that one should bring out one's family if it was at all possible  but no details really were known at that time - at least not to me.
Vera Marcus came to the United States with her family and lived in New York .
We realized we had to adjust to a new life  a new family  new cousins  new language obviously  new culture and being Americanized.
I -- it was -- I knew I was Jewish  it was important.
But by that time everybody else in the family  my grandparent s  my other aunt  everybody  had already been arrested.
that it prepared them to put up with this nightmare and also that they -- that those children had -- what was done to them was done to their whole family and not -- was not an internal problem within the family.
Our family lived in that town for many...for quite a few generations.
I believe I was so close with family that I tr I thing that my parents do everything for us.
This is my grandfather and grandmothe r  my mother  my father and me as a little boy  my three little sisters  my aunt and uncle.
So I determined to escape from Poland and through contacts  family contacts  underground connections  I managed to ge t on a Swedish coal freighter  which was leaving Polish port city of Gdynia and was going to Goteborg  Sweden.
I yeah  I do understand German a little bit  because mine mother speak very good German.
Were the rest of the family involved in Zionism  do you know?
Some were paid by family and some were -- we t ook a supplement  and out of the supplement  we financed gratis packages.
Both my father and mother came from very religious family  but I believe when they moved up to Cluj  some of the religion was left a little behind.
89 06:00:43 So  you told me the story about finding -- Yes  the mother  and she said that this help ed her to make a living and to raise her family  you mean  the trade that she learned.
I will not wait for you  because I lost enough people my family  and I dont want to have somebody else to lose.
As soon as I could  my sister wouldn't talk to you for nothing.
>> Bill Benson: During that time  and you lived under those circumstances until 1944.
Meanwhile the Italian family moved in  and their name is .
I had a warm family  and I belonged to the blau weiss.
A-And -- and they seemed nice people  very  very nice people.
I look at my own family and I look at my cousins and you look at the children and its incredible who these children are.
I have a very ex tended family  cousins and aunts and uncles  lot of them  you know.
A nd she worked there in the farm in all works as was she was considered as a as a relative  far relative from town that she run away from Kovno from bombardments and from the war  but she was for all things and purposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them and uh it was a woman  a widow whose husband  th e boss of the farm  fell from a from a thunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm  and the widow was a very good-hearted  that was very religious  and that's why the pr iest could talk her in that she should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina came because she didn't know what to... was crying all the time...Momma  Momma...and uh I...as I said she lived there instead of a week  she stood there for about four  five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman  the widow had three daughters and one son.
What would you like your family or y our friends or whoever will listen to this tape to know about you that they ma y not already know about you and your experiences?
>> Bill Benson: Before everything suddenly changing  do you know if your family was aware of what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
From that family  the three people were not or thodox at all.
That was when the mass deportation took place  and the whole family was just -- they disappeared.
Well  as I say  my father was not very hes a very tolerant  you know  he Im not talking about your parents  and your family  but growing up in an atmosphere  you know.
The family might not be interested  but an archive will be able to put history together  and without our history we have no future.
And I wonder  if it's possible  you have a good family  a good home.
My family didn't like it so much  but you were[n't] afraid to do what you wanted.
One reason Marty said he left Baltimore with me  after we were married  was because he said  ﬁYou have nobody on your side  but I have this huge family  youre going to be drowne d and we dont want that.ﬂ He was -- he obviously wasnt that fond  you know?
And they have -- that family has been absolutely fantastic to me.
I was the first of the family to meet him  because weve had a very  very nice old Pastor Lange  and Pastor Lange was supposed to retire.
So I hope you can come ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 back and join us.
Besides the spirit was completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 57taken away  and knew -- by that time you al ready knew that they were going to places where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin.
There was another maid in the house  she was also a Austrian refugee  but she didnt live 32 with the family  she came over as a maid.
Well  unless you have something that you want to add just -- or talk about something I havent asked you about -- No  Im very satisfied  and my life -- too bad my pare nts and my family had to go through  and also we had to go thro ugh such a hard times and difficult and things.
His whole other [ind ecipherable] his family stayed in Krakow  and as a matter of fact  they all ended up on Schindlers list  eventually.
But did you know people were leaving  nobody knew people were dying except for family members every day lie that?
Uh a few people did manage to get out and uh the reprisals were very very high and that probably kept other people from from leaving if they could get out  because the first ones that would uh be used in the reprisal would be the family.
3 >> Bill Benson: A couple of more questions about the life with your family really before you were born and then your first couple of years.
You described to us your father on Kristallnacht  after getting the phone call from your grandparents  going to try to see what h e could do with the other family relative that was here in the United States.
She also completed translation of a huge collection of correspondence by a family in which th e husband perished at the hands of the Nazis but his wife and two young children were rescued from a train leaving the Bergen -Belsen concentration camp.
There was the grandmother  the father  the mother  the sister  my husband and I. There were six of us.
>> Bill Benson: So  Steve  they rounded you up  deported you in the boxcars to Auschwitz.
This family in Hamburg wrote  \ We can't write anymore because we don't have money for the postage\  And another family from Konigsberg wrote the same thing to my parents.
My brother had consequences of it  my sister are similar  you know  so this is just one family to  quote  just one family  and theres plenty of damage  and I repeat again  I did not [indecipherable] go through the personal horrors of people who go through Auschwitz  or ber -- Buchenwald  and tell horrible stories  you know  on a personal basis or so.
And my grandmother married my grandfather  this of this very good family  with high intellectual traditions  and so on  and going back hundreds of years in itself  in Ferrara .
Even my husband was not a believer an d he came out from a very pious family.
Interview with Erika Tamar December 18  2015 49 you know  that has this im you know You have to understand that I came fro m a very warm  easygoing family where we had to have good manners  but you know   it was it was like just really a warm  laissez-faire kind of family.

A part  the other part was occupied by other family  the [Britzomeyers] and we kept that apartment  but...but...uh...later we sold it.

From the table where I used to nail the furs  I made a dining ro om table and I invite all  wherever I could find my family people  and we used to cook and eat a nd give them to eat  at that time.
I lived...I grew up there; and I went there to the [Krauner ] School and then there to gymnasium--which is their secondary school  their high school  and... Tell me about your family.
Members of my family  while we were there  in W DP camp  there was always lists right from the first moment on.
My grandmother and my grandfather  they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.
The -- yeah  family friend  and my brother was friends -- Right. --
When did you learn about what your parents had gone through?
So population there spoke Russian and the Jews spoke Yiddish  too  so my mother  who was born there and her family spoke Russian and -- and Yiddi sh.
And he was quite successful  so my mom's family was comfortable.
He was certainly reasonably prosperous  certainly middle clas s and definitely in contact with his family in Lukow.
Well  first of all  we had Germans living upstairs from us.
Before we get to your experiences  when the Germans came  can you tell me a little bit about what it was like to grow up in Lodz?
In a little while he came back with these two gigantic books  and he says  there is what happened to your family.
>> Bill Benson: And  of course  March 19  1944  extraordinary important day in your life.
And of course I had the classes  you know  I had to go to school  and plus the family.
They all knew that at least  my relatives all knew that was the end.
USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 44 Even within your family  you didnt talk about it?
Now  I think we were talking about this off camera  so I just want to make sure you say 19 this for the record  that where was your family and where were you at this point?
Some family introduces a man  other family introduces a woman and they decided that they would make a couple and they get married.
We -- We Jews had one -- this family and a ra -- a normal life  and everybody else tried to squeeze us.
You know  they were such a little things which here I am coming from a family which wasnt assimilated one and here I am suddenly a Christian.
Were you aware of being a Jew  and what did that mean as a child?
I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do  I I found a job as I told you before in western France  again as a teacher in a family  in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit  de voyage it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is sick because...it wasn't very cleaver but I had no better...nothing better in mind  so uh they didn't give it.
Therefore  to afford to go to high school  you had to had support of a family that could afford it.
It was not allowed to visit to come  no  but sh e knew and we have also family  relations in probably across the river somebody has seen me and wrote to my mother that I am alive  but she told me later  when we talke d  after my return from Germany  she said somebody said I am alive and she wasn't sure exactly  but her hope was a little better.
>> Bill Benson: When you got back to Paris  August 1944  the war itself would go on for -- until May 1945.
This is tape number one  side A. Helen Bamber  tell me about your background first of all  where you grew up and the family you grew up in.
So one family -- I remember just like today  a nice peasant family -- they took me in.
Applause] Halina   thank you for joining us and being willing to be our First Person .
>> Warren Marcus: And this is after a very successful  respected career of providing for his family as a dairy farmer and his neighbors.
So there we separated from our friends  and we ha we had family  my father had family in Paris.
And then I used to join my family and I was very proud.
Was her family becoming more and more afraid as the years progressed?
And I brought them into a family of wonderful Lithuanian people and they came and they talked and they shared and they were  you know  even crying 86 together.
I know; 07:12:36 and we were very good with the children  family  it's a close family  and with the grandchildren; we are.
They provided an affidavit for my aunts family and and two of her sisters  and their family  and for us.
Or somebody from the family  a cousin  an aunt  an uncle or that  you know  it leaves a scar in your -- in your body.
You had to avenge those who had done you or your family wrong.
It was a b -- a big family because they had brought over about 90 people from Europe and I was not one of them.
And on my last day...and this was before I left that all this happened  I went to say goodbye to the family and by that time we had a little kindergarten.
My fathers  my mothers  my sisters and my -- m-my and myself  and my name.
But we all came back for Christmas  and I can still reme mber the family gatherings at Christmas and other special occasions.
So  most of your familys conversation then  when you were talking about wartime issues was concerned with what had become of various family members and tracking people down and making– Family members  to some extent  property  the ca rpet which is in our family room used to belong to my parents and then of course  the Germans got it.
We did not particularly suffer from lack of food  although we didnt have the kind of food we used to have before the war.
What was your relationship with your parents during the period from the end of the war to the time you went to Israel?
The woman that took care of my brother was the one that my mother thought of next because she was like a member of the family.
This is in the apartment of the Ameri can commercial attache  Mr. Williams  where I worked as a chef and butler for his family in parties that he gave in his house.
She was very young  the woman he married  and she was a very good looking woman and I suppose that didn't go down too well with my mother's sister and her family.
I mean  my father and my mother was a family; and they had 5 children.
And said  you  where is your family  do you have a family?
So how did this affect your -- your family life th en?
As it happens  my young  my uncle was a younger brother of my father  was living Buenos Aires and he was also looking for surviv ors of his family.
So I already felt a little bit better because I felt I its true  Im going back into my city and Im going to look for my family  but at least my boyfriend is alive.
26 Q Would you say then  you've mentioned her once before  you said that there was a maid who lived in your family.
Everything when down a normal life  and that lady  Julian a Persch...uh... gave me a proposa l that I can try to bring my family to her.
And he was the only one who died from his family  because he had a brother who survived in England and his parents and sisters survived there in Uzhgorod where we lived.
What I started saying is that because of my modest background  I was able to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 79 comfortably live on my salary  or my family was able to  you know.
And so  in Prague  and in order to be understood  you speak German  because I dont do Czech and -- so we spoke German.
This is how shes been af -- to -- to the -- to the -- th e extended family  she really severed all her relationship.
And that  of course  its then where my grandfather was buried in the family plot.
The some of the food would be rationed and given to each family  or what?
Anyway  and that way I was able to support my family some money somehow.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about -- in the time we have left  tell us about reunification with your father  how you were able to do that.
You stayed in Paris until the summer of 1942 when your parents arranged for the four of you  for the family to leave Paris.
Did you have much success in helpi ng individuals find family members?
Every single group  every single organization  every single segment of the Jewish community in Budapest at the time made petitions  and somehow they have three of these  four of those  six  seven of those  somehow this comprised it  including  but perhaps starting with  some 25 people  thereabouts  of Kostner's only family.
Then -- and then the rest of the family  I dont Interview with Arlette de Long 22 know.
So I forwarded it to my kids and  and my younger one Jesse  whos the historian in the family sent along images of this Interview with Barbara Goldberg 13 August 22  2012 suitcase to the foundation.
So we...each family had a little corner  but it was...there were about five in the families and and my my three families  you know  I was like the godfather there  you know  and there were another two families in in the in the train  in the wagon  cause there were  you know  this was already during the summer and it wasn't cold.
>> Bill Benson: How did they come to pick Bully has the place to take you and how did they pick the Strycharszyk family to take you in?
So  I had five uncles and aunts  and some of them were married.
There were  of course  people with family who were let's say twenty years old  or thirty years old or husband or wife who didn't want to separate.
>> After you came to America  were you able to communicate with your father and your mother or today even your extended family that's still in Germany?
How did the family make ends meet during that time since he had the tailoring business?
I was always the only girl from four  from four children; and I grew up and I was the youngest so I grew up with my four brothers.
Because in Seattle  Jewish people couldn't easily get jobs  but a family Schoenfeld said now you have no choice  you can say he's a cousin.
Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 20 Was your father were you able was the family able to feed itself from the 20 acres?
It was very dangerous for a lot of people because they  for people like my parents  so when they felt unc omfortable in a house  when they felt there were people who might talk  and who might divulge that they were Jews  they had to move 7 on  and they were very fortunate also the last year and a half before the war ended to live with a family  as it turned out  only ten miles from where I was living but unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them because it wasn't sa fe for them to know where I was because if they knew they would want to find me  and if I knew I would want to probably find them as well.
I says  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 68 ﬁFlorence  you know  when I go t into your family  I wasnt right.ﬂ She says  ﬁI know that  Kurt.
I think all my family  as far as I know  I think that they had maybe a bat mitzvah  they went.
I wanted to tell my story as a memorial to my family and about 2 500 fellow Jews of Dokszyce who were executed by the Nazi regime for no other reason than being Jewish.
We had a nephew of my fathers  a cousin of mine  who had been in Israel by the at that time.
As the ghetto was being liquidated or more and more deportations  and it was emptying out  your family moved and created a bunker on the ground floor of.
We there it was so unbelievable that they were it could have been a family  although some of these children tried to survive  they held together for their during the bombing or they just starved like that.
My mother with my father and all three of my sisters  the beginning  and my brother.
>> Bill Benson: Kurt  your family  before they left Germany for Palestine  sold the family butcher business and sold it  I think  to your father or grandfather's apprentice.
They were hiding  so my father really handed me over to a Jewish family  basically.
And uh...then  by the time  we came to America  she had already had a job and she...she had some family here  too  on her.
Thats the last I heard  I was never placed with a family.
This group picture is with my moth ers side of the family.
From there we continued on at night  hiding in the fields or the forest  until we reached another family that was halfway between my hometown of Dokszyce and Glebokie which was a larger ghetto.
So thats how the famil -- th-the roots of the family came from Vienna into Poland into Boryslaw.
And now So the fact that your parents came from different now  was your fathers family Lutheran  or Catholic?
Not with the family  but I lived gee  where did I live first?
And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job  we...my mother had a very close knit family.
And when I got to the United States my family didnt -- werent friends with any Gentiles.
I don't remember doing that -- [Laughter] -- but they were very much a part of the Harrison family and always included in their family.
You gave me an accountin g of many of the members of your family  but you didnt say anything about a grandparent.
When I left Poland  Poland was my home  my friends  my family  my synagogue  my shul  my Hebrew  everything.
When I I wanted to reach my house  because I I felt to to unite myself with the family.
So  I couldnt say ﬁnothingﬂ because I didnt want to be invited by them  because it is a family holiday and they had their family.
If you lost your family  you adopted a stranger  who became your family.
And she said  I said to him  Massimo   you made me leave Italy in a matter of principle  and I left my family  my friends  and everybody.
This is tape number two  side B. You were talking about yo ur relationship with your children and it was only when they were older that you started to tell them about what happened to their family and your family.
And can you tell us something about your family  your sister  your parents.
>> When you were with the Catholic family  do you recall playing with any other kids beyond that Catholic family?
Awful  it just  I remember there were two other Dutch girls and fiancee   left Holland  they were just going for a visit and of course we went with my family.
How long did you stay in Berlin   when you were there?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 >> Bill Benson: You had a large family.
How did your family manage for those several years to make ends meet while living in that kind of environment?
So it is something entirely perceived by the child  for God knows -- a variety of individual reasons  a pass -- this -- place in the family  self perception  I dont know what.
There was a mother and a baby and two boys and two women.
And they make a bi -- made a big party when they -- I had to go to them   and they invited a lot of people  family and people  and it was the nicest party I remember for a -- for many years.
I was the youngest  the youngest from the whole bunch of people.
And the  the  the  the Gestapo said  \ How can...how can you put your child with such a terrible  bad family who hides Jews and things like this?\
And he was -- he had a Ph.D. Was his family also well to do in Germany?
Were from France originally  from -- from [indecipherable] is the area called [indecipherable] This gives one a sense of how wealthy your family really was.
My new identity I thought I would stick with it except in the way that my mind formed itself then  by then almost age 18  I felt that I should be proud of my original family name and somehow fake the answers to the origination of the name.
Our family was ordered to go to the hospital  because there were a lot of patients.
I think maybe they lived somewhat better than than my family.
It was such a tremendous change in your life  after leaving Vienna where you had so much space  then to be in such small quarters with your family.
Without -- without papers  my husband's family had papers to im migrate to the United States.
They always wrote letters and always kept in touch  and they still corresponded with the Ness family so -- while this was going on.
And one day she said  oh  I k now a family  a very nice girl.
And By the way  did you have any conn ection with your family  I mean letters?
Did you keep in touch with anyone else from the clinic after the war  other than your family?
>> Jacques Fein: Well  in 1947 I was visited by an American family  who came to Taverny.
How did your family get food in the ghetto  did the Germans provide any food?
And And your sister talked ab out how she had to part with the trunk for your family.
JL: While we were in the ghetto  I think uh we as a family unit seemed to have uh managed quite well.
We wereŠour family was four brothers  two sister s  father and mother.
Now my brother remained in Israel and has a big family.
And...uh...I remember a family by the name of  I believe Grallman   who...uh...uh...whose lady had...uh...uh... a very small little girl  a child  but she became quite ill.
So we had to move in an apartment house where where mostly Jewish people  family  in that house.
And because they cannot feed the family  suppose the young people didn't have food.
Among the 240 000 were 33 members of my family  grandparents  uncles  aunts  cousins.
Imagine a boy that age being alone and not knowing what had happened to his family.
Tell us what you can about what happened to your family when the Germans occupied Lodz but before they put you into the ghetto.
This is for men Men  just for men but in my family  not my father and not my brothers had payes.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ETA HECHT page 16 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Christian family was a colleague of his so he knew I was with Mr. Losouskas and where I was  he knew exactly the address and everything but apparently he must have been afraid that in case this was found by a German they would be able to  to find me  they would be able to locate me.
5 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: And where you lived?
>> Bill Benson: What was your father doing during that time?
indecipherable] So  what was the connection between your family and the family of the Bobover Rebbe?
He was a registered pharmacist... uh...despite the...that he came from a poor religious family  he became very successful after he became a pharmacist.
But there was this...there was a prob... there was a stipulation that we would have to go to Auschwitz to get this money; because it is our family that will bring that money  you know  and hide in certain area near...near town.
And the other family had a 3 -year -old girl  my cousin  and I  we were put on top.
If we would escape  they knew where our family lived  so for the love for our family  we gladly stayed in that camp.
And they came and my family was there with  there were two branches  so to speak  from my mother and my father.
And I remember it still it was a joke in the family that my mother said  whats happening?
And I have to acknowledge  I have a lot of letters  mails  personal calls  which say  the first time I started to look in the history of my family.
I was assigned to a family that there was only a father  and since he had a daughter who was a year older than me  he just didn't know how to be a parent for bo th of us.
And the family said no  its  nothings going to happen here.
There was an old family  the parents and the son; this wa s the son and his wife.
We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good.
I lived in Trastevere; it's a very old section of Rome  right in the center of Rome and not far away from the ghetto where my mother's family was coming from.
Each time a couple of weeks with another family and this was going on for like a year.
While you were growing up as a small child  did you have any friends that were not Jewish?
>> Bill Benson: And that night happened to be  as you said  Kristallnacht  what we call Night of Broken Glass.
>> Susan Snyder: When you say your family  you  your sister  your mother returned back to your town  returned back to your house waiting for the Nazi occupation  essentially .
I don't know whether she suspected or ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 not.
Now I will what I want is to to to get to my family  I mean  because I am by myself.
And people  non -Jews  had to move out of those apartments and Jewish moved in.
>> Bill Benson: During that time  of course  that year  1944 -1945  where you're with the Madnas  in February of 1944  your sisters were living with a Catholic family  and they ended up being taken by the Nazis.
And did they know your parents were Jewish  and what that meant? (
So we kept our family identity  but we were certainly part of the -- Yes.
Uh and I I did well and we stayed with this 10 wonderful family for two years.
Yes  yes  my family was there together but I was I was most of the time in and out because of messages and the thing things like that.
What did -- what did you know about your -- your parents at this point?
And then of course  it has an address  be cause we were sponsored by my brother-in-laws family.
I happened to get myself with the underground and they advised me to have two or three re sidents in Budapest  having a place to live in Buddha  in Pess -- in Buddha I had to places where to live and when I chose a place to live  I used to live always with a Christian family.
And  in our own family  we started to prepare ourselves and my parents and grandparents remembered that in World War I  our city of Stranlinka   which I am speaking of  at the time that I was  we were living in Stranlinka.
So that was the only thing  and then wh en I realized this  then he -- he wrote us back  and then one day I got a letter  and it was directed to me  and then he wrote  ﬁMy next leave  I want come to The Hague.ﬂ A nd he had been before  but it was always for the family  you know.
>> Bill Benson: And  of course  war came in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland  but the full effect.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 30 I want to thank all of you for being with us.
Overall  what was your -- would you say your experience in England with your foster family was positive?
After they were discovered  Estelle and her family were deported to the Majdanek concentration camp where Estelle's father was killed.
We were seven children  four boys  three girls  my mother  my father.
But she lived in London  and Edith was the only onewell  Ruth did too with a Jewish family.
After all thes e narrow escapes  the friendly farmer  the farmer that Abraham fed and provide d clothing and provided food for his family and his animals  thus was the end of Abraham  shot by his own quote unquote fr iendly farmer.
So my two aunts  my one aunt specifically  Theresa  found me with the family where I had been hidden and she came to pick me up.
And my whole family  in fact  got very scared because they knew that I was the only one living there.
But then you -- I feel that I did accomplish a lot because I -- th-this way if I would die  there wouldn't be my children  my grandchildren  the names of my family.
It was a family with two children and I dont know  with somebody else with two other people who had the same document what I had.
That mean  uh Oradea became uh Hungary; but South Transylvania  where is part of my family was living there  there...that's Romania  and...still Romania.
Tell us what that involved  what your parents were able to do to keep you from being deported during that period.
That was -- But our -- We have very good fa -- good royal family.
And I just would like to live long enough to enjoy my family now.
And I've spent really hours looking at those and what emerges from them is th is tremendous feeling of people that are bound up with hundreds  a far flung family  you married and you then acquired your spouse s family as well and your spouse's spouse's.
But in any case we were all there and so we went in and they put us in this camp.
Anyway  the camps  the second camp I went t o  I made by first great friend for life  uh although I still did have my father with me   but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew and I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in Brussels  Belgium  I also picked up Dutch  which was spoken at home  but Dutch and Flemish is almost the same.
6 No  they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family escaped Germany to Poland so there were no problems with the family and they hardly spoke about any events that involved them.
>> Bill Benson: By the time Germany invaded Poland in September 1939  launching World War II  your community had already experienced profound change.
And therefore when the second family wished to go away...the second...another family who was one of the founders of our community...they wished to go off the same.
Youre still with your family  so you must be feeling some obligation towards them.
Was -- w-would you ha ve considered your family middle class  or more than that?
Middle class  rich At home we were poor  but we had enough food to eat and clothes to wear  but we were happy because we had a a beautiful family  a very close and loving family  which we are still that way and so are my children.
07:07:59 One of my mother's sisters  the second sister  i mmigrated to Israel  in the very early 30s with the whole family  and this family survived.
In fact  between relatives  both in Slovakia  an uncle in Germany  an uncle in Poland and their respective families; of about 25 relatives  uncles  aunts  cousins; there was 17 only one person that survived besides our immediate family.
My father  when I met with my fa ther  one of the family offered us a place to stay.
Personally  our family  my mother was having a lot of patients.
So you did not go with the entire family when they went to the ghetto?
But life went on  you know  and Warsaw is a very  very busy cit y. And then I befriended a family who are relatives of the owner of this -- of this -- of this pl -- workshop.
That we had -- somehow there was a terribly -- disturbance in the family  that my hiding mother was extremely anxious  that my hiding father was the one who wanted this  who did this  with all his heart.
Do you know much about the impact of Kristallnacht on your own family and what that meant once Kristallnacht happened for your family?
My father told him about our Jewish tradition  and eight days later friends of the family  neighbo rs  everyone gathered in our home in The Hague for this  for a celebration of this milestone in a Jewish life.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 59 Oh yes  theyre -- they ask  you know  oh yes  yes.
What were you thinking at or at all about your rest of your family?
So -- So ar-are there -- are there members of your family with you in Haidari before you go on the train?
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
My mother was very  very religious  and I was raised in a religious environment.
But Id like to get a sense of who was your family.
Unfortunately  if we would have moved maybe he would have been alive  at least the close family.
And yet  you got to go on with your life  and you get situated the best you can  and you try to be happy  and try to raise a family  and to have a future  thats all.
But as we came to the same school from where they take my brother out  I find there the brother of my father with his family  two old people  and two old other people  Greenfeld  and Mrs. Greenfeld  also very good friends of our family.
Are you -- are you religious now  or have -- di-did you raise your children Jewish?
S -- and my grandfather had that business and my father and uncles took it over.
We didn't tell this because th ey would not let us  but we risk our lives to make a living for for my...for the family.
And this is your first within a month or two of you having left your family?
I knew that the family  very few were left but we never talked about it.
So how many people from you r father's family lived not so much how many people  but what kind of jobs did th ey do  your extended family?
There are  when the family  immediate family get together  all the siblings and all the from Chaims brothers and sisters  there are 65 people.
There were many  I  I dont remember how many relatives  I think it at least 15 or 30  I dont remember how many and in my family too.
You do -- it wasnt exactly Jewish neighborhood  it was a mixed neighborhood  Polish people and -- and Jewish people.
And the English was differently  told about his family and his home somewhere in England.
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?
That's always -- >> Bill Benson: But as you've said to us   not only what you went through  but the family.
>> Bill Benson: During the time of the Soviets  do you know what happened to your parents' business and their ability to continue to support y ou?
Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the Ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: Your grandparents and your great grandparents  tell us what happened to them during that time.
In 1977  when our si thi-third boy was born  I -- I examined the boy  of Formatted: Font: Bold Formatted: Font: Bold Interview with George Kadar 49 April 24  2000 course  as a good father  and I considered that his ears were a little bit different of the other ears of the family.
And then in a day  or maybe even faster  they found for me a place  and so I got to the family of my second mother   really.
You have to show that the family is  can take care of the people that they are going to bring.
You know  like you have a house and they put you in two rooms  a whole family.
I had an older brother  who was eight years older  and a sister who was two years younger.
My mother  father  and three of us  my sisters  all three kids.
No  I didnt know exactly what Romania and I didnt have there were there were once there were not many Romanians the Berkovitz family was there was the doctor  the wife.
Do you still have any connection with the Bocahuts today  any family?
And after your father was taken away  what happened in your family?
This mean my mothers -- my mother and my uncles wife were two sisters.
So the family got into that boat  and many people drowned  because they were walking in the water.
Talk to me about how supportive people were of one another  and how friendships and you had your camp mother  refer to  tell me about that whole phenomenon  adopting a new family in the camp.
A family called 43 Zilberman  with two girls older th an I  Lidia and Mia  whom I knew very well  but they also stopped there [indecipherable].
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about that  you and your brother were possibly and probably the only Jews left in the town.
Somebody who had a presidential ex emption  he and his family did not have to wear a star.
I mean  I looked out for myself and I used to say  \ we have to do it  we have to have a family  we have to have a life\ .
>> Bill Benson: September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland and World War II begins.
Im sure that my histor y and the persecution that Jews had  what we went through as a family and as Jews had a lot to do with my wanting to participate in the Civil Rights Movement.
One other thing that I want to mention is that while we were still with the Runjak family  that family  as they were renters in our house  was all connected with the same courtyard.
I was live -- first we lived with a family  with the Frankel family and then  after my sister got married  I got a little -- tiny little hole in the ground  just for myself and I lived there and I -- I became a nanny and [indecipherable].
There was some sort of a roof still over the basement  so and we knew in that house there was food  so the neighbors  the border guard family and us  we went to this bombed-out house and we stayed there for about three  four days.
Did you tell your children about it  what you went through?
There were Jews and non-Jews  but there were a number of  a great number of refugees  because we found out later on there were some refugees who came from Po land  from Russia  from other places and to  we  they also went to Canada  because this boat went to Canada and  and my family still had contact with them after they had left the boat in Canada.

Well  there was a fairly sizeable family   not in a town where we lived  but where my parents had come from  and that since that was only about 20 miles away.
All  all the family left Vienna  or the immediate family left Vienna.
So anyw ays  when I came to th e United States  somehow I don't think the family really know what to do with me   how to handle me.
You know  in this family we dont -- we dont talk like that  you know.
I remember the very first I heard a family actually would sit shiva if their daughter or son married a Sepharic Jew.

Now we have fragments of the family but family is still ve ry important to us  to all of us.
But like I said  my family  I think they shielded us  you know  from this.

And also some Polish people losted their family in a concentration camp  and -- and was -- you know  there could be a worse  you know  but maybe of this experience I explain myself  what we was going through  maybe make a -- maybe this experience make me a better man  you know  and thats why Im so busy  you know  with this social organization  you know  and I try help other people.
indistinct] Did you find out what happened to the othe r members of your family who didnt leave?
Did it affect your father the way it did your mother?
The farmers took us in and hid us  at their own risk  I mean  the risk of their own lives and the family  right?

To this dentist  my benefactor at the office  who  his family lived in Displanes   he said  Dr. Horn  I will send you to the hospital and they will ask you for no money.

Later his father was dont tell me the Stromas I know Alec  I know the family.
Because his family was also killed that he died within a year and left their daughter an orphan at the age of 19.
My father's mother and also my father's sister and her husband  her two children  and her mother -in-law.
And like I said  I always  any chance that I did have to go  I did go see them  because I felt this... we were not family  but it was more th an family.
All the family I have is my Harry Alexander 31 October 11  1995 Page 31 son and my daughter.
I  together with my family at that time  my wife  my children went to visit Oskar Schindler in Tel Aviv.
Well  my my grandparents had three children; my father and a bro and his brother and his sister.
I dont remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family car in the 1950s with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying.
And and he wrote a letter  together with a picture showing her and the five children sitting on the Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 52 Wawel   telling Hitler its unbelievable that a man could leave a family looking so beautiful  and being so important  and So your mother did this?
Now  when your father died  were you living with your parents?
My parents' family  both of them came from a town called Sarajevo in Yugoslavia.
It was an apartment of three rooms and in each room one couple was living and the kitchen we divided and three women were sharing that kitchen.
Is there anything about you and your experience that your family and friends dont know that you would perhaps like them to know?
>> Bill Benson: That was before they began creating the ghettos and moving you into the ghettos?
How do you think all of this has affected the way that you view your life and the way you have lived your life since all of this happened to you and your family and it was such an unusual experience in so many ways.
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 13 Well  mostly like families know knew each other  because the families stuck together  like my mothers family was quite a large family  and my fathers family was quite a large family.
My grandparents home was sort of on the outskirts of Warsaw.
I went  no they were mixed  in the school it was mixed  but actually my first friend wasn't Jewish  but otherwise  later on   I had only Jewish friends.
And Mike Swab went to Amsterdam  he didnt find anybody from his family  so he went ba ck to the Third Armored Division  and there was -- and [indecipherable] where I dont find anybody.

My mother  my father  my brother  my sister  my aunt  my uncles  large families.
After the war  the family went back to Holland  because they used to have businesses there  and my father-in-law wanted to see USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 28 what he could salvage.
My mothers brother -- one a -- one of the brothers  went with us.
Q. So how do you remember your parents reactions  what were they saying?
They  they knew and actually they are especially one is actually in knowing the r elatives and even some relatives from Israel was there that visited our family years ago.
Life continued as a student and the practice was to go home on vacation and holidays and of course that was a double holiday to be spent with my mother and spinster aunts who housed the family.

So  they had a house  and were rented the rooms th ere for her.
How much do you know what the other members of your family were doing  where they were  did you [indecipherable] see them from time to time.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- your father was a remarkable man.
The rooms were small and each room would have a family or several single people.
Your experience under Nazism  having to leave your family  start a new life?
But I remember that he was good to us and his wife said  ﬁIf you child will go to court and tell them how he treated you and your family  they will let him go  he wont have to go to jail.ﬂ Well  I did.
But my cousin -- I had a lot of cousins in France and in Paris.
Yeah  so  my mother  she came from a family living in in Latvia   and not in Riga  she was Ventspila.
No  I did not encounter antiSemitism  but I encountered situations that I didnt like.

indecipherable] with one family who had big orange and grapefruit groves in Famagusta.
In 1939 they still were able to immigrate to Israel  and thats why they survived  this family.
Your family makes a decision to move from Antwerp and your move to Brussels  and you were there  I think  for about 18 months when your family makes the very profound decision that it's time to go into hiding.
And to this day whenever I talk to the Madna family  it's always Bobby.
So -- so I was kind of accepted as part of the -- of that -- of that working family  as it were.
But what happened to these hidden kids USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 127 is that they had good  solid years  early childhood  of nurturing and of -- of -- of -- of -- as -- a stable family situation and they dont perceive their parents as the perpetrators of terrible things.
Two of my cousins  one with the family  his wife and child and another one.
>> Bill Benson: Did other members of the extended family also go to the Netherlands?
Did you hear -- do you remember when you heard that you were going to be leaving?
We did  we did move  took our belongs  drove by  we rented a camion  11 a truck  and the whole family  Frajermauer and me including.
And  you know  w-we get al ong very well when were together and having fun and we can discuss family  too  and -- and difficult things  and -- D-Do you talk about -- do -- about your childhood together  with one another?
He didnt find anybody from the family  but finally he married a -- a Jewish gi rl and he left for Israel.
And what -- what kind of business did your father have?
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
Probably others as well  because while Im familiar with the family members that were brought over  he had gotten other people to sponsor other immigrants  and Im not familiar who they would have been.
And I told you that after   he moved the whole family to the Cottian  which is in the mountains.
And as -- you were still you ng at this time  but did you know anything about Hitler or the Nazi party or what was going on  you know  in Germany?
My sister lived with a family with daughters in London  then at some point was taken away from them to a hostel.
Ye s. Oh why does God punish me with your family?
And I  if I consider myself anything  I am Jewish  and Im not religious.
My family was part of my life  it's not part of theirs.
And in Italy there was instructions at th e Palestine office that whenever the first certificates for to Palestine arrive  should give it to and his family  and there really arrived four hundred certificates  the last ones in in the of the   so they give it to us  but then came the Pale stine Jewish Brigade who were...who took...who arranged their illegal immigration from from Italy to Palestine and they kept me and they told me  look  we are in uniform.
He was with his girlfriend and I was with my family  but this was counted as we lived in one bunker  you know  we made one -- one place of -- of living to gether.
I dont remember any us e of the telephone in either family at any time  so its very possible there wasnt one.
Also when the so-called racial laws came out  it was uh decreed that uh no one  uh no Jewish family where the where the man in the house can have a ma...a live-in maid because uh they were afraid of uh mixing up the races for and uh he  that man...his na me was Victor Marschek ...uh got a permission to uh for our maids to stay to the very end because he said my parents have other things to do than uh to stay in the house.
Because my children always appreciated are just so close that we just could not be a closer family there is.
I was lucky to be working for a Bulgarian family where the son had been a diplomat.
Anyway What was your fathers business when he came to the United States?
And...uh...we also  I remember...nobody in my family smoked  but people did.
The family th at I was staying with were Jewish pe ople that were my cousin's wife's relatives really.
My my cousin  the the the daughter of my fathers partner is very Orthodox Jewish still.
My sister  who did not know she was Jewish  because we couldnt tell her  she was too young.
There was nobody from my immediate family  my first girlfriend  school fr iends  factory friends  you name it.
And also up the stairs was a little like a loft  a little room  and some family was looking out through the window  they didnt go to zaehlappell and they loo -- used to smile at us  you know  they were so happy that they are there.
For one last time  that part of the Munzer family was reunited.
Until 1937  my family  of course  had friends and co -workers.
Okay  and so would you have consid ered your family pretty well off?
Did you have a large extended family on both sides  on your mother and Not really.
But th what you know But I I I should  but I I dont know  and I not even in my my imagination I could point who he was  if he was a little bit more sophisticated  you know  educated  for some kind of revenge  some kind of what had been done to him or his family  but I dont know.
But was your father taken away first  did your father  was he taken away first?
When you first came to this country  were you able to stay in touch with family and friends that you left behind?
So we just did -- SE: And he was the oldest one for the family.
Well  not just that they were thrown out  the plant was taken over by an Aryan administrator who made it publicly known that he intended to popularize the family and did some nice things like closing access to the bank  to the personal accounts of my father and my aunt  at the same time charging the entire payroll of the plant to that personal account a nd a few other things like that.
And then finally he got a visa from Prague to...uh...France  and he moved from...to France  hoping that that he would have it easier to have his family follow  but it turned out that the French did not...uh..permit us to come.
Okay  I mean  when I asked that question  yes  it was sort of a backwards question to ask  is your family from Karlsruhe .
Had your family lived in that area for a long time  for generations before or did they come from elsewhere?
What about the other members of your family  were they equally religious?
01:25:20 So then you were put in with a work group  or separated from your... Family.
Now  when you got on the train  your family was together?
I ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 don't remember how this came about.
>> Bill Benson: So you had some semblance of family there.
This is a wedding picture of my parents  1922  in Frankfurt  with the extended family there  and including in the back right behind them  my moth ers sister and her husband  Rosie Goodman  and Morris Goodman  where my sister went after the war.
He wanted to find somebody in the family and he find me in that computer.
My parents  my mother's family and my fath er's brothers and there were people from other parts of different  other parts of cities and different villages that were brought there  into that compound.
The furniture didn't have much value but some pictures  you know  family memories.
I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters  and my mother had two brothers and a sister.
But in that corner of southwest Germany I h ave documented it because I do family history  back to 1660  1670.
They wouldn't be ashamed during the we ek that they cannot give their children enough to eat  but on the Sabbath they would certainly be ashamed of  and they would do anything  you know  on Sabbath and the holidays  that they did the behavior of the family is di fferent  and they can and this was really every Friday  I was going already as a four ye ar old child.
So at that time your family was aware enough of what was happening  or what seemed to be happening  to try to emigra te  to try to leave.
I remember our family talking about it and that we were scared  but we always thought it would pass  that the Germans would realize that Hitler really was no good  and that things would be well again.
I know I stayed with this family for a ce -- for a certain amount of time  and there were -- seems like two other children  kids my age.
But meanwhile  Theresa Pollin had asked me to translate letters that a family wrote.
I have the children and the family and whatever I worked all my life for and to run away to Russia  and we didn't.
Which is  my uncle was my father's brother  and my aunt was my mother's sister.
N one of my family saw anything  I was the only one  thanks to the fact -- and then Jews driven out of the synagogue  with the -- And you saw that? --
>> Frank Liebermann: In 1933  my mother's side of the family celebrated the 100th Anniversary of their business in Germany where they had a wholesale leather business with a tannery.
Interview with Paula Blue August 7  2009 49 I came yeah  I got my I I was in Paris with the Leo when he after he was released from the army  and I was the the yeah  the consulate was in my family in Canada found someone here to to make papers for me  because I couldnt get to Canada  believe it or not  I was German.
I went to a Jewish organization  they had the -- a meeting -- social meeting on -- on a Sunday.
So they decided  a committee  they paid off the Gestapo  the execution sh ould be in another town  not -- not the family should [indecipherable].
How did things develop further as time went on  and how did it affect your family?
And so my parents told the pediatrician of our Jewish tradition and eight days later our family gathered probably for one of the very last of ceremonies in Holland  really the first milestone in the Jewish life for the Bris ceremony.
But even in Sweden   you -- did you feel you could mourn your family?
Because some people had brothers and sisters  I was with mine girlfriend.
I wrote through him to my family and he took the letters  and my family sent to his address and he brought the letters to me which were  you know  going without the censor.
Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the ghetto was sealed and when the deportations started in Czernowitz?
And then we went  and we hid there for two or three weeks.
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
>> Bill Benson: Your parents  as you mentioned  moved to France in 1924.
So but then we met somebody told us that our uncle  my mothers brother is alive and they told us already they went back to look for their family  the two older girls.
And it was a Hasidic family  a ll belonging to the Hasidic sect of the Alexander Rabbi.
I just wondered if you felt that you were a -- a cornerstone of the family  sort of succeed ing in the -- in your new life  but fulfilling one critical role?
Youll become a Christian and youll become part of my family and we will treat you equally with my children.
I had no family in Israel  none whatsoever  all my family was in the United States  and it was quite a -- quite a group by then.
You were living in a place with  I believe  a rabbi and his family.
And then we moved to Long Branch   New Jersey  where I went to school  and my mother and father worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family  with a New York lawyer.
So the Jews had their own places  and so that's where I went.
We were 29  and we were all crying because the parents just left.
So and Im in between  so Im neither one good friend with me  and this is how the family ended.
Before the liquidation of the ghetto  the family escaped to a small vi llage.
everybody in the family  all four of you had to get special permission?
It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere  but it was more when we were on our own  without family  you know  that it suddenly appeared that I really was in a German Jewish circle.
And now  basically  as I said  was the feeling th at the Jewish community was a friendly community and there were not really big conflict.
>> Bill Benson: You're in the ghetto  but you're able to go into the town?
My father was one of the Hasidim -- belonged to one of the Hasidic sects  it was called the Alexander Hasidim .
As a matter of fact  particularly one non-Jewish family I was very friendly with.
But that time her mother was working  her father was working  and in -- in order our family  which was friend of Evies from V-Vienna  they were in Ferramonti.
In her case  I checked it out  they were not Nazi family.
And then when was the next change  from going to the I should add also that my mother was to her own par actually  my mother was close to her own family  but I think she lost some contact while she was living away  and but she was closer to her fam ily than maybe my father was to his.
I suppose that my older siblings  they probably were in organization  therefore I do what is possible and thank God that my girlfriend was also of the same kind of family [indecipherable] Which girlfriend is this?
From there  I went back to this friend who told me about my family with the Kosner  Kosner group and we started to speculate  \ What can I do?\
I had a cousin which was a son from a very wealthy family.
I mean wa You know  when I got my when I married when I wa started going with my husband and I married him  our maid  who I to ld you about  so fond of the family  she said to me  dont marry a Jew.
Did you have a large extended family in Germany and therefore youd be leaving them?
Isnt that a great -- nice picture of my family and -- and Im very proud of them.
Because the ghetto  at one time  people lived there  before the ghetto  they were homes  you know.
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
>> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: How did your family make ends meet between 1936 and 1938?
And in the train  my father wrote out an affidavit or something and said to the chauffer  who cl early was a member of the family  ﬁYou will need to take care of your family.
>> Bill Benson: Once the Germans occupied Poland on September 1  1939  your life and that of your family changed swiftly and dramatically.
It was -- it was just a -- one big happy family.
And th-th-the only th ing I -- I -- I -- I remember some Gr-Greek family that hid Jew -- Jewish people  were asked wh-why do they do that.
I mean  my aunt and her three  the three other members of her family lived in two rooms  essentially.
Other even went to the length of quickly getting married  so they woul d be supporters of family.
Went to one of my jo bs and the family was in Geneva  the kids were in international schools  which was a good experience for them  and my job was making reviewin g the budgets  reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was ne cessary.
And on Sundays th e whole family  the real rich ones  you know  who could afford anything and everyt hing would come and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 60load their cars with all the garden vegetables and fruits th at my father-in-law worked on.
When I was in the west  my family wa s still in  in Warsaw.
In a household there were ten rooms  it was a post-Jewish apartment consisting of ten rooms and all this I had to clean.
I -- I mean the longest I stayed [indecipherable] the longest [indecipherable] was I stayed with my fathers friend  and I was -- I was ju st part of the family and thats it.
And then every few years we went back  because -- I especially went back to the ci -- be side the cemetery  I have this friend over there in Budapest  they moved to Budapest with a big family and they always waited for us  you know  with so much love  and -- and just like the war time  I remember she was always so nice to me.
They brought out  and what they give back to the family was Raoul's passport  Raoul's personal papers  and the thousand dollars.
Her name was Helen but we called her Potyo that's some kind of endearing term for I don't know \ the little one\  The baby in the family?
And the United States family  all I knew was my fathers brother  my uncle.
And that he considered it to be a danger to the family and they stopped the strip mining operation totally.
Anyway  we went to that family  to the pharmacist family and he said  \ Barbara  what you going to do now?\
Until I decided I am not going to listen to the family.
Tell us why that was so and what you can about your family and their life in Gliwice and about yourself in those first years of your life.
What became custom  the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 Jewish children were sent to relatives in bordering areas  where they could go to Jewish schools  but it had to be away from home.
The...the...the...the younger brother immigrated to Argentina with one of the sisters went to the United States  and one of the sisters lived with her parents in Poland and this...this...I just wanted to mention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the family.
And I  I think  that is  is a direct result of the loss of my parents.
>> Bill Benson: How did your family -- you had a lot of mouths to feed .
And I drew a a family tree  and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg  the only Jew in the class  could trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu fellow students.
And I dont remember any Ukraine family  even the people that worked for my father [indecipherable] at least I dont remember my father talking.
And th-that was sort of a family run hotel  small hotel  and I really liked it.
Uh  my  if I  for years  and I still do occasionally  there wasn't a night  and I  like I mentioned  I have a large family so my family gets my mind off these things and I have a very normal life.
An d so my sophomore year of college I went to Poland  and at that time you couldnt go as a Jewish group to Poland .
This is tape number one  side B. And we were talking about how your family left Warsaw in the taxi and then the gas ran out.
I got to be together again with my family...which was le ft from my family.
Just to go back during  you know  all the years you -- you lived here  and youre raising a family  -- Mm-hm. --
My mother had made sure that Annie had gotten ration cards and things like that  to care for me  but the Madna family never asked  really  where they would get food  who would pay for this extra mouth to feed.
So was my brother who was sitting downstairs uh with my father  my uncle  and many other family uh and friends whom we know  and I was really brought up in a very warm  Jewish family.
Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 31 Do you have any other memori es of the Jewish community in Taurag  or anybody that you would have known from ther e  or who had interaction with your family?
But not having family left  and not wanting to contact any of my Polish ex-friends  my -- my idea was to leave Poland forever and ever.
There was some villages went to the German  Polish people and they would say  listen  here and here is a hiding family or a sing le.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
Talk a little bit about maybe some of the holidays or did you  did you yourself ever read the Torah in the home with your family?
But my mothers family was a different type  especially at that time  you know.
He was assigning family units to the left and to the right.
Q. So you feel like your family was integrated in the community?
My leader  th-the person who brought me there was my cousin  first cousin  Zioma Faerstein  who was -- whom I mentioned before  who was living with his family still at that time in Balti  in 94.
And we went and spent two weeks in Noordwijk aan Zee  a very nice place  where I met my family.
Most of these relatives being my grandmother's sisters  brothers  and their children.
So I was with my mother and the kid  my wife and my brother  and it was most of my family who went to the left to the transport.
She became a real mother  got very involved in our lives and we became a very close knit family.
But my aunts and my -- both uncles  two aunts and two uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
You had mentioned earlier that you were trying to find your family.
And we never talked about any of this  my family  with anybody else.
And so we moved to Vienna with all the other relatives on my fathers side.
This other fellow took me ther e  but I met my husband to be there  wh o was also a Holocaust surv ivor and who lost all his family there.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 33 By that time I had done a lot of things.
And when my mother was the first member of the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here.
And before she finished  she says  ﬁWe -- we a nice Christian family  and please dont send any Jews.ﬂ So here the graduation day  a bus pulls up full of black people.
>> My dear cousin  why didn't you and your mother join our other aunts and uncle with your children to go to Israel instead of coming to the United States ?
I get back to that later on  but let me tell you about the family.
And Ive calculated that if every German who told me that they hid a Jewish family in their house  really had done that  there wouldnt have been any Holocaust  you know?
Third way was that the people who were coming in  they were  we  our family 12 was assigned two different families that would come and get their lunch.
And due to this family connection  my mother started to do a little work over over there  mostly started to kind of a a how should I put it?
>> Bill Benson: And Anna  after the Hungarians did all of these terrible things to you  they took away your family business  they took away the textile business -- >> Anna Grosz: They took away everything.
Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 205This I know through family  through because there was in village not far away from the village where I was born.
They just come by to say hello to every...Sunday was horrendous for us because we had to stay in an upstairs little room almost all Sunday and couldn't get out because the family was downstairs and they shouldn't see us.
Tell me a little bit about your family  what your father did  what your mother did  your brothers?
I didnt want him to be stuck with with a family like that.
But going to a show with my family and enjoying that experience  thats what we enjoy doing.
This situation with my family really drove me to the brink of a ne rvous breakdown.
>> Laura Green: This might be a good moment to talk about some letters that your family -- that you recently discovered.
But my stepfather knew  and when we could not fa tried here  and here and there  you know  well-known hotels  we  I think for one night maybe  we found a Interview with Jerzy May 8  2013 22 little Ukrainian hotel that was accepting us  but later we found the Schiffmans had a big apartment  so [interruption  break] Okay  so you were with your stepfather in Lwow   and you were staying with a family called the Schiffmans .
And he told his colleagues to bring his family in Vienna and get them to contact us that we could stay with them.
And the entire family used to come visit  and quite often they left me with my cousin and aunt  so we were just playi ng in this house.
Give us your name  your full name  and where you were born  please.
His connection through the CID caused them to check our family tree.
So  two boy two boys in your family  and a girl and a boy in theirs.
My father family stayed -- his mother was -- her name was Maria Vizeron .
I dont mind visiting Hungary  but... and the reason I dont mind visiting  because I still have friends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with.
So you gotta understand is  if I was going to rely on the fact that I had family in Israel  I Interview with Esther Dezube December 7  2000 36would be miserable every holiday  because th ey werent with me during the holidays.
And so actually my father met my mother in this family.
Did you have  or did your parents have any correspondence or connection with the people back in -- ya -- the family back in Germany?
A nd of course family  family and friendship was very important.
This is tape number four  side A. What do you mean  family history?
My cous ins  aunts  uncles  my mother's sister that was in the big ghetto they didn't have much more.
And thats we were the first ones to go to a school of higher education in my family.
And I had the difference between one family I brought my friend and here was such a joy that I brought him.
Me  my mother  my father and the two brothers  my tw o brothers and my mother's sister and aunt.
Have you been able to forgive the people w ho did this to you and your family?
Yes  yes  they did I I dont remember but I I I cannot con yes  every family already knew that this is bad.
I -- those days  I -- and my family -- so-called family was absolutely stunned.
It was a family  we came in  they knew about such transportations because they used the people  the young people used this channel very often.
He was he the both Rothfels and his wife were Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13  2012 42 very devout Lutherans  but the family background was Jewish.
Well  the family life...until...before the war  everything was  you know  normal.

I know you know very little about your family and circumstances for them prior to the war but to the extent you can  tell us what you're able to tell us about your family before your birth.
As a matter of fact even now I read quite a bit...his name was Freidman and my father's family was related to him and I have some wonderful childhood memories as a child going to .
He said  ﬁI got a problem  my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.ﬂ I said  ﬁLook  thats not... shouldnt be a problem.ﬂ In my broken English I said that  and he looked at me and he immediately said  ﬁWell  where ar e you from?ﬂ And of course  the whole story came about and I said  ﬁWell  why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?ﬂ He said  ﬁBecause she has everything.ﬂ And this is how I met a then young man by the name of Sheldon Rich  who was the son of a Chicago banking family.
He had a family to provide for  to support  and he did his job.
But I remember we had a pretty nice life for the few months  and th en we applied -- then we heard that President Roosevelt was taking 1 000 refugees to America  and we applied for it  as a family.
What was the Jewish community like when you were growing up?
When the war started he tried to convince his family to also to move to +.
He had a sandwich  he was eating onion  and so suddenly the French policeman said  ﬁYou must be Jewish ﬂ and there was this w hole group of family who were Jewish  they had false papers  but they were Jewish  and they bothered this farmer because he was eating onion.
We uh  packed up everything we could  take on our bags  and uh  in a week we moved all our household  we find a little place in the ghetto.
But my cousin -- I had a lot of cousins in France and in Paris.
Its -- The whole family is -- is dead  which is very disturbing.
Well  being in the ghetto  she managed  you know  managed mostly take care of the kids  whatever the best she could and make the best of it for the family.
And yes  he  with really an adjutant to the unfortunate leader of military leader of Poland at that time  tha he crossed  with his family  with my father  with the guy from ma my fathers friends from Warsaw  while his family wer the wife  their daughter and son  stayed with us.
Interview with Rose Liberman February 4  2014 6 Did you have a lot of extended family  grandparents  aunts and uncles?
My uncle in his uniform in the first world war  you know  that kind of stuff  and mostly family shots.
46 Your family is whom you gra -- My aunt and my grandparents.
Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 16 We was all together.
So  in my very earliest memories  those were kind of the memories that I have.
Sounds as if youve kept in pretty close t ouch with whatever members of your family have survived.
Tell me a little bit about your mothers family  and I know what you know of it.
I was born in uh Hungary in Europe  Hungary  Budapest  and uh I had a brother who was younger than I myself  three years and uh we had a wonderful  happy family life and childhood.
And  did your parents have any contact with Jewish families  Jewish people?
A family -- nobody knew really what happened and what w ill happen  and a father was very prot ective of the chil dren.
Every house  more or less  had a refugee family and we had a room and a ha lf  starting from scratch  from nothing  you know one box or something--a barrel to use as a tabl e  I mean nothing.
Did you share your log room with another family  or were you did you have the whole room to yourselves?
And then  obviously  our life totally crumbled because we had a couple of hours to evacuate our home  which was just I mean  you know  it 's very traumatic  obviously  not only for a teenager  but the whole family.
10 >> Bill Benson: So the rest -- your mom  dad  and baby brother.
We -- and there was one -- there was one family who thought that they werent Jewish  the -- they converted  but they were with us  too.
Buchler was  I would say  fifteen years older than me who knew my family quite well.
She fa she talks very in teresting  she talked a lot about her own family  very little about my father.
Dr. Rosenblit is going to tell us about her father and his family  and any family members that she can recall.
So I had a uncle  and a aunt  but they are deceased.
I subsequently took a room with a Jewish family  and I was with them until March  when things had already become quite bad.
And I knew who was the family  first of all  because my a unt and his aunt were very good friends.
And but in my family in particular when when my my cousin became a priest  you know  those things came up regularl y. And there was  yes well  there is something in in in the gospels which calls about the je y-you know  the Jewish Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 35people demanding that Jesus from Nazareth would be executed.
Did your family think -- Oh everybody -- everybody are afraid to war  if somebody know what mean the war.
In fact  when theŠwhen my family finally made the decision to enter the ghetto  to smuggle ourselves in  a decision was also made that I could potentially stay away and not report to the ghetto  which I did temporarily.
And al so  what about her cousin  who lost her whole family?
Laughter] To keep us -- >> Bill Benson: Keep you occupied  yeah.
Unfortunately he died when  before my childhood friend Harold  uh  was born  so he never knew his father and so we were quite a large extended family.
We were not lazy  and we built a new family and a new life.
But before we turn to that time  why don't you tell us about your family  your community  and yourself in those first 10 years of your life before the war began.
But and the relationship between the non-Jewish help and your family was good.
You better pack.ﬂ And we packed the things of the whole family on this cart and it was loaded to the top and everybody was looking for only Carl and me because we were the youngest of the family.
We st ayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least.
87 And can you just then  finish telling me you le ft -- when did you -- your family leave Poland  and -- and walk through a little bi t of the chronology of the rest of those years  you know.
And one of those Po lish people  you know  who I can say it  they killed my family  okay  saw him  and they got scared.
Once Paris was liberated  is that when your parents felt you could go back to Paris?
Could you tell us a little bit abou t where you were born  your family  your circumstances  how many sibli ngs you had  and so on.
I am sure that other people who share similar traumatic experiences in their family histories probabl y feel a similar bond as well  but this is what our family feels  and this is what Lauras family feels.
Let me go back chronologically a little bit in time and talk about how there became an awareness in your community and in your family that the occupation was coming.
They very definitely wanted to go to the United States because a large percentage of them had family in the States  a large percentage  and I think they wanted to get away as far as they could from the Russians and away from Eur ope and the Middle East.
For example  I have to leave the pictures from my family and from me of course  many things and not one word written in Yiddish.
200 000 people were still in Budapest  and then except for this Manf red-Vice family and a few others  what ma naged to escape  there were 200 people -- 200 000 Jewish people still in Budapest.
We used to rent an apartment when we first moved to that city  that was our first apartment that we rent from his family to live in.
We wanted to go back to find out if anybodys alive or if anybody is there from the family.
So I had two uncles  young me n. Because you know  four kids  my mom was the oldest.
And I dont know whether thats the name of the family that they were hidden with or not  my mother didnt tell me.
And I fell asleep with my head falling on the plate.
But whenever I came to her house  she was so happy  because I was full of hope.
And [indecipherable] religion  [indecipherable] look  there were some Polish people  theres -- you see  there was an ordinance  that anyone that is hiding a Jew  if the Ge-Germans will find it  they would be executed together with the Jews  the whole family.
L et's start the conversation today with you telling us a little bit about your family  your community   and you before the war began.
But have you put yourself in your fathers shoes  and it does seem to me that the reason he chose not to leave with his immediate family was because of that responsibility to the extended family -- Oh yes.
With the horse and wagon and ah  two  three times they bringed over the furnitures and this way we moved.
He did sell a number of stamps  yes  and by this time  I guess it helped to keep the family going.
Because first you come and then you settle down somehow  you bring your family.
There are a lot of people who are just sort of scattered remnants of their family.
I have cherished memories of my wife's family  Uncle and every supportive to us.
But they couldnt  they -- and many of my relatives were really in Poland.
They told him that he had to take me in and take care of me and if anything happened to me they would lock him and his family in house and burn the whole house down.
a remarkable woman  whom I remember well  because she was old  but alive in before we left  and who may have been the only one in the family  who in some way had some element of practicing Judaism.
In the ghetto  in the apartment where we were  there was several families.
And they invite all the family  and even friends if y -- they want to come and see us and they put on a big  big party  yo u know  so -- you know  all kind of food and they were really  really nice to us  and I -- I gonna -- I -- we remember that  that they were so nice.
When you're with your sisters and the kids and your mother and your father  as well as -- I mean  pretty much the whole family is together?
Did you go to school after your father was taken away?
We went to a small synagogue  Rabbi Moshe Weiss   and he had lost much of his ow n family and certainly we were very close with him and we talked with him.
Can you firs t tell us -- did you have other family members that stayed behind in Moravska?
He would come and play the guitar after he finished his office work; and he tried  he was one of the best people that  that lived on this  under the sun  because he not only that he  helped  he was so I mean  that he gave up his life for his family; but when he was a young  a young boy  he would he would take the children.
Yes and because of her parents and her family and the whole thing.
And as I understand later that these people has to put their own family to th e gas chamber and the cremat -- crematorium.
And you know  a and a lot of that might have been my doing as well  because I wanted this new family  which turned out to get bigger and bigger  and cousins here and cou you know  cousins in Cleveland and cousins in Canada and my fa my American father was Canadian originally.
Then the uh  Germans arrived  uh the S.S. And they set up sort of like a platform and they told us that we had to march by them in a single file by family.
to your uncle and aunt who were family friends Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy ended up in Belsen  and where they perished.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 >> Bill Benson: Marcel  I'm mindful of our time  and I know we want to spend some time talking about your stay with the Sawinski family.
I am very happy  I have a nice family  god was very good to me  I have four lovely children and thirteen beautiful grandchildren who know what I went through and they are really trying in each day and in each moment to sweeten my life.
But but I think that our family may be an isolated incident.
And then you heard the marching toward the door that would open on the family in which the Germans would come.
Laughter] Let me go back to the family life  what we had .
And was your house in the ghetto at the time or did you have to move?
But that was somehow an just occurred to me later on th at they must have been Jewish because of for some reason  I dont know what made me think about it  that that I somebody said that the father was Jewish  so I thought that the family was Jewish.
I mentioned that in a tiny room there were eight of hi s family  and that was very good.
Because it was in me  and he asked always  almost  about his grandparents.
Interview with Sylvia Rosen November 20  2012 49 And I went through [indecipherable] when when he didnt want to give me a raise  and my husband  so I want to I have my husband has a friend from the same family  that they have a factory that makes [indecipherable].
I mean  my father was a soldier in the first World War.
On the other hand  I did know the family friends in Geneva who did a very nice competent job of kind of looking after me.
I just -- but most of the  my family  my father's family  are  like I said  they said to me  um  a French policeman - I didn't have any money to have a winter coat  and I didn't have a winter coat when I came back  and he got me material.
So they treated me very well and tr eated me like family.
We ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 shared a lot of things together.
Augusta after my mother  and Sophia after my aunt  its -- its a family name  and Sybilla after the princess of Coburg and Gotha who la -- later became queen -- crown prin cess of Sweden  and is Gustavs mother -- was Gustavs mother.
We found this wonderful family in Brussels who helped us  and they probably are not there today anymore.
That's all because they were quasi-recent immigrants having been displaced during World 2 War I and they came to this area after that but my father's family had lived there for many  many years so my mother's family was more scattered and the rest of her family was in different places.
And so I was born in under that period  but  you know  few years later  it the tragedy struck  and my mother  agai nst wi-wi advice of everybody; family and friends  and acquaintances well placed here and there  decided that she will run the business herself.
That's the first time that I really  since I was 7  the first time I met anyone from my blood family from my actual family.
tell you what get to that  but I What kind of family did he come from?
He said he was a deserter who left his French regimen and was going south to his family.
57 Tell me something  did you talk to George about your family hi story  and what had happened to your family during the Holocaust  and what had happened to you  from the time he was a child?
My dad had -- after the war  my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he remembered and he wrote to the Post Office in our town  looking for his family  looking for survivors.
So I ask him  is it possible you send me to a camp where my sister is  I dont have nobody from my family   just a sister.
So she is somewhere  and my sister and I with the rest of my aunt's family are hiding there  plus a number of neighbors that came into hide in the brick house.
And for how many ge nerations back were your wa s your family in this town?
And  yes  there was a Jewish community in Shanghai  of which there was an exhibit in this building  how they maintained their identity and eventually many of the Chinese came to the United States.
>> Bill Benson: Did you spend time with each other talking about what you went through ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 during the war?
I think we need to also mention that I was sponsored by a wonderfu l family that was supposed to be either second or third cousins of my dad's.
I was wondering if that affected you or your family of if you remember if this is right?
I said to her  ﬁWha -- did yo u have any family in my town?ﬂ She said  ﬁYes  I had an uncle by the name of Bookwhites.ﬂ A ve ry prominent family.
I was born November 30  1925  and I lived in Berlin until 1938  when my family escaped from Germany .
But Zhaglietskis   my mother  and some other family decided to get out of the sovkhoz called sovkhoz house and go  move towards a city  and Semipalatinsk was the city.
My mothers family had lived in Battenberg at least for two or three generations.
My mother was a very religious person; my father was not  but my mother was very religious.
They then borrowed the family then lent them a car  and Mother drove a little bit around New York state and nearby areas.
Or somebody in France help you [indecipherable] SL: No  no  da -- no  no da -- th-the -- the one there  from the Red Cross -- the man that came from the Red Cross  hes the one that asked if anybody has family in New York -- in America  period.
>> Bill Benson: When your family really learned what happened  that so many of your family members had perished.
So I dont know  I dont have another proof  but but thats brand new for me  and I told it the other family of mine  and two of them  two nephews  sons of my brother Mikey   they thought as far as they know  it could be possible.
It was like a family council and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a pharmacy.
Your family...you had a father and mother and a brother before the occupation and uh... There were uncles and aunts and grandparents... An extended family.... Sure.
There were six children  four brothers  two sisters  my father and my mother.
My grandmother and my grandfather  they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.
And he is the one who real... The Sassoon family was always famous for philantrophy.
They lived with a family that had a grocery store downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the country with  to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them.
So  when she went back to the -- when she went to that Polish family to get that girl  they refused to give her to her.
I was the only child in the family and I used to go to visit her from almost every Saturday and Sunday.
Tell us about your family and you in your life before you moved to Palestine.
And uh I guess I talked to her maybe once or twice more at another family function.
I have some non-family family there  in that my fathers second wife  my stepmother  who to this day lives strong and healthy at 93 in Philadelphia  has a niece -- two nieces  who are actually related only to her first husband.
And even and one Czech that I was  the first one  a whole family from my town  it was hiding in the stable there.
But where my family is concerned I suppose I'm lucky  having beautiful children  remarrying and with a nice husband.
And I know it that everybody was still home--my brothers  and whole family.
>> Ing e Katzenstein: Well  we had -- there were three ritual slaughterers in our family.
And he -- the entire family came from Nowy S acz  which was Galitsia.
And the Lubavitcha Rebbe thought before before the war it was a question that my family has to go to Australi So  the Lubavitcha Rebbe  in the first letter  where he good wishes for coming out from Russia and escaping Russia and this.
And then I have another cousin who lives in Chicago  and she was sent with the you youth youth organization to the States   cause we did have family in the States  so she was able to come on one of the fi rst immigration trips.
Now  when you were in hiding  would there be any visits from old friends  or members of the Jewish community  or would it be very much an isolated time for your whole family?
>> Bill Benson: And then  of course  10 months later  September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland  launching World War II.
My father figured out how many of his relatives in -- how many in his immediate family perished when the Germans came in to Yugoslavia and this happened in 1941  early April in 1941.
Jacques and his sister  who were in hiding with the family at that time  are circled.
Anyway  my grandfather and my father  my grandmother -- they all fled to Poland.
And they Xeroxed for me the file on my family  including the records of the number of pieces of underwear my mother had been allowed to take  and not take.
But anyhow  that the Germans was there  but downstairs was a big basement  and there were Jews hiding.
I still keep a little bit in touch w ith the last family.
>> Bill Benson: Kristallnacht or Night of the Broken Glass took place November 9 through 10  1939.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 >>Bill Benson: The one of you and your mother and brother.
Then the others -- there was a family of four in Holland  went on the boat the day Hitler walked in.
But I had lived in Vienna for most of my life.
For some reason  which I never knew  I was sitting in a living room  in our family living room with my grandparents  which was a room never used during the week.
I felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that I had three weeks of heaven  but I can't blame them.
But one day  when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my town was located  I wrote a letter from camp to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council  asking if USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 6 theres any information about my family.
The next day  in the morning  I say  ﬁoff.ﬂ I go to the town and I was in the family.
Yeah  first of all  as far as I am concerned  a lot of people  starting with my family  with my father and more my m-mother  were very much interested in my experience  in my Ah.
>> Bill Benson: At the time  did you have any idea where he went?
And I would like to challenge you to create more history in your own family.
He was very  you know  devoted and healthy  happy that Im alive  that somebodys alive from the family.
And a nephew of Lilly Grau told me that he remembered my father sitting in their family  together with Lilly  and Lilly was so dominant that my father was afraid of her.
Yes my parents family lived in the neighborhood of the Yodebrastaat.
And with a French Canadian family  they had a dairy farm.
And therefore  the third family  or the third family -- That you were staying with?
He repaired cars  and they were very blue-collar family  but they're very  very neat fa mily  very fine  fine people.
The war comes  and Jews are clearly segregated in some very significant way  what happens with that family and you?
Did you know your grandparents on either side of the family?
Tell me a little bit about your childhood and the town where you grew up.
>> Bill Benson: Al  did any other members of your extend ed family survive ?
But one of the children of that family did visit us in Massachusetts when I was in college.
I had asked you if your family had a long history there  but what I didnt ask you was if your father ever served in the German military.
I don't think we heard what  what kind of a store it... It's a liquor and wine s hop and very nicely built with the wooden shelves and carpeted and you know  it's... Did he have any special interest or any of his family ever have done anything like this before?
That was my grandmother's house and he was the only child of my grandmother's who stayed in the family home after he was married because he occupied my grandfather's medical office as a dentist.
We always spent all of the holidays there together  the whole family.
>> Edna Friedberg: I think it's always very striking  especially hearing your family story to think about when we look at historical c hrono logy  we think of this sort of inevitable plod.
If I'm making a deal  I will certainly insist that my family be part of that deal.
And tell me a little bit about your parents personalities  as you remember them  being a small child.
And...uh...after his death  I still kept working  kept our house  and it was only really after my family in America began saying  \ Look  why don't you come and join us?\
And even his closest family  according to his brother to whom we talked recently  he said nobody ever knew what happened to Yesh-e during the six or eight months that he was away.
One of her  the child of one of her uncles whom she had never mentioned before  ever cause she really didnt talk about her family very much.
I recall we sitting together  the whole family at the table  discussing what should we do.
And  if they'll catch me there  all they can do is kill me.
I will show you a picture of the whole family when I was a little boy.
Okay  so in my family  what happened is  I believe that early in this ballgame  the persecution of Jews was direct ed against my family as it was against others  and I will tell you why.
This family conn ected--the family that sent the telegram connected also us to a family in London  who had a representative in Sweden who wasn't Jewish.
And both your parents were -- were Jewish  and brought you up in -- practicing a sort of Orthodox Jewish faith.
But your mother never recounted to you why she -- why her family had left?
And then they lived in Vienna  though they still had families in Poland .
And another brother was incarcerated in Dachau for a number of months  but was released and managed to come to the United States with his family.
Well  the families  yeah  they had a lot of children  which is an interesting story.
Each Jewish family invites a Yeshivablocher  you know  when it was a holiday Shabvas  for -- you know  for after -- after the services to come -- come from -- from Shul to come to his place.
My cousin Georges family and mine had many  many similarities  and it could have Georges story could have been my story  and his you know.
Uh my youngest brother  her youngest...my youngest uncle  her youngest brother  immigrated in 1934 or '5 to Holland and he uh studied in Germany  so there's a lot of German in my family.
Did you interview members of their family or I dont know No.
We always run eagerly to see if anyone from our family had survived.
Here was my mother  my grandmother  and then my aunt and uncle.
Of course there wasn't much I could do there with uh my Master's in Russian studies  so I figured if you can't fight them you join them and I decided to go back to school and I got a Ph.D. in  with a focus on child development/family relationship and I have - we've been there for the last 21 years uh and I teach at the University part-time and and I do some counseling part-time and it's amazing because my whole focus on family relationships/child development has made me so aware of the horrendous impact of the war years and all the things that ideally should have happened after the war that didn't happen  how much pain could have been prevented if people had been more aware of the horrendous impact of - even the  let me compare...our experiences are nothing compared to concentration camp experiences.
Had your family had a long history in Czechoslovakia  in Salatven-vena  before you left?
I felt very much a part of the Madna family  and Willy  Dewie and Robbie were my brother and sisters.
And he also helped to bring us to the United States  his father  yeah.
I I I really I I I I myself have a very difficult relationship with my family  and thats one way I get through it is to to be funny about it  you know.
I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister  but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from Romania  came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in Romania.
They smuggled us out to Brussels and placed me with a Christian family.
We reached there because we had family in the United States.
I am the keeper of our family passports so I still have my -- my Nazi passport.
He got the false document and he was adopted by a family of farmers who had son of similar age who didnt return from war.
I mentioned that there were some friends of my family that were left off in Belgium  so they were refugees like us.
>> Bill Benson: So now you're forced out of your home and forced into a ghetto.
So  the three of us and we had another family  I wasn't looking for that.
Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 26 Tell me about the Madna family  a little bit of their background and the neighborhood that the house was in.
He was the one that brought most of the family  brought the other uncle  and everything.
>> Bill Benson: And as a result of that  you were eventually able to come to the United States.
The period that I felt is not going to get better and because my family  my parents did not think so.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
My was  it was  my parents were observi ng Jews  not the...not too much rich Jews  yes.
But anyway  Nechuma and her family  that had been hiding for years  at least for two  maybe even more than two  were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say  for a bottle of Vodka).
Lets go back to sort of your -- your family history again.
If you could describe your living situation did you have an apartment  did you have a house?
Why my parents didnt leave  I will never know  but they were not alone  I mean  there were possibly a hundred thousand Jews in-in -- in Germany  maybe even more  who stayed in Germany.
We found an apartment  which was an extremely important thing with the -- this Polish family: Czachor; his name was Jan  her name was Marja.
Of course  th is was with the agreement of the family we lived in.
I just...you know  it's a memory of what the seder was like  a memory of the fact that uh you were not with just family.
Roger Masteude  I was very close to him and his family for 25 years until he divorced and went west and his wife went west.
No  did you stay with the Harrison family the whole time?
So she found that in our extended family there are over 200 Me ndels that were deported.
He had baptized the oldest child  by the name of Many Babella  and he knew the family well.
So he says to me  such a smart man his name was Commandeer Plattin if nobody was in business in your family  now you will be the [indecipherable].
Her back -- background  her 69 family name was h -- Hirsch.
I felt not only I  the whole family  that short before the war  the antemitism got much more Strong?
Were your parents able to get anything out of Germany when when they left?
And when we were [indecipherable] we started to sing  and -- and then I went down  so I lay -- kneeled down on the ground  and I started to kiss the -- the -- the earth  and we started to cry  and -- and -- and it was -- the family was waiting for us  my wifes family  my brother was family and they took us home .
Tell us what happened to you and the rest of your family.
The -- the one family rebel another -- ‚nother family  and so he used to have all those bloodiest people  they killed themself  they -- they stabbed themself.
And then I sold my place and moved to be close to my family  all of whom are in Arlington or in Leesburg.
Then my aunt she was the aunt  my mother's sister  her kids  four of them.
Could you tell me  please  wh at happened to you and your family once the war began  once Romania and Germany started to lead their operations against the Soviet Union?
I-I-It was a natural I got married  we wanted to have a family.
I remember the big action  I can't remember all the details  I know that the family was all together  we were all in one group  we were on a tremendous field that had a couple of hundred  let me see about forty  fifty t housand people came out to the big action.
A My mother  my father  my sister  my little brother and myself.
My family -- I saw my father on that day  very early in the morning  and he said to me  ﬁIm going into the hiding with entire family.
And can you give me the name of your parents and your siblings?
You said you played with the one family I played with all the kids.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 152 And what about family?
So imagine a pharmacist  a Christian of Polish persuasion 4 had to be found  a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name the pharmacy was bought.
Well  Im living in -- in the -- with Maun family in -- in -- in Kosheetza  and I have to just mention a few things about them.
There were a lot of Jews in there  but not not necessarily Jewish.
Moving now to the right from the left - Ha nia Wilson holding little Daniel Corbin  the son of Barry and Ruth  and the brother of Jonathan  and that is the younger daughter of the Wilsons with her family.
And tell me a little bit about how you maintained contact with your foster family.
Before we turn to the horrors of the war and the Holocaust  tell us  first  about your parents and their lives and their community in the pre -war years  a little bit a bout them.
But different friends and different family members always wish me a happy birthday late or early.

Thats what ga thats what I wanted to get a sense of  of what was the not only the facts of pre-war life  of you know  the circumstances of your family  but also the atmosphere.
Oh  there was one time my mother worked for a while forthe first family treated her so badly she said she would not go to work for rich people again  she would go to work as a general housekeeper to a more middle class family  and she worked fo r a family where the wife was American.

And so there wasn't a nybody in my family  whether -- we were just Jewish  so that wasn't in qu estion  whether we had a grandf ather or whatever.
Tha-That was on my grandfathers side of the family  that he was in business with.
This is tape number three  side A  and you were going up to the Adirondacks with your family.

Well  we said to them  her mother  that we will bring her out to Israel.
So  I know that there was another family living in hiding with us  or at least on the same property  and maybe there were children  but I have no recollection of being with other children.
There was one of my grandfather s and two of his sons  two of my uncles.
Can you speak some about the role of faith in your family?
Its sitting in a place  you try to make a nice living  with nice family.

So were the three of you living together when you went back to Athens  or did you split up?

Is it -- Yes  I-I do  and I mean  I -- when I think about the complaints that I hear from various family and friends living in this country  about what they think are harrowing problems  and I think about what it was that my mother underwent  I mean  living in mortal fear of losing all three children.
Did you uh have any contact with your parents during this time?
The ghetto was in the area that my father lived in because my father lived in the Jewish community area where all the other Jews lived so I dont think they had to move but they did have other people moving in with them.

Like Sarah mentioned  I came from a family of nine children.
We had a nice size but we were a big family and  and I think we were pretty comfortable and thats all I can say.

Were you a close-knit family  or Yes  of course  I was the only one at home  so and my father  for example  as a when I was then  I dont know  eight or something  and [phone ringing] Okay  lets cut. [

And one of the families had said they would take me and the other family said theyd take my mother and her mother  my grandmother  who  remember I said  had been left behind in Germany  and came to live with us.

Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 39 Was your family kept together?
This is what I go  its nothing to do -- as far as Im concerned its nothing to do with religion  because I sit down and I think of my family and what happened to them  and of course my grandparents were very religious  so I owe them that  you know.
And did you see much of your fathers parents  as in those first years?
Families separating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the ceiling including some single individuals living in the middle of family and people  and so on  and children and so on.
I love them more maybe than anybody else loved their child because to me it means a little more to have a family than somebody who gets it easy  got it easy.

I wouldnt say that he was rich by any means  but the family was confortable.
But my husband  for instance  he was -- you know  he had a very  very bad experience with one of his friend in school  and he decide not to go to school for a while  and he ran away  ran away to Naples without telling his family.
In essence  those three people are the only ones in my family  my direct family...near family that were killed in concentration camps.
Uh in in in November '39  by the way  uh my wife and I had our child...a boy was was born and uh since we had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell that certainly at the beginning of the war  Jews were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or have radio  so I was not...was not was not able to communicate with them  so uh so uh uh that means very often  especially afte r an air raid and if it was a heavy air raid  I didn't know what happened to my family and my family didn't know what happened to me  and uh then in the summer of '41  there started what we called the fi nal solution.
Of course  after that incident  after we were told th at were going to be interned there  I realized that Im going to have to part from my family.

Each family had  was given by the Gestapo  a maximum amount of money it could spend per month and withdraw from the bank account.
There's my uncle -- my mother's brother and my father's brother.
The only German family I knew was a family that fled from Germany in 93 -- 33.
How did when you found out the war is over  what were your first thoughts  if you can remember.
In other words  when they took this action which they called the final solution in Berlin  they took a man from the uh  from these places where they were  where they were working  and then they went af ter the members of the family  and their different places  so that uh  uh  uh the families uh never saw each other again.
So  my father took the coat and said he was going to see his family in Vilna  and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and behind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink.

Why dont you tell me a little bit about your family life  what you remember because I know you were very young and how your parents lived their lives and what you and your sister were like.

People have no idea what it means to live without family  without parents  without brothers  sisters  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents.
And no doubt in order that this cause may mature  you may live a very dignified and religious also family.
World War II began  of course   in September 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland.
So  I 51 knew the family from my own– and I didnt know whats going to be  and when I met him  you know  when we came back  I was te rribly crying and he was crying  too.
And  again  everybody had big families   a lot of children.
Halina frequently travels to England to see her son and her sister and her family.
But I dont know if my family knew about the camps.
However  my brother and his family took me out to a steak house  they gave us steak for three people  you know?
So  you re with your family and youre returning to Amsterdam  and you described some  in the first interview  some of that– you were housed first in the DP camp in Leipzig?
Not too many  but there were a few family camps  yes.
When my daughter wa s married  I had no family at the wedding  obviously  so I really maintain my husband's family.
When they got to Kenya  although they were well to do  they had just enough when they came together with the little bit of money each family had and put a down payment on the farm.
So he was well-known all over the place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and friends by number one  contacting a fascist officer and Ive no idea how he did it  who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and  and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara George.
Before we begin  for the camera  could you pleas e tell us your name  when you were born and where you were born?
Will you say -- I -- It sounds as if your family had a long history in the town where you were born.
And every once in a while  she -- I remember she would take us kids up there to her family.
You mentioned several times th at your family was religious Very.
But very soon my my sist er very soon found a job with a family to take care of some children.
My parents  my father  he was religious  but not to the extreme.
Did you take anything special with you when you left your family to go to Palestine?
So your grandfather in Essen  would that be on your fathers side of the family?
And my mothers sister and family were already in the uni United States  so theyd send it you know  United States wasnt in a-at war with germ In the war yet.
Youre getting ready to leave  so lets talk about the actual leaving and saying goodbye to your parents and All right.
>> Bill Benson: During that time  during those war years that you were in Kenya  do you know if your family members  parents and other family members  adults  did they have any contact with the family that were still in Germany?
Everybody else in the family  including me  not anymore  including me  we ...we sang.
So  the third of September  from our family from village they came with the horse and how we call it this car -- with horse  and they took us from the village because everybody afraid that they will come  the bombs will come  and we wa nt to be hidden there so that we went to the village with our family with our family to be more surely there than in the city of Torran.
from the family  and -- and your parents state of mind because they were busy  was functioning and they were doing worthwhile projects and so forth?
So  she was the first victim in the family  so to say  and I have difficulties to kind of understand why a person who has done so much good for others has been taken away from us  and sh e was the first victim.
This of course was the th-the word at that point things became terribly oppressive  and as a as a as a youngster you you you you knew it  and you started you lived with it  and you that was that was the you Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 31knew you one wrong step might be dangerous to you or to your family and so on.
And I stayed a few months in that home  along with the other children.
Were you very conscious of it as you grew up in the late 20s  in the early 30s in terms of what was going on in Germany?
We had family waiting for us  whom I had never seen before.
We actually sh ared very intimate family secrets and all 6 sorts of things and all of a sudden from one da y to the next there was this barrier and he couldn't speak to us anymore.
And all business had been fur brokering and after the war and his family went back to New York  which is where I ended up.
My father had a very different kind of a face  but I look like my mother  my mothers family.
He should have said  could have said  might have said: let me live ; why don't you go upstairs and get the Jewish family.
My father took the whole family to that town of Abarro.
The house on the right side was the store as well as the family home.
And should make sure that innocent people s houldn't have to go through what me and my family and my friends went through because of one dictator who's name I don't want to even pronounce.
And I said to him  by the way  do you know that I was Jewish?
And -- and lo and behold  we meet one of my mothers cousins  but not the cousins that I mentioned before.
Did you think that you and your family s hould have moved to Warsaw  or you didnt?
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 11 A middle class family I consider my son middle class  but we never could afforded what he has here  never.
I mean  I think that the museum in Washington has a tremendous consciousness for the sufferings of others that a-are similar to or parallel to those that befell my mother and her family and my wifes father and his family.
And my grandfather  my father  on my fathers side  died when we were in Dergachi and my aunt and uncle.
And then she decided to go to go and join her own family  and they were in Zwatruf   and by her own family I mean her parents and her older sister and my uncle  meaning her brother  and his wife and three children.
Defiantly   my family continued to do kosher slaughtering i n very clandestine ways.
Let's talk a little bit about your leaving your family then.
Would you -- your own preferences  just going all -- along in life  with your family  whatever  is it some thing that you prefer not to dwell on?
>> Bill Benson: Jill  November 9  10  1938  Kristallnacht  the Night of the Broken Glass   tell us what happened that night  what happened to your family  whether or not you recall anything personally  what you know about it from other family members.
I come from a family  my parents  my father was a businessman  he was a cattle dealer  in the small community of Jacovce.
This is a family photo of Joseph Bussgang  and Stefania Bussgang  my father and mother with myself  Julian and with my mother and my sister Janina  or Ja nine.
And lucky to have -- and lucky to have a family member willing to help you with -- You mean the family?
And I remember that we went toge ther  it was a very good feeling and his parents were at home  thank God  and then I was living in the other part of the ghetto and we had to pass the Krikschu kaichu Street where the ghetto was very narrow and that was a little bit dangerous to walk there  so his parents were absolutely terr ified that he is going to see me off  but still he did it  and -- and I came back and I also found my family  but many people disappeared and after the Estonian aktion  I left the ghetto pretty soon.
It was shortly after that that your family packed up and left.
My fathers side of the family had a number of people who were who married non-Jews  and they were  I would say  completely non-observan t of any religion.
And then I came 1 The family Petschek --consisting of Otto Petschek  his brothers  and their families --became highly successful as bankers and industrialists under the Masaryk government.
We didnt know them but we knew the whole family .
And so we went and then we went -- the whole family and we went to that little town  that was Banatanya  beekitchock and finally we got -- we found f-family what one -- that we could rent a house from and was -- and we -- and -- was very -- and then it start very hard  but now we had to live and make a living for ourself.
What about your sense of--once yo u were reunited and af ter the war  was there any more sense of Jewishness in the family?
They did go on Rosh Hashanah  because the whole family went.
How -- please tell us about saying good-bye to your family.
And I g -- I grew up -- I know USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 64that sounds funny because of what had ha ppened to me  but I grew up privileged in many ways  you know  because I was sort of [speaks foreign language here] which means sort of like a -- from a noble family   you know.
I said  \ H ow selfish of them can they  don't they know that this is my family and I cannot leave them?\
I guess  to me  it was an adventure to go across the big ocean to the United States and to be independent and go on my -- be on my own  although I had to -- I was going to live with my fathers family.
We had also relatives in Germany  my mothers sister and children were there.
My father was from family where it was seven children  and -- four son and three daughters  and this town  land where he was born  Vol-Volbrum  in Poland  had to supply to the tsar of Russia  a soldier  forever.
Now  Im -- Im interested in LBJ very much  but Im also interested in the fact that he asked you how was your family.
I know absolutely nothing of the family history on my mothers side   except that she had two sisters and we were close to the sisters.
And and my mothers family were they were also farmers  from Mieleiıiai .
My name was Dorotka Goldstein  Goldstein really  and what I remember from my home  well  we have been a very nice Jewish family.
And she comes from a beautiful family and I regret very much that I didnt have an opportunity to get to know her family  and Im sure that if my mother would have known her  she would have loved her just as much.
I begged him  I have nobody from my family  one sister.
In my family  conversa tions about this took place willy -nilly and at the drop of a hat.
And everybody wanted to go find somebody  a sister  your brother  the father  the...maybe somebody survived from the family.
So tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
That was another aspect of -- of Jewish life in Poland.
After the war we found out and we found him in Buchenwald and he worked as a doctor there and thanks GOD the two sons survived and then he went {89} with his family to Switzerland because they opened.
And  y ou know  he has been probably the mystery person of the whole thing becau se he came from a welltodo family  and he was just like a 28 or nine year old architect  and Hitler took a liking to him  and eventually he headed up all the industry manufacturing groups  but he a lot of since  you know  the last 30  40 years  there have been several books on very critical of him that he should not have got in bed with Hitler.
I think that most of his family  the Lukow branch of the family  his mothers and brothers and sisters  well whatever  theres no t that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in Warsaw and presumably they were deported in 1942.
For example  my father sis this rule that you had to have 20 000 dollars for a family  or 10 000 for an individual  people that had it  th-they recycled this money.
It would be because as members of that family -- Yes. --
My parents were both raised in orthodox Jewish homes  my 3 mother in Germany and my father in in Holland  but uh my father rebelled very early uh against orthodox Judaism so altho...although I'm not quite sure - we kept the kosh...  my parents kept a kosher home but I'm not sure whether it was mostly for their uh sake as it was for my grandfather's sake who was raised and had lived all his live in an orthodox family.
I want to ask you now  what it was like for a young boy  14 years old I remember  to live with a foster family that he had never met before  and what was your adjustment learning E nglish  learning a new educational system  learning a new family.
The family on my father's side  they mostly conver ted before the war an d nobody  or almost nobody went to ghetto.
Tell me what was going on in your lif e  now in the 1950s  as you were having your family and -- and your -- your career was beginning.
Can you tell us a little bit about your history  where you were born  what in what family  in what town and so on.
They were over 70 years old ladies  and Mr. Varga who knew the family for 20 years went to an uncle or a brother of theirs  who was already under the protection of Wallenberg  he lived in a protected building  and told him that his three sisters are to be deported  and my great -uncle ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 called Wallenberg's office  and somebody went and picked them up and brought them out.
Do you remember  you being the oldest child in the family  about what was happening in Europe?
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if at that time if your mother and the other adults  did they begin to have a sense of the enormity of what had happened during the Holocaust  what had happened to Jews throughout Europe?
It was very hot and very sticky and I think we slept that night up on the on deck because it was already unbearably hot and you know  coming from Europe and we are not used to this climate and uh next day  the next day there were all kinds of little boats came from Havana with family.
Well  you know  in Berlin we really kept pr etty much to ourselves except  you know  getting together with our family.
And she stayed in Bristol with a family and helped take care of the children there  and they were very  very good to her  very nice.
>> Bill Benson: Within seven days of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland  within seven days they occupied your city of Lodz  unleashing the wars of the Holocaust for your family and the nearly almost a quarter million Jews who lived in Lodz.
Okay  we -- we lived in -- like in the von -- von alka madalan  and there were family that was all Girl Scouts.
So your family got around those rules as best they could.
And  had your parents come from families that were all originally from Germany ?
But what I know --you know so about mom  what you want to know more?
The money that he has possessed  that the family had  was not confiscated as far as you know.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 32 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: PT: This uh this is a  I can't  I can't see.
I kept the seven children alive  and the whole family alive.
We'll put it on tapethis photo that you're showing me of your family before the Kindertransport  it must have been very recent before the Kindertransport.
Well  I cannot sa y that tree of –  theological tree– Interviewer: The family tree?
My maiden name is Popower  P-O-P-O-W-E-R. And was your family originally from Germany or from someplace else?
After six months of hiding in a convent and growing Nazi suspicion  the Belgian underground relocated Josie to hide with the Debrackelaers  a Ch ristian family in Brussels.
A. The whole family because he was the household member and he was the one who would take care of the household family.
What happened to all of my relatives and friends  I have been very lucky.
And do you know anything about her side of th e family?
And over there we came and we came to a family .
She had family in Sarajevo and in some other cities  not such a close family.
We will do our very best to place you with a family  but we ask th at you be patient  because it may take us some time.
So you have the juxtaposition of a very happy family event and then just a few hundred miles away the increase  the rise  really  of the Nazi era.
We had  after all by then  the major part of our family here and one part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help us at all.
But the me s there was really only one family  the one down the block  the Wolf family  with whom we were friendly  our parents played cards together  and they had three children.
You could have saved your family and maybe us  but you asked Zigmund only to come and leave Ruzia and he r little boy alone and your family said Shiva and tore his garment and he wants you to know th at.
We went in a farm; we took two horses and a horse wagon.
This is the three of you  your mother  your brother and you.
And when they put my family  mother grandmother  the old people and my mother was holding the sisters hand so they put them in the shower and gas came out.
The roundups I did see because even from the place where I stayed... My family wasn't with me at the time.
She didn't have anything personally  she drove a -- so my little sister had a hard time because I don't know what kind of family she stayed with  but she was moved around a great deal from family to family.
I guess what Im trying to get a sense of is whether or not what was going in the outside world  affected the world with in the private world of the family?
Uh and so we felt that we never  we just never fitted in and as soon as we could we went back to Breda which was not until I think April of 1945  so for about four months we lived very tightly with our family but the best thing was that our family was back together.
An d so my sophomore year of college I went to Poland  and at that time you couldnt go as a Jewish group to Poland .
And someone survived in their families even  like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived  you know?
What do you recall of what happened when the Germans came in and being forced into the ghetto?
So we -- my family always lived in the same place.
>> Bill Benson: At some point soon after you were forced into the ghetto.
So when I met the people  and they was going to the Grodno ghetto to take out the family.
So  they had only eight children  so it was really bu-bu -- nothing  and he was very well off  because he u-understood a lot about antiques  and the whole family loved antique s  and had also -- many of them had the s-s-stores  antique stores  and dealed with antiques.
Do you have anything in there that you can-- My aunt found me a home with a family named Pool.
I know that my sister carried a little pouch on her with the name of our family in California and in New York.
I love doing these things because I always think of it as I am remembering my family whenever I am in this place.
According to my mother  apparently my building was hit in some part and there was a family that was killed in that apartment that was hit.
Because we tried to go to this country during seven years  and we never get a passport  you know  it was first time when we get the passport that she thought  ﬁI find the way that I will join you.ﬂ During the war  when you were in the AK  are you aware of whether other family members  particularly your brother  knew that you were in the AK?
And also  for the record  your father's full name and your mother's full name  including her maiden name.
Uh...Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood  your family when you were growing up?
Well  I I must say that my two granddaughters  lovely two granddaughters  they are very intelligent  and and they ever since they were small children  when I was talking about my experiences  lets say to to my son -in-laws family  he has a family in Minnesota   my son-in-law.
Of course  when we started -- when my father started to think about leaving and then when he decided to go -- that he would go to Palestine  he tried to convince many other members of our family to emigrate also because he felt it was getting more dangerous in Germany.
Here we have a group portrait of the Karpik family with an aunt  uncle and cousins taken shortly after German inv asion of France.
Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood or w as it mixed?
And my family and friends  Judee  Rachel  and Phil and Cookie for coming here  supporting me.
Did the fam when did her family go from Warsaw to France  do you know?
How did you present your family hist ory an-and -- and what happened to the Jews in Europe to your children?
Uh-huh  and -- and d-do they talk to you about your childhood frequently  or -- Well more so now than before  but it -- its not a big deal in our family  because its something they grew up with.
She tried to bring him to g -- to go to some office over there  I dont know about which one  to bring him to th -- to unite the family.
But they were all the Willner family - it was a close  closely-knit family who all lived in the Rhin eland of Germany  near Cologne-Dusseldorf.
So did -- no one had a car in your family -- No. --
Just like some people go to Auschwitz and step on the ground and say perhaps the bones and the ashes of my family are here  so Im here on hallowed ground.
Before we talk about your experience during the Holocaust and what you went through tell us  first  what you can about your family  yourself  your community in those years before Kristallnacht  before war was on the horizon and began.
But do you know what it mean s to lose your family in ten minutes?
What led to the decision to move you to their home?
My brother who was at that time in Krakau  and on the way to Warsaw because he hoped that there will be the least possibility that the Germans will get it  but then he saw that in...in 10 days  they were already close to Warsaw they changed their 3 routine and went to the Rumanian border and so we were reunited in Kolomier altogether the whole family once more except my father who was not anymore alive.
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother as people.
And of course  my parents were on my mind  and not only my parents  the rest of my family  too.
And I tell everybody the story that we lived in -- we had an apartment.
And  again  everybody had big families   a lot of children.
And they said ﬁoh we will miss you so much why are you go ing?ﬂ But we said ﬁbut we will be united with the family and we are going to be served better foodﬂ so we lined up.
My brother who was older than I  and myself and two cousins of us.
I had a cousin that use to be in Lublin  then she live in Warsaw.
And therefore  we decided to keep quiet  not to report him [indecipherable] the family.
And  thus  by the time she was 15  her mother was 65 and her father was 80  and that was a family of butchers.
Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 32 This was a non-Jewish family?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >> Bill Benson: And your entire family was in that boxcar with you.
S-So youre describing it almost a -- a kind of insular quality that at some point th-the city was Russian  then it was Polish  but you and your family were -- were simply always Jewish?
They -- somebody told us that if its no men in the family  they not going to send us to Siberia.
I was I had two rooms  then I had one room  I mean  and Did you live with another family?
So you came to the United States and you lived with a foster family.
And you were with your -- with your sister at the time?
Whatever you co-- whatever every member of any family could get  it was assembled together.
But all the others  my aunts and uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
So when my family decided to enter the ghetto  he promised that he could help me st ay out of the ghetto and he allowed me to stay over in his shop and sleep in his shop.
Well  anyhow  we were there for a while and she was very nice to us.
Was there talk in the family or what it were you mo re intellectually– I was conscious and I liked it  I liked the political life.
Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 4 And lets talk about your family.
We were not really religious  but we were a Jewish home  a Jewish kosher home.
She and her entire family were in Rivesaltes  because her parents had not acquired citizenship.
He was originally from Germany  the whole family is from Germany so this is what he was accused of  and I think on the basis of that he was jailed and sent to the camps.
Let's first  before we get to the war years and the Holocaust  tell us a little about you  your family  and your community before the war began.
Did you eagerly embrace Judaism again or did you -- My husband came from a Jewish family wher e he spoke only Jewish.
My brother and sister were placed with a Jewish family in Aachen.
You wouldn't know anything about his schooling  or an y of his family background?
What did you tell your sons about your parents and and your family?
Now  we knew there was a part of the family that immigrated to Palestine  now Israel  in the 1930s  1932  I think.
And two daughters  my -- each of -- we -- it was only single child in every family in our family.
And even though we accepted that we should not bring -- and we should not bring people -- well  you should not raise a family  that -- perhaps that was the expression  to have children  we wanted to get married.
And he used to like to fix things and my father liked to fix things  so that he fit in our family.
We survived  but 6 million people didn't  including my whole family what consists close to a hundred people.
Can you tell me your earliest memories  regardless of what they would be?
We realized that the family that we were -- to whom the house belonged were obviously very unhappy abou t the whole situation.
And can you tell us the full name of your mother and of your father?
Q. And could you tell us a little bit about what your life was like when you were growing up in Berlin with your family  frie nds  the climate  so forth?\\ A. Well  I come from a typical German Jewi sh family.
Yeah  then you went for his family  and then you started hiding  from one place to another  I see.
But relations were good  and in the same apartment  in the same  were an apartment for a family  a family of four or five.
Were you aware of what  the nature of what was happening to Jews in Europe?
And they said  ﬁDon't go there.ﬂ So I didn't go there  and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the Germans came  raided his house  killed all th e males in the family.
Yeah  and was that something that was -- meant a great deal to your parents  and their parents before them?
>> Bill Benson: At some point while you were there  your aunt  uncle  and their family which was part of the 13 decided to leave.
How did it come to be that you decided to leave and the rest of your family stayed?
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- your father was a remarkable man.
And  well  my father remarried after four years of being a widower and that was another traumatic experience for our family  because my step mother turned out to be a terrible person.
My father  thank God  they didn't bother him  the whole family.
Were you very close to your brother from the very beginning?
We always went on vacations and with the kids and we were always together.
O.K. The boys that worked the day shift unloaded my family.
I couldnt stay in the yeshiva and learn like I used to  because I couldnt I couldnt get used to it  not to see my mummy  my sisters  my a-all the family.
Would you tell me about your family and growing up in od?
Can you imagine when you have to have family  two families  10 - 12 or 15 people in the sled with the belongings and it takes about couple hours and you know  its freezing  you have a child -- you saw some women and children  you know  froze to death.
And I thought Im going to spend my life with them  theyre gir -- my family.
And she would invite me to spend weekends with her sometimes  and she had a huge family in London.
This is the first time I was really confronted with death; because throughout when I lived in my hometown  not...not one member of my family ever died or even went to a funeral.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 >> Bill Benson: With your sister.
Now  there was one thing  you cant go back and you cant bring your family.
And so I learned to walk very fast  and -- and then later in life it kind of turned around  I mean  my brother has some foot problems an-and other  you know   things  so he -- he no longer walks fast and so -- so now  you know  everybody else in the family usually says  ﬁCould you please slow down?ﬂ But -- But so we would walk to the library very often and because I was with him  he could take me into the adult section.
>> Bill Benson: Your family also  I believe  hid some things in the house.
And that is information about your bi rth  who were your parents  where were you born  did you have sibli ngs  what did your family do?
But my father  you know this large family  his mothers name was Wexler 5 before she was married to a Ro senberg.
I dont have any memory of the family  my grandfather and grandmother really being together.
Tell us about the family and what your life was like with them.
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
Thats why I -- sometim es I was asking  why me  when everybody  my family  my friend  everybody was killed around.
And it was not broadcast in my family that he's a Jew.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know  once you had shelter  how your aunt and your mother were able to start to make ends meet so you could at least eat?
I couldnt with my family I was cut off  I didnt know what happen there.
Here we see Margit's family at the Lido  a beach resort in Venice in 1926.
And they  you know  everybody they had details of where everybody was sent to  you know  like my family Jungfernhof   some Theresienstadt in this book  and I I have that at home with the pictures in it.
I've met some people here -- I just had breakfast with a gentleman who said he came from a poor family in Vienna.
Yeah  it was just one of those family obligations -- 30 That -- family  yeah  yeah. --
The Liebermann family settled in Ohio and Frank went on to graduate from Western Reserve  now Case Western Reserve University  in 1950 with a degree in chemistry.
There were quite a few Jewish families living in the building.
My father was on this train  and I dont know  you know  he you could visualize that he could have said to himself  oh  but my family is in Marseilles   why do I want to be on this train?
And then you can imagine both of us just couldnt couldnt Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28  2015 138 It wa and its its what one has heard before  that very often the trains would stop  and one of the family members would get out to get something  and then theyd be left behind.
She used to take -- I have some pictures from the family too because of her.
So maybe there was a little family resemble -- a non-family resemblance.
>> Bill Benson: Then you were able  finally   to make it to the United States.
At this particular time my father said  \ Well we are going to take the option of dispersing the family.
Could you let me know a little bit about the beginnings of your story; where you were born; who were your parents; what you know about them?
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
DiDid your family move around the city a lot  or did they sort of stay in their neighborhood  or -- No  no  we never moved.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 A lot of times  there was a supervisor working with me.
Organized life was pretty good  the Jewish community wa s pretty good and strong.
And there had been some talk in the family  apparently  of coming to America to join them.
But as far as family lif e  there was no such a thing as a family provider.
Report  information  However  the fact is that he did not come back because I had returned to the same city looking for maybe some family and there were none.
I was born on the West side of Chicago and my family gradually moved to the North side so that by the time I went to college  we were living in Wilmette  just North of the c ity of Chicago.
And so I went to his family and I told them who I was and they were very kind to me.
And they -- this girls were appro -- this girls and our boys played together  and th en we become very friendly with the Lazar USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 27 family  whose daughters were also the same age as Philip and Charlie  and this was really our extended family  and we used to visit one another on a weekend  and when Sofie had surgery  the girls stayed with us  and we loved it  and they we re so thankful for it  but it was really a privilege of ours.
Th eir lunch money was taken away and all of these things  so the area started to change and we de cided it was ti me to move on and at that point we had some friends who moved  who lived in a very beautiful area up in Rockland Coun ty  New City  to be specific and they ta lked us into going up there to look around and we fell in love with the area and we found a beautiful one family home there and so we made the move and again we were very happy there.
>> Bill Benson: What made you leave Israel and come to the United States?
My mother came from a more religious home than my father.
416] death camps which basically gassed all of the Jews of Poland and certainly the region he was living in because the section of Poland that both he and his family was in was the general gov ernment.
>> Bill Bens on: Nat  with the war over  your father returned and the family trying to re -establish yourselves  knowing that the government included many folks that had been the fascists and now communists  you would live under that environment for five years  until 1950  when you immigrated to Israel.
>> Bill Benson: Julie  at that time you did have a few family members living in the United States.
Lets talk a little bit about your family  your -- lets talk first about your father  who has one of those longest names that Ive ever heard in my life.
My parents  sisters  and brothers -- I mean  my mother had about seven siblings.
And uh to this country had managed to come before the uh 1941 that Uncle Benjamin  my fa ther's other brother Charles Kurz and his family who had fled and who had managed to a rrive in the United States via a stay in the south of France in Nice and eventually they came here.
And when we are gone  our whole big family is no more.
I was very good to them  I used to help my grandmother - we lived together.
But we do keep all holidays and we try to get together as a family at least once a year and that is on Passover  so that we are at one table with bot h sons.
And somebody answers from the authorities in the partisans that he went to  back to his family  to his parents.
And sometimes when I am even very conten t and happy and I have a lot of reasons sometimes to be happy beca use I did brought up a ne w family and a good family.
And was there any property that your family lost at that time or -- We didn't own the property.
>> Bill Benson: What did it mean to you to be liberated at that point?
When my mother said once  she saw the name   my name  Berliner on the list from people  and they lived not far from us  she said  you th ink that is family of yours?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 >> Dora Klayman: Yes.
How many of the Sawinski family were living in this cottage  this little cottage?
Do you think you would be a different person than you are today if you hadn't had to go through what you went through  being given to another family  living in Poland -- Most like -- yeah  probably I would be different if my -- yes. --
I was so lucky because individual people helped me and loved me and did things.
I find it so interesting that your family  even before the Holocaust  even before any awareness that there may be a Holocaust  was contributing to Israel.
>> Bill Benson: Did any of your family members that were in Germany survive?
And you wanted also to talk a little bit about your family.
And as I say  moth ers  I mean my fathers mother  because my mothers family had come  already come to this country.
And before our family couldnt financ ially help us because one of my cousins who used to be very wealthy lost all his mone y and the cousin who paid for our tr ip to America .
With our house in that free standing hous e and I recall there were maybe three rooms perhaps and there was another family that move d in with us.
There was music  there was 56 intelligent conversation  which I didnt have with my war family  which they sensed.
She was also going and buying produce for the family  for the whole family  vegetables because they did not want to arouse suspicion in the local store.
But still   from my grandmother  she had another sister and she went to Israel.
And -- And  again  how that was -- I mean  that was my uncle and aunt had made those arrangements to -- with her family.
The thing I feel bad about are the fact that my children have never had a family  that theyve never had grandparents  you know.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 6 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: or got killed  we sort of gave a name to every group of people disappeared.
And she started researching the Schafler family  and she sent me -- she would keep me posted  and she would send me all kinds of stuff about it  and she'd send me -- she'd send me like a matrix outlining who went where and who did what.
Before that  my brother is the one who went first to Palestine and then brought over my two sisters.
After all I was a visito r. And by a visitor I mean visite d family and loved ones and was loved in return so maybe we were shielded  although I dont think so.
So  it was nice to know that I had family -- its the lizard.
I  my mother  my younger brother decided to go back home.
Every Jewish  German Jewish family who wanted to go to America needed to have a sponsor.
My family  first of all parents  was Jakub Rozen was my father  mother was Golda.
I think my father– I mean my mother basically grew up in a small  country town and was Jewish  but had many more associations with non-Jewish people.
Because she she before the war  she traveled a lot  she was very probably a fairly rich family  so she was thinking she is going for a ride.
One of them had told me that his family lived in Montevideo  that I was welcome.
And um me and my two sons  who survived um concentration camp... Um  I have family in um New York  and um they are making papers for me to go to America.ﬂ Well  this lady wouldn't give up; and she kept asking questions to him.
And I was brought up that it was my job as much  to help with the family.
And  it still seems to me a rather unfortunate attitude if it did stop anybody coming over because they couldn't get into a Jewish family.
So it sounds like your -- your family was pretty well off.
And a you were you close to your cousins  and aunts and uncles?
We had -- I had very close Jewish and non-Jewish friends  and I was very fortunate enough to have the non-Jewish friends because some of them were really lovely children with whom I enjoyed being together.
And we -- we left Ebensee and Bad Ischl and stayed my mothers -- stayed -- I stayed with my mother for a few days in a town called Bad Nauheim in Germany and then from there went to Rotterdam and met up with the Madna family and the Ravensbergan family from Rijnsburg and some other friends of my mother  close friends of my mother from The Hague  and who saw us off on the Ryndam and we left for the United States.
That's one of those other memories of being with the Madna family.
And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go to see his family.
And  you know  when you try to separate a family  it's very difficult.
But that but whatever they knew did not get filtered to your family  or to the population  is is that correct?
I was the youngest in a family of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most of the time.
In our society -- like I told you  I came from a family of nine.
It sounds as if you had a very artistic family  is that right?
Vovek was a few years younger and because of the problem within the family Vovek came to live with us for a couple of years in Katowice  when we moved there  in about 1930.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 >> Bill Benson: Where were you then taken?
Aside from himself and his brother  was there anybody else from your family who survived?
So I  a nd it's not  they are still not what you would call a truly middle class family  that most of them still stayed in  you know  auto mechanics and this and that  that part.
I came from a middle class family  nothing very fancy  but these people  the man was working for the railroad  he repaired railroad cars.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 >>Bill Benson: Let me turn to that  just a couple of questions.
Before we knew all the stuff that was going to happen  but his family eventually  of course  totally abandoned this and they were very  very good and had many Jewish friends.
in eastern Baltimore  and this  was it simply a a conscientious decision on the part of your family and your family al one  or did you feel certain pressures from assimilation?
Because according to the German law  my father was considered Jewish.
No  he left because he want to go back to his family and that was the deal with him before he drove us  that he would be able to go back and he was supposed to take the car back to the provincial governor  who wanted it  and so my uncle and aunt had passports  and had visas  so they were able to cross earlier  and we crossed later.
He and his wife and the whole family of his wife was killed in Lipovets; and one of the brother with my grand-dad  her brothers  was killed and his son  his wife  three daughters; very many people died  were killed in Vakhnovka.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 That left my mother and her two children to take care of everything that had to be done  to leave a home and move somewhere else.
Yeah  the Olst family  they also were when the Germans came in  we were living with them for a couple of weeks.
Tell us about the circumstances for your family and for you in those earlier years of the war.
For -- people that really went through bad times  the people that were killed  that saw their family killed  that were in horrible concentration camps  that we re tortured.
Particularly my parents  we were this kind of family  close 44 family  always passin g the food to the next one  were not hungry.
My mother was a very religious person; my father was not  but my mother was very religious.
Hermann– they were  all of that family was killed  the one in Rotterdam.
And they were from a family of learners and rabbis  and -- very  you know  in the Jewish religion very important.
But you and your family did not go to Germany  did you  you went to France.
First of all  I can't remember them right now  one of them was Count   who was an aristocrat of a very old Belgian family who was a pastor of a church in Brussels.
Or maybe when this was done  maybe there's just indication of Jews.
We had also relatives in Germany  my mothers sister and children were there.
So he left me with hi s sister and thats the family the Mann family and lived with them for a good number of years.
What frightens me the most during those two years  and what I feel guilty about (coughing)...I never thought about my family.
My father was making shoes  and thats what the whole family did.
Did you have any conversations with your parents durig this ?
>> Bill Benson: Sylvia  before you went into the ghetto  if I understand correctly  the family went to Warsaw.
So you didnt have any other family memb ers in the town where you were growing up?
2 unreliable (Russian) 3 Yes  with the family and I'll describe you the house we lived in the ghetto.
One family l ore is the day before the wedding she went to make her hair pretty for the wedding forgetting that there is a Jewish custom that on the day of the wedding  the bride goes to the ritual bath where she has to be immersed into water completely.
But then I was born  my mother died  and my sister had to take care of the rest of the family and play the role of mother.
There was one of my grandfather s and two of his sons  two of my uncles.
And I lived in the house of a lovely Quaker family  where my friend Etta also had a room.
Meanwhile you probably didnt know what happene d to the rest of your family  who survived and who didnt?
Lets go back to talk about some of your other family members.
You lost her in a very personal way  as a family  as a mother  and then you lost her because there was the Holocaust.
And so they came back and they hadn't gone through the rest of it and they were much better off financially because the father hadn't been in concentration camp and they didn't have to take in the entire family  they just took in my mother's friend's mother and so  they moved to a very nice place with hot water and a bathtub and I was extremely jealous.
There was a family by the name Yovanos who lived in Agrinion   but had come to the village for the summer  and they stayed on because of the the war situation.
There were like many ye men in that fam family  but So they came from a farming family  but they became professionals?
I was not I was not a great asset to the family  lets put it this way.
Do you remember anything about this family that you were with?
When my grandmothers passed away  the rest of the family got killed in the war.
Everybody was in the same situation  everybody lost everybody  [EMOTIONAL] the whole family  so it was very important the comradeship to us.
If anyone in the family couldnt make a living  he could open a leather business and get credit.
Ok so you got the visas for Yugoslavia  for the whole family.
My father had one brother  and my mother had oh  three sisters.
Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 52 And looking at my mother.
Even now  when I am going  having my...in my house or now my daughter takes over  the family getting together  starting from Thanksgiving and the Jewish holidays and uh so you know  and whenever I see the table  naturally new hou...new faces because they got married  new children  which makes me happy  and I still see the faces when I was a child.
Okay  I was born in Regensburg   Germany  which is up the Danube from Straubing  where my family lived  probably be cause they had better medical care there than in Straubing  so it happened there.
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Interestingly enough  uh my family story has a happier ending than some of the previous stories that I told you.
I recall when we were looking at the photographs  that you men tioned other family members who were involved in various patriotic efforts; either when Pola nd was just becoming independent.
Did -- was that something important to you or your family?
But there was a time where it was still difficult to work on those wages because I had to pay the $25 to that family of Kohn and I didn't want to be behind and I didn't have any extra money for myself.
And you were communicating with your parents back in Germany .
29 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: You were in a school  but it sounds also  as operating more or less like an orphanage at that point?
>> Bill Benson: So when the war was no longer the Phoney War  it was the real war for you  your parents and family fled Paris.
Very fine doctor and a nice family  they had one daughter.
Of course  the family th at hid us was in danger by hiding us.
Could you please tell us when were you born and where?
Yeah  my father was extremely religious  due to the fact that my grandfather was religious.
And  you know  when they see the pictures  they see us all  the whole family on the bicycles.
This is tape one  side B. Okay  contin ue to tell me about the family you were living with.
This is the family picture of the three sisters with their husbands taken in Pennsylvania in 1990.
We all went with that family that -- where I hated the two boys.
>> Bill Benson: So here's you and your brother now are with your aunt and uncle.
And that  you know  everybody in the family would be able to speak Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 38 Yeah.
Soon after the invasion  Estelle and her family were forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto.
They realize  they already lost pro-probably all the family  they were all abou--on their own  and they organize  and they devastated the German in the first uh mo--few months of their ex istence.
Tell us what life was like in the ghetto and how you felt about  you know  how many people you lived with and what you might have been worried about.
Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you?
Maybe my family would  but we were not natives of that part icular place  so I can't weight it  but if you can put it in those terms  there we re certain advantages of being alone if you found helping hands from other people.
And thats where I found that family living in it. ‚
My -- my cousin in London -- Im not going to give anything away  but as I didnt -- didnt know there is an ending to this USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 36 that -- that is a very interesting ending  pertaining to my cousin in London -- never told her kids anything about her family.
>> Bill Benson: Peter  how large of an extended family did you have?
I think that -- that Judaism will survive under all circumstances and I certainly  in my family will make sure that it does  and make it as palatable and as ag -- as agreeable to my family as I can.
You try to adjust and form a new family  you had to belong.
And then my father the same way and thats all from my family.
And there were -- I suspect from the same family -- From Bosnia?
Again  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 some other people were living in there.
Was your family treated differently from the others or was everybody from there sent from Nitra to Sered?
We werent allowed to roam Switzerland at will  so here was my -- my petition was denied  but then after awhile -- this was in February  or say March  then in April  at Paisa -- Passover time  they allowed me to join the Munck family for Paisa.
The family saga says Ive been there  but I dont remember that.
Now  were your grandparents and your other relatives with you in the ghetto?
Oh I met her  I had  I quartered in a fam ily in an English family.
So how did your mom and family make arrangements for you to leave Germany?
But my parents decided  like many other families  that as a form of insurance so that if one person was taken in the family and was killed at least the others might survive that we ought to split up.
It was fairly clean and again you formed groups with most of the people you came from Studthoff so you were already had a family.
And we lived two to three families in a two room apartment.
There were a family there with two boys and later on a single young man whom they had f ound in the church [indecipherable] the story was and he wanted to cross over into Switzerland.
And on Thursday we got a corned beef sandwich  a loaf of bread  and that was the family dinner.
Early in the war you and your family lived under occupation.
And Mother was living in that area  before they moved into Warsaw .
Tell us what you can about the circumstances for your family once the war began in 1939 and then your father being sent to a labor battalion.
That was very  very sad that my own family didn't gather around and pulled out as much as  as many as they could.
If she says Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 64because I wanted not that I wanted to get their permission to marry her  I just wanted they should give me you know  to say look  I dont want to divide the family.
So we did all our  whatever work we  whatever little business  whatever to sustain our family  my older brother  myself and my younger two brothers  we did our dealings  and it was till maybe October or November when the first snow came on the on the   not only the snow on Ka...on our street - it's snowing all in Krakow  maybe in Warsaw too  but the first snowstorm - they closed off the streets and they start going door to door  only to Jewish families in their apartments and it couldn't go 4 through my mind - there were calling us Jews with lice  Juden   dirty Jews.
I made it known to my family in Switzerland that I would like to leave.
And we had relatives who survived the war in Holland  who were in hiding during the war  in the broadest [indecipherable] were kind of somewhat distant  but in the context of the time they very close to my family  partly theyre -- they were raised in the old country  very close in the same courtyard  effectively  so they were like very close cousins  brother  sister type relationship.
We were breaking tombstones from Jewish cemeteries of rocks for family.
It was just for us  for me  wonderful being with family again.
Can you tell me briefly about what happened to the rest of your family  ... Yeah. ...
They lived in all parts of Budapest  but my immediate family moved to Budapest in the latter third of the century.
So it sounds like you had a a real ly rather small family  all told.
I mean  they they suffered  but it was so common  every family would lose somebody.
My grandparents  maternal grandparents lived with us  my mom's mom and dad.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
And I was like the third child in the family  sort of.
And extended family  did you have an extended family living in the same town?
I have an album here  of course you cant see it on tape  that a distant relative in Holland made for us where its a genealogical tracing of the fa mily and in it we have listings of people and under the listing where it says when they died  where they died we have  well here it says Holocaust to say that he perished -- Judah Zomerplak some of my mothers family.
Lets talk about the family of your -- the other grandparents  from -- from your fathers side.
And we had a couple of hours walk to get out of town to a certain farm of a woman that our family knew  had done some business with her.
Could you tell us a few words about the background of your family and about your childhood?
And thats -- we are as close to each other as a family could be.
And he survived with the family  with [indecipherable] with kids  small kids.
What was devastating for my parents was that the Russians came in the year before the Germans  to Latvia.
because in the camp which I was living  and pu-publishing this little bulletin  was family named Grabowska from Poznan   but they were kicked out in 1939 to Warsaw   so they after the Warsaw uprising  they were in Germany .
I felt I -- I -- I was guilty that I was liberated and the rest of the family not -- nobody survived.
And she was happy that I did that for her  and I was happy to have her.
As a matter of fact  I have one surviving first cousin who lives in Givatayim in Israel.
Your family all went togeth er except for . . .
>> Bill Benson: So the agreement when the Germans occupied came into France and occupied Paris  they left the southern part of the state to the Vichy collaborationist government.
They were at the age of marriage and they wanted to have some kind of a family life.
I want you to tell me a little about what you were  your family knew about Hitler or Naziism before Belgium ?
R: -- from the family  and Luta with her children will come.
The Slotkins  what -- what was the -- that family like?
And when did they realize the extent of losses in your own extended family?
What sort of long term impact di d these early experiences have on you  on the -- on the way you've lived your life  on your general outlook or the way you've raised your kids?
We were traveling five people  my father  myself  my two brothers and my sister.
What did happen to your parents  and how did you learn about it?
And theyd be assuming that you were a well to do family  and might be the very place to have food.
I'm the only one in the family that is like that  rebellion.
Now  did you have any correspon dence with your family back in Poland?
By this point  was the rest of the family still not believing the danger that was going on?
So some of them had friends or family in Canada  and so on.
Still -- And  in addition to that  a fair number of kids' family lived on a farm.
However  his mother was quite religious and his father  I remember him saying or at least my grandmother who lived with us that he studied Torah in the back room and I guess they had some kind of store And my mothers family was also secular.
And besides this reason was my mother was  I feel  during my sitting in concen tration camp  each evening I prayed to the God  if somebody must die  better me because I am al one  not my mother  not my sisters  not my father because my father has obligations to family   my mother obligation to sisters.
I did know but -- Again  what were your thoughts about leaving Europe?
Did you have any friends or family that went on the voyage with you?
My family had  for the most part  had the good fortune  or perhaps the bad fortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist draft notices  and fled to the New World at the beginning of this century.
And I remember  say in our family  was a special farmer which come every day  before the war  every day they bring the milk in front of our door  some meat sometimes  fruits  vegetables  so was some relationship.
Well  they -- I had to wait for my turn for the visa to -- to this family.
He came from a family that somehow seemed to not be in very good physical shape.
We only knew since we came originally from Germany that practically all the people who had liv ed in Germany  Jewish people  were not there anymore.
My fam -- my immediate family consisted of my father  my mother  my paternal grandmother and my brother  whos 13 months younger than I am.
Cause I wanted to have a large family  cause we were nine children.
Otherwise everything was  whatever they used to say  it was dinner Shabbos  we have to be by the table  the whole family.
Because when some new family moved in  the first question you ask them  \ Can you play football or baseball or basketball?\  [
As I said  my mother was able to travel  go to Israel  see her family.
And she lived there with the family ‚till June 1941  was established a ghetto in our town  so she was taken with the family to that ghetto.
And did your father have siblings  did your fa -- Yeah.
When he catched up with me  he said  \ You know  ...\  Um  the nurse came in and said that there's somebody from my family here.
I have grandchildren  grea t grandchild   build up a family.
And Ive been in touch with him and their family a lot.
Interview with Yehuda Adam 4 I was born in a very middle class Jewish family.
Single people  most of the time  unless you had family maybe  and if So they were not making it so easy for you  but how did you feel not to get to Palestine?
03:36:00 And so I knew where they were and then I f ound my family.
So very soon the family had to depend on selling whatever possessions we had  including my stamp collection and handy work that my mother could organize  which she did extremely well.
My mother  that was a big family because there were ten children in the family and she was the youngest.
And  indeed  we went back  my family and I  to meet the people who saved my life.
>> Bill Benson: What happened to your family when Eichmann arrived?
Can you tell us how that event  Kristallnacht  affected your family in 1938?
At that point  did you know what had happened to your family?
This business that you'd had in the family for a century.
My father was Catholic  but my mother was Jewish  and it was not something that I fully understood.
And she was the only member of my family who was over 5'6  you know.
Our family had a maid  a cook  a chauffeur and a governess.
As a matter of fact  uh I would say that uh most of uh my friends were Jewish.
I was if I wasnt home  I was there  and they sort of regarded me as as a family member.
They were very courageous people to do that  and they were great human beings to be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk  yes  because if anybody was found to be sheltering Jews  could be shot  he and his family.
Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews.
He said that night was the night that his family was destroyed  and he survived  he went to Israel  the Soviets finally let him go  originally th ey didn't want to let him go because he was such a decorated soldier  but he got to Israel.
Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23  2014 32 Did your parents know what was happening to the Jews in the 1940s in Europe?
Well  wh en you are a large family  that's how things go.
So so  your fathers grandfather  what kind of family did he come from?
O K. Then we lived like this in the ghetto and then later I was taken away from the ghetto.
Can you tell me a little bit about their backgrounds  what kind of family your mother came from  and your father came from?
You've seen all over the Western world the break-up of the family pattern  and uh a crisis situation like this of course works the other  the opposite way.
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?
Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood or were there was it mixed?
In '49 I started in a family company and uh stayed there - was uh general manager very soon and started my own company in '81.
If you work as a militiaman  you can keep your family a little longer in the ghetto.
So the kids of the family  did they help in the milling business of your father?
We st ayed pretty active  but like a lot of other kids who are in the South in high school  after that fourteen  fifteen year old  you sort of– youre there Friday nights  but teenagers  unless they have a real tie to  unless youre in a Conservative or an Orthodox family that is very traditional  which you get away from the Sunday school.
It partly was my mind to br eak away from the family  because if the only chance I have is to survive is not to stay together.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 40 It was very special  my grandmother wa s actually  whom we had seen a few years before that  my grandmother was living in Is rael with her son  my mother's brother and his family  in Tel Aviv.
And in this -- and then there wasnt -- they didnt make enough money or anything  it was somehow or other  some body in the family advised that my mother should go with -- they should go to work as a couple for a year and put some money away.
Okay  my next child in my family is my sist er who is still alive  she lives in Jerusalem.
And they were very good to my parents - helping out and working hard that we should have everything.
>> Bill Benson: What about the rest of your family in Germany?
>> Bill Benson: It wouldn't be long before all the Jews in Warsaw that hadn't fled  which was ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 the vast majority that hadn't  including your family  would be forced into what would become known as the Warsaw Ghetto.
So now Germany invades Poland in September 1939  what are your memories of that?
We  on the other hand  his family  was supposed to be also taken to Siberia like that.
He cared  he provided for the family  he did things with the family.
And he was a great family man  and he was the one who got false papers to thes e people.
Yes  I do  and I have pictures of her  and the you know  of the whole family.
And thats how the family came to be in Hannover .
That couldn't have been an easy task either and knowing that his family.... And what did he end up doing in the United States?
About Kristallnacht itself  other than hearing it  and of course my parents just speechless with the news that was coming in  I still see us sitting around the radio  the whole family and really despairing.
I was very  very excited  and I didnt know I had the same feeling she had  that we were afraid  because everybody  her parents and my aunt and the rest of the family said  who knows where theyre taking you?
I just want to say that your family name was Loki ec.
And from then on  the gates of the barr acks were open  and when you finished your job  your work  your assigned work  you could go with that family and move around without being accompanied or guarded.
We were liberated in April by the 11 th Armored Division and of course  then I realized what happened to the other members of my family.
Our extended family was quite large  and our house  especially while my grandparents was alive on my fathers side was the center of that life.

In my family here  in -- in [indeciphera ble] amongst my peers now  there is hardly a grandparent who doesnt have a non-Jewish grandchild.
When was t he first time that you saw the other members of the family that survived like Uncle Willie and other people who survived?

And and then the childr we were separated  you know  the classes were separated  and stayed with that family until we th-they bought a hostel  a they called it a hostel  a big house  with the girls and the boys  one for the girls and boys.

>> Bill Benson: Marcel  your family decides to go to Vichy.

So even after the anschluss in spring of 38  your -- your extended family did not make an effort to leave  it was only after Kristallnacht?
>> Bill Benson: That brings us  then   to that terrible night in November 9 through 10  1938   that we call Kristallnacht or Night of Broken Glass.
What was the end of the war like for you and your family?
Alth -- I -- I knew -- you see  I -- I had family here.
Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at school  and my parents and thei r friends  the family uh Meyer  Dr. Meyer and his wife and three chil dren  and my parents tr ying to find a place to go.
Star ted off a very famous family  a Count  Franz Josef   he came from a very well known Austrian family  the Bar on .
When I was still a little girl like this or a year older when the first short wave radios came into being and Grandma was very sick  so the family bought her a little radio and on that night when she was really sick they said that was the daughter  is going to play the Greek piano concerto.
Do you know any stories your family had about that day?
My family  my parents and I  I was the only child were consider ed Jewish even though we did not practice the religion  and know I had my grandparents and I am told  my great-grandparents.
When I say we  I was very brazen  I must confess  and I established a precedent case showing how this man I wont give you his name  he lives in the States today how this man had lost family  had lost his home  had come back  had no where to live  was being housed by the American voluntary agency  and essentially he was still a displaced person  and we won the case.
He and his family had to be involved because we had to be fed aside from the fact that he knew about the place.
When we go out after the -- the 19th of April I saw there's nobody there from our family and then I was coming from concentration camp.
She was wonderful  and we -- we lo ved her  she was such a -- she like family member in our house  in their house.
Well  actually it was a year that they -- well no  it wasnt a year  because they had listed him as missing in action and his pap -- picture was in the paper and a l -- his -- his family had given this little blurb that -- you know  hed just gotten married  etcetera.
It was a next door neighbor  and but there were other people because I think the next door neighbor had there was a death in the family.
But still   from my grandmother  she had another sister and she went to Israel.
If I come to Israel  and Israel was a lot like my brother from my home town  what that lived over there  so they knowed me  and they knowed the family.
And of course  I was notified that this is it  that we would be going to Israel and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case  boarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members  the ones who were in my group  and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border.
And he didnt get married because he was supporting the family and he wanted the girls to get married and probabl y– but he was never married.
I found out in the I was with a family in Kreuzlingen  which is the s the Swiss part of the I was af with family there.
There's just the four of survived  you know  from the whole big family.
And then when did you learn about what happened to your sister and your mother?
And I lived with a Jewish family until my mother came to the United States.
And here's my mother and myself and two little cousins and this is some of their family.
My father also worked on bringing over as many people as he could of the family.
I had some family in Israel from before the war  and Rose had a larger family  two uncles  and she of course went with us.
First   when you left the ghetto in Radom to go to Pionki to your sister Hanka  that was the last time you saw your family.
As a matter of fact  when I -- when I got the book from the Ga itling family about the history of the 12 th infantry regiment  I sent it to Rommel with the remark  if he reads this hes going to know why his father could never win against the Americans.
And my boyfriend talked me in that I have to go  and -- and my family.
Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 117 Yeah  you see  you know.
And  had your parents come from families that were all originally from Germany ?
Very small  but And so  you dont have a memory of aunts and uncles coming through  and and sort of being there for family celebrations  or things like that?
In other words  I sign up -- my family would depend upon me.
So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help the family.
As a matter of fact  my family didnt know about it.
And most of his family was there and some of his friends were there and we were there.
She was quite happy living with her parents and I was quite happy living with my mother  so it's ok.
Because I had to dig up things and realize that Im here now to tell a story and I cannot let the past be overwhelming me with these emotions when Ive got -- Ive got a family now and I got a life now and lets face it by attrition and by the passing of time.
And I can see that the help is in the form of the letters that I receive from people who listen to me  and in the next generation  my daughter and my granddaughter  who are perpetuating my dream of good life and education and -- and being close to the family.
This is why I can sit with you and I can talk and tell you my life  where I just dont get to do that -- my husband or anybody else in the family.
I thought if -- if -- he also -- I think he had a hard time taking me to see his family.
Many families together and at least we got -- yes we got one room and a half of a kitchen together with a family of three men.
He was born  I believe sometime early 1900s  I dont remember exactly So did did you learn about his story and his family  and all of Yes.
And then with all our belongings  which were nothing  and then my aunt had sen asked the son of the family that she worked for it was actually a tavern there that she worked for  for that family in the kitchen.
And some were marched by foot for 80 -- you know  from -- especially from the Narefkar  the city and we had to take in a family from there and they marched them.
This was these were family councils going on among the members of the families dining rooms or another.
I was never really after I came to the United States   I was no longer German  you know  I was Did you and your family become citizens during  or after the war?
I met one guy and he was a son of one of our landlords and he knew my family very well.
Okay  now tell us -- lets spend a couple of minutes talking about your fathers parents.
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 6 So it was she was a-and came from a landed gentry family.
Finally  he appr oached a young woman  and asked her if she knew about Eddinger family.
Why don't we begin with you telling us about your early years  those years before Kristallnacht  those years before the war  about your family  your community  your own life in those early years.
And so one day they were sent to -- to Krakow to a -- to a member of the family  and my mother  at age 10 or so  had to work for that family  although she lived with them.
When did things begin to change --for your family  in particular?
Summers we would go to summer vacations  to the Balaton [a resort area and lake in western Hungary  55 miles southwest of Budapest]; and in...it was an industrious family.
Well  a man came came to the door  to the house door  and told my parents we had to come to the police  all three of us.
Well I think he was there with his family after the war  trying to go through the various Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 4 June 11  2013 battlegrounds in France.
Well  I was very lucky to be born in a wonderful family  in a wealthy family.
I didnt tell it to my family  she didnt tell it to her family.
No  I learned first of all  I told you that my parents spoke Russian  and I had But only when they didnt want you to understand.
This was a family festival  and we had -- we had no family left.
It was a family home  you know  and our grandmother had lived with us.
This is how we found out what had happened to millions of others  to the children that we were separated from  to our parents  to the rest of our family  by just -- they would just raise their hand and they would tell us to look at the smoke.
But w e had a room together  a furnished room and a family.
Were your parents glad that you came to the ghetto to be with them?
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
And she gave her this buckle that belonged to the Altarac family.
My parents hand him to -- to the family  to stay w ith them.
As a peasant it was much better for me  but eventually this come out  I mean they find out my Jewish cousins  oh blah  blah  so I had to tell the truth  that I am Jewish and I was not killed  I don't know why  but it really was at times very difficult with the Communism  I had a very bad influence at home because my cousin wa s not Communist  her husband was  she was not and neither were my peasants  Rorat  so I had that influence at home and hear the propaganda at school  so I really  I had problems with that and then since I was the best student  I of course had to be in the forefront of the organization and everything and they ask me to report on other kids from the class  to re port if they have family in America or maybe or so  oh I have to also hide that I had sister in America so that .
And my mother star ted to cry and I thought you know that shes just upset because she left her family there.
So did you speak Russian all through your childhood  as well as Yiddish and Hebrew?
>> Bill Benson: In September 1939  of course  all that would change when Germany invaded Poland from the west.
>> Bill Benson: During that time didn't some of your family members leave Hungary and emigrate elsewhere du ring that time?
So your immediate family seemed to get aw -- have gotten out of Vienna early.
She was obviously with the rest of your family  that you remember about her that sticks out in your mind from those years  from 33 on?
And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we were alienated from our larger family circle because of my fathers change.
Not that we were mistreated or anything but every family got one room.
At that point  after you were there almost a week  did you know what had happened to the rest of your family?
And she was very good to me  and to my whole family.
And we lived in  and next door to our house was another house that we rented out.
civil rights  and he rememb ered his family was very  very in -- in this movement.
With this large number family members  you had grandparents  at least one grandparent who was very ill but you somehow managed to get everybody together and out of Germany.
He said to me  my  the family I was working  I was visiting  said to me  \ Go there 3 right away.\
So  in some I mean  my family as such  and I did not hear them saying anything bad about Jews.
So  they were not able  even my mother's best friends  they said you know I would like to help you maybe by yourself but not with a whole family and you have to leave my premises.
How about  tell us about your mother and your father  where they lived   you know about.
Basically  when we came back  the only people aside from the family  what there was -- a member that was there that remembered us and wa ited for us was -- when I mentioned before this family that met us in Theresienstadt -- Fritz Simon.
I know you had mentioned that your family was interested in music.
My grandmother and my grandfather  they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.
>> Bill Benson: At what point did you get forced to move into a ghetto?
On the end it was many  many Jewish children in this.
I dont know whether they realized that this immigrant family had come to Spartanburg  South Carolina and were totally in a new environment.
The war clouds became darker  and Germany invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland  and the onslaught continued  but fortunately by then we had gotten the rest of my family either to this country or to England and finally from England to America.
And then the -- I guess the children of your brother  who was in Israel -- Yeah.
Going back  we wanted to go back to Hungary  we wanted to see maybe somebody remained from the family.
My child was brought to my sister b ecause they knew my sister and her husband and the rest of the family .
And they were three years apart and I just wanted to have a family  I -- not a lot of children  but I wanted to have more a nd more and then the third  you know  it wasnt really like we planned it.
And here I was a sixteen year old kid  barely sixteen  fifteen real ly  and telling them  here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here.
There were -- actually  there were 15 children born to that family  and 13 of them grew up to adulthood.
And so so that was before my cousins  I think  were sent to labor camp.
How did things I mean  one of the big questions is  your family leaves in 1936.
Before we turn to that time  tell us about your ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 family  your community  what life was like in those years leading up to not just the war  but war in Yugoslavia.
However  my father  the next day that we got home  my father disappeared.
And then they came to Theresienstadt  to the concentration camp where my family and I were  and said we need some volunteers to go there and build that guy a new headquarters.
My George is named after him  because then he became the child of the family who– the two brothers  my uncle  my mothers sisters husband  he was alive and his brother was alive.
Warsaw destroyed too and I lie a little bit and say I look for a family in Warsaw and so on  and they did understand.
What were some of the thi ngs you did together as a family?
One sister perished  her name wa s Lien and I had the letter from the Red Cross in which they notified the family that Lien had died in Sobibor.

Did you speak German at home with your family after the war?

T he family lived in the tiny village of Le Got in southern France for over two years.
All right  first of all I wanted to ask you really just about your background  your family  your childhood in Austria.
But I was very  very attached to the children  and -- and now its thinking back its like -- like I almost -- we all were very attached  the whole family  because we lived together and my father -- if I had a sister got married  he didnt let them move away from our town  they stayed in our town  he opened a business for the new son-in-law.
Then  there was  after the war  in Ukraine  near my town  a family that I told you they were hiding  four kids in [indecipherable].
And  did your parents have any contact with Jewish families  Jewish people?
My sister was -- was thinking all the time she was in London  about her family.
And thats when I said to myself  ﬁI live d as a Jew  not very Jewish  I suffered as a Jew as the rest of them  Im going to die as oneﬂ  and I stayed for a while and I left for Germany.
And my co -- family was very comfortable  a nd had a very cultured  lovely life in my early childhood.
So life was very  very difficult for people arriving from home  without a family  with their whole background destroyed  without any means of support.
And actually I had never met my  my mother's brother  my uncle Elias and his family and so it was a very  very special 10 days that we were all together.

We were af raid of Paris being bombarded  so -- and the French government aske d people who had family in th e provinces or a secondary home outside of Paris to leave -- most of the big cities.
So this is the continuity with a major interruption  a nd some family tragedy between  but thank God that the bright side is that the continuity exists.
Was that just in your family or was that common during the war where you were?
My mother had gone through hell  really  and so had my father  in a different way.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 14 And the plan about where to go raises lots of questions for me about the -- the friends  or the people with whom you -- your family  not -- not you  ultimately  sought shelter  or -- or -- or homes  and the extent to which those people took risks  or did not take risks.
In that tent there were -- we were there  another Romanian family from Romania  which we could not communicate and two other families from Yemen  which we could not communicate.

How how were things going for your father  in supporting the family?
because you were advised to -- No  I -- not that I couldnt stay  because my family told me  and this time was that center -- I dont know if you know  there was a question with food  a question with war  and the same.

inaudible] End of Tape Three  Side A Beginning Tape Three  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.
Im just trying to establish what your -- your life was like before the war.
And that was part -- ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 >> Bill Benson: Right.
If the j-jew -- the girl is Jewish  theres a par -- bigger possibility that the family stays Jewish.
So one family read the German newspaper the the newspaper was in German.
A copy of his application was sent to his wife to get divorced or something to break the family.
Can you tell me where you were born  when you were born and who your parents were  and we'll take it from there.
No and that thats when I started feeling that there was different  I had Jewish and non-Jewish friends.
But I want to tell you something  you gonna be a lawyer  I dont want a shysie lawyer in my family  I want the best lawyer there is.
5 So you were rebellious at first  within the family structure?
I assume that there were Jewish families  but that it was not a predominately Jewish . . .
First of all  we really  finally were able to find out -- to make USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 90 connection as to what happened  who -- we knew that the family perished  but we still didnt know who or how or when or what or anything.
So I knew that -- I knew that he was alive  but totally cut off from Wilna and cut off from the rest of the family.
Were your grandparents though -- outside of your family  your lo -- your nuclear and your extended family  did your parents  or did you experience any kind of prejudice?
My father was   had one brother who was a  had two brothers actually who  his older brother was a distinguished judge who was the only one who actually suffered during the I should add that nobody in my family became a victim in the Holocaust.
How long did you think  you and your family  that you would be in Cuba?
There was always -- the odd thing  the only person that I had ever heard of anything happening like that was a cousin of ma -- not a cousin  a second cousin of mine  we -- you know  I guess one heard there were things going on  possibly because this was such an old family  totally integrated  both on my mothers and my fathers side and -- and maybe I dont like the -- the -- th e word  you know  its none -- the word is not important  but the powerful.
The most important thing for people -- I think now -- was to find family an d find friends.
And I went to my  my family from Bedford Hills picked me up  and I stayed there for a short period of time.
And so my family  and momo st of my village  and the villages surrounding  they were all  I would say  75 percent Protestant.
So for family reasons  because my grandfather whom I didnt know  he was a dentist  and this cabinae cabinet had to be continued  and he agreed to be -- to become a dentist.
I personally have genealogy that go back to the early 1700s in that area.
So -- and th -- What -- what -- what were he doing -- 6 -- and his -- his -- his family -- you know  my father was sent to be educated in Hamburg  because my grandfather  who was a merchant of the second gildia -- I know thats a quite high level  he was quite [indecipherable] man.
The you have heard about  the   the which was a very big family in culture and but there was never Yiddish literature in Denmark.
And family  the cousin who was so wonde rful to me when I first came and gave me my mail with my banana  she still lives in Baltimore.
Otherwise -- >> Bill Benson: Wouldn't have realized it was so close.
Some people didn't even  some kids didn't have a family to go back to.
Ma -- our family  my father  myself and my mo ther.
Two of them  they took me from that midwife  to the place that the family was hiding.
The third  Marcella   married a man named Guido Tedeschi   who was of a very  very wealthy old  very Jewish family of Bologna.
Well  I was very safe and happy  you know  with the Madna family.
And there was a family  there were the parents and one -- one daughter.
Oh sure  I mean all of the holidays and even though we grew up in this non-Jewish neighborhood  I [indecipherable] And so you had non-Jewish friends as well?
And one of the people when I went back when I mentioned my name  she said  yes  she heard that there was a Jewish family living there and she remembered her mother talking about it.
When you met your wife  did she have any idea of what your history had been during the war?
My parents were very  very attached to their parents and very family oriented.
Do you remember did your family go to the factory to see all the damage that happened?
I know they grabbed many watches and an army  as an army and any army that comes in first  you're better off not to encounter with them  but somehow we made it to Debrecen  and stayed for a few weeks with a Jewish family in Debrecen.
Something like that  the last the last letter which we had first of all  when we were left Marjolet to go to Haute-Savoie being hidden with a family   with a French family for a wh for a few for a while  we had to we had to get rid of everything [indecipherable] in German everything al-already  uh-huh.
Did they have to explain your being in the family to any of the authorities?
It was a question how much can I bring back to feed the family.
From the very first day of the occupation your family and community were immediately subjected to profound upheaval.
But my father didnt see me at the transport  didnt see his da ughter Amaria  who s still -- you must put those people in  his daughter Amaria who was the last survivor of the whole family in the transport.
And the rule at the time was that you could take with you out of what was usually a dozen fish forks  and a dozen teaspoons and whatnot  you could take one for each member of the family and two for guests.
So I had an uncle on each side of the family.
technical interrupti on  break] Okay  so I-Im trying to understand if if her family  did they sign  or did they just read lips  or how did they how did they communicate?
Let's...tell me  as the war broke out indeed  uh in addition to the move  what happened to you  to your family?
As I mentioned  th-the family of my moth er  they came from Warsaw in 25 - 27  the mother  the father and three sister  okay?
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your mother and father .
I will begin at the beginning  and I would like you to tell me your name at birth  when you were born  and where you were born.
Did they ask you to sort of take on their identity as a family?
And some of the family were farmers  and and butchers  and Shochets   as they would say.

We would listen to the the American broadcasts and uh somehow the rest of my family one by one found out that we were in the Swedish house  my mother and I  and my cousins kept coming and since my mother told them since she had the it belonged to the whole family  so she managed to have all my cousins come and stay with us in the Swedish house and I think she paid somebody off because my grandmother appeared on the scene who was at that time in her late seventies  and somehow somebody brought my grandmother over.
So I wrote to my family  a small piece of paper we had  we got  we didnt have it and the pencil  I wrote I do not want Erika to come because this to me looks very bad.
>> David Bayer: Well  there used to be a big military camp the Germans had called ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 Foehrenwald.

DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 10 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: from the house.
I so we landed in New York   and we moved in with our friends who were lived in the same building in Vienna  who got and had many relatives   cousins and brothers and sisters lived in New York .
Anyway  tha -- I want to lead up to why this is significant in my family  because I come from these people.
So they try to go to this family mayb e we be better  and it was not.
On my mothers side  my mother had a sister and a brother.
a lot about my family  but not not about my coming here.
That time my uncle had a very good school friend who came to the house and said to my family  whatever you see or hear today  do not leave your home.
So they knew Russian  my father 25 spoke Russian to them and he told th em that we think there is a family living here  if they knew that we would be here  they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown  Saskatchewan.
Before we turn to the war and to the Holocaust and all that happened to you and your family  let's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family and yourself and your life and your community before the war began.
On my mother's side of the family  whom I knew much better  they were in the small town of Ludbreg and my grandfather arrived there from Slovakia.
My mother could make a meal for nothing for the whole family.
When my father got married  he decided to go with my mother's family.
I had a very strong bond with my mom and with my grandmother.
My dad was a locksmith and son of 1 of 13 children  and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of taking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers.
What did -- what did you know about your -- your parents at this point?
Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 41 Oh yeah well  I wa I wasnt there that terribly long  but the family certainly fully accepted me.
And so she was the only one in the family w ho survived  she was alone and Mr. and Mrs. Frost  who were the people that my brother wa s staying with -- and went to her and asked her whether she would be willing to take me in  and she did.
I did not find names of my family on any of those lists.
And also  if you could say how old your sister was  relative to you  and something about your relationships within your family.
That's something I learned from not onl y family  but also from Boy Scouts.
There were a lot of other people  yeah  the families  yeah.
And thats the entire story  I have to tell you [indecipherable] the trip  because we didnt have enough money  there was no cars  and we had to fit ourself in that car  all my family and the Barad family  who lost the head of the family and one of the sons.
Were you able to maintain contact with your mother at that point?
They came to visit us  and ask about our family; and everybody was asking  \ How I can find out about my family--my parents  my sister  my husband?\
We were i-in contact with Sochas family  and a-after -- she died and n-now I am not in contact with the rest of -- o-of the family becau se his daughter  she -- sh-she felt that we did something wrong  that we said about him that he was a -- a -- a thief.
No  my mother was from Poland but my father was from Germany.
So when she got in touch with Jutta  Jutta told her  you know  you have a lot of members of your family in Israel  which she did not know.
Do you know this family  the other fam I didnt know anybody.
They would shoot the German somewhere  and then the whole village gets killed.
>> Bill Benson: Because your father is gone by this time?
Besides his wife and -- and kids  he lost his whole  entire family  no one else survived.
>> Bill Benson: And then amazingly you would connect with your aunts.
>> Josie Traum: Well  I would say about 12 people  immediate family.
Now  we knew -- like I said  we all had it figured out they will take care of our family.
I went because my mother told me that my sister Joy had not made the examination and there would be bad blood in -- in the family if I went.
Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 24 was a family of of pol I dont know exact there was some Lithuanian blood  but I think may most most of the blood was Polish blood  who didnt like the idea of Lithuania he caught somewhere he drew connected with Luther and his followers  and and there was a lot of going and in that time in in so  he counterattacked with the rev wanted to ch-ch ase those out Jesuits  and Lithuania practically was becoming Protestant.
And I got  with great difficulty  in touch with my family and they told me  please dont come because otherwise they catch you too  because you were [indecipherable] when you -- okay.
And he was  I guess  used to being sort of the head of the family when my husband wasnt there.
I'm just trying to understan d  your experience is different than many other people I've talked to and yet you've all had you r lives torn apart  disrupted  lost family... Yeah  yes  exactly  exactly.
At that time I did not know how many of [my] family survived.
I felt comforted and  you know  I was with family and it was wonderful.
She was okay  her family was okay in New Jersey  but then I was supposed to meet her parents -- excuse me -- in -- in Detroit  and I went there  and I had just graduated from officers school  I was very proud to have made it  and to have a career maybe  ahead of me  and to have succeeded  and all that stuff  okay.
And so there was a family on this side of the ocean yes.
I know  for example  uh of a man who did assist my family  but that didn't have to do with our family  uh  and Mr. Kubinsky  uh whose farm was burned and his family was killed.
And I guess everything came  and I took the train back to Brussels because my Uncle Josef had moved to Brussels  and the on ly family I had was in Brussels.
We found out the horrible things that happened  and for our whole family and extended family.
I wanted to ask you  regarding that -- that experience of -- of real disappointment with the fact that these people who had been your friends before the war  really abandoned you and your family  an-and so many others.
But your father and mother did keep in touch with your foster family for a while.
Two weeks later  the entire family was sent to the ghetto.
On July 23 rd  your family moves from Rome to Arsiero .
Because we know from experience that some -- in some family that men was belong to the party  was a 31 Communist  the wife was not  and there wa s the whole discussion.
So my mother's family -- >> Bill Benson: He was a cantor there.
I was walking around looking to be captured  to be taken to work  because that was the only opportunity  by being at work outside the Kovno ghetto  that I may have somehow a possibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family.
So I don't think I ever  I mean now  you know  my father has been dead for 20 years or more  I can under stand what he was about and how strong he actually had been to survive this and to be able to rebuild a family and bring his entire family  his entire surviving family to live with us after having gone through hell himself.
And when they evacuated he left this ch ild in here -- this child moved into this family.
And now as I reconnect with those family me mbers  I still...there's a part of me that finds it very diff icult to absorb their identities and their names.
This way now  being in the farm  I had for my family whatever we did need to eat and end of the y ear I got like this room a lot of how do you say this? --
Within the -- Did you have a large extended family in the town?
Our family was alwa ys  my family  my mothers fam ily was always the family.
He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the Bavarian city of Oxbourg before the war and now he was rabbi in Springfield  Missouri and he and his family took me somewhat under th eir wings.
My father told him about Jewish custom of having a circumcision ceremony  and that ceremony  probably one of the very last held in the family setting  occurred eight days later in Holland  in The Hague.
I -- I guess Im -- I wish I had undertaken a more structured way  ongoing way to educate them about the family  the history and all that.
This cam e from somebody  I dont know  friends whose parents were there during the Boxer Rebellion  brought it back  and I dont know how 56 they came into the family  and in the middle is this round room which we used to call the chapel  which we called it the chapel because there was a not organs  but a harmonium were there  and it had a nice c upola.
Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1  1998 12 So  with your second family you were more focused on your Polish roots  would you say?
01:12:01 Uh almost all the members of my family died during the war  one way or another.
This is tape number two  side B. Cou -- lets start talking about the actions that your father took to try to get the family ou-out of Germany.
And it was a family that that cared deeply for each other uh and so you know  just just thinking back to the little two-year old who stood up stood up to her father.
I dont know why I said I was Jewish and they said youre Jewish.
Well I had four uncles and four aunts  all married with children.
I -- how -- you know  its wa -- I -- I knew I was Jewish.
Before we turn to the events of the war and the Holocaust  tell us a little about your family and your community in the years leading up to the Holoc aust.
>> Bill Benson: Regina  it would not be too long before you and your family were forced to go into a ghetto.
He had to state all that  that when you guaranteed for family to come to the United States.
And we had my family my mother had me  and she has another baby who died  a little he was still a little baby  I have no memory of him.
So he actually sponsored me to come to the United States.
ﬂ So he decided he would get us out of there because we were endangering not only our family but everybody else.
After Germany invaded France  Jacques and his sister were hidden with the Bocahut s. Here we see a portrait of Jacqu es and his sister who were in hiding with a family at the time.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 Now  about the food  food was rationed and the family  even if you could buy on the black market  if you buy more than your family needs  this would be suspicious.
The ghetto was formed  but for a while your family lived outside the ghetto?
Was better situatio n because people can do something for me  but - and my friends  Mr. Melamid  Mrs. Melamid  two sons  and some other family  pay the 20 dollars in gold and go there  and said  Oh well be free  and well go to France  and there we be change for prison of the war.
And he trained us you know  etcetera  and then what happened it--George's family  his mother was  she was from Russia and she was absolutely against him continuing because she said she knows the nihilists  and we're probably going to be--because they did train us how to jump from trains and things like this and so she  I don't know   George decided he wasn't going.
So it's amazing that any Jews took that risk -- non-Jews took the risk of helping Jews because it was so hideously dangerous.
Would you tell me something about your childhood and family  growing up?
>> Bill Benson: In 1936  circumstances for your parents turned more ominous and they became more difficult if not dangerous.
Yeah  so you took your middle name as your first name.
There was some other family  whom I remember very va guely  and some but there were no children  or no youngsters  we were the only ones.
Was there anybody left to tell you what was happening  or -- how did -- how did you experience those deportations  thats what Im saying.
A2: In London  and go to the government to show them the contract  and tell them we are going for three years  and why the and they allowed him to take the whole family  why?

We accepted them  the whole city was not so bad off when the Russians were there because of the city wasnt that rich and for my personal family  it was good.
This family came back and settled and the boy started learning Croatian  and spoke it.
But thank God for my uncle  and that -- that manufacturing company in -- in ro -- in -- in Lodz that saved us and our family.
Of your large  extended family  do you know how many perished?

I grew up in a Boston Jewish family  non-Je wish  no temple  as my son will say now.
Dont talk about it  dont deal with it but for heavens sakes  and I think that has been a hallmark for at least our family  is prove that the Germans  that the Nazis were wrong  prove that youre okay.

Dirty as we were  hungry as we were  but nevertheless the family was intact  together.
I know them  but between our family was a little bit arbut yiddishim.
Later on  my interpretation again  is that he did not want to worry the family.
And at that particular time  I used to talk to my family  why don't they try to go ahead  go move further east  but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one  that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run away from.
They didnt have they didnt have any family they could relate to.
My father had some cousins in Berlin who did not survive the war in Germany and our family is rather small.
And he had allowed my father and our family to live in the janitor's apartment of the factory.

We moved in 23 there  and there was another family  there were three families living there.
Can you tell me a little bit about your parents and grandparents ?
04:15:59 And after the war  when they ca me for her  Mirek Edelman came with his wife  Ala  to take her away from that Polish family  she di dnt want to go because her parents told her  ﬁRemember  never tell anybody that you are Jewish.ﬂ And she didnt know after the war  after the war ended  she didnt know anything  and the woman didnt want to give her away.
But when another family comes in that you dont know  that is totally strange  whose livi ng habits are different from yours  and who are uprooted and who are strange  and it had this problem with adjustment.
At this point did you have any more cont act with your family?
And were you with any of your friends who you in the camp?
So he just stayed there with his family  and of course was Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 26deported to Siberia.

Because my parents  my uncle  my grandparents  my brothe r  my sister  they were killed.

There were a couple of people who survived from my family.
In order for my family to be safer  I told them to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that was the other part of the city  like one section is towards east of the city like facing the Russians and we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue.
My father had worked on the job  too  so in the meantime he was coming home a few times to check what we are doing  and I was very helpful in raising the whole family  and so on.
And my mother was  the two brothers and two sisters and me.
And where was she in the family order of the siblings?
I assume that there were Jewish families  but that it was not a predominately Jewish . . .
And during the war what happened  from everybody from mine family wh at happened during the war.
how could they how could two families fit on the one bed?
They stayed in the Cott ian  and then when things went really bad -- I don't know if it was the end of '43  beginning of '44  I don't remember when -- my brothers moved my whole family up even higher up in th e mountains in Narniac  N-a-r-n-i-a-c.

And we were assigned a room in the ghetto with a family.
>> Bill Benson: And as you said  your mom then made the decision to put you into hiding.
The same thing  for example  one of the families that we were very close with after the war was the Vanderpool family.
Laughter] As you said  you went to church  but you -- did the family formally act like  though  the cover that you were Christian  or you just went to church?
Yes  I was working for a family then and then of course the war broke out  and I was in London and we  at one stage  went and sl ept in the underground stations to protect ourselves because of the bombing.
There was no family which was left unscathed by that  that losses.
And then  Theresienstadt was founded and my mothers oldest brother  the one where we used to have our   and his family  which consisted of his wife and three children -- no  no.
I'm just wondering if you had heard or read anything about Hitler or the Nazi Party in Germany or if you think your family had any 8 information about what was going on.
And we are standing  actually  on the spot where he was telling us that that is where my family is  both of these places.
And I heard from Hani  Hani Dover  the my nanny  she told us when on this last visit sh-she can remember that when my father decided to leave  telling them that he was leaving because there was no future in Germany for his son and his family.
My mom had gone to a textile designing school and she was a dress maker and she was actually  before she got married  she was a dress maker for the world family in Belgium.
The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was eighty.
So  in other words  those first few years  economically your family was  would you describe it as on the edge?
It was donated by the Varber ek family  which was a Jewish family  Jewish bankers that when the war broke out in Germany they went to live in Switzerland and some went to live in England  you know.
I always wanted a family and I never knew that I can have a family.
What were some other things that you a nd your family started being careful about?
Yeah  Russian  I s I spoke Russian  I we used to write Russian.
And in America I was far away from it  so the combination of not quite acclimating immediately to the American culture and the climate  plus the fact that I was still laboring with the thoughts of what had happened to my family  because this -- there was this guilt from the moment that I left them  in ‚38  although my mother urged me to leave.
Many people gave up because they thought somebody from the family would stay.
Okay  but yeah  family trees  you you mentioned earlier  and they [indecipherable] explanatory.
They came to each house  those Nazis -- I call them Nazis.
This was the first baby  my son  that was born in our family.
Well  as I said before  my mother showed me my si sters notebooks and through the Van Luhrmann family I also -- you know  we constantly talked about my sisters.
At the same time  you know  I was with my family and if anything happened to them  it would happen to me and this was it  you know.
So he was very religious  and that we had all the time kosher househ old  even during the war wh en it was very hard  and he wasnt more alive any more  but my family  my parents were used to keep the kosher household  si we were holding til the last moment.
And they were the ones who provided the first visas for our family.
And then theres a family down about four or five houses from my parents th at was German ancestry and I but the neighbors would ask me about stuff like that  Id tell them a little bit about it.
Well again  they they documen t the family  and this is the entire family was affected by the war.
But my parents didnt accept it and I was -- I was  somehow  I depended on my family more than seventeen-year-old depends in normal times.
This is a plaque  a memorial plaque which my mother commissioned after she arrived in the U.S. to -- for the memory of those in the family who died during the Holocaust and for the other people in the family who passed away.
With the school wanting to get rid  get me out  expel me  the family had had enough of me  they didn't want me anymore.
And before you think that's sort of extravagant  you have to understand that Yugoslavia was a dirt poor country and the social morays was if you could afford a car  you certainly could afford to support another family by hiring a driver.
And he devoted himself a lot to his chapel and his family.
There were six children  four brothers  two sisters  my father and my mother.
So in that respect  I must say that I have sort of half and half: one family who knows of  and said  ﬁOh yeah  well  my dad was is a survivor ﬂ and then let it go; while my younger daughter is much more saying in Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 9 pride  ﬁMymy dad made it ﬂ you know  and tells people what-what happened to me as far as she remembers.
It seems the whole extended family ended up in concentration camp s. And Now when you talk about the extended family  did your father have siblings  even though he was an orphan?
If they catch me  I said  why I gonna kill your family?
I am the only one at that point who is not living with my family; they don't even declare me with them .
So when they came to our home  my two brothers  as I said  they were older than me  my parents.
The women became the the stronger part of the family  very often in in a way that would not have happened at all  had it not been a in a a had this not happened.
And my family -- my mother joined with my oldest sister in Paris -- to Paris.
Close  you k now  father's family  close  aunts and uncles and cousins.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >>Bill Benson: Like a nanny.
I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my parents got in touch with a former teacher a nd they -- the teacher organized a little class of children to come to his house and study in exchange for almost anything like some food or clothing for his family.
He said  ﬁWe going to Lexington  Kentucky  whats left of our family  and we going to stay there  and we going to be close together.ﬂ So I stayed in Lexington then Winchester  he lived in New Jersey.
This I learned from my brother who is the only surviving member of my family now.
They would assign you where to go  they would make a list wherever they had place  but if you had somebody  and wanted to be together with the family  and there was room  they would do it.
But not only our family  but look  why they sit in Poland waiting on this Nazi to come?
And when we got a -- there was a cousin of my wifes living in Mount Vernon  New York   and we stayed with them  the whole family  and my brother  first thing he did is bring out a bottle of vodka.
Were there many other children from other families Yes  there were in this group of people?
I was in this tent with another family  with my baby.
What's been the best information you've been able to figure out about your own family?
You remember a couple year s ago  Skokie here  builded a -- he was a Jewish guy  he come from a Jewish family  the guy  what he orgaz -- what was his name?
But my interest was with the family  to help as much as I could.
Well  my interests right now have to be  I have given the children I have -- the children I have left  about as liberal education as possible and I have never allowed any form of segregation to exist in my family.
The head--General Morgan--of UNRRA in Europe  who was a relative of the royal family.
But strange thing  his family was the parents  they had two girls and two sons.
02:36:00 The Germans told him  and one German said to him -- one German said to him  he said  \ You know \  he said  \ If there is a way for you to  to run away  you cannot take your family with you  but if you could run away  because you're going to be killed tomorrow morning.\
The town was a small town but we had a big family from both sides  from my mother's side and from my father's side.
Well  my my grandparents had three children; my father and a bro and his brother and his sister.
I have a law clerk  who is now dean of a law faculty at Cornell   named Eduardo Peñalver   whose family fled Cuba .

And he went over to Sweden and later on he came over to Canada and joined the Norwegian Air Force  and all his family are lost.
But she got a good deal of support from her family and her sisters.
So they gave me a room  we used USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 52 the same kitchen.
He even survived the war  and he survived his wife  survived his son  and wound up with a family in Israel.
Lets talk about the war ended  and -- and what happened with you and the family from there?
>> Bill Benson: Kristallnacht  which of course happened before your birth  November 9  10  1938  it did have a direct effect on your family  though.
So so so nevertheless  you knew at four or five and six  you started having other memories  of not living with the family Oh yeah  yeah  sure.
They had to pick out a new president  so they picked me out for a pr esident for -- for the family circle.
Did you -- do you feel there was any effect on you by certain events in this country  like for instance the Civil Rights movement when the -- you know  the -- did you -- did you know about that in -- in detail  were you interested in those kinds of -- No.
But between 40 and 50 members of my family perish ed  immediate family  speaking about.
No  because I was reunited with Irene and with mother and we -- were no other members of the family left.
Is that just a family trait or is that at all a war and Holocaust related do you think?
We the families stayed together; and we could have lived that way  very well.
Interview with Rose Liberman February 4  2014 11 And what did your aunt and uncle say to you about this?
It was a household that wa s living  I would call middle cl ass life  going to do certain activities  like with fam -- family oriented ac tivities  and Scheveningen was a resort town  so there were a lot of visitors  and to this day its still a resort town  the beach  and -- so it was an active household.
I mean it has never even occurred to me that I uh  that there was any alternative because that was uh a real opportunity to get away from my family.
But they were afraid  the Polish family was very afraid if they were caught  they would be killed  too.
I said I'll tell you why Bobby  because I never made bookkeeping  so if I don't do the right job you can't put me out because I am family.
She was -- I knew her family pre-war  my father -- she was that much older that she wasnt a friend of mine in Zagreb  shes just a -- well  she was maybe three years older  maybe ev en four  and she was th -- one of the glamour girls.
This was her toughness  and when she had this opportunity  mind you  and to be there and then to go and bring the Block Alteste to make sure that Renias goi ng to get in with us  a miracle  thats my mother watching over us  and Im not kidding  because after the war when I returned back to Poland and I went to see my hometown to find out if there is anybody left from the family because peop le were coming  maybe somebody was seeing  somebody had  and there were about twenty Jews who had come back and settled back in their homes in one area  but the Paliszewski family  with whom my parents were so friendly  with whom we had kind of always a home away from home  insisted that since they didnt see us for such a long time  that we can stay a whole day with the people  but for the night we should come to them and we should spend the night with them and theyll give us an opportunity to talk and  one of the women  I had a picture of her with me when I went back to Poland  you know  when we went to Treblinka  she went with us.
So  can you tell me a little bit about your parents  their names  and any siblings?
His family had owned a a a wheat mills and so on  they were grinders  they grind up for for food  and so on.
When I run away I came to commandeer and I said to him  I had to go I had a dream that my somebody of my family is alive.
Now  so much was going on  obviously  with Hitler  we -- and -- were you and your family aware of what was happening to the Jews in 41 - 42 - 43 over in -- in the -- on the mainland?
Can you tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family life before the war?
And Martha  which was the Roberg side of the family  got as far as great-grandfather  didnt get very far.
We were in in No  but you were were you with any family?
Are you angry that you had to leave Germany and your family had to go through what it did  and you had the losse s that you had  and other people didnt?
And she  like the son of the Auschwitz survivor  and Max Weidman who was in England  us four were the surviving children of this family  other than my brother.
In Geneva I was this one night in this little hot el and I told this contact person to immediately call my family.
And Im Interview with Al fred Lakritz April 3  2008 5talking now of my paternal grandfather  my paternal grandmother  all seven of their children  all seven  if any ha -- were married  and all of them but one were married -- all of them had children and of all of thos e children in the -- in this compilation that I made of the records of my family  I have the whole family tree.
There was a form which has all kinds of questions  birth and where you were born  and so on  fam ily  where is your family  politics  what are you? (
I met somebody there that knew my family and they said to me  you know about your brother Paul.
They were married  and I -- I dont know in which year  might be 1920  and then we grew up as one family.
The only way if I can survive for me bei ng involved with the underground  I left the underground because on account of the family.
And  I was very fortunate to come to this country and create a new family.
But if the family started to come  they assigned those buildings  those villas they called it villas.
So you were with your mother and your father and who else?
I think having survived and wanting to survive  and making life as good as possible for me and for my family.
It was two  two rooms and a kitchen; but here we got one room apartment.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
And and I enjoyed being I enjoyed being  you know  that that was family.
And whats the -- And that was dinner  and we had to be together.
And even even with my aunt and uncle  who were certainly my closest family  but still  they were not my parents.
Tell me a little bit about your daily routine when you were living with the farm family.
So were -- were you observant as Jews in the house  and you went to synagogue?
The quarters were very tight  we only had  I think  for the whole family  thats four of us and my father and mother  I think we only had one big room for all of us.
Beautiful pictures  hi -- their wedding pictures  and -- and how they -- th -they -- really its -- its -- and -- but I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0058 27 had -- and I ha -- I met a guy  a Polish engine er there  Pierkel  and he even wrote me a beautiful poem when I was leaving  an d he said to me  ﬁIf you not comfortable there  I find you another family.
And as long as they were part of my family  thats what she did.
Obviously since you were born in August of 38  your memories  the initial memories of what happened or the information that you have must have come from your mother.
One family came from Berlin  one family came from Frankfurt   and we moved in the old house  which had nothi ng.
Well  when we got to Auschwitz   we came with the whole family and my -- you know  my parents -- but the two older brothers were taken away already for Interview with Helen Goldkind February 21  2001 7work  to s-s -- t -- t-to the Russian front where they were picking mines.
Jackie and her family  even though her husband is not Jewish  b-belong to a congregation in Arizona  in Tucson  where on the high holiday s  she usually plays the violin at the services.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075 72 But thats -- was enough for me to see that in spite of this need and activities  that he was involved in  just to keep a family of five alive.
I went 23 patch (Yiddish) 26 back to help my family.
Living with my American family and I was thoroughly Americanized language wise.
You were the youngest  were you the pet of the family  or . . .
So my mother had to take over the responsibility of the family.
Your fathers family  you sai d  had a department store in that time -- Well  I would call it a department store in th e like manner  and I have seen pictures of it a little bit.
I wish that my parents would be alive  my brothers  my family - I can't say my grandfather  he was dead at 85 years old.
One  which is  do you have any earliest memories from your childhood  that you can recall?
And it came from our home  so the fact that my brother wa I it always also amazes me  and no one really  in the family came to that decision to do that.
Tell me a little bit about your family  and you had a a y an older brother  or a younger brother?
And -- Your family worked on -- There was nothing to work  there are no jobs for us.
Tell me a little bit about your parents as people  their personalities.
So you didn't go  did you ever go to your family apar tment?
What was your family saying as the time  as it was rising?
Our family was active in Jewish affairs in the in the city.
They came from a place in Germany called Desow and the name of the family to this day re mains Desow and he told me when we met by chance a couple of years ago  that  uh  I was always dressed in brown  for some reason my mother always thought that brown suited me well  uh  and of course a very unharmonious relationship between me and the color brown   I can't stand it  but that is how it was imposed on you  so I even dressed up in brown  what do you call it  special weaving  uh... Herringbone I don't know  it's some kind of brown  uh  well most of us either wore blue or gray  or what not  but I wore brown.
I really believed the fact that I wa -- being a man I was more in danger than the rest of my family  sister  mother  grandmother  aunts and so on.
They are absolutely so dear to me that I wouldnt know what to do without them  because we dont have family.
I l ooked all over Germany  between the refugees  trying to find you.
Oh  I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood  is a new word for me  I never heard it  but I like it  it  I think it's a continuity  nothing happened because when I came 46 to Palestine I found many of my family of my uncles  aunts  cousins  classmates who did it before from the organization from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair  so it was a road.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know  once you had shelter  how your aunt and your mother were able to start to make ends meet so you could at least eat?
The rest of th e family  for instance  my father's brother and his family  my uncle; my father's sister  my aunt; the grandp arents were already--they were killed also in the first massacre.
My father and my uncle were brothers and my mother and my aunt were sisters.
I think it was important -- Im sure it was important to Morriss family that he married a Jewish person  but they didn't quite know.
Uh  uh  I was the next to the youngest of the family.
What kept me is the belief that maybe my family is still alive.
And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers  who was liberated from the camp and then placed very briefly with the scouts  was eventually placed into my family to help my parents at the farm.
One day  I hope to be able to go back and put something there  a stone  a music lesson  anything that is sort of connected with this Altarac family who gave me so much and left so much behind.
Had my apartment  and Ill even -- Mr. Funkin  his family from his life had two big buildings  where I was there managing  too.
So this is a family tree from her side of the family.
And as a devoted and daily religious man such as my father was also  he belonged to that synagogue.
Im Tape 18 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 5 the only one who is alive–left alive from my whole immediate family so thats makes a difference.
It was  the names of my family and  and we had a conversa- a lengthy conversation ‚til  ‚til he believed me.
R: I do want to say one thing about the Slotkin family.
And he hid there by a family  and got word to us that he's there.
Is there any message you wanted to leave to your grandchildren?
Also I have to tell you  two uncles and one aunt remained alive in Budapest.
So So  did your did your family all live together  did your parents and your grandparents live together in a did they live in the same neighborhood?
I was the youngest from the four children and the only girl.
What did -- what did you know about these deportations at this time?
The first and primary motivation was to find survivors  members of the family.
I have to se e where my -- if I have any family left  I have anything ﬂ I said.
We had a little suitcase  which is now property of the museum  and that suitcase had essentially all the family photographs.
And whatever I do now  Im very happy in general  and my happie st second happiest thing is was the grandchildren  the family  and then when we go to Israel.
There was a big chandelier made out of 17 cloth  a lamp over the ta ble  and this was one of the family gatherings.
They had two c hildren when they came to Ludbreg  where there was a small Jewish community that wanted to have a rabbi.
On my father's side everybody was in Transylvania in two towns -- actually maybe three  but one is Nagyvarad  which is Oradea today  Cluj  which was Kolozsvar  and Otog (phonetic) was the third town where my father's family was traced basically.
But she was quite a religious woman  as were my uncles  my mothers brothers.
And did you live right in the center of the town?
And then my husbands family  and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living.
Can you tell me a little bit about your family  who made up your family?
Very  we were an extremely close family  and not just with my parents  but with my mothers side of the family  because they liv ed very near  within twenty - whether its twenty miles or twenty kilometers  I dont know.
Of course we went to Israel to visit Israel  which we did  too.
She cooking for his family  which enabled her once in a while to get some extra food to help to support the family.
>> Bill Benson: And  Peter  when you were in the ghetto  you were in there with several other relatives.
The  my fathers brothers and sist ers were  of course  some of them are only just a few years older than I am  so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and since there was no money at all in the fam ily  they resorted to somehow  illegal things.
She married my father in March of 1930  after a whirlwind courtship and moved with him to Schlichtern and lived there together with his family  his mother and several siblings.
Can you ask me can you tell me  Tedeschi   is that a Jewish family  or not?
Did -- did Mr. and Mrs. Munzer have any contact with him or your family?
SB: And the moving in to the ghetto  do you remember the things your family took or do you remember what you took?
I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American family.
And so in January  of 42  we -- my family boarded a ship called the Monterey  whic h went from Cuba to Havana from -- to New York.
Well the family kept in touch because we had all these brothers and sisters in Germany and What did you feel like when you heard about it?
Of course  the Rosenbaum family became like a fa mily away from the family.
Tell us about what you can about your time in that convent and then what led to the decision to then move you live with a Christian family.
That bothers me  that nobody in the family said  you know  ﬁWhat would you like to be  and where would you like to go from here?ﬂ And I knew I had a very good mind.
>> Bill Benson: You told me about a neighbor  the Schoen family.
Were you and your family in touc h with your relatives in Warsaw?
But my father wrote a letter that the family has to stay together.
We knew there was a part of the family in Palestine.
Then we went to live together...the second family  was my mother's sister was living...separate family  and they said  \ Come to us and stay with us  if...if it's happen.ﬂ You know  they take...we got no friends  and we got a horse.
Where that family structure  that family entity as in so many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases  that family entity overnight was destroyed.
And we had saved a few apartments from the family  we had a big house with a lot of bedroo ms.
And I met the same I I met George  and his family  which had now come together.
Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28  2015 23 But that one soldier was like probably he has the family Yeah.
She said  she said  ﬁI never would leave my family  either.ﬂ And so we stayed and waited for a few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into Czernowitz.
The other thing... the connection of the musical talent of your family... The musical talent in my family originated with my mother who was also a pianist  and because of her my sister was attending th e conservatory  learning the Piano in Poland and that's why she ended up in Israel to finish her studies in the conservatory of Tel Aviv.
You don't have time to tell us about them but one of the things that you said to me was that everybody was treated pretty equally but once you were known as wanting to leave  you were put on a list and things got very difficult but eventually you were able to leave Romania with your family.
I became pregnant and we didn't want to raise a family in New York.
So your your father made his living and was able to support the family  both from the pension  and from farming the land?
I was happy that somebody  somebody from our family was still in life.

Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war?
19 And he didnt want to leave his parents  you know  your commitment to the family  so forth.

And since every Jew got something  so my family got also some kind of a location together with other Jews.
They d ecided that theyd take the first floor and the second floor  it was a doctor  a gynecologist with his family.
They take all kind of date about my family  that I have family and where can  the addresses and they gave us some money  but I don't remember how much  not too much  just pocket money.

And he was head of the Jewish Family Service  which was a volun -- as a volunteer  and my mothers chief endeavors were in Hadassah and child welfare.
An interesting thing about the family  though  you see  were almost rather like two families.
And when when I was there  we went to the cemetery again  we wa saw our old house.
Your fathers family and where they came from as well as your mothers.
I stayed in convent until I went with this family  the Debrackelaers.
They were and in a Jewish community and you know how it is.
They were having big full breads to eat besides other items probably that she took home to her family.
When he fell in love with my aunt  and he  of course  this was a Croatian Catholic family  and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi  not exactly the right combination for the times  forever  but certainly not for that time.
Was that the I mean  was the biggest fear losing your family  or I dont you know  this is so very strange that I dont have I was just speaking to a friend of mine whos also who is my age.
Can you talk some about the role that your faith played in your family when you were growing up?
What have you told your family about your childhood and your experiences in Vienna?
Do you know why your family moved from Poland to Germany?
Ah  H-Hebrew Ladies Bene volent  which is now Jewish Family Services were -- we were accepted in this community  of course  oh it was fake  there was no job  or no -- no place to stay.
You cannot get out from this area  this where you live  and there was no such a thing like uh  a family gets a home or gets a  a place to live.
And  of course  many people in Paris  including my family  we ran away.
She had a whole family  they used to all come to me  and she was what was her name?
Oh yeah  for s -- the holidays  that is -- What about the Sabbath  did you observe the Sabbath at home?
What happened in your family  when you begin to talk about it?
Even before Hitler became chancellor  he watched what was happening in Germany and warned the family and went to his siblings and his father and said we should leave.
My mother came from a observant family  meaning my grandmother kept milchig and fleishig separate.
And the story was that he and his family lived in the town of Zelechow  in Poland.
And so we waited in Constantinople until my father succumbed to the influences of his whole family and decided that we should come and...come to the United States.
They had  her father was Austrian but this whole family lived in Turkey and the mother was Greek background  Sephardic.
>> Bill Benson: You would leave  your family would leave  for Kenya in June of 1939.
And he knew my tele phone number and he called me up and he said  you have to take my your father be cause I have a family  I cannot keep him.
The family [indecipherable] had a family  and they said  ﬁYou are in America  and Israel is very bad now.ﬂ Peopl e didnt have work  didnt have what to eat.
So you -- you didnt necessarily have dinner with the rest of the family  with your mothers sisters?
So  I thin k so  in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex because it was a Hasidic family an d my mother was  had that air of a bigger city with more civilization and the country in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic  so I would think I have the strength of all of that in some way in my own personality.
They just asked me or told me not to go on Chris tmas Day but stay with the family which I did.
And that used to be how you In the family  thats how they behaved.
This was going on maybe more than a year that we were wandering from one family to another and this is how we lived  01:12 and then one day my mother went into a family that she was very poor and approximately her children were our age.
Look  in that train  in that thing we were three already of the family  we were left three  and it was just the most terrible thing that happened.
And this -- this shot is my family as well  the same constellation.
Q. So  were you and your family ever forced to live within this ?
When they returned home in 1944  police were sent to arrest the Garihs but agreed to say instead that the family was not home if the family would leave immediately.
Aside from your grandparents and your aunt Rachel  Ruchl  was there anybody else from your family who stayed?
And even when the girls have the Bats Mitzvah  he does bring up that my family perished in the Holocaust.
Probably not given the 1930s in Poland and middle class family.
And she was young  she was almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18  and almost all her family had been killed  but one brother who had gone to Palestine.
And she had a dream that the angel came to her and told her that when your daughter will be 13 years old  it will be a war in which your whole family will be killed  perish  all but not your daughter.
And what are some of your earliest memories from your childhood?
Did when you met your family again  tha your parents  and I take it your sister must have stayed in Poland   is that right?
On one of those daily trips to these schools or gathering places where they were bringing in some inmates from some concentration camps like Mauthausen  ot her (c.652)  Auschwitz... By that time  I already gave up or did not have any hope any more that any one of my family members is alive.
Something that was important for her rather than just working for the family and doing what my father wanted and -- The fellow who saved my life and myself -- one of the reason we didn't end up married after the war was that we had the most terrible fights.
He was  for 45 years  living in that house  had brought up his family there and he didnt understand how the -- what happens.
So it became a feud in the family because of that.
Then they came for the Jews  and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.
When you came back from your tour in Europe  and having had the experiences that you did  and seeing what had happened to the Jewish people in Europe and what could have happened to your  to you  had you been there how did that affect your relationship with your parents and your family?
At night she went to her family and he didn't want her to work.
She had two brothers  one brother and at the time before the war and after the war she had some more sib lings  her parents had some more children and it was quite remarkable because her father was sent to a separate place  separate USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 4 concentration camp from Nomi and her mother and miraculously that family survived and was reunited after the war.
And I know that your pare nts sort of social network was generally family contacts.
The priest told the story to my parents' neighbor  and so my two sisters were entrusted to this woman's care.
I think she has passed on to us the importance of family.
So your family life and your family before the war  you told me a significant story that your mother shared with you along the lines of someone saying one day  well  today you now speak Yugoslavian.
>> Bill Benson: Before we talk about that  tell us a little about your mom and dad.
But in my circle of friends here  my -- my family  friends  they were mostly Jewish  but as I said  not really exclusively.
During this time  were you able to hear from your parents?
I wrote this to mine brother  and -- about it  and he answered me  he said in -- you know  we are from a strict Orthodox family  he wrote me this letter  as much suffering I had to go through  I can do whatever I feel  he feels  you know  that it will be justified [indecipherable].
So they as I said  my mothers youngest sister  I think was a devout Jew  but I never knew her.
Th e picture is of the Corbin family taken in Pennsylvania in 1980.
Uh  the many relatives  the aunts and uncles and cousins and brothers and sisters and family and the busy work place... you know  the milking of the cows and  uh  and I remember making wreaths out of buttercups for my hair  that Cornelia taught me how to make too.
So when I speak to my cousins  his children are so now about -- because they also regret they never pumped him for information just in the family tree. [
We our family  and another family  we were we were given one room.
And they also had -- he had four sisters  and they were very similar to us  you know.
Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 73 I stayed with this family from 1941 to 1952 when my husband and I were married.
>> Bill Benson: And  of course  you're under the Communist government.
We lost 90 people in the Holocaust  90 of our family were killed.
What was what was your family life like as a child  growing up?
How many people were in your family and what... We were 9 children  five brothers and....uh...s ix brothers and three sisters.
With -- I got married when I was 19  and -- and I think thats the most importa nt thing  to have a family lead so called a normal life  have -- our -- both our children got married  they both have two children.
Even she was raised from an ultra -orthodox family but her mother died after bir th.
Not only was I in the course of...of maintaining this...this lie about who we were  part of what that entailed is that I was completely cut off from almost all of my family.
>> Bill Benson: How many of you in total left Germany?
>> Edna Friedberg: When you were in Mauthausen  were any other members of your family with you?
But e-even in Germany  my mothers family  wh ere we used to have Seder together with her family  I was always the youngest of all the cousins.
And with trying to -- by 1944 -- I think it was actually during the time that Ljudevit was gone that I was told by the remaining member of the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 Runjaks family that the local priest came to Mrs. Runjaks and said to her  \ What are we going to do with these children?\
And...uh...we knew a policeman by the name of Chesick who knew our family.
And I never had anybody really to speak German with or to exper -- have related experiences with and I didnt know anybody who because I was thoroughly Americanized and my family was American.
In a way it was I dont know if Mother and I would have survived without that family.

Atlit  which is now  I think a prisoner camp for the Arabs or something  but ‚Atlit was just a cam p  it was--and there people were trying to either make you join the army or go to a kibbutz or free and then a lot of family came.

And then  the older son  he with his family lived in the house  they made in the side.
And did you begin to hear things that were happening to Jews?

We were happy - and like I said  we had nobo dy - we had no family.
We grow apart and we try to stay together by having a family.
And he said  your family  that were with you in contact from Australia is still there.
>> Bill Benson: Nat  although World War II began with Germany and Russia attacking Poland in September 1939  it wasn't until 1941 that the lives of your family and other Jews in your community near the city of Iasi changed dramatically.
I was the oldest  I begin to smuggle in some f ood for the family.
Page 19 Did you and your friends  your family someho w blame the German Jews or the Austrian Jews that came in and because of them the school was closed?
I tell you  we had so much tzures  you know  troubles  our own  health  nutrition  family  that besides that what happe ning with our neighbors  our immediate family  that wasn't even the will to participate in a nything  all the time.
The family -- Cargill Zeetroon owns that house and -- and a jewelry store that they all came out of that jewelry store.
You had your family  people th at you grew up with  with you.
Before you were occupied in 1939  what did you know about what was going on in Germany with Hitler?
And -- and one of -- there was a father and a mother and three daughters and a bo -- and a son  four children.
I said  \ Because I know that I come from a family with 78 people  and I know nobody is alive  just I'm the one.
We were busy working  we were busy building a family  we -- we were busy with our children  we were busy having fun sometimes.
I dont know what happened to Richard or my grandparents at that point  my mothers family.
My mother understood German  my father I dont -- I dont think so  but Jewish is similar to German was  so they could understand.
And he didnt object that I named them after my side of the family.
SUZANNE FOLDES Page 9 out something on the rest of the family.
At that point  we had a small ap artment  a one bedroom apartment that somehow  my mother's brot her lived there prior to the war and so somehow they kept that apartment for him so when we came ba ck and my uncle survived and he came back  we moved in together and we lived there and we stayed there for close to a year  again  waiting for hopefully family  to trickle back.
01:44:15 Since I was a fairly well-to-do person  and without a family  as soon as the Communists took over Lithuania  everybody in Lithuania  every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin  to make themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots  and pants with  with -- how do you call it?
And the fact that I have all of this family people here  most of whom have heard what I have to say several times before  is really -- it really shows that why they feel -- we all went to college.
But the visas were going to run out before we  before they could really do the whole transfer and so they got in touch  my parents got in touch with the Kindertransport and they arranged for us to be flown out of Switzerland to London where we were met by the Brega family and who lived outside of Cambridge in an old  freezing cold rectory.
And so I remember having to go -- there were two ways you could get out  by quota or like my family did  if you had a special visa because you had a special profession and had a job waiting for me.
It was -- it was -- you know  by that time  Martin Niemoeller had already entered our family -- Right. --
All I know is that Grandmother basically  the grandmother herself did not come from a religious family  or maybe she did  because she was very well educated.
>> Bill Benson: Where they placed you  in the same house.
Was there something about your family that made them more tight knit than usual?
I was born in a -- first of all in a fairly large  I mean a locally very well known family  very big family and you know  mmy family has been in the sugar industry and so on  and -- and with connections in the Belgium industry and so on  but at the time I was totally immature and -- no I -- well  I -- I went through the -- the experience you are interested in  it was about 1920  and -- but very mentally immature.
Would this be one bed in each corner  for each family?
Well  my father and mother came from very  very religious families  especially my father.
Oh I cannot  I cannot tell you but it was  she was very happy that I came back.
>> Bill Benson: Your father was arrested that night along with other family members.
They had two daughters which were my age as well as my brother's age.
We used to go away in the summertime into the mountains for vacations...uh...during the Christmas school holiday or the....uh...holiday during Easter with...I visited some family in different citie s  about 50  60 miles away from where we lived.
And...uh...my mother was Bella from the family Frucht and from Chelm and...uh...all her family lived in Helm and they was a big family  very well known in Chelm.
So that apartment was confiscated by the Nazis and we had to find another Jewish family.
And that was outside the ghetto  or inside That was part of ghetto then  yeah.
Now I had also from Selma's family was a permit like that what I could get and I got and I got apartment and we started in the textile business  and we didn't begin -- we did very well  and later my partner just  cheated me out and I  we lost all the money and I had -- I couldn't start another business so I was decided to go away.
>> Bill Benson: Nat  you were not yet 3 years old when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 starting World War II.
He mo st likely didnt tell him that he killed a German  and - and the guy said to him that he should show him where the family wealth is.
Did -- did you -- did you and your family consid er yourself Polish?
>> Bill Benson: Before we end  tell us about your mother and father then reuniting the family.
And would you say that your family was well-to-do  or Middle class.
2 My mothers family lived in Pinsk  and her father was a merchant  and his name was Abraham Schwartzman.
So  like I said before  there were Jews  and there were Jews.
Up to that point  did you have any Jewish friends  were there any Jewish families living in your town?
So and I'm sure that if he would have come with us  he probably would have been alive.
I want to ask you  were there any deportations going on from the ghetto before they began to liquidate?
This is tape number two  si de A. I was interested in knowing when your mother was taken for questioning  with your family  where they were -- where they -- that Gestapo questioning would take place.
And we had a couple of cousins there  too  relatives of my ma my mothers.
No  there is no 22 center  but then my family was never really my center in that sense in the boarding school.
And this was the biggest surprise that I had  that the the very same people who lived with you in in the house  an-a-and knew th e family and and guten tag and guten naft and this and that an-and theyre friendly  and suddenly yo tell you they have been in the underground f-for years  under as Nazis.
So the remnant of the family  whoever was leftover and hadnt died  a ll came to New York by 1951.
I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens  and he decided to come to be with us.
My father was photographer  and he was the official photographer for the Hapsburg family  was the king that time.
See  my mother -- from my mother's side  she had here her uncle and cousins.
She was born into the Frantz and Martha David family in -- in Guben.
The parents were friends  and we were friends with the family.
If you were the sole caretaker of somebody  your family  whatnot.
Do you remember what your apartment looked like in the Ghetto?
And our ghetto was organized before large towns had ghetto because we already had a ghetto in June 1941  which was very early.
But with such a large family  its hard to say who went where.
We had moved into our building only two years earlier  and there was one -- the f -- of our neighbors there was one family who clearly were vvery troubled by the way we were treated  and they just -- at every opportunity they showed that their sympathies were the Jews.
And  people that go out for themselves  and uh  everybody fights for life  and all the kind of dirty tricks that people do in order to survive  so  it was a very  very  because of my background  from my family  you may want to call it brainwashing  but I was brainwashed pretty good.
That's like they would take my arm from me because all my rest of the family  they were educated .
You were in the ghetto first you have this little house that you this little room.
In fact for the first  almost year or longer I did not live with the family in Jackson Heights.
Its -- The family took it over and it became sort of a stagnant.
I'm trying to just give you the atmosphere I get from Poland  that the family unit was very close  so when you had a wife and children that came in  and you knew that they're suffering  even if they're alive  that the do not  they had have nothing to eat  they stand outside in freezing  no clothes.
Was it a huge apartment building  or single family No  it was in an apart it was about five story building  five story building  yes.
Was it a a religious family that you were liv ing with  where you were able to practice?
And mother  Interview with Hugo Herzog 12 March 6  2014 everybody knew t hem and they always said Albert dont worry  they dont do anything to you or to y our family.
His father decided to send the two girls  the only girls in the family to America.
So your mother  your father  and all of your brothers and sisters.
Family  so the husband would come and so on  but mainly women.
Did you know w -- that -- where -- while you were still in the camp  did you know where your aunt was or where shed been taken  or did you not find out what happened to her until the war was over?
There was a wall constructed that I later found out and behind that wall were some members of the family of the friends who used to work there  and that was the time that I wanted to bring Eli to that place and most likely he would be able to work for us  but I was too late.
What do you recall of not only you now have a fifth family but you're an entirely different world.
The youngest brother and his family  who had been living in Berlin  they managed  again with the he lp of my parents  to come out and they came to the United States.
What did you do  how long di d it take for you to be deported  what happened?
Uh  he went into bankruptcy; and  uh  the family had a difficult time.
And the Mo-stof-ski 19 family  they had a car  and motorcycles  and they left.
>> Bill Benson: So  Alex  your father  your sister Madeleine  and your Aunt Cylli  you survive.
But when you were growing up you spoke Yiddish to your brother and to your parents?
All I know is that I was reunited with my -- With your family. --
Why  I cannot explain  but I knew our family -- I knew he knew the village people and I thought maybe hell be some kind of protector and I was right in some ways.

He was mostly with 14 his sister  with the family  and we was put in a house also from the family  from their side.
But before we turn to the war and the Holocaust  let's start with you telling us about your family  your community and your early life in the years before war broke out in Europe?
My father registered and my mother registered and that was some papers that I found in the Warsaw archives after the war  and in 1941  like in February  I went out again to get some food for the family  and a Polish policeman grabbed me.
Probably not given the 1930's in Poland and middle class family.
Not for me  ben when you started to think  everyone who has a family  and if he would started to think that all his family were killed by certain people  and they were not only killed  before they were killed  they were tortured.
For us  what you're talking family camp  I'm talking we didn't have any guns  we didn't shoot anybody.
>> Bill Benson: And  Peter  the last question for you today is: You were planning to go back to Hungary because you'd really like to learn what you can about where your father was.
>> Bill Benson: I think  during that time  your father lost his business.
He went into the other family to look for the father  but the father wasn 't there.
So we was between the first uh group to get the shutzpasses because we both   our name  our family was in this uh in this list.
How did this make you feel  and how did this make your family feel?
He said   ﬁB ecause you know me and because you know my family  I'm giving you four hours.
We didnt have any -- anything out of a Dutch -- thats for 200 years my family lived in Holland.
And he told me  Adam  in case theres a such a thing that I wont be able to take care of my family  youre the one thats gonna take over  and it will be your responsibility to take care of your mother  your grandm other and your si-sisters and brother.
So at night we took some shovels and the two of us and went there and we dug up the money in the one jar and the je welry in the other jar and we took that money and some of it we paid border guards between Hungary and Romania so that we could ge t out already and the Russian soldiers were there  so in order to be able to get ou t of there and go over to Romania where my mother's  a lot of my mother's family lives.
And I was 17 when I finished school  and we had a very extended family and we lived -- you know  we were very close to my grandparents.
I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters  and my mother had two brothers and a sister.
I mean  in her family when she had all the siblings -- Yes  the same thing  all my cousins -- I have one cousin left; she's in her '90s; she's sort of -- she's in England  sort of out of it.
But I remember that if they went to church  and that would be going to church  where would that be?
I lost 58 with the immediate family not counting farther relatives.
Were still in the apartment  and then came th-the d ecree that young adults who wants to work in Germany  you know  will go  I think there is copy of those kind of forms  saying you have to take only one suitcase and things like that  you will -- your fa -- your family will not be t ouched.
What about your family  were th ey able to get out of Germany?
I was asking if your paren ts had any knowledge of what was happening to the extended family.
So you were with your mother and your father and who else?
My grandfather wanted us to go to Israel but -- at that time it was Palestine.
My mother was still living in..at home with this Mrs. Degelas and her whole family.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father with you when you arrived there?
If he would have taken that  perhaps other members of the family  would have been avoided during the Holocaust.
So my son  who lives in New York state  I didn't want to move there  because they have a lot of business to do with themselves  they have their own family and they wouldn't have any time for us  not that I want people to have time for me  but they're busy with themselves.
So do you have a lot of family here  extended family in the United States ?
For my family  my uncle uh Mihnk's family--only 3 children were left on the right side--the right side; the rest of the family on the left.
RG-50.549.05*0001 11 Back in the beginnings of the war  when there were  did your  did your family experience economic hardships when there were economic restrictions on Jewish . . .
And so did your pare nts have family back in the place that you were born?
So if three people from one family was in one house and three people from the other they just so rt of stayed together.
Well  you had some family help  but it sounds very much as if you built your own life here.
>> Bill Benson: So you're living in this apartment while all of these restrictions are being imposed on your family.
And then my mothers family went back to Paris  and thats where they settled.
Well  I was going to say when I came back through arrangements with his friends and family I went out to his home and uh it was a very moving experience in telling him this story that I'm telling now as he sat there uh paralyzed and listening to this  so uh  you know  we were all in tears when we finished but I felt uh the satisfaction of knowing that I could at least tell him it first hand  the story of what role he had played in this case  and it was the first time that I learned the uh meaning of the Yiddish word uh mitzvah  which people were telling me that I had done and uh I felt very good about that.
Do you know very much about your mother's family and . . . (
>> Bill Benson: You were a young boy when Hitler came to power in Germany.
He started all of this so-called enterprises  whatever  a way that was needed and in order to be able to support the family and the money that he ma de from this -- taking all these things to the villages and into the town and everything else  we bought land.
So  tell me a little bit about your fathers family  and how they decided to leave  and when they left  and tell me more about what happened with them.
The  my fathers brothers and sisters were  of course  some of th em are only just 5 a few years older than I am   so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and since there was no money at all in the family  they resorted to somehow  illegal things.
They put us on top  and some were pushing and some of the family were pulling.
Not at this point but later on when I was in military intelligence  I was advised to change my name because my family was still supposed to be alive  or at least I did not know any different.
Most likely she traveled east towards maybe her town  maybe spent some time there with family.
>> Bill Benson: One of your relatives had left Germany in the mid 1930s.
So  you see the soldiers come in   you see that your father has to give a gun up  the one weapon  and you realize that your family  your parents cannot protect you any more.
My mother was a farmer's daughter  they had land  and he married her and I'm all my life I was till 26 years  the war start I was with my mother's family.
I  too  wanted to take my family and my friends for granted.
How is it that your parents didnt  or your family didnt?
But the other thing  the -- the -- the other thing kept me -- kept me -- they shouldnt take reve nge on my family and thats what kept us together.
There was a large Jewish community there  I gather  but -- There was a large Jewish community there.
Is that a reunion of like a family reunion of some sort  or No  I dont know anybody.
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
Family A  parents go to family B  and the kids from family B come to family A apartment and we had house parties.
A. I am assuming that the village knew that your family was Jewish.
But my father had a family to support and that was his job.
My parents were -- came to Austria right after the first World War  married in Austria  and there were three children in the family.
>> Edna Friedberg: Did you have a large  extended family elsewhere?
What  who  who made up your family and where did you live?
And we had wonderful teachers and we had - it was like a family.
And he said the woman that attended in that orphanage  5 her name was Anita and she was very kind and very nice and he said if ever he will have a child  and she will be a girl  he will name her Anita  and thats how I got the name Anita.
Well  how did you know that your father might be there?
And then my parents  I think this family no longer could afford a couple he they were he had once run as ri congressman in a for congress in a heavily democratic district in New York of course  he was a republican  so he only ran  he never did get he didnt get elected.
And whilst many of their friends were Jewish  they also had many non-Jewish friends. [
Q. So you must have felt very isolated in th ese years not knowing how your family was  if they were alive?
Did you have discussions with friends of yours that were Jewish  do you remember them being concerned  or their parents?
My father was born in Romania but as a child already they had left and they had come to Zagreb and established themselves there.
And I was with my brother in law and my husband and my three year old son.
He had been orphaned  and went to Israel--or went to Palestine and was adopted by a family  was educated there in Tel Aviv  and he became a doctor  a medical doctor and had practiced and just retired when I first got in contact with him.
That  now I shouldn't be overly proud because I did so little  but when I think of my family  I'm still pretty proud.
End of Tape One  Side A USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 16 Beginning Tape One  Side B Tape one  side B  of an interview with Jerry Slivka.
What was that time like for you living with your aunt and uncle?
How did your how did your father I assume it was your father support the family?
So she placed my mother as a governess in a family with several children  eight 10  I don't remember how many  but a bunch of children near the Eiffel Tower.
And she got me a job w ith a German family.
But we were not hungry for meat  once a week when I became an intern  we were invited to hospital cafeteria  the family.
So she appeared there one day and arrested a whole family of   a sort of middle aged couple and a teenage 102 son or something.
He was born in Hamburg in 1921  moved to  with my family obviously  moved to Amsterdam in 1933  went to s -- high school -- to primary school and high school there.
it it it was  if you go and look at the family tree  his father was one of who knows how many  and and they all had 10 eight to 10 kids  so that trying to figure this thing out like this  its You can get a clan in no time.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
Because  like I later found out  my whole family I never heard from them again.
Thats a family photograph  my father  my mother   and all seven siblings.
And lets talk a -- a little bit about your family.
She had to really be able to support a family of four.
And he was helping not only her  but also another cousin  two cousins  young girls who escaped from Vangloff which was some kind of a family town close to us.
Thirty-one members of my father immediate -- im -immediate Im -- Im speaking now  members of my fathers family were kille d in the co -- various concentration camps of the Nazis.
My  as a matter of fact an old family friend would always say my mother was more Jewish than most of her Jewish relatives.
So she went to the bazaar places to look for somebody from the family  and one day she met my uncle there  and she to ld him that that where I am  and he didn't even know I was born.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >> Bill Benson: You found out later at the time.
06:30:01 Number two  how can he think about selling something  you know  when you looking 36 for members of family.
Did you know or did your parents know what was happening in the rest of Europe at the time?
When you said no one came back  are you refe rring just to your family?
Well  it's uh  you know  when you  when you grow up with certain ethics  and you believe in your family  you believe in your holy kind of things.
I got involv ed  through the Jewish family    called me one day and I was active in the federation in '55 or  I mean every campaign since 1955.
Did your family -- were you aware of your family receiving packages or letters?
And both your parents were -- were Jewish  and brought you up in -- practicing a sort of Orthodox Jewish faith.
So my grandparents  actually  and my mother took in this little girl to stay with us until she found a safer place with some family.
When you went to your hometown in Poland  did you see a ny of the houses  or buildings you remember  places where your family -- Oh  sure. --
We never we never did anything I think to betray our family or or even endanger our family.
The family that st-stayed back in Poland  who did not leave -- Interview with Eli Dortort August 3  2005 24 They already were living there for a long time.
My anger with God  and we talked about anger before  and this with God  being the only survivor of the Willner family  out of 28  has changed to thankfulness  permitting me to forgive God  and not the other way around.
You really cannot describe those feelings because something happens in a family.
Did you -- did you go back to Poland to see your mother?
And she she was tiny  but she kept the entire large family together.
>> How were you able to overcome so much tragedy and still make such a positive  beautiful life with your family?
He must have because he started anothe r family and havent been in the close contact with him at that time  at the end of his life.
Maybe if we had boys in the family  it would have been different.
I know less about his family th an I do about my mothers  because she talked more Okay.
And I was very content  she was very  very good to me.
Some of them were people we had made friends with on our ship and there was one family we met who had come there in probably 1931 or ev en earlier  and he had a s -- he and his family had established themselves.
Then I find out who now was this family  was Speer.
When you speak about immediate family  nobody in my immediate family survived  my mother and two sisters were gassed.
And as we ha d to move -- we moved into another apartment again  and this time it was a beau tiful place  a beautiful home.
When you were living in Antwerp origin ally  you were a fairly religious family.
A. Well  the others did not yet know about what was going to happen and my father had been a frequent guest at the various Danish folk high schools since we were a family at that point six people  my eldest brother went on his own and actually went very soon to Sweden but still we were six persons and we just couldn't go to the next door neighbor.
I-It -- It was Menachim and father  Menachim did also everything but in fact  Menachim all these years  was so unhappy because he felt that he should have been there for us and -- and I kept alway -- I always had to -- had to tell him that this was the greatest thing that could have happened  because if -- if not he would have also perhaps perished and this way at least we had a-another family member survive.
What did happen to your parents  and how did you learn about it?
And I want to as k you a little bit more about your family life as a boy  your religious background.
Not true  because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends  but they were not that close because the children could have been very close and we went to school together and everything was fine  but the parents of that group did not really want their daughters to mix so much with the Jews  so we were not kept very close with them.
My grandparents also owned a dry good store and they had an orchard.
Yeah -- i-in a house  we were living in a house.
So it was natural for them to get married within the family.
>> Bill Benson: You would remain in Paris in your apartment for another two years until June 1942.
But we 11 were both from the family Roth  honest people.
You know what does it mean to be worth in the time -- of course my family [indecipherable] father is a hundred thousand dollars.
Many times I feel in concentration camp  if mu st be sacrifice somebody in our family  let me go first  because my parents must live  raise the two girl  younger girl -- and I am alone.
Then not long ago  I met a woman and she was and I don't --I don't know why the s ubject came up  but she was telling me that her father-in-law --I don't know  someone  someone in her family did not believe it ever happened.
And from what I remember  we were talking about the Volksdeutsche family neighbors that had been in near you  who displaced you from your own small quarters after the arsenal the artillery bombs and shells of your own apartment  and had a picture of Hitler on their walls in their own place.
So  after the war started  what ha what had happened to your family?
>> Bill Benson: You were left then with a couple of your sisters  three  I believe.
What -- What was it like when they were growing up  rega rding the fact that you and your husband were Holocaust survivors?
And because I was the only man in the family and more in dang er of being persecuted by the Nazis  so my family agreed to send -- to let me go.
They were originally from Pleven and that's why we actually pushed to get sent to Pleven because we had some family there on  on my aunt's side -- her husband's side.
But then when you have a family you want to give your family some kind of soul.
And here we see a group portrait of members of the extended Berg family on their farm in Kenya.
So he was on the well  we had  or my husband ha d family here in in United States.
My grandfather had 9 children  and I come from a family of 4.
So when there was a tragic meeting in the family  they say  now Miko  Neho  you will go.
I want to make a comment  because that was it its one of the changes  or you come from a family that has been integrated in Italy for two millennia.
And -- as   by the way  are both my daughters.
Did you come into contact with any Jews at that time or did you know anything about what was happening to Jews in Europe?
When I visited the family a number of years ago  they told me that the day or two after I was taken out  the Germans had invaded that hospital.
It was really at from what I recall  it was really a family affair.
Just a very normal life  which abruptly ended  and we got notice that we were going to be relocated  thats what the -- would be call -- and we knew when  and we were lo -- no  we were relocated in -- we -- into an apartment and we stayed there with another family 6 and their daughter.
By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigr ated to England  and so it was a bit of a family reunion.
And we  all kids  all of our brothers and sister  we had sense enough resp ect our family  and try to give back our love the same what their love was to us.
A My mother  my father  my sister  my little brother and myself.
Mean while  my family in America contacted me and they very  very much wanted me to come to the United States  even if I don't live there merely to come to see them.
But my aunts and my -- both uncles  two aunts and two uncles that went to Russia  they survived.
Did you know what was happening to the Jews of Europe before you went over?
I mean  you know  a large family  maybe seven  eight people  because there were families like that.
But we came Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 47here and we got even a room with a Germ an family  a Jewish German family.
And part of retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story  I think has helped me to -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family.
And when I didn't learn from -- when I was read ing the paper with my dad would -- what I didn't learn  I sort of translated myself  yo u know  like -- I remember an example that my family had repeated  namely that in German whipped cream is schlagsahne  meaning beating  and sahne -- or schlagobers  the Austrians used to say.
It -- it -- it -- its very hurtful to me  its very hurtful to my family  its something that affects all Americans  not just Jews  a-as you could see from the tragedies on -- on September Interview with Harry Gelb December 13  2001 6911th.
And in particularly there was round -- when we -- we -- before the war  there was a Jewish family around the corner  they had two very small children  babies  an d they -- somehow we knew that they were not in hiding  I dont know why  but that they were shipped -- that they went to -- to the camps  and I just could remember these little girls  and [indecipherable] what happened to them  and -- and you know  that they w ould not sleep in their own beds  and they would be somewhere in -- in Westerbork  an d I dont know what would happen to them  we didnt quite know what happened to them.
And the -- the -- the prepara -- End of Tape Three  Side A Beginning Tape Three  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.
But after 1933 well  34  they started pulling back and also we did not want them to be embarrassed by associating with us because it you know  some a third party might might say the you know  there was one  his name was Willie Wrobleski  I f and they were very poor working family.
But th ey -- he wasnt Jewish  her -- her husband  she was the one who was Jewish.
But I was happy because I could be home with the family.
And they all had the children  and they were my cousins  and my aunts.
Please marry Paul  he can't be alone.ﬂ She said  ﬁI won't marry a Jew.ﬂ I said  ﬁYou can live with him and you 30 can be your boyfriend and you 29 R.L.: Renata meant to say ﬁWe lived a very much an after the war life–ﬂ 30 R.L.: Renata meant to say ﬁhe.ﬂ Renata Laqueur 26 February 7  1998 won't marry him?ﬂ She said  ﬁMy family wouldn't let me.ﬂ I said  ﬁHe's not a Jew  he's baptized.ﬂ Any could we go over this  she married him  they have four children.
>> Dora Klayman: The Runjak family  because they were very close  very devout family  apparently the priest said to Mrs. Runjak  according to this oldest daughter who is still alive  or she was in 2010 when I was there  who told me that the priest had come and said to Mrs. Runjak \ What are we going to do with these children?
One family was put on in...two or three families were put on one room.
And so I wound up in the hospital and I-I just -- after many  many weeks -- I remember asking for my sister  not for my family  because I -- I was just heartbroken that she was tr -- you know  she didnt want to s -- she would tell me that I have to survive because she doesnt want to stay -- be alone.
Its  its a part of the thought process that never leaves you but I did but as a young wife and then later a mother  I was so bu sy trying to raise a family in happy circumstances that the children knew that family had been in Vienna and that I was from Vienna.
You see  I was pulling out -- I broke some few bricks  taking off my arm band  I smuggled out myself into the other side  where I could bring a little bit some better nourishment for my family.
In one family  somehow one person from that family somehow escaped and came to our ghetto.
And she had  herself  she had five sisters and a brother  but they were all born in Hungary  in Budapest  as far as I know  in Budapest.
Tell me a little bit about your mother and your father.
Yes  I do -- I -- I did under stand and I actually foo -- you know  in my family  it was not the custom to -- in -- in the Ukraine [indecipherable] to speak Yiddish -- Right. --
As a teenage I already was earning a living  going to school at the same time working  earning a living  being responsible for helping the family  being responsible for helping the education which was very went to high school.
After that  I remember also that must have been already when the family from Warsaw came  as a refugees to our home  because I wa I remember that the the son in that family  who I dont know  he was me he was like a teenager maybe ni maybe 18  and this took me  with little flowers  and lifted me wa up at one time  as the recruits were going to be put on they had trains to go to fight the Germans in the west.
My wifes family took us in like -- like a family.
I could answer people which I was with their family in the same wagon...how they locked it and how they lived through the journey to Treblinka and the last time I...when I saw them.
Had by that time you heard about what was happening to the Jews in other countries?
I work  my family  my work made me forget my wife.
>> Edna Friedberg: Thank you for sharing your story today. [
My father and mother was f our years in World War First in working camp in Germany and said to us  because we was family we survived.
Tell us then  uh  what happened to this family when the Germans came?
Tell me a little bit about your father  your mother  and any siblings you might have had.
And so she  Im sure  was very instrumental to convince my father  you know  look  a-as difficult as it is to leave our family and -- and our -- and y-y-you know  our place in Kiel  you know  with family   we have to protect ourselves  we have to protect our children  we have to leave this hellhole.
Interview with Susan Berlin March 7  2003 13 S -- your family gave away most of their possessions  but what -- what could your family take with them and what could you take with you when you left?
And as you were gr-growing up  did you have any kind of religious background?
It was Catz  is family name  Catz you pronoun ce it  C-a-t-z  Moisei M-o-i-s-e-i  which was Moishe in terms of a Jewish name  but they -- it was a lucified name of -- the variational form of Moishe or Moisei.
And then th -- this family found another place for us.
Very lovely  I love them very much  and I am a very family oriented person.
This is my son and his wife and their two children  and this is my daughter's family.
How -- If you can remember  and if your parents told you later  how were their lives affected after 1933?
And before we do that  Id like to get a sense of what your family was like  what memories do you have of your family  of your sister  of your mother.
In the course of two days every member of the family would get a package.
Yes  no more in hiding and I wa s this family  old  sick  uneducated people who Edwarda Rorat 6 February 25  1996 Page 6 saved my life and who are poor  who work hard  and I also work hard with them.
I was sort of the bridge  or the glue of the family that kept the two sets of kids together.
And shove into the -- I was thinking about my family  you know.
And he says  you know  theres ka all ki theyre so cluster  theyre so exclusive  theyre so see with Janet and and Stanley he was used to  you know  being included  Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 165and he thought that every Jewish family is like that  that they would that if they like somebody they would sort of  yeah  gree t him as their own.
I was first on the list  Lisa was the first  the whole family is.
Please tell me where you were born  when you were born  and a little bit about your family.
From the first day of their occupation your family and community were immediately subjected to profound upheaval.
The two sisters -- the daughter of one of the sisters  and their parents  my grandparents  were taken to Auschwitz at the same time  and the same place.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 12 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: it certainly felt like sometimes more than a day I think.
So the whole -- your whole family managed to stay together?
And the lady wh at she took me out -- the family what she took me out  she gave me some clothes from her.
My mother was a very religious person; my father was not  but my mother was very religious.
For Shabbat  the orthodox families wanted me to have them with me because they didn't trust the other family and then the cousins who work ed all of that--to get me into the Un ited States--they di d not agree with anybody.
Coincidentally  my family  my mother  my father  my sister  my brother-in-law  they were already in a different part of  of the country.
And come to find out  he had been a musician with one of the Dorsey bands  and he had gone over to Germany to settle a family estate or something and he'd been cap tured.
You don't have personal memories of most of that but tell us what you have learned and what you know about that period  about your family.
So when the Germans would find under the circumstances -- would find me at that house and they would realize that I am Jewish  everybody would be killed.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: I don't know if it was with another family but my mother's brother's family  his wife and son  my cousin went to the same town.
Her name was Rena Gortz and she had left a -- a child with a family -- a Polish family and she was looking for the child.
You were in your uncle's house  but did you ever go to the apartment where you lived with your family?
She was born as one of four sisters to a family where the head of the household  meaning her father  my grandfather  Hersh Aram  was a hat maker.
I know of a Polish family or a Lithuanian family in Wilno that will keep yo u as Christians.
And we went into Germany  we went to a place called Konigheim  where my wife ca was born  and her the family lived there.
Thank you very much Mr. Hieminga for agreeing to speak with us today  and to share some of your experiences during World War II.
We will try to see your your family is in Rawa Russkaya .
Of course now its becomes much more difficult to go as a family  but we still try to to travel when we can.
And she was married to an official of Macys in New York and felt that during the time that they escaped from Russia  people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah team spoke excellent Russian.
As a little aside  somehow I think my family and Walter lost contact for some time.
He had a car for us  and he took us to a family that in in New York   where we spend the night.
I -- I was raised in a strict Orthodox family  more or less my father belonged to Hassidim.
Of course  there were other people who came in and out  hiding.
Simcha at some point before '42  everybody else in '4 2 except for my father and his family.
And she took me from London to where my Foster family lived outside Norridge.
Just prior to that your father had left Germany and gone to -- excuse me  had gone to A achen  Germany   but left and then returned.
And her f that family lived ther e and Im in touch with the cousin.
There were other families who got beaten up  many of them.
Those girls that I met through the family  at age 18 were dating and going to the movies and theaters and all of that  all those things were unknown to me.
When that child  or adult for that matter  died  the family just got a notice  your so and so passed away  and that was it.
And I would say we were content to be where we were  but the constant worry about the family left behind was always there.
15 >> You talked about many different people who helped you survive this time   people who risked their lives to save your lives and those of your family.
He was a self taught individual who cared very much about the family.
The family  and what was  talk a little bit about  could you  Mrs. Scheuer about what it was like in the family camp.
>>Bill Benson: And what did that mean  at that point  to be liberated?
His family wa s just in as much jeopardy as anybody else.
And we lived in the same apartment  because it was my parents' apartment building.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 >> Bill Benson: And no doubt learned a great deal from you from the research that you've done.
And that's how I ended up being placed with the Madna family.

>> Bill Benson: David  your mother -- your family owned Passover dishes that were hundreds of years old.
I dont know  it might have been discussed among my my family  like my uncles and my au my grandmother  or even my aunt who lived with us.
And there was fr 34 So there was no reas yeah  there was no reason for her to stay in No  no  no after you know  after a period of time  we were there  you know  she she you know  the family is gone  you know.

What they would do is they would mix the Jewish children in with the -- it was like a Quaker orphan age -- with other children.
Being that was only twelve kilometers from Rovno and my family lived in Rovno  and I didnt see them for a long time  I decided to go to Rovno to see my family.
02:45:49 5 Holy One (Aramaic); Jewish prayer said to hon or the dead  especially close family members.

So I said  ﬁYeah  the mink stole is the president  but wouldnt I be able to buy my wife a mink stole  I would never be a president of the family circle.ﬂ So naturally they didnt like -- also they didnt like it because a lot of times I said something what they didnt like.
Well  I asked about the anger  because its striking to me that you came out of the war and you had lost  your whole family had been killed.
Here the matzos are so small  you know  and back home the matzos were huge  you know  like for a whole family nah.
I was the youngest of the whole family  actually  except for the baby t hat you saw in the picture.
And then my aunt had a -- excuse me -- she had daughters too  they were in that house.
How do you do that without any family  without any friends  without any advisors.
My philosophy ba sically was to let them do  know that they should depend on each other  stick together as a family.
We were  in a sense  a close -knit family  but not that we played Interview with Robert Max July 14  2015 23 together.
So we slept on one side  and the other family of four slept on this side  in the barracks.
People attended the service and somebody took that picture which somehow arrived in my mothers hand and she saved it through the entire ordeal of my family lifes until -- then brought it to the United States.
If a political prisoner died  the stuff had been packed and sent to the family.

So  my sister after three months she saw a boy who worked for my father and she said you tell my family that I'm going to see   to be with because she found out that he is dead.

Certainly at the beginning I had to establish first my family.
Yaffa Elliach with her family wa s already in his house.
Uh the only other family wa s a German family   no  a Swiss family  and they were Christian Scientists and they had lived for m any years.
This is tape two  side A  and we were talking about your staying in the tent and watching the family eat and the -- your fathers response.
And my father  being a mountain climber  would join us in August  when we usually would go in the Dolomites   sometimes in Va-Val dAoste   but usually the Dolomites   and almost always  the whole family would manage to go  cousins  aunts  uncles  to the same place.
They didn't have any family  so nobody knew who they are.
I came -- I was raised as an Orthodox child  I came from an Orthodox home.
So what was the reaction of your father and of you?
Uh now in that family  only two of their relatives knew that we were there.
She was only eighteen years old  but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's brother and the whole family who were Germans  lived at that time in Palestine  so she explained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they permitted.
So  nine children all together  then older  extended family  the spouses and my cousin s. And I am aware of many other names  from letters  photographs  occasional visits from out of town.
And did you and your family believe what you were hearing?
He married a girl also from a Nazi family  a judge  a Nazi judge who didnt want any part of him  but he was the other Jewish guy.
No  in Romania  we were not living with any other family member other than the eight of us.
I can only compare my family  for instance  to this other woman who w-was a witness in Italy and -- and went through that -- who came  also as a counseled stude nt.
And in fact  it was a sort of a joke in the family that people always ask me  you know  who was the Prime Minister of England  or who was the president of America  or whatever else  and I always knew the answer  even when I was in kindergarten.
My fathers family a s I said was an old German family  totally assimilated.
And then they went to one house  scale  weigh it  and every man had to go home with a little bit for the family.
But was  for Shabbas  everything what you needed  he was he knew already every family  every this.
I knew the Germans were close by  so I said why do I have to stay here  there is nothing to do anyway now  why wont I go with you and help you to evacuate your family to Lubov and then we will together co me back to the station to work.
I wanted to ask  during your experience moving from camp to camp and seeing everything that you did  I read that you're from a very religious family.
I grew up as a child  and I had a very early and happy early childhood.
That kind of thing  but when you go deeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means  then I'm beginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense  in terms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend.
Interview with Edith Langer 54 Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington?

How did life progress for your family during these occupation years  between 41 and 44?
S: At that time I assumed that I would be in Israel and I am going to establish a family life eventually.
And that's where we lived fo r eight years until I moved in here and I considered myself very lucky to be in a family like this and my life here was quite normal.
But that was one of your hobbies  you found the members of your family all over the world.
So And about approximately  when did you leave for the United States ?
Youve commented several times about the lo ss of family  and your desire to continue and to have your own family.
And some of those feeling of insec and they were feelings of insecurity  may have played into into why when I came to the States   and came to the Jewish Childrens Bureau in Chicago   who was our s-sponsor  and then having to go from one foster home to another foster home  and then finally  eventually  landing with a family who were a stable family  who wanted to adopt me.
So for a couple times I went with her  just out of respect for her and her family.
The big beef  when they needed it or wanted it -- an uncle of mine was the butcher part of the family business.
But at that moment when when this happened  the partition happened in 1948  at that time I was in the United States and my my father was in Canada and he did not have too much he did not make too much of an effort at that time to go to Palestine  even though we had family in Palestine at that time  and I received Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25  1998 17[indecipherable] from Palestine  but at that time it was not settled yet [indecipherable] After the birth of the state  there was the the war  and there have been subsequent wars.
So yes I was friends with her  she had a very nice family.

And the eyes and the shapes  there isnt one that belongs to my side of the family  nothings come out.

And I was wondering how -- how that played out in your own family?
So then you con you were the only child in the family.
My mother  father  and three of us  my sisters  all three kids.
But when you were in the larger family you felt Yeah  Im just one of the kids  Im fine  yeah.
But  I remember there was a Jewish family  the clo who lived the closest to us  by the name  the Fleischmanns .
I know that in the Pariser family one of the kids who was a student by that time  he went to Canada.

We were free of them and  of course  I left my family and all of them.
In -- in November  December  I think  our family started splitting up.
And my father was -- he devised something which I think ma ny Jewish family did with their naivete or their idiocy or whatever.
We dont want to go really  because we feel even more lonely when we go to another family and they have so much family and we sit there just the two of us.
And we settled in that apartment until the...the Germans came in.
He had heard that we were such a uh charmi ng German family and uh we were uh  we would be hospitable he was su re  and uh so on and so forth  and he went on and on and on  and he's so ha ppy that he finally met us.
Ella  I suppose  of all of your surviving family is the one that was the most involved in the Holocaust.
And to tell you the truth when I go up to the family plot  I talk to my father.
And I didn't stay so long so there I have   when I speak even though I was there but I must not speak of Auschwitz because that's where  it was the last day when I came with family  that was the last day on earth for my en tire family.
You said before that you came from a middle class family.
My -- I didnt want to leave to -- my family  but I was a -- probably by then a little Z-Zionistic inclined.
My mother comes from a big family  eight children  four boys and four girls  and she was the oldest.

What woul d you want the people of Straubing to know about your family?
And I -- but because the good relationship that my family had w ith the town and with -- with -- with the cities  thats who we got along.
They...its give them to renew the sens e of belonging so that gives them also more security  more defense  that in case someth ing happens  they know they have to...they...as ever a man to whom they can go and open their arms and their pains and and their problems and so on  and there were  believe me  everyone had a full heart and pains 86himself or his family or his parents  or his friends  and that we want to get a .

My mother used to correspond with him because she was the only one writing to him about all the whole family.
His private library was his first love after his family I think  and teaching  and he collected rare books.
It will this follows  we had a fairly large family in Budapest.
The Jewish community by that time I lived in Berlin  my family had moved to Berlin  and there they had a very good Jewish school  whose teachers  many of them were college professors who had lost their j obs  who later on sometimes became quite famous individually  as scholars in Israel or in the United States .
Well  to me it sounds like an amazing achievement to keep a family together when so much was working against that happening.
What about being aware of what was happening to the Jews?
>> Bill Benson: After several months in Issoudun your parents then decided to go to Villefranche.
So if you were a family that was given one room  then you were okay.
I invited her to keep th e peace in the family  right?
There was nobody there that lived there that -- that knew my family.
And they were very social  and I mean thats the way the family conducted itself.
Tell us about your family and your childhood before the war.
I mean  family that might have been living in another town?
>> Bill Benson: Even though he wasn't able to own it.
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
>> Jill Pauly: My family didn't own it for 400 years.
Uh  so this was mostly what was going on  there was a lot of hunger  there was  food was not available.
After the war when my father found me   he left me with the priest because he didnt know -- he went to look for most of the family.
Not anymor e. As I said  now that the children are grown up and they're wonderful  and I have a family whic h I adore  not anymore.
He  that caused a big rift in our family initially because he was pretty fanatic about it and he wrote things like  you 27 know  you if you Jesus you know what was Jews were damned if you don't believe in Jesus you're damned and all that other stuff.
So life was -- people were already  as I told you -- we had a friend in our family who was picked up by the Gest apo  he was put into a basement  and he wa -- with -- with a group of other Jews  and he was told  say your last prayers  were gonna -- youre gonna be executed.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
Yes  as I mentioned to y ou  our our family tradition was that we were not we we never went to the railroad station  we said goodbye at home and then he went to the railroad station himself.
Q. Tell me a little bit about your life in the Ghetto  how it was?
My father went to some othe r family  and my mother and I  and sister  went to Calivare  which is a suburb of Athens  to this wonderful family of a couple  the name was Pavella.
And these parents although  my father went to before we left  and they had two daughters and family  they couldve easily come along.
And everybody was very cr-crying  seeing me  just everybody was crying  so had the -- this -- the -- Aunt Sura  and Aunt Fanny  and the family came back  and Aunt Sura had two boys  and one of them happened to be -- he was much older than me  but he was not at war  it seems to me  but I dont remember him during the war.
So  oh  yes  I remember very well the family who came to stay with us.
There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister  or -- and after that he begged me not to come  because he didnt open the door  because he said the neighbors know  they noticed it.
Then she went on to join the family in the Dominican Republic.
So I remember Shabbat when our family were together  so sometimes place my father also make Kiddush and I didn't refuse.
From my perspective today  when I look back to conditions before the war  I must say that the family living before the war was much more cohesive.
While I was in Belgium and when my father went to work one day  oh -- within a week or so of the occupation and his boss said to him that he felt that my dad should take his family and leave.
Excuse me my dear before we get to 1942  would you tell about the family with whom you stayed?
They don't want them staying in Sweden with a family they don't know.
And between the this time what we in in Vranov  in Michalovce   we went to Prague end of the year to look for someone if we were some on the Jewish organizations  if they will give some on the Red Cross  if they will give some some i-information about our family members  but we didnt get anything.

Then they were moving us place to place  and they took us out from our homes and they put us in like not Ghettos yet  in the beginning.
When my husband and I were stationed in Japan  I'd been asking my family here in America to try and find some pictures of my family  and they did find some  but none of them looked like my parents and sister that I remembered.
But she -- I heard -- the last I heard of her that she was adopted by a na -- a Canadian family and was going to be brought -- To Canada ? --
And he you know  he felt that he had arrived at a really good  American family.
They tried if possible  if they could  they tried  uh  a family with four children...uh  mama  papa  child.
Yes  my wife was -- came from camp  or a different camp  to look for her family and she met my uncle  which they were sort of related.
That was after the defeat of France and so we -- we -- we didnt lose contact  because we were in correspondence  but in December 1941  Elizabeth and her family left France for America.

Tell me a little bit about your mother and the family that she came from.
3 memory were glows in radiance of lilac trees against open blue skies   with soun ds of good neighbors   fabulous cousins and family  kindness and trust and love.
Then the Germans went house by house  chase out the Jew s  then the synagogue.
And then I had one other sister who was close to my oldest sister in age.
When we came with my mother  we came to Kiev because I wanted to -- I wanted to study in the same school which my father did for [indeci pherable] like this family.
So your family was pretty well off financially  to have a maid?
And then my -- he finally made it  and then he came there -- he lived in Haarlem  thats a small town  and -- and he came home and the whole family from both sides were -- a lot of them from that town too  were there waiting for me.
When our family stood before the German who made the decision  the leader from the ghetto  he said to my father  you strong  my mother is good  my sister but because of me we have to go left.
But I don't think that I will be true to mine brother  to my family of 300 from before the war  to my colleagues to our...to whic h I went to school  to my colleagues who later were the heroic fighters in the Warsaw ghetto  to the simple people  my neighbors who perished fo r...for nothing.
But you know  but being intelligentsia  or being the family of army of army of or family of of police  or intelligent  or in the jury so you had In the court system  yeah.
And I had a -- oh  for two years  when we lived in this place  which was called Santangelo de Jarno  I had -- and I lived with a family -- my family  but als -- came very often  but I also had this wonderful family who was Istytotw iss.
So my father was very unnerved  you've got to do this because that might put me  the family  the community in a very sensitive dangerous position.
Its good  he is a good man  he is a Polish Jew who [indecipherable] and very good children and grandchildren  good family a nd he loved my mother.
Now  my girlfriend suggested that what had happened is that the parents had taken different cars to go to Maquis  and they didn't tell the kids about it  because they didn't want -- if somebody got picked up  they didn't want the word to get around that there were more of the family on the train.
Well  we stayed with my family there for several days and their friends and families were notified and they all came to get them with their papers  as did my uncle.
First of all  let me thank you for taking the time to conduct this interview with us  and I would like to return to your early years and I would like to ask you about your family and about your town.
My aunt  I'm told by the Runjak family -- one of the daughters is still alive.
This one soldier  he knew our family because his mother was a midwife and helped to deliver some of my grandmother's children  but he didn't reveal our identity.
But  I think once or twice I did hear that they met somebody from the family.
And so I learned Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 87 More.
He was a very wealthy man  but  you know  this not even a Jewish -- Jews usually leave their estates to their family.
No  Im just  you know  as I said  I was very lucky  I had a wonderful English family.
I dont even  I dont even know that I told them that I was Jewish.
They gave me a little room in a building  in the same building my aunt lived downstairs with my cousin and her husband and child and another guy  another family lived next door and they made an .
You know  when I was running at night from one place to another  and I saw those lights in the homes and sometimes I heard laughter or talking in a normal way  family to family  I was so envious that those people lived normal and I run like a beaten up dog with constant fear with constant such heaviness in my head.
I remember salt mines that we visited once where we went through  yes  we did get family visits in Vienna of course  usually my other aunt Marianne  his youngest sister  would come and be in his mother's house when we visited.
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother as people.
Oh  to the -- in my house  oh well  so I see that -- I see the family  with little children and I -- I says -- Tell us just about walking in -- on to your street to go into your house.
So it had been in the family for quite some time.
I tried to learn how to play something  how to sing  so I could make a living  not for myself but for my family  so I could help my dad because he was ill.
By December we had a kind of family meeting and I just felt that I could not stay there.
And so I will not speak  because my family  naturally  was very happy.
So  I mean for my father  s -- being immobilized  first of all because of his -- of his leg  but even because of hiding  you know  when -- even people who were fully functional were -- couldnt roam around the streets  you know  from fear of bei ng seen by somebody  denounced  there were many of -- of this kind of people  in fact  you know  my family  as I know from my brother  were found by Rekanati  who was a -- a Jew  a Salonika Jew who worked for the Germans  and well  he was  you know  shot.
Oh  I heard about -- I heard about -- talk about the big word and -- we used in my family for anti-Semitism is called rischous.
And she tried to tell me that she and her whole family were never Nazis.
So this period  from the end of the war until December 1947  you were working for your family or continuing your education?
Did you in those first four or five years feel any need to discuss your experiences in Dachau with say with friends  with family?
From there  we traveled by train to...overnight stay in New York City and then to New Haven  Connecticut  where we joined my grandparents and my family.
She feels guilty because there were so many shining  singular individuals in her family and she feels that why her  and -- and why did they perish and why did she survive?
Yes  and and she had a family and and her her daughters still live in Lodz.
Speaking of your son and your daughter  when you were raising them  did you tell them about what you went through?
As I said  all my spare time I spent with this one Jewish family that had befriended me.
When were you -- when did you have to go and live in the ghetto?
They found another job for me  which was equal almost in pay as the one Id lost  and they said  ﬁYoure just what were looking for   well give you that job ﬂ and there was All of a sudden my immediate Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 38 problem to earn enough money for my family was gone.
When you were on the train  were other people talking about what was going to happen?
Tell me a little bit about your fami ly and your life before the war.
I don't know if the family name strikes you  but the Wrightmans are billionaire developers.
>> Bill Benson: And after your father was deported  you and your family were sent to a ghetto.
Were there any family items or religious artifacts that -- that were incl uded in the things that you took?
I just wanted to know why  and then  did you and your family eventually get like dual citizenship with Israel now that you can go back and forth to the area as you please?
But when my mother was arrested  and I became the moth er in the family  I lost interest in things.
There were no--I think we were the--yes--there was one other family  unfortunately.
I really...the last two months maybe also persuaded me to leave  and the little girl survived  who's now married  lives in Israel  has family.
My mother was the oldest of 12 children  and my father was the youngest of six.
I wanted a child so badly  because I felt that I owed this to my family.
In those days  if you had a very smart person in the family  you had to defer to that person because you couldnt disturb the genius at work.
And if you like my husband  he was in the army  and his family was with me  in the you know.
And I also asked in the Centre d'Accuiel whether anybody had seen anybody of my family and somebody said from the description  they think they know my brother.
>> Bill Benson: When your father was taken away for forced labor  do you know where he went and what he did?
Q. This is probably a strange question  but by thinking that your family was probably not alive any more  did that free you at all from having to worry about then and think about them?
Interview with Paula Bronstein November 10  2008 52 and wanted to have a family.
But at home in Berlin   German was how you spoke  yes?
They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer some of my message to the family if I know the address.
He was one of the youngest in the family so we're dealing with an extended family about 50 odd people.
10 Q. You just traveled  just your family  that was it?
My father  my mother  my brother  my sister  theyre all dead  and I was intent on starting a new generation  a new family.
I think the fact that he was a very good person who was an old  old family in Frankfurt   I think helped to some extent.
About two weeks before we were liberated  I had a friend in school who came from a very Orthodox Jewish family and the 15 people of that family were hidden somewhere.

How was your family affected by the de pression when it began in the early 30s?
Tell us what it was like in the ghetto and how your family was able to manage once you were forced into the ghetto with the remaining Jews from your community.
I kept this right in front of it  with my family pictures  organizations  everything.
No  I was just thinking of -- of German  and I just wondered about  have you ever had any German friends in America?
But  we were living with my grandparents at that time  and an aunt  and an uncle  and some cousins.
They went to South Amer ica  to Paraguay  which they had family there.
Like  the Jewish Welf are Office was trying to get one child out of every Jewish family and I was designated to go to England  they found foster homes.
His sister  Nehama  though  who lived in Lukow with her family  you know I wrote down that her name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein.
Somehow there was a Doctor Kilina who liked Rene alot and he took him home  back to Czechoslovakia and Rene became part of his family  kind of.
>> Bill Benson: So you stayed  the family stayed in Bride -les -Bains for almost -- for two years.
And I spend my six years -- the firs t six years in Athens  and after Occupation when the Italian came to Athens  one of them was friend of my father  and he came to our house  and he told us about the German -- what they are doing in Europe  and they told to my father \ Mr. Cohen  take your whole family away to the mountains with the partisans and save yourself.\
I mean  we were learning Polish as well  but Polish was a language 5 Polish history and Polish was taught in Polish.
We are a small family  but we always have lots of celebrations.
>> Bill Benson: You were left then with a couple of your sisters  three  I believe.
So there was one other Interview with Vera Levine 26 February 7  2013 Jewish family in Ipswich and they invited me to tea.
So at the time yo u had your mother  you and your sister  the three of you?
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
So  anyway we used all the relatives and we rented a car.
Until I was two and a half years old  thats when my family moved to -- my father had a new position  and we moved to Berlin  but not to Berlin Dahlem yet  but we stayed in -- in another half suburb of Berlin  which was known for being nice  and quiet  and cheap.
My grandparents -- my father's parents and many of his sisters and brothers  except one  they lived in Poland.
>> Bill Benson: We won't talk about this today  but Margit just returned with Anne and family to a trip to see the relatives in Australia and Tanzania.
I  I am the youngest; I was the youngest of six children.
What you did and what your family did when--and what happened?
That was the time we were not -- >> Bill Benson: In the cellar.
W e are a known family because the Lok iecs there were houses we owned.
Anyway  my grandfather and my father  my grandmother -- they all fled to Poland.
>> Bill Benson: And then do you know how it was actually arranged to get you out?
I n 1940 when the Germans invaded Belgium  Michel and his family fled to the south of France and ended up in Marseille.
And next day we left and it wasnt too far away from my cousin where I met my father.
We are now the only family [indecipherable] and you will get along.
Your family was fairly affluent and under the Lithuanians and the Russians  did they allo w all of this privilege?
Anyway  the what what happened to me was  my parents  in those chaotic days  which were in October of 1943  not knowing exactly what would happen  they decided to place me with a non-Jewish family  a colleague of my father  they were both lawyers  and they fer they thought that would be the safer thing to do.
No  but we were we we we found a place in Lwow with with this Mr. Schiffman family  who was related to the business of my stepfather.
You have no idea  it's still  you know  America has a lot of faults  but it's still  I think  the greatest country in the world and when you have lived  you know  under those terrible dictatorships  you really get to appreciate it  you know and you h ave to  you know  this is it  for better or for worse and we could  I don't think that any  any presidential Eva Edmands 78 [Date not labeled] Page 78 candidates today  running in '96 are especially inspirational and I think politics have taken a very negative turn  very nasty turn and I do feel t urn off  I'll probably still vote  but I  at this time  I don't know who for  but I'm  I'm discouraged at the  at the direction the country's going with the decline in the family structures  the rising crime  the  and just  the senselessness of some  you k now  crimes that are committed  just for the sheer heck of it  it's  I'm not optimistic about the future of this country and at times I think that I'm grateful that we didn't have children  because I would be extremely worried about their future  and not o nly economically  but drug scene and AIDS and all these things which  you know  we really didn't have to deal with when I was young.
So they had to go through that area  so they came to find that from the family.
Because no  no  no member of my family finished high school.
They had a little daughter who was my age  a couple of months younger than me.
S he said I (inaudible) it will be j ust our family and (inaudible) since then she has (inaudible).
We left  and we went -- his parents were in Krakow  and his brothers and sister  so they want to be with the family.
These are one story houses in Pleven  very rustic  but we had a roof over our heads and at the beginning  you know  we were treated as guests  always having food prepared by those who already were living there  in the Pleven branch of the family.
>> Bill Benson: Back to a little bit about the early -- before the war began in your family  in the early years.
So you packed yo ur bags to go to Switzerland with your family.
In one of the conversations I remember was rather explosive in his home and I asked him point blank  telling him that a decent Pole  a Christian with the help of a few other priests saved my life  riski ng it every minute of the day and I asked him at one point  what did you do Uncle Sam to save your own family at the time when strangers were saving Jews lives?
What about when friends or neighbors knocked on your door or came in  and you didnt know if they knew about the baby  what -- Well -- -- how did -- how did your family handle that?
Maybe I told you before I had nice big family  so my fi rst cousins who lived in Warsaw were arrested and sent to Auschwitz.
But she was a very  we got along very well  my sister and I. She was a very good person.
I fell asleep with my head falling into my plate basically  of course being found much later by the family.
How do you think it was that your family was able to survive that?
Other people hadnt -- Well  it was -- but -- -- taken it  or -- -- n-no  other people had lived in our house  but the Germans had taken everything away.
He sat in that barn quiet  assuming that th e farmer will come in and he did but his only greeting was that to take us away  right away he will not subject his family to danger.
So so he says to to me  we c I we I come from a socialist family  dont kill us  dont kill us.
You had to move into the ghetto  and how long were you in the ghetto?
She was a year and a ha lf older than I was  but I was still the boy of the family.
>> Bill Benson: Before that happened  at some point your father really gave the family two options if you were to avoid what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe.
Ill tell you where the -- what -- what happened was  first of all I wa -- by the time I arrived it was already  I guess mid -- mid-1940 because I -- there was a layover in -- in -- in Japan for awhile  and def -- for quite awhile  for a number of months  I was simply w ith -- with the family and -- and just -- just -- just finding my way  in a sense  and that was very good because I didnt -- I didnt have to -- to -- to worry about  you know  about what just -- by just surviving  or living  or whatever it was.
They degraded us so  I was not caring anymore  but I promised my mother that I will take care the rest of my family so I...I di dn't care to be killed already.
I dont know exactly the name of the family that -- that my sisters were placed with.
When were in the second ghetto  I believe my cousins  my cousin  just my aunt and my  my and her younger daughter were with us.
He just told me the other day that he was in the exodus -- h e's about two years younger than I am -- a nd that his whole family was bombed and he lost a large part of his family.
And they took the whole family  the grandparents  the son and the two children  put them all into the echelon.
And did you observe the hol -- the Jewish holidays at home?
I was put on the U.S. Congress family unification list as a condition for the most favored nation clause   which was renewed every year -- Right. --
And as it turned out  that was the last time I saw my parents.
Me  my mother  my father and the two brothers  my tw o brothers and my mother's sister and aunt.
I di -- I didnt know if my parents were Zionists or something.
Let's start with you telling us a little about your family in your own early years before the Anschluss in 1938.
Did you maintain a relationship with this family  this Christian family that the man  I guess  was the landlord or the superintendent of your building  once things got worse?
My mother would knit socks for the whole family and so while we had to leave the house and went two blocks away to another family  she took her knitting along but very close to the house she lost the yarn  so we walked and the yarn unwound and  you know  the whole path with the yarn behind her (laughter) and we found it very funny.
If you talk there too much -- And were they a -- were they a Jewish family?
Around the corner and on the other side of this railway conductor's family  was a machine tool shop.
And I dont remember where my my mo fathers family lived.
Yeah  but nevertheless  your family wa-was among the minority to help others  to help Jews.
And as people were beginning to ask us to take care of asylum seekers  refugees and asylum seekers from many different countries who look -- resided in this country  and whod been to rtured and violated in many different ways  and lost sometimes  all their members of their family  that made me feel that we needed to move on.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  eventually  you would be with your family  you would be deported to Riga  Latvia.
Well  I rem -- first of all  looking at our general family constellation  some of the most interesting and fun thi ngs that -- that we did  meaning Paul and I did as children  was to go and visit our relatives.
The Dewey St orm family  the first ship  they give away to Israel as a gift.
I was there in the summer of 37 and 38 and my family was there also in the summer of 39.
And then if you didn't have an ID  you were unattached  you didn't have any family or children  they'd push you over with us  the working people   able -bodied people  whether a man or woman  they saved all of those.
And my parents had obviously been great supporters of the Jewish community.
>> Bill Benson: In September 1940  your father returns to Paris.
That was never - I said  ﬁBut if you want to know  anything you want to know  I will tell you.ﬂ And every now and then I would relay an anecdote  and of course  they saw the films  and were very close - our family gene rally  you know  our family - the Lermans and the Wilsons and the kids and the grandkids - were very  very close.
You know  in a small villages in small cities  the older brother is the head of the family.
So we had...even my father said  \ This business is for hundred ten years in the family.
Can you tell me a little bit about the family who you were hidden with?
But before we turn to the war  tell us what you can about your family and your community in those years before the war began.
So even years after  we  the family and my daughter  were putting out search inquiries about the Red Cross and other groups that traced survivors who had not been accounted for  trying to find out what happened to him.
So I -- so  at -- in this neighborhood at th -- at that time  I didnt even -- I wasnt aware that everybody was white in the neighborhood until a black family moved in and nobody said anything  everything was fine.
Only to show one family  three kids  two could take it  and one ki d  they was worried her one kid.
They i n my in Rokiıkis   my parent s were told that the the house is too big  too luxury for for for a family  that we have to take in some families.
Well  after a while when things had simmered do wn  we were told that in that letter in one of the letters  I dont know which one  whether the one in the suitcase or the one in the pocketbook that was sent out  a message was sent to the family that was sending to packages to Krysia that if they receive this letter because of course there was important information that had to be sent out in that co ncealed envelope that if they receive this information that should include in the food p ackage that they are sending one hard-boiled egg  which will be an indication that they know what is going on and that they received it.
Uh  Barbara  would you tell me  um  a little bit about uh growing up  about your family?
My brother tried to pick edelweiss for his moth er and fell to his death and they found him with edelweiss in his hands  so edelweiss in my family was something very special.
So tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
We had there too but we didn't talk about it  and this was given by a Jewish family that we should take care of it  and this is empty.
But then they had not and you cannot even blam e the people what they did because from the first day on  the very first publications after World War 2  produced in Poland  by famous researchers like Dr. for example  he pu blished the very first book on Auschwitz and it's a good one  I ha ve that in both languages  in Ge rman and in  in  in Polish  which he forwarded to me because I  that's always activ e and tried to keep in touch with the post-war 66 Auschwitz family of inmates  I me an  it's not the families  but we go t a small family of people who tried to stay in touch with.
There were German refugees like myself and Captain Harber  we knew had been born into a Jewish family  but we didnt know what his sympathies were  that he had been converted.
I was so hungry for family  and I had in America   my fathers side  and my mothers side.
76 Yeah  from my family  from my fathers family some went.
My family in the United States ha ving been notified that we were alive was sending communications to us and the family w hom my mother had hidden in our apartment the night that they came  and those friends of hers  that whole family survived the war  the two children having been hidden that night when Freddie and I were hidden...those two children were hidden too separately and the two adults were hidden separately and all 20 managed to survive the war...and at the end of the war uh we made contact with them again  my mother did  and when my mother became very sick we were sent to the country where they were living out in the country  and my mo ther  with much pain and some surgery and much help from America  died in uh March  the beginning of March of 1945 9.
We have -- we carry no pictur es with us -- we didnt carry any pictures with us during the war  obviously  and any family pictures we had we -- either they were disposed or not given to us after the war.
My grandparent -- grandmother brother used to have apartment building and one apartment was -- before war in Sacz  and one apartment was vacant  so our family just moved to this apartment.
Had -- were your parents born there and their parents or what -- what was the history of your family in that area?
DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 25 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Jewish police; at least not our family.
And knowing her family  the main thing is about overcoming that.
My mother  father  and three of us  my sisters  all three kids.
Although it has been so many years  such a horrible thing has been committed to Jewish people.
And you were born in Budapest   after your parents had moved to Hungary ?
The same when I came back from the service  you know  I could have done other things  but I you know  we we we were family oriented and you know  there was an obligation  a family loyalty and would have never consider ed  you know  picking up and going elsewhere.
But they were s-saying we are staying here and if you want  we can take Chava as a family member  and we will take enormous care of her  whatever we can do for -- for us  well do for her.
And o on my mothers side  there was my mother  a sister and two brothers  and his mother her mother  as well.
You grew up in Haifa with your newl y constituted family?
Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 33 And there was a an aunt there  and there were again some  but they were members of the family  younger. [
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 146 And did you  during the time your family was all split apart  that is  your brothers are in the in the forces.
But n-not the families  there were people arrested  whoever was  you know  they wanted to arrest.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 28 And at that time  was -- were you all -- you and your father still holding out some -- some hope that even though what you knew that you thought maybe your family would come back?
The fact it is the ﬁNew York Times ﬂ ran a picture of my family in the front page  like an [indecipherable] with the valise  cardboard valise  the refugee for Naples  because most of refugee coming to New York were from Bremenhaven.
And they got married by us  you know  was [indecipherable] his family couldnt be th ere  was in Germany  hi s fra -- fa -- parents  his brother lived in France.
And  did your parents have any contact with Jewish families  Jewish people?
A nd -- but -- but from -- for us  fo r the family it was war  because my mother was alway -- all the time crying about he r sisters in Warsaw and their grandchildre -- For -- -- about her daughters and the grandchildren  in spite -- in the -- 39  in the beginning  before the war start  they were all in Wilna  at our summer house  and when their vacation finished they went -- the sister with the brother-in-laws went to Warsaw  and th e children was ver -- left with us.
And I -- I have very optimistic -- Im very optimistic about his -- his future  and of course he wants to have a family  he told me  which -- which I am very happy about.
And they were trying to encourage people to have a large family  so motherhood was very big.
So he didn't feel that he could take a family  wondering about if there would be milk for her and what kind of conditions.
I will never forget the Seders  the warm feeling of being with all my family  and with strangers  because we always -- my grandparents invited strangers  this was a tradition  from orphanage  soldiers who were of Jewish origin who did not have place to go to.
We could have gone I mean  we went walking  but we no longer would go  lets say  using this excursion boat  which one of our neighbors we lived right on the river  a-and they were a family of fishermen who also owned a little excursion steamer motorboat.
Can you tell us a little bit more about your childhood  about the town that you grew up in?
Well  we had relatives here  and tha -- actually  these people had honeymooned in -- in Budapest  and looked up my parents because they were related somehow or other.
I don't remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family car in the 1950's with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying.
The difference is my family were observant Jews  we observed everything we could  and we did  and this little girl's family was not observant.
Can you tell me about your early childhood and about your family?
Whereas my husband knew a lot more than I did  maybe because he was a boy  maybe because his -- you know  most of his family was killed.
Did your Jewish friends tend to be nonreligious as your family .
There was a Luxembourg family  a Jewish family from Luxembourg who--I'm sorry  who was  who did not get called.
I lived with one family and then I moved to a girls club.
They were ardent Zionists  and they had gone th ere in the 20s  and in fact one of the cousins whom we met on some of our trips back to Palestine  my mothers cousin  founded was a founder of a kibbutz  Kibbutz Yavne  and he had a very large family  which we met when we were there.
And father begged her to take us  his family  to hide.
My father was he he went he was the first  of course  member of the family to be to go to higher education  he went to the teachers college and then onto the university in Kaunas   and he became a teacher.
My parents knew Yiddish and spoke it to each other if they didnt want us to know.
They had family in Palestine  as it was then  and decided  \ Well  goodbye.\
Did you get together with the family on holidays and -- Not really.
There was another family  Shule who had a boy and a girl   but we didnt socialize with them.
What was the reunion like between your mother and your father and you?
So as I said  that was our biggest tragedy in the family.
The poverty was everywhere and when I think of that poverty  I think of them like of the closest family because ther e was no right for them to suffer such an end as these people did.
And and what After a few like to know  what did you what kind do you remember what you talked about with this man  and this family?
So I taught a lot of courses on marriage and personal development and on family interaction and on child development and on  some on communication and infant growth and development.
Then heres another picture oh  heres my English foster family  Raun and Edith Cornish.
My wife couldn't do it because she had her family and her grandmother  uncles and her sister in Palestine.
What year was it that your family left  I know you said... '51.
I felt I had been unjustly  I felt is not the word  I had been unjustly treated and so did my entire family and this is how you react to that.
So he -- and there was a doctor there that was from my husbands hometown  so they were friends.
But they dedicated the memorial and I decided at that point to take my family.
In Philadelphia   one day my brother -in -law  and the w hen my husband found his family he looked for his family  you know  and my sisters  we all married Jews.
What kind of role did Ju daism play with them growi ng up and with you and your family?
Actually  Id known about it all my life  cause my family was very instrumental in its creation.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 >> Dora Klayman: Well  yes  and of course  I didn't talk much about him from before the war and about that family.
We were an observant family  religiously speakin g. My father was at times  a cantor  conducting services for others.
My f mother-in-laws family was in the scrap metal business  and there was somebody that they knew that got a group together.
So  when it was when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town  then I spent  for example  time with this Runjak family  and they had rented from this other house which was now empty.
And at times  it was  they were going home  sort of  with victory  thinking that they killed partisans while they actually  the one that they killed was the ones in the family camp.
And not only I  but our whol e  family  because he was the resourceful one.
So  somehow  we got a little bit closer  because that was the only person that I could relate to that I felt like it was my family.
I stayed  incidentally I stayed with that first family just a year because during the war being head postmaster  he would receive advance notices of air raids.
My brother who was born in 1946  with his children and I love his family.
The family that she maintained contact with was sending to her packages  food packages  monthly so nobody could suspect that she was Jewish  because if you have family outside and they send you food packages  then you definitely Jews did not have anybody who was sending daily packages.
When does your family pack up the car and head into ha what was the journey like?
In fact that particular area was very fortunate because it was a farm area and everybody  uh  in the area was either a dairy farmer or a vegetable farmer and th e Schouten family had a dairy farm.
Can you tell me that one of the questions I usually ask is  how did your parents support the family  that is  and you kind of answered it now.
But my family  I -- I -- I do have family there.
But how did you were there  you came from a family where father was politically engaged  so how is that commented in the family  Hitlers rise to power and the rise of Nazism in general.
And you know  I have pictures here where the wh-where the whole family went bicycling.
H-How did you know that you had to leave the ghetto?
The people  in spite of all the  the taxation and the expropriation  and being prohibited from working and holding jobs  people still could survive on savings and on loans from family and so on.
Interview with Ezra Sherman May 16  2014 22 My family was modern.
Later we connected back in -- >> Bill Benson: That was your uncle  his wife and a couple kids  two children?
And the first thing that I wanted to ask you about is  is a little bit about your family life in Poland -- Poland. --
My pa rents had just been arrested and deported and now I am living -- I was living with a completely different family and the family atmosphere was totally different.
When you left Germany  were you able to say goodbye to family and friends?
speaks foreign language here] I: And the women who were alread y in this barrack had a family and there was a big  traumatic situations  because they knew th eir family were taken to  to concentration camp. [
Did you have  were all of your friends Jewish at the time?
When Ive gone through difficult times  I have felt that I was being punished  that I deserved it  becaus e I didnt suffer the same as my family did.
I went there and I helped with a family in the ghetto an d I brought them food.
To the Jewish people  Then in a couple months   they take us to the ghetto.
and a little bit of a life  did you go to synagogue?
He had a very bad ulcer  and in that ti me they didnt operate in Israel yet  so he had a family in the States  and they forced him to co me and to operate  but he didnt want to do on his 41 own  so he waited I should come  and I had two sma ll kids and I didnt want to part with Israel for no money.
And this large  extended family that y our father came from  did most of them stay in Austria ?
indecipherable] So you spent the rest of the war years doing this same work with this family?
During his second trip  he fall from the tramway and he died  and this way we were not able to get the papers for my brother and he remained in Soviet Union until 1973 when he left for Israel with his family and after a few ye ars he died.
Now  my mother's parents also lived in Poland but all of my mother's sisters lived in Germany.
As we went out  the whole family  we just took just a little bit of food and we went out to the woods.
>> Bill Benson: Were any of our other family members able to make it back?
SB: So  tell me about the place where you lived in the ghetto.
Well  after liberation  I know now that she was taken to -- to Poland to live with a family and as the years go by now and we star t to hear about some of her experiences  and Im going back only to 1985  because before then  Irene and I never talked about it -- and I mean never. [
It was a middle class family  quite reasonably comfortable  without the luxuries of this day.
There were six children  four brothers  two sisters  my father and my mother.
Bu t one aunt  I think  died in the concentration camp  and that  with our big family  that was terrifi cally lucky that -- becaus e my friends here all lost so many family members  and we didnt.
Did you ever have any aspirations to go to Palestine [indecipherable] Our family was studying conversational Hebr ew just in case we didnt get into the United States.
And I got as far as Prague and I still had the diarrhea and even the Czechs couldn't cure it  nobody could cure it  it took a long time  until a friend of the family got me some cocoa and that stopped it.
End of Tape One  Side A USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 15 Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak  this is tape one  side B. You described in your video interview  returning to Hoost and rejoining with your family there and that you were immediately put into a ghetto.
And our family is now already 10 Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski November 24  2009 61people.
But it was very  very well-known  a center of Jewish learning.
She will also participate in next month's Holocaust commemoration at Har Shalom Synagogue in Potomac  Maryland  where she will light one of six candles accompanied by her family.
03:12:18 So  you understand  it's the uncertainty  the mi sery and that life has no value and what happens with your family was so terrible th at it was meaningless  it was no hope  no hope whatsoever.
On my mother's side  she came from a very Orthodox family.
If in your mind you have the question  How did they know you were Jewish?
Youd have a -- a right -- youd have the property right to be able to go -- Yeah  it was a little house  not a big [indecipherable] Yeah  but it was your family home.
In 1946  Ada Birnbaum with her family of Edith  Fred  Ann Birnbaum and Joe Birnbaum arrived in Bomberg  Germany.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 33 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: come and help them yes.
24 family what in language and to work they take me.
So after the war we went back home to Romania first.
Well  I would like to see I would like to kind of weave in the general picture youre painting for me with words  to what happened in y our own family.
And my earlie st memories are fairly warm of Christian friends for our family and -- I didn't go to sc hool but my brother and sister did.
So I made all kinds of efforts to come to the United States with my family.
We n we d ont know what happened to him and his family.
When your children were your age  when things started to get bad  like Yes.
In one room there lived a family Lipszy c. Herschel Lipszyc with his father that was very orthodox  and a cousin of his  that her family was already killed in a small town.
Two weeks before I arrived there Malamed family went to Israel.
And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days.
All the sisters came together almost  like I said  every Thursday night and from that family only three survived in hiding.
>> Bill Benson: But she was able to get your family along with your relative in England -- >> Jill Pauly: We got into Kenya.
Of c ourse I didn't drink coffee until a little bit later and Were you worried about what was happening in Europe at home possibly to your family?
I dont know  but I know they were well educated in Jewish.
I want you to talk a little b it about your family background a nd sort of values that you grew up with.
I need you're apartment now because my family is coming and we need an apartment so I want you to move out anyway.
119 And he went to live in New Jersey  and I stayed on and I milked cows  dealt in cows  both  and raised a family.
His aunt and uncle -- I don't know how many people -- his family died right there and then.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother was taken in July of 1942.
What was happening in your life right be fore the war?
A nd this was very typical of a Jewish family at that time and even today in Denmark because Jews have lived in Denmark since the 17th century.
>> Suzy Snyder: Was this the last time you saw your mother's family?
What was it like for you seeing your family again  your mother and your family?
So what do you remember about the war coming to an end?
I'm a little confused because you say when you first went into the ghetto you lived with your family and there were many people in one room?
Could you tell us your full name and where and when you were born.
They would -- they were ready to have a rather lar -- and had hoped for a rather large family.
01:54:00 Because they said  ﬁIf you bring a certain amount of Jews  your family will stay alive.ﬂ You know  the oldest tricks.
I was walking one night through the fields to another family to convey something  and they stopped me.
Well  at -- at that time my grandmother and my aunt and my cousin  we were all living in one apartment.
And  you dont need a wide angle lens for my family.
And -- and met some -- my uncle was there  you know  and other member of the family  you -- a-a-and I forgot to mention who I met in Belgium after the liberation.
And you know by that time I was gone anyway and had my own family.
What was the relationship between you and your brothers and sisters?
My sister had already papers to go to Argentina with her husband  because he has the family there.
Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family?
Was and at that time it was much easier to send uh uh food packages to my family.
It was two  two rooms and a kitchen; but here we got one room apartment.
This is the house that I was born in and grew up in.
So  did you all go together -- your family  your grandparents?
Were still gonna talk about family at this moment  before the war breaking out.
And he knew whats going to happen  and said to the family  ﬁWe have to leave Warsaw  we have to go away  theyre going to kill all Jews  because Germans kill -- Germans do all that atro city  I see and we know it.ﬂ But nobody was expecting anything.
ﬁI know how you feel about the family  we havent got many left.
But my parents lived within this Jewish -- German Jewish community.
When did your parents and your family learn the fate of most of your family?
Tell us a little bit about your father  what he did for a living.
They were locked up day and night for a long time  and I remember that once  one of the assistants came and he said this Jewish family and they can't stand it any more and they get out at night and walked around and that is so dangerous they bring the people where they are hiding in danger too  and we have to kill them.
So the Interview with Esther Fol November 8  2008 14foster family said no  she cannot.
Interview with Annette Fein November 7  2008 5 So would this suggest that when your family left Poland   it wasnt just your immediate family  your father and your mother  but a larger group of people?
Some times we go in the field  and -- I dont remember his family name  but his first name  Haim  Haimala.
And each of us from the nine girls that there were  had family in the United States.
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone now  off to fight for the Soviets against the German -- or at the time with the Germans initially -- no  no  against the Germans  what did your mom do  and who was ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 with you at that point once your dad was gone?
I don't wish that feeling for my enemies how I feel and live with the memories of my family.
Estelle and her family were hiding in a bunker during the uprising and were among those discovered and forced out of hiding.
And we were sitting and talking and she asked me  ﬁCan you tell us about your family and how it was in the concentration camps  because my mother doesnt want to talk about anything.ﬂ I told her a lot of things.
Besides from this Uncle in the Gentile and -- and their family.
And many other Jewish people  you know  they losted thei r whole family  you know?
What about the synagogue where your parents went  was that affected?
Why don't we start with you telling us about your family  community  what life was like both before the war and the events that led up to Kristallnacht.
Later on when I studied the history of my family  prior ge generations also had to sort of take the fact that there was antiSemitism for granted  the way minorities today live in so many co untries where there is governmentally supported discrimination.
And there is a guy  I just found out  theres a guy in Germany whos written a doctor thesis about movem movemen ts for peace in the last century  and hes got six or seven pages about about Edward Lowenthal   which still doesnt answer my question  is ta is he related to this side of the family  or that side of the family.
Uh the the change not in the feeling of security but the change in the family life came in - it must have been mid or the fall perhaps of 1944 when my dad uh joined the uh Danish uh Brigade as it was called  the the uh the Danish military police force that was built up in Sweden towards the end of the 2nd World War.
I have no recollection  others that  maybe once a year  it's a high holy days  my parents went to the synagogue.
Uh  my father and my mother and my brother and I uh we were work--worked as family unit.
Did you -- did you spend a lot of time with your mother and your father  or more time with your mother as you remember?
And we crossed it  and then I met my whole family  they were all safe.
So you and your brother Paul  who well be speaking with as well  are the youngest of the family.
He found some of the stuff that was hidden like he found his box of thread and stuff Did anyone from his family survive besides him?
Kept for Barbara by family members in South Romania and given to her after the war. (
So your father  is he separate d from the rest of the family?
Your father got papers  got the affidavits from the New York From the family in New York   in New York.
And I wouldnt have gotten it  because the Nazis would have taken me hostage for the family  and the newspapers  and everything  yes.
And by the way  we used a lot of food because we had a big family.
I was trapped in the killing center of Auschwitz Surrounded by barbed wires  gas chambers  smoke and flame The Nazis tattooed a number on my arm 2-5-6-7-3 became my new name They tried to reduce me to a number Dehumanize me day by day But regardless of all their efforts The could not take my self worth away They murdered in the gas chambers my entire family In one single day All my earthly possessions we re so brutally taken away They treated me worse th an a hardened criminal Even though I did no t commit any crime They hated me merely for being born Jewish And starved and tortur ed me all the time.
And my uncle  and the baby a nd other members of the family.
And then the -- But there were always some people who were really nice  really nice .
And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who played a large role in your and our lives.
And I always di d. And I think with the spectrum of what you see whats happening now is the breakup of the family and fatherless children and god knows whats happening in the world.
We had some close relatives who played a large part in the future of our family.
Because yeah because we wanted the family wanted  wanted a DVD.
I did not experience any anti -Semitic remarks from them or their family.
The older brother raised the family  and was a very wise man but lived in a different city  about 15 or 20 kilometers from u -- from Bendezin.
My mother was too  and ma -- in -- and the rest of the family  Id say those that were politically conscious at all were more left wi ng Zionists.
T-Tell me what you remember about life in your home before the war.
And th-then something happened  and I was there  I have seen all that  the family.
Yeah  okay  so youre at Annie Madnas house and your sisters are with this Catholic family.
And lo and behold  I ended up with an Orthodox family  a very religious Jewish family.
And we asked him to take one of the whole family  my brother on the left  my father  my mother and me.
And it was -- I did not know where the rest of my family was.
And -- and then I spent a little over a year with a secondary Gentile family  se condary teacher.
In other words  if there was a direction of political thinking in your family  through po and Povilas sounds like the most political The other two brothers  they were not political at all.
Do you have any memories of how that was how you felt that  when you were before the war  as a child?
In each apartment was three or four rooms which in each room would be one family.
We got married on a Saturday  must have been because we worked on Friday  and I moved in -- actually I couldn't move in right away with his family.
In view that so many members of my family were killed  and I felt that I was the weakest link  and I survived  and I was able to produce the next pr -- generation.
Somebody from the Wolf family who had the store down the street from where our store was.
So wha -- its -- i -- why di d it take you so long to find out  did your father not tell you about the history of the family  or -- He -- you see  you have to remember  I th ink in Europe generally  avi was something peculiar to my family  parents dont exch ange a lot of confidences when youre young.
And was her family also wellto-do  the family that she came from?
He had actually a very well going practice  he had  I remember he used to talk about one of the most famous German movie actresses he represented in her divorce and then he had some members of the Hohenzollern famil y  that was the family of the last German Kaiser.
Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 63 Well  what was the atmosphere like in yo within your family?
I grew up well  my family  I guess they had a lot of money  but I didnt really know that  you know?
And we have sort of kept a little bit  and especially my brother  in touch with this man  as he left je England for the United States   grew up  married  raised a family here  as I said  on the west coast.
So I'm going to begin with asking you when you were born  the date you were born  where  and what was your name at birth.
So my mother found out that there was a boarding school.
Try to tell us a little bit about when your father took that shingle down  how -- at that point how was -- how were -- how was your family earning income for you to survive?
Now your mother  lets turn to her side of the family.
And we were old  like my mother and my sisters  young sisters.
So my sister was able to go to live with her husband's family  and she had the baby in April.
Did you and your mother have to do anything to kind of help the family?
My grandmother  my mother's mother was with us in the hiding place.
She let me spend the night on the floor  sh e gave me something to eat  and she told me that there was a job open on this same line Otvosk  which I mentioned at the beginning that our family used to spe nd summers between Warsaw and Otvosk.
When did you learn about what happened to the Jewish people in other parts of Europe?
So those are these family stories  each family has its secrets.
We had a lay -- a layer of -- a s -- of a small town in Poland who wouldnt go along with him and had to leave  with his whole family.
You will 4 Boogard was a farming family who lived just south of Amsterdam and known for helping Jews  especially children  find homes during the war.
Introduce me to your family that was at home - your grandparents... Well  I  actually I only knew very little of my grandparents.
But It was the last piece from your life of your family.
So uh  my family life started I guess in the 20's after the war.
So we hope you will have the opportunity to come back.
>> Bill Benson: You told me  Irene  at that time  you really didn't sense anti -Semitism at that time before the war.
So did most people I mean  did most people work in the mines or have  you know  family members work in the mines and then also the support functions to that?
We cannot live in our home and we live in the home of my mothers sister in th e same village and we stay together with my mothers sisters family and they begin to use us in village.
And so we moved  we went back to Poland actually  because he had a good education.
So  we went into a building that we didn't even know who lived there  and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady  maybe 100 years old in the bed crying that she doesn't have food  and that she doesn't know where her family is and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all.
So that then I was hiding with my family  but in this time  when they started to take families  my mother and my youngest sister  they were in Hungary already.
I said  ﬁDo you -- do we know somebody  do you have a family in America.ﬂ So my mother said  ﬁI dont know  Im going to have to check it.ﬂ And I always remember that I was battling for a long time with America.
The uh  lot of very important personalities  and political scene like Leon Blum  and one of the royal family of Italy uh  were political prisoners there at one time.

But they were not in a Jewish home in a sense that I'm not religious at all.
59 04:14:20 I said  Anne  if you go  and in Polish they call it Hanka  Anne is Hanka  if you don't go to work  you know  in a few days what happens to you - this happened  you see  I gave her an example  this happened to somebody else; this way you have a chance to survive and see your family.
Q. I'm curious about how you told your children and your grandchildren if you've talked to them about your experience about the Holocaust.

And my older cousin had just been discharged from the army the day before I arrived  so there wa s such turmoil in that family  and I felt that I did not fit in.
Did you keep in touch with an yone else from the clinic after the war  other than your family?
My mother had a sist er who came to live in the United States with her family following World War I. And they invited my father to come to the United States   look around for a few weeks and see if it was possible to come and possibly make a living and then decide to apply for a visa.
Anthony: Can you tell me a little bit about when th e Germans invaded in September  what you were doing  what your family was doing  what happened?
My par most as I remember  my most of my parents friends were Jewish.
I want -- I want to get some idea about your family  and about living in Poland bef -- before the war  but if I would ask you  what is your first memory  the most prominent memory you have of your childhood  what would come to your mind?
Before  my fathers family s I told you we knew what was happening and my cousins were sent off to labor camp.
And were not very conscious of of living in a Jewish neighborhood  although we we know that we are Jews  of course.
The lives of 125 Jews  or even a thousand  compared to what he was going to have after his family came over.
Did you have any concern about that among your wifes family?
And you know  so a family was a very big part of -- of our lives.
>> Bill Benson: And  Peter  when you were in the ghetto  you were in there with several other relatives.
Was there any -- besides the intellectual connection  and -- and the interest starting from Shirers book  was there a personal connection in your family to World War and the Holocaust that wa -- was also important for you  or -- No  no  this was -- this was purely coming at it through history  and -- and frankly through military history.
It was a Polish family there  and my mother was helping them a lot.
Tell us what happened to your parents and what happened with your brother  how he was able to not be deported.
So my parents heard that and they -- they had a Ukraine family that they had no children  and they said -- my parents gave them money  gold  and whatever  jewelry  and they promised that they gonna save me and my older brother.
Because if they would find me over there  they would shoot the farmer with the family and then they would shoot us.
So we -- he wrote a letter to this rabbi  he said  ﬁWell  we asked th -- we asked you to see the family.ﬂ He said  ﬁI saw the family.
Would you -- do you know when your mother and the family began to realize the enormity of the Holocaust  the enormity of what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
In fact  a couple of  about six months  well eight months ago  I was in Belgium visiting my mother  just a week before she died  and we went to a go -away party for my uncle who is also 80 -something and who moved to Israel with his family.
So  one day while he was cleaning that market area  an old farmer that he knew  that my father helped a lot  came over to him and said [Speaking Non -English Language] to my father  I'm really sorry to see you  the condition you are in; I know how wealthy you were but here you are sweeping the streets and sweeping .
So my question is  you stayed there til 47  did you tra did you want to go home  did you try to fi nd out what had happened to your family?
And then my mother found a job with some local family that was making aprons  yeah.
So how was it that you -- how did you tell your -- your children?
So you were living with your mother  your grandmother  your sister  and your brother-in-law?
And so Simons family came over  a nd theyre very friendly  and made us feel good  and I heard some comments that  ﬁHow is it that Dave has such a beautiful  young wife?ﬂ Of course  if they would know Dave better  they would not be so surprised.
He sac -- told me about his family and we talked about it  yes.
Thats my life  by Gods plan  or by coincidence  Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 95 I was born into this family  so I will have my own life as Niklas Frank   and not as the son of of those two.
Well  the only expectation I had is I knew my my mothers family was here.
Now  my mother came from a very Francophile  somewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to Paris  at least for some time  to be with an aunt  whom I know -- whom I knew too  and there they perfected their French.
From the rest  there was no -- see  my wifes family was diffe rent.
And in the other house  lived a Jewish family that she was hiding.
And the Menn family fled eastward seeking to escape the German advance.
Let's ask a little more about your childhood only because people seeing this tape are not necessarily what traditional native Jewish family means.
Tell me about what you did when the war broke out.
So we were hoping that h -- we kept on saying that probably our parents would be okay  but still we worried terribly about our friends and about the rest of the family.
My father had one brother  and my mother had oh  three sisters.
And it was really the Jewish people that lived there were really all my relatives.
I wrote to his family after the war and his sister answered and she said  ﬁWell  my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because he argued with her  so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp.
What was your family life like  who was in your home?
I lived in a neighborhood that wasnt -- you wouldnt call it ex -- exactly a Jewish neighborhood  but there were a sprinkling of Jews  but most of them  of course  were non-Jewish.
Any other holidays that you can talk about  that you have memories of as a young child?
I had here two aunts  my mother's sister and my father's sister.
Was your family different from other familie s in thinking so quickly about getting out of Germany?
Bu-But but her main her main domain was the house and the children  and family.
Would you have been a different person than you are today?
Be-Before that  that was the da that my family told the deportations started  and that I told that Viktoris Lingeese that this is happening  that he was already aware that how well lose out.
>> Bill Benson: When did you learn about what happened to your parents?
So it really starts sort of with Moses and ends with ou r family in San Luis Obispo.
Like for instance  in my home we spoke Yiddish  but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish.
My family and a -- a brother of my mother -- father and her -- his sister.
When we came to Israel in 1951 there was a family from Boryslaw that my father remembered.

On my on my wifes my late wifes family  her name was Frankel   and her paternal family  ther her fat her was born in a place called Drohobych   in in Oh yes  in Poland   isnt it?
That was when we met the people who said they'd helped our ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 parents.
You told me that your father made good on promises that he had made to himself about the Sawinski family after what they had done.
>> Bill Benson: You shared with me that early  the Hungarians had imposed a number of very anti -Semitic restrictions.
And you know  how did the match get made with this family?
On the other hand  I think the name is a Jewish name by itself  Waldmann  apparently  Waldmann (vald-man)  my parents were -- they had dark hair and -- everybody in the family looks more Jewish th an I do.
And then they thought that I got killed  so they notified my father that I got killed.
One we re a family by the name of Schlesinger  father and two sons  running to the synagogue to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning synagogue  the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burne d the synagogue.
We lived in a house which belonged to a family who left for South Africa.
Do you remember your parents ta lking about the Nazis before they came in  when they were in power in Germany in 1933?
I was the youngest of all of them  and when I was born  I was very young.
I was not from a relig...religious family  and I am not...was really not observant  but there were a lot of women that were very observant.
We heard terrible things but we didnt want to belie ve it because we were very frightened for our family.
Lets begin with you telling us about your family and the events and your family's life leading up to Kristallnacht and that catalytic event for you and your family.
I m ean  we were observant of all the major holiday -- Jewish holidays.
I mean  Im interested in politics  so thats I think what part of it is  my fa my family  my mother and father and brothers  all were very interested in politics.
So that came another family  and th ey told me that my uncle died  and they wanted to bring me to their house  to give me a home.
And I remember that my mo ther was very anxious for this whole family  we were 14 people  our family  to get our own house.
He was just returning from Athens and wanted to in form my family.
Well  he was a manager of a large chemical in factory of of some products that were used for military paints and special fire resistant something  I dont know  but it was a big outfit outside Warsaw   and so they had their agent  who was in Lwow  that was Mr. Schiffman and his family.
T alking the younger generation until we -- Did you have a large extended family  aunts  uncles  cousins?
That's that's while  you know  didn't have any cars or we went by train which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and wagon  so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there.
Your grandparents in Heidelberg on your mothers side of the family?
And somehow  in recent years  Ive tried to tell him  ﬁBut look at -- look at how she came through when the chips were down.ﬂ Thats -- It -- You could see her as a heroic figure in -- in keeping the family together.
And this is where your parents were living at the time?
Uh there may have been assemblies for other reasons and but uh I my family and I were not impacted by that since we all managed to get back to our apartment  at the time.
Worked for a family by the name of Bodner  on Goldessgreen Road and -- and she was constantly working  so she had no time and -- and certainly no extra money to do anything with and she spent on my schooling and whatever extras.
My mother had a huge family and they all left in early '30s   up to '37 and they settled in Amsterdam.
The strange thing in this family is that all three sisters married young  and were widowed young.
We found out -- my mother had a brother in Paris  France.
Yeah that When Hitler first came into power and people realized what he was going to do  did your parents talk this over with you and your sister?
I di -- I knew one thing which was very important to me personally because my father was the only member of the family who -- who survived  and he survived by a fluke.
And also my parents fo the families were in Poland .
Immediately after that my brother and I were taken away and taken to a family in the same town we lived in  and we stayed there for two weeks and uh was  they lived in a house that - and again in Holland because it's so such a crowded country  several families would live in the in the same house  so we lived on the second floor of this house and there were another family living on the first floor.
His aunt  his cousins were there  his immediate family was at the Bar Mitzvah  but he was never told and because of the divorce being in progress for many  many years  I na -- his pa -- his parents -- his mother -- his father  I dont know what he is  but his mother say  I -- I think they support him.
And at that time we really needed it  because my brother had eaten up all his savings  you know  for keeping the whole family alive during the whole war.
I wrote a letter to this guy what I gave him  in Kozienice  what I... He took my family to this place to...to the camp there  in Kozienice  what I give him a piece of gold.
And I -- I never -- because of the fact that my family was a little bit disjointed to start with  my mother was the ultimate intrarude .
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Dora Klayman: The family Runjaks.
In in such a well  as I mentioned before  you know  the the family history  the people the my fathers experience i-in in in in the War of Independence  and before that he was in Poland during the World War I  you know  an-and the relationship even during that tsarist times  even in their gymnasium  there was already hostility between the Lithuanians and Poles in their classes  he told me.
How religious was your family and how affiliated Jewishly were they?
The war is over and -- and maybe its -- maybe there was a feeling that its time to start a new life or -- but at the same time  youve got this burden of knowing what had happened to your family and to your people.
And walked to a different part in Delft...outskirts of Delft where we had some friends of the family.
You had to move into the ghetto  and how long were you in the ghetto?
How  how can you describe a whole family of 58 people or 60 I don't know exactly how many we were  who died in vain fo r nothing  only because of one reason  because they were Jews  who were not even  they did not even belong to a political party.
And she also  with her family  was in that displaces persons facility and my mother had found her.
Did you know what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
And in the cemetery there are many tombs of Mendels family.
Were there other people that you adopted into your family at this time?
Well  then what happened was that..uh..I guess he went ahead with this  with the fact that he wanted to adopt me  but in order to get the proper clearance and everything he had to check out some of my background and he had to give all this to the Red Cross which in turn had to get a hold of the underground and they had to start doing a lot of tracing  uh  back to  uh  exactly where am I coming from  what kind of family.
No  I was  I feel very home with my family  my uncle's family.
In defense of this absurd attitude  let me tell you that my ow n family was not lagging far behind.
End of Tape Two  Side A Beginning Tape Two  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Esther Dezube.
And I was told later by one of my cousins that Dad was the only one our family was the only one who owned a car in the '30s.
I said by any chance do you know where the Venslauskas family is in Germany?
The particul -- No  I dont -- she identified herself so much with our family that y -- or later too  very few non-nobility people came into our house  and they ha d to make up for their terrible lack by titles 21 like your Excellency  stuff like that.
And Mr. Varger who knew the family immediately called my mother's uncle who was already in what they call a protected building  Swedish protected building.
When my grandmother had a a cousin I Im never quite sure what the relationship is  but its sort of a cousin  or a nephew  or whatever  who had been the black sheep in the family  and had been exiled by the family to South Africa   where fortunately  he went into diamond mines.
And when we came home we talked a little about it  but then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family.
And that was the last time I saw my mother  grandmother and sister.
And I have a family... I was just looking and we have a pretty good family tree on his mothers side of the family  going back to the 1700s.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 >> Gideon Frieder: Very poor.
So I had some money from him and I decided to go home to look for the Polish guy which my father wrote and told me would guard me and be like my family.
Youre very love ly people Im -- first time I met you and I feel like youre my family.
My mothers family  there were two older sisters and one younger brother.
And he came back with my brother and sister to Berlin.
Let me ask you about when the decision was made by your family to go into hiding?
If anybody from my family or by miracle somebody survived  I am the second son of Lester Pantirer.
>> Bill Benson: While you were in Poland -- you had left some of the family belongings before you went into the ghetto with somebody who said he would take care of them.
So rischous  maybe it come from -- I -- I dont know  but this is the word that my family used in -- in Judeo Alsatian [indecipherable].
So Did you have any other relatives that you left behind in Germany?
Well  uh as I say  tightening the screws was done on my family in a very dramatic way in that uh they first pulled my dad's work permit so that my dad  who was very much in the public eye uh giving lectures at public museums  going to auctions and so forth  couldn't openly do that anymore.
There were the old established Danish Jewish communities who had ancestors living in in in Denmark for perhaps up to 200 years or more  and then there were these new immigrants.
Was that--I mean  that's such a personal--a family ow ned it even through these trades  was there any compensation that came to your family from the German government? {
Anyway -- >> Bill Benson: Spare this one family  this mom and son.
And so in this sense my family moved to the Pennsylvania community  and I worked there in the shop.
I put up a new name  a new family name  and I was put to court  and they all believed me.
And if there would have been already a bus or a truck that what would be cruising from Aniksht to Vilkomir  my family didn't have the money to pay.
So tell me  where were you and your family on Kristallnacht?
or their or their family  and what is in the general atmosphere  you know  those are two different things.
And to the right h and side was one of the farmers living with his family --a mother -in-law and two or three children.
Because they were hidden in some convent or by some Polish family.
And then was just a matter of taking a tr ain and going to our fi -- this -- our family FFisher in the Sudetenland.
But then she didn't want to give birth in this small town where the medical establishment wasn't just up to date and she wanted to be with her family  so I was just a month old then  I was taken back to Slovakia  but it still shows that I was born in Budapest  Hungary and  well  actually it was very bad for me when it was time to immigrate to the United States because the quota for Hungarian born people was very  very small and limited  so it was difficult at the time.
What's it like for you and for your family to do this?
The others  the cousin  I heard that cousin's cousin  somebody in the family; she washed herself with the water.
But he was the nicest guy in the -- he had a strange -- I never saw him [indecipherable] family  nothing.
When you moved from your house into the ghetto -- Yes. --
On my mothers side  there are quite a few cousins all over.
You know  it was hard  we were crying and so it  you know  we leave then with some member of the family are leaving leaving you  it was uncertainty.
And so the -- the war turned USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 92 out th-that of my mothers family  the only survivors  except for the brothers that were in Canada  were the three of us.
Well  it seems yes  Ive had some relatives left in Germany.
Very comfortable financially and he decided that he was going to save this family.
So  I really don't know  but I do know that she found quarter s. Every family had to find where to live  so she found a house where there were two sisters living and they had two rooms and a kitchen and then she had a mother  Mrs. Pollock.
That may be wrong  but -- Have you shared this story about what your parents did during the war  with other people?
And how how long did the family live in Cluj ?
You would have been in a very comfortable family  had there been no war  had there been no Holocaust Yes 50 had there been Sure  sure  sure  sure  sure.
So you were living with your mother  your grandmother  your sister  and your brother-in-law?
There we were  a mother and a daughter  not too many survivors at that point had already someone of their family.
So they knew everything about the family  they follow it  you know  they were attached to.
Alerted to the danger  Jill and her family fled to Co logne.
And I think theyre both cognizant of the effect its had on the family.
And tell us a little bit about where you were born.
When I got out of the camp  I knew I was sick.
I'm probably more observant now than I would have been in my family.
And that was the last time I saw my mother  grandmother and sister.
So they let her live and as they were looking...I don't know  maybe for Jews  they find the two Jews...the family.
I did know but -- Again  what were your thoughts about leaving Europe?
And my father and his family deci ded to escape from the ghetto.
I assume that there were Jewish families  but that it was not a predominately Jewish . . .
Did you know any Jewish people when you were growing up?
I went there later in years with  with my family to get to that same area  and people were just waiting there ankle deep  knee deep in that particular... But I crossed  and the first step I took into the river  I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest  and then here go the dry socks in my pocket  and it wasn't a concern of mine.
My mother had four sisters  so I was with three of them.
Do you remember starting to feel afraid during that time about what was going to happen to you and your family?
I also  when we went for Tel Aviv with family to Jerusalem  they [indecipherable] back and forth and they show me all the places where the Jordanian used to hide.
9 Not very much and as I say that's part of the thing that the family wasn't as close as it could have been over there.
My father did know German though  he probably did speak to her in German.
And this is the family who really got me on my feet.
you know) You want to help your family  you want to be able to pay college for the kids  and make them into decent human being.
And as it turned out  that was the last time I saw my parents.
I had two brothers  a mother  and my grandmother lived with us.
Well  my mother was the opposite  and I'm not going to go into my family history  but my mother wanted me to come home.
And he took a chance and he took me to meet his parents.
Where I lived there was some Jewish family who were very good to my family and I want to pay it back.\
You were worrying about your own life  your -- your family  and was -- we knew about others  but nobody cry or feel sorry for them.
They they tried to get him to Israel with the family  but it was too late.
But most of my -- my kids  my family were just -- partook in the marches.
And so what was the first change then in your life?
indecipherable] delicious Just a Jewish 34 In this time  theres so many Berlin memories  but you say that every year  your parents would go back to Warsaw to visit family.
She studied with Dr. Freud  and he became friends of the family.
My parents  believe it or not  were first Germans  second they were Germans  third they were Germans  and only then were they Jewish.
Q. Now in these immediate post-war years  what kind of efforts did your family make to track down your parents and the rest of your family?
End of Tape #2 33 Tape #3 -- would like to talk a little bit about  you we re in a -- a communication with your parents.
But there was another part of the family  th-that we just got to know that were very kind people  that were not  you know  th-they were not rich and they couldn't help us financially  but -- but they -- at least they were -- they -- they helped us  you know  with a nice word.
that family where they had the pilots  th at had leaked out  and he got a message from the good police -- there were -- there were bad police and good police  you -- your house will be raided  they suspect you.
So  in some ways this sounds also like something that the family valued  you take care of people when they cant take care of themselves.
Where do you think that quality came from in your family  of meeting this horrible situation with such determination?
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone  who was left in your household with you at that time?
>> Bill Benson: So the Vanderlinden family  they had a daughter.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 16 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: virtually all my time crying from that moment on.
Your father said that we cannot go  and so we stay -- we stay together.
And its a -- a very important thing to all of us in our family that there be Holocaust education and Holocaust awareness inculcated throughout the American educational system at all levels  fr-from grade school on.
So the second time that ever it happened that we were lined up  that we came out whole as far as the family  no casualties.
So  a ma tter of fact  now Im reading -- I read two USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 85 books at the same time  by the way  because Ive ga -- because its -- most of them are dry books  so I -- I read-- one of them has to do -- Im reading now th-the Leaman family.
>> Bill Benson: Your grandparents and your great grandparents  tell us what happened to them during that time.
>> Bill Benson: And Regina  when your mother told you had to leave the ghetto and go to your sister in Pionki  it wasn't just a matter of walking out of the ghetto.
I obviously ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 was not aware of the war or anything.
I wa -- at first I was in the childrens home  a nd then they placed us in families  because they - they had such an overflow in the kinderheim  that they had to take -- they had to get Jewish family that had enough room  were wealthy  to take in some of these children.
So But even though your father was told to leave and he said I cant leave because I have to defend the family.
I had to be with another family to -- this was only through my work and ability whatever I could do to help those families this capacity of course I wasn't paid much  almost nothing.
I didn't tell even tell th at I I have family to nobody because I didn't want to come to them to be a burden to them.
>> Bill Benson: What can you tell us about the circumstances that you found yourself and your family and your community found yourselves in when Germany invaded Belgium in May of 1940  and what led  and you said a little about it with your father being both Jewish and an outspoken newspaper editor  the circumstances that led to fleeing Belgium?
She was 9 years ol d when the war broke out and I can only think of her as fear and love and by fear i mean the fact that she was so terrified of bein g torn away from the family.
So the Germans took the new villa and family moved to old villa.
So there was not far a big mill from flours with a family.
Then how many children did they have  your mother and your father?
And thats where you can find family  not in a small town.ﬂ Which is what we did  we went to Lodz  and he gave us an address of his sister  so we stayed overnight  and then next day we went to register  and we were given a place - not an apartment.
And you're planning to go back again  you say  with you're family?
And everybody  because we knew each other  everybody in the family of the other children  the parents of them  theyre talking about it.
So a lot of time the men of the family  spent a lot of time trying to find hiding places.
My father's mother and also my father's sister and her husband  her two children  and her mother -in-law.
We were busy with different game s. Then he told us things about his family  what they were doing.
The olde r ones  the ones that stayed in  not the draftee World War two  he was out already  but people who were professionals  either officer  or enlisted men  didnt make any di fference  there were many -- oh  there was even one that I remember who came from a family  he was very poor  Italian family  and he said  ﬁI -- I -- I like what youre doing lieutenant  cause I -- I grew up hungry.ﬂ So that was the extent of the conversation  but -- Did you  when you got here to the United States  did you search out for other people who were survivors?
What did you learn about your family and how did you learn it?
Most of my friends were -- I think all my friends were Jewish  I think.
She had a lot of my father's family  but never much of her own.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your mother and father .
ﬁWhere did you live in Krakow?ﬂ He said  ﬁWell in Diver Street  number four ﬂ and this house was the Himmelblau house of the house of my wifes family.
I know that my grandfather died I was told  but my grandmother  my uncles  all my aunts and the children and my uncles and the two little girls  Sarah and Rivka.
Your family  in many ways  is very assimilated into society  insofar as you speak the languages.
So but anyway  so I I knew I have a family in America  okay?
Tell us what that meant for you and for your family  including your grandfather  Aizik.
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself.
See  my mother -- from my mother's side  she had here her uncle and cousins.
And this can neve r be fulfilled  even if you are successful in business  and family life  and everything  always will come to haunt you about your past  about your suffering.
But I was still with Josefs family  that was -- Ill tell you soon.
But the rest of the family for financial reasons we didn't go.
They had children my age or younger  but this was a Jewish family in London and they did not want me in this.
And because she had this one aunt there  Cheryl had gone there throughout her childhood to visit the aunt and uncle and cousins  along with her family.
My brother was married  my older brother  and he was with his wife and my mother and myself.
And so i-i even that  you know  for him looked kind of ridiculous or or or unacceptable that from such a rich family  you know  he becomes co mmunist  and is working against the Lithuanian government  really.
My father  mother spoke Polish but used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
>> Bill Benson: When did your uncle return  the family that your aunt and uncle -- >> Rita Rubinstein: I don't have exact dates  but shortly after  because we immigrated.
But I said  you know  normally  I should be in Frankfurt   with my entire whole family together  but everybodys someplace else.
My mother  hoping we would be in Poland  went to Poland.
The family would have been killed  and besides the whole village was full of Germans.
You sort of start dreaming  and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and  uh  you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless.
>> Bill Benson: Alex  at what point did you  your family  realize that you were liberated?
The people we were living with were her brother and sisters.
They had family in New York so they applied through the Jewish organization  Joint.
This is tape number one  side A. When your video interview ended  you summarized a little bit about what happened to you after your family came to New York.
Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 70 I I I felt like I said I was part of the family  but I wasnt.
When I'm very sad -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 33 When you wrote that poem at the -- after the restaurant experience  did you share it with your family?
What would you say was the turning point where  when you and your family really realized that things would go terribly wrong?
Did they treat you like family members  which would explain why you were there?
I see  so its another -- 107 Thats the family name on the top.
For myself I could have a job in the mountains and teach Greek to the village girls but how could leave my family and go there?
They catch some people there but fortunately  nobody from our family .
We knew that there was one sister of my father's that went out to Palestine to work on the land before 1932.
A lot of our dear family went the communist way  the partisans -- Yeah. --
I mentioned his name because  before going to Auschwitz  after his family was deported  he came to us and we tried to hide him.
It was for six weeks because the only family I have is in Israel.
Send the clot hes of that prisoner back to the family?
Then we heard that one of the boys escaped and the family w as picked up by the Germans or the French militia.
And so your father  your uncle  your your aunt  and your brother were there all together.
But that was -- that was her name and I dont know anything about her family.
My mother was absolutely frantic  was trying to get him into a hospital and they were told that they had to keep the hospitals empty for the wounded that were expected  so all of us  uh all of us including my baby sister and my aunt - at that point my aunt  my mother's only sister and her daughter also lived with us  so it was a hugh family.
I have visited his grave there and the only time that I really shed tears for my family  like really understood the loss of a father is when I stood at his brave and broke down in tears Edna Friedberg: Your mother  having managed to survive  returned to the Netherlands  hoping to reunite with her children.
Were your were both sides of your family from Lvov for a long time  or had they come there from somewhere else?
And my aunt and uncle  now they lived in apartment houses  very nice apartment houses where a floor was big.
In this letter I remember like today I said  \ I'm running away ﬂ and I told my family  \ Run away.
In your family circle and in the people that you knew  did you have any friends who were not Jews?
My great -grandparents were living in -- they had a house there too.
This is a picture of our family taken a year ago for our -- on the occasion of our 55th wedding anniversary.
One time I know its because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family living in the house next door.
As far as my family goes  like I say  there was nine of us.
So your mother and father were in one One  and my sister  because she had a little child in her hand.
So you were living with your mother  your grandmother  your sister  and your brother-in-law?
My mother had sent her away  and my mother also was nego tiating to go to an English doctor as a maid  for ch -- in this family.
And so then we were moved into in to another family.
Not immediate family but you had a lot of cousins and . . .
How did your family manage to survive during that time and to not be denounced n ow that all of France was occupied  Na zis  the Gestapo are everywhere?
You mentioned your family in the United States  and you also mentioned that in the first interview  that the aunt who was here in the US  that you were corresponding with -- with  was a favorite of yours.
Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from what you experienced  what your family experienced?
And did you belong did your family belong to a synagogue?

Welfare  information and tracing  group work  recreation  cultural activities  education  adult  children  library  religions  newspaper and radio  vocational training  religious affairs  child welfare  family welfare  case work including psychological  home visiting  hospital welfare inch  including occupied therapy.\
Q. Early on it was very clear that the Germans weren't  were going to try to eliminate Jewish people in one way or another.
Course  they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish  that the whole family would be killed.
And Ill tell you  thousands of thousands of Jewish children survived and they are in [indecipherable] family  they dont know that they are Jewish.
Let me ask you  this may seem a strange ques tion  but do you remember any happy times with your family during all of this travel  with all of these children and... Well  the happy times were th e time I was in Lucien and I ha d my Bar Mitzvah and I had that women Raseen  Mila Raseen and teaching us Zionism and Jewish history and putting actually strength in our young minds .
And then tell me a little bit about living in the ghetto  and how long you were there  what it was like.
We have some pi ctures in the family of his being bitten -- I mean  the wounds he -- he endured in that beating and it was unsafe for him to stay so he left -- had to leave with his left leanings to Paris  wh ere he could practice them a bit more.
I have a picture of my family  it survived it survived in someones hands in Palestine  and I think that I have it on me.
in nature  which are intra-government al  nevertheless affected your family a great deal  and I take it to mean affected in a sense of not in a personal way that their lives changed from one day to the next.
How much did you know at that time about what was going on in Nazi Germany?
I would like  with your permission to go back to the war time  because I'd like to know what happened during the war  to your family  to your father and to your mother.
But to understand this  that the shooting and the killing there and my family was already dead.
And I could s ee it right away  wherever I was  that its nowhere in the world -- you know  the dreaming that I will go home  see my parents  see my family  or be free.
For agreeing to share your story and let us know a little bit about the experiences that you had  the family history that you have and how that all was part of the huge catastrophe which ended up being the Holocaust.
You know  I was -- I was wounded  like a wounded animal and here -- you understand  a little compassion  a little understanding  a little asking about their family.
7 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD But when they were born  this was Austro -Hungary works in Eastern Europe.
This point  it was much easier for my father to obtain immigrant status or visas for his family to be reunited.
And  of course  Marty  all of that changed dramatically for you and your family once the Hungarians occupied your part of Czechoslovakia in 1939.
And so we are a very close family even though we are not always together.
I knew Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 110 exactly that mine Jewish neighbors were thrown away  and I have to confess  I took a big  big wonderful painting out of this Jewish family.
Part of a family a part -- A Jewish family? --
So he gave mother to -- money  rather -- No  he didnt give any money  but she trie d to help the family.
We were gra duate students and we lived in this housing project and everybody there had no family but lo ts of them had little kids and it was a nice community.
And uh  they were in a refugee status in Belgium and uh  they were furnished a little room which was not big enough for me to live with them  but it was agreed by them that I would remain with the Dutch family where I was very happy uh and it was a rather large family  and  but I was able to see my parents on weekends.
So I think it was about 1938  the family got out of Germany and went into France.
In fact  I just wrote an introduction to the book thats coming out about the cemetery  and I was very fortunate to have it registered with one of the people from my hometown who were dear friends of my family  Pola Frank .
They -- my grandfather -- I have pictures of him flying to visit his factories in 1929  pictures standing in front of an airplane  airline flying to places  and they -- my grandmother's family -- they -- Peter Bogdanovich  the movie director  is part of my mother's -- my grandmother's family on my mother's side and -- and her sister was the first pharmacist in Czechoslovakia  you know  so they were -- they were an achieving upper-class family.
How did you reconnect with your -- with your brother and th e other family and friends?
And  after liberation his family  his parents  his 17 year old brother  all of them were taken and they didn 't come back.
And I will tell you  when we moved  it well  the family got together  had a going away party.
Sometimes you help a teacher who's down or someone is in the family.
My parents  sisters  and brothers -- I mean  my mother had about seven siblings.
My family then went into this large detention ca mp that I had explained  had talked about.
And there was a big family [indecipherable] I mean -- And some of them were in America already?
And family  I -- family -- Im very much attached to family  to cousins and such  so we -- that telephone takes care of that  all my -- my nieces and my nephews and my -- so that -- that goes without saying  but as far as friends are concerned  I cant quite now remember off hand  but I can tell you  I have all these friends whom I call my connection.
And when these people are being called out on the Friday night  midnight  the Germans want to get this over with really quickly  they dont count the members of the family.
I had a big  beautiful family and they took me in with open arms.
But I spoke Russian with my mother  I thought I could I wondered.
Yeah  I spoke Hebrew that time  and I was -- I just felt we were -- we were so brutalized  and lost everyb -- thing  and every -- lost my entire family.
And because they were Communists  they were trusted by the Madna family to come and play with me.
We -- So there was a -- a -- -- we were very close knit.
We have a 16 year old gr anddaughter and we have a very close relationship with our family and so life is good.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
And of course the policeman there  they knew -- Did you -- did you say goodbye to your family?
Their -- Th e family before was Cohn even  I think was Piadagorsky  because they came from Russia  and when they came through Ellis Island  or wherever  I think they became Cohn  because it was just to pick the name that was easy  or some such thing  Im not sure.
>> Bill Benson : So just your parents came to the United States.
And what they have done at the museum here  shows many survivors because we have more than one number or two or three .
We lived in a building where there lived a lot of Jews and non-Jews so you know  you should have.
And there it was written the family from Albert Pollack  he was -- he had many  many things [indecipherable] a nd he was high up  you know  from the -- to -- very  very appreciated  he was an [indecipherable] and he was very appreciated in Salzburg then.
Well my family  we always were together with my uncle and aunt and his family.
End of Tape #8 71 Tape #9 When we ended the last tape  we were talking about this second break-out that you thought was really madness.
Oh  I did see him  I -- when I paid a visit to him when I went to visit my family in Poland   yes.
And now  all of a sudden   towards the end of the war  after your mother and sister were deported  you were -- you were like th e head of the family  and the kids -- I was left alone  I had to battle for myself.
The money that I have gotten at that-- at one time  that lump sum  went towards a in a small  very small part  I took my family  my wife and the two children  and my son and daughter  and we went to Israel  right after the '70 war.
What would you say to others about this destiny that your family has had?
But time is a very wonderful factor  which in my life reduces the impact  through the sense that you see the picture  you remember it  but its I remember the people  or my family who died  but I didnt go home and cry.
He had the same name as the present Pope and his mother and his family were chauvinistic Catholics.
And I showed it to our children on a particular Passover when the whole family was together  I said  ﬁI came across these items and someday you re going to say  why did my mother keep this old hat?ﬂ I said  ﬁWell thats the hat I wore when I left Germany.ﬂ And I donated that hat to the 54 museum in Washington  D.C.. I understand its on s how there with the picture of my wearing the hat.
Theyre the only things that I have to a family  so its just not an option.
But thats just a kind of little composite stor y of one family and how it spreads  what happened to us  and how one takes it.
When did you find out about your parents  your mother and father?
In all probability  this same family controlled the area before the Romanians took over in 1918.
I mean  we were learning Polish as well  but Polish was a language 5 Polish history and Polish was taught in Polish.
Alexis is also for Anna -- Hannah  my fathers mother  and Sarah   her -- her -- her -- her Hebrew name is Hannah Sarah  which is a blending of from my family and my husbands family deceased relatives.
Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 6 June 11  2013 Were you and your family aware of what was happening in the mid to late 30s about the Jews  to the Jews?
I just  Im sure that havi ng that history in our family in a major way influenced us  as well as– I mean  my father and mom  my father worked in the textile plant.
I unders tand that you took advantage of the fact that you had use of a car to actually ex plore and see what happened to your own family.
And the Pariser family said you know that we could have the top floor of the house.
He is th -- he is the boss of the family  but he agreed  you know  so he must have felt a lot for the child  too.
You cannot forget your family tree  going back for three hundred years.
I had no family  but very many family members of my wife  who had come from Bern.
My grandfathers sisters and brothers were he re  and their family.
And you were born in Budapest   after your parents had moved to Hungary ?
The I mean  for hundreds of years  on both sides of my family  they remained Orthodox  even though a large proportion of the German Jews became Reform Jews.
And when I was born  my mother  you know  l-liv ed with her family close by.
So you didnt just stay with one family during this -- is it -- No  n-no  about two or three families.
Yes my uh--had cousins and other family that were beaten brutally.
>> Bill Benson: And your grandfather  despite what he went through  ended up escaping from there.
That all of his relatives  on both sides of the family  said [speaks other language] you know  all this will go away.
But thats what I remember  sitting in an apartment building once I was apparently taken from the Christian family.
What about extended family  aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents.
And the president the presidents name was a Hebrew name  he had a Hebrew name  a family name.
We saw that th is was a Jewish family  and we knocked in to the door.
She said I know the Tikler family here in town  another Jewish family.
We were nine people in the family  my father  mother  the six girls  and one granddaughter.
We lived on the second story and they always had every year  a different girl  peasant girl would come from Yugoslavia  Czechoslovakia  some such place  for a one year contract and up  upstairs  there was another family and Herbert was a little boy who played with me .
but anyway  I thought if th ey are Jewish  and they have family Jewish  it means that they okay  they brou -- they brought up properly  that mean theyd -- are not --- and they - and besides  everybody went -- try to go to ha -- to college  or is in the college  which means  you know  it means that  you n -- theyre certain level -- Uh-huh  right. --
Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
He -- Hes just -- Hes much more tied up in his work and what he feels he needs to do   and he does not tend to do frivolous things  whereas I do a lot of frivolous things  even though most of the time  Im -- you know  I -- I live a fairly serious life  but -- You -- Do you think it -- I mean  it just occurred to me that perhaps this could have something to do with -- or maybe not  but -- but perha -- I was just wondering if it might have something to do with the fact that since hes older  his experience of the -- the -- the brutal meaning of what happened to the family  helps create this -- this sort of difference in the personalities that you are describing?
What was important was to have good family and enough to eat and be dressed and go to s -- schools are free here  libraries are free here  which is wonderful.
And nevertheless  the rest of the family who were outside of Budapest  they were practically all deported to Auschwitz and did not return.
And again my father was devastated that his wife had to support the family.
He would  you know  repair things for -- for people and do some small building jobs and that sort of thing  and -- but we sold our family homestead -- our family home  and my father c ould pretty much live on that.
Tell us how this originated  what the swap was supposed to be and  of course  it had huge implications for you and your family.
>> Bill Benson: George  while the full brunt of the war would not come to Hungary until 1944  the lives of Jews in Hungary  including in Budapest  would change significantly with the beginning of the war.
In the meantime  his father and the whole family had immigrated to the United States and...uh...my mother said  at one point  that she'd had enough of being...uh...uh...a farmer.
When we came to that field where they're they're separating...right  left  right  left...I found out that one Judenschein can save one family  and I had four of them  because I had three from us and one for my father that was out to work in the brigade  so I kept running around between the people  but they already took away both my grandmot hers and both my grandfathers.
In retrospect  retrospective knowledge  what were your family experiencing in Warsaw during these months?
Were your parents upset that you did not marry someone who was Jewish?
What -- I mean  were they - I mean  you know  things like was it a religious family or were you -- you know -- Mm.
And some members of my family never want to go back to Germany.
She came from Warsaw  Poland with her family  and the family was settled they settled in France  I believe its in Paris.
My grandparents on my father's side  they died because they were old  weak.
My parents had bought a big cattle ranch in Kenya   together with the three cousins.
We had  between us  there was a man out there  the father of the Hasidishe family  who was deaf   half deaf.
And another Jewish family which was really half Jewish  where the husband was Jewish  but the wife wasnt.
And my brother went to live with a family that was not really -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the Ardennes.
I want you to just tell a little bit about family life.
And they had more Jews there  not many but a couple of families.
By the way  I'm still in touch with my foster siblings  with the Madna family.
We were put in a one -room -- one room with several families in other rooms.
And  did your parents have any contact with Jewish families  Jewish people?
Well  he was born in Belgium  came here during the war  went back with his family  of course  in 1946  but for some reason or other  his parents couldn't get used to Antwerp again  they went back to the States.
Uh my father met my mother in Germany and my mother is  was a German Jew.
Some of them had no family to go to and some of them just wanted to give me a beautiful poem for what I have done for them so many times it was a very emotional trip.
Your father was from Germany and your mother was from Poland.
Its been a very interesting kind of gradual move for you in that direction  to working with people individually in their very intimate  kind of family problems.
Family members or people from the same town or something coul d do that.
And there was a few Jews came and somehow...uh...I stayed with this family.
We had no other choice  even from my family the young people  cousins like  my mother came from a family of four; they were all were married  so there were cousins about my age  a little younger.
And when he saw what happened to his family the next night  he ended up as a lunatic himself  never forgot this.
So were a very close family and I think this helped a lot  because when you think that very few of us of that whole group needed psychiatric help  or being counseled -- I dont know anybody who was counseled through the years  because we had such a family  we had.
I lived there with a family and they rented a room to me.
We were basically uh we were basically conditioned to to to obey the laws and the restrictions  the demands  until early in 1942 uh the ghetto was established in in and uh slowly the various uh Jewish communities both in the town and the neighborhood  the villages were compelled to leave all possessions behind and move to the ghetto  so in the spring of 1942 my family uh was required to move to the ghetto and the ghetto was in the oldest part of town.
So in 1942  early 1942  weŠthe whole family  as a unit  that means father and mother and six children  went on and reported to the ghetto; or smuggled ourselves into the ghetto because we were no longer legally able to turn ourselves into the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: What was your father doing during that time?
Then after a couple days came in a new decree all the Jews must to go in the ghetto  to Slobosk .
And I knew that other Jews were taking care of me and it gave me a sense of family and that was very important and and finding out all of this on my own...nobody telling me this  gave me a sense of security because I knew that within I was alright.
And once there were Germans right next to us because they were occupying the apartment upstairs from us where that family had fled already.
And the family  it was interesting cause I just spent  as I sai d  we were in Holland in April  just  just a few months ago and I spent quite a bit of time with the daughters  three of the daughters of the Booka family.
>> Bill Benson: The war  of course  began in September 1939 when Germany and Russia attacked Poland  but your community  Hungary and your community  did not feel the full im pact of the war really until 1944 when the Nazis occupied Hungary and your town.
I guess my question is  when did you find out that not only the rabbi and his family  but almost all Jews had been killed?
10 >> Bill Benson: So the rest -- your mom  dad  and baby brother.
But as I say  by the time they came  they had something to eat or the Germans let them eat some.
And was your was someone else in your family with you?
Tell me -- tell me a little bit about -- about your fe -- your family  in regard to the - the climate in the house  about the way things were done in the house  about the religion  about the ethics.
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
So  it was very exciting to see my family because I have a very famous aunt and uncle.
The o ccasion was the visit of Mother Superior brother and his family.
Oh  yes  I did have a wonderful  I had a wonderful childhood.
And did you always -- during those 10 years did you stay with the family the whole time?
Before we talk about the events once the war began  start first by telling us a little about your family and your community and yourself in those years before the war.
Because you couldnt -- also because you -- They had many children  it was like there was their family and here I was  alone.
Did I cry for my family that was so brutally killed?
01:29:03 12 Anyway  we did come to Split and arri ved   I found the family waiting for us  two sons and a very  very friendly wife  and we went home.
Civil law was not very important at that time and I was working in family law and in youth.
You know the joke about the family moves to the south and the boys got to be bar mitzvahed but there is nobody to do the ceremony so they write to Brooklyn and to make it short  the Brooklyn man comes down and he arrives at the railroad station and hes got payess and a hat and a shtal and wha tever it is and the kids had never seen anything like this before so they follow him like the Pied Piper.
So they  sort of through my uncle  started beginning to m ove this reunion and how to get me to Germany.
He likes to sit on my sisters laps and it was just a normal family life.
When Im thinking of Bergen-Belsen  Im thinking more of my little boy and of my family.
Because were interested in getting a little more of your family backgrounds.
They took us  if I -- if my memory is right  to a home that the Rothschild family owned.
5 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: And where you lived?
Going to Japan was an -- an occasion for us very exciting  but the whole  the entire family  mine and my husbands was very mu ch against it.
So the -- otherwise  my parents were members of the Jewish community.
I was very happy with Tante Toos and living where I was  and I had this girlfriend and I played at her house and she had toys and I went on vacation with her family and I didnt want to go at all.
I think very ea rly in our discussion I told you that I was married more to my work than to my actual family.
Oh yeah  thats good because a lot of peopl e -- lot of people dont -- I tell you  my middle daughters family -- her husbands family  Jewish  she didnt even believe it when -- she said she never heard anything about it during the war.
So  I didnt grow up close to this family  close emotionally to this family.
Did you pretty much know most of the pe ople there -- or did your family?
End of Tape #2 21 Tape #3 So the family thought that I was dead because there was an incident in MinskSuwatki from which they deducted that the MKVD shot me.
I really  uh  only started thinking about Holland and what I went through again when I was fifty last year  and that's when I felt that I had to go back and make a connection again  even though the parents that  uh  kept me were no longer alive  uh  and the only real connection that I felt that I had there was Cornelia and  uh  again the problem of the language  but luckily there were many people in Holland that spoke Dut...uh  English that were able to interpret for me so when I went back to see Cornelia last year  it was a very short visit 01:41:46 because again I felt like it would be very uncomfortable not being able to speak the language  uh  but it  you know  gave me time from last year to this year to think about what these people had done and to what it means  uh  not only to me but I think to to my children  to my family  to my friends...uh  that they have risked their lives at a time when it was very dangerous to go against what was told to them to do which was that all the Jews were being rounded up and and they must  you know  follow th e dictum of the government of Germany which had occupied Holland at that time  and I r eally feel that for people to do what they did without any  uh  I mean to them what they did was what they feel every human being should do.
So my grandmother was taken away from her apartment and was put in what is called a hidden house  a Jew house.
My parents  sisters  and brothers -- I mean  my mother had about seven siblings.
The next day her husband came with a cart and we took whatever we could with us.
My mother was a very religious person; my father was not  but my mother was very religious.
I assume the rest of his relatives in Lukow  aunts  uncles  cousins  Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.
Your father  you told me  was involved in the Jewish community?
and I think she was the second in ma -- first was Esther  her  and then my -- what I want to mention is that in this pre-war period  and leading to the -- the invasion from the German  I know this because after the war  that contrary to some of the friends o -- friends of the family -- Mm-hm. --
It's against the safety of himself and his family  and also it's against his world of values because no matter for him the Jews  no matter + and not * paid for it  what the * you know  it means it's interesting to watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way  you know?
You know  you said your -- your family back in Holland  basically  you didnt talk about it.
So I...and that Poland and Czestochowa was Protectorate for us for that's where they give us the Polish money  so with that money I rented an ap ar...uh a room by a family  and I brought over my sister and my brother and my mother so we stayed together.
Yeah  and you told about how you -- how you found your sister  but did you ever find out anything certain about your brother and your parents?
Before we move to that period  once it really hit home to you in 1944  tell us what life was like once the war began in Europe for you and your family living in Budapest.
>> Bill Benson: What was your father doing during that time?
So we practically left almost everything in and a couple of other families which house become a Jewish house were still outside.
So i and your mother became tell me what her new name was.
Jews only received citizen names in the year 1729 and over the years because we were the family that tried to do well by the poor people  so we had many friends amongst them.
It was primarily the men of the family that would go out and hear things  th ey would bring newspaper.
I went to a Jewish organization  they had the -- a meeting -- social meeting on -- on a Sunday.
We went into an apartment building where my mother' s retired brothers and sister were living.
She did everything she could to get papers and affidavits for him  for the family   but it wasn't enough.
Later on  this other room  these two rooms got vacant and me and another family were assigned to this street.
You were talking about the fact that your family was very observant.
And there was my father  my husband and my older brother.
And some of my relatives also lived in Transylvania  so they became Romanian.
But because I was in a much worse state when we got married  and I to ld him  I didn't want to get married because I didn't think that I was well enou gh.
ﬁFamily X were looking for A  B  C  D Family X you have to be packed what you can carry with you in two hours  and were taking you to Russia to work  work camp.
And everybody from the family Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 136says  just dont go that time  shes pregna nt  its not gonna be good.
And there we registered and um  if you had family  they helped you to get reunited.
So how can it be that four people from one family is buried  died in the same day?
10 >> Bill Benson: So the rest -- your mom  dad  and baby brother.
We had...the house had like three tiers...three floors and the 3 bottom was the kitchen which 2 years ago when I was in Poland a whole family lived in the kitchen only and two more families lived on each floor.
Had you  before the war started  before 1939  had you ever heard of a man named Hitler?
And I knew the man because the head of the family  Mr. Osher was a widower and he had two sons of the first marriage  Heinrich wa s the youngest son of the first marriage  and they had two children  a son and a daughter after the second marriage  and the son and daughter of the second marriage were my age -- the son was my ag e  and the daughter was my sisters age.
Before we talk about the start of the war and the events that led up to and following the German occupation of Slovakia start  first  by telling us a little bit about your family and your community and your life in the pre -war years.
And now she's working on about 160 pages of correspondence from a family in Switzerland who sent their daughter to Pittsburgh in 1938.

Nevertheless  it would pass  but one was keenly aware of the preciousness of life  and to hold on to it as long as possible  and to me  this was really the most important thing  and I would say that during that entire time that I was in the camp  was a little  I mean  except for the beginning of the war when I really did not know  and only heard that the family had chosen that path together.

I tried to ask about things in the city  and any information about my family and the rest of the Jews from the ghetto  and all of a sudden one of our guides heard screams  a mother  I'm a mother  and I didn't hear it.
They were our -- our uncles  our aunts  our -- not my uncles  but there were parents there  you know.
Because number one  we saw him  number two he brought food  which helped us to have a little feast then  and number three is that he  we knew that thats what he would have done  he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four  family of five who were out of their own  well  problems  housed in our place.
So  thats where I spent three month in Israel  during which time my family started coming ba -- over from Romania in 1949.
Uh by and large I must say it was ignored by my family.
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone  who was left in your household with you at that time?
Q. After the German s came in  did your family do things differently ?
And what  how did you feed  how did your family support itself during that time  before the ghetto  that it lost the store?
One for his family and one for his imme diate relatives.
You had 150 Jewish families and 500  generally speaking  you lived through each other.
Did he did he talk about what was happening in Germany at all?
Again a surviving  again it was already 12 boys  and then it came a family lived from east but they were also save d. And then I went to the family upstairs.
There were six children  four brothers  two sisters  my father and my mother.
Even though your family and your -- your life w-was in danger and thats why your father deci -- and mother decided to leave?
Transports and going underground  and we ha d no family left.
I said to him  I have to meet my family if somebody survived in Germany   I have to go there.
And my brother and my husband were was sitting there in that little room but they didn't know my family  they just knew me.
Because one of their daughters who was active in the Zionist movement met me and I was so knowledgeable about what was going on in the Middle East   she decided to get the family to send me to Cornell.
The two that are in Baltimore   yes  and their families  and they had a reunion a couple of years ago of the whole family  theyve got a very large extended family  and they invited my husband and myself  and and I spoke to them.
Did you speak Polish and Yiddish in the house  or -- In the house  Yiddish.
Because he was so forthright and my family was so subtle.
And  did your parents have any contact with Jewish families  Jewish people?
Its ironic  they came from Siberia  th -- and they escaped from the Siberia [indecipherable] and they -- now they say whoever it could made -- took off and got further into Germany -- into Germany where they had DP camps  at least in a place wh ere th -- at least lay down and have foo -- enough food to eat not to be hungry again  you know  whatever food it was  but it was food to s -- to s -- to survive until each one found somebody else or so mething like that  from the camps or that family out in the different countries or something like that  and they -- Why -- why did you choose to go to Bergen -Belsen rather than any other DP camp?
And we lose fo -- fo -- with this family we lose connection  contact.
Did they remain in Poland  that family  or did they leave?
No  it was my escape--not to be exposed to the family problem  not to play with children where they coul d ask me  where is your mother?
My oldest sister  my oldest sister was ten years older than I. Her name.
Harry Alexander 51 October 11  1995 Page 51 Tape 3 And we are talking about your own family.
Hes had one son  Ch arlie Kent  my cousin  110 who established a very beautiful family  the Kent family with four children in Toronto and Phoenix and the States.
We lived on the first floor  the rabbi family on the second floor  on the third floor a non -Jewish family  and on the fourth floor there was an attic.
This was the family that hid us during the war  my mother.
Cause as I said earlier I came from a poor family.
He was the head of the family  a typical European head of the family.
I-I -- I know that my sister has mentioned it several times  something of the family dynami c between the brothers and Tante Toos and -- and how often there was friction because of the fact that they were not wanting the sister to do this and so on.
We -- I never saw in our family  I never saw in my surrounding  where I was in my little  in -- in my family down there  but then I start  you know  I heard its all this abuse and all this -- this -- this -- this -- this bad things.
This world that you describe  sounds actually like a lovely world  in in New Jersey at that time  y ou know  of growing up with this large family  and and a wonderful older brother  and and warm parents  and so at home  were discussions about what was going on in Europe ever part of the conversation?
People only believe it if it hurts themself  if it hits themself  hits them or their family.
>> Rita Rubinstein: 1944  the sounds of war got very close  and the people we lived with  they took their family and took us along with them.
And like I said there was only this one young family.
Interviewer: Do you remember anything a bout your mothers family; about how many brothers and sisters she had?
Tell me how did that affect the family  his actual arrest and departure?
And the head  the Mother Superior said to my family  my mother  sorry you have to take your children out.
And we lived very happy and the kids was growing up nicely and it was a wonderful childhood.
This is what I did and they were so pleased and that Bar Mitzvah boy was so wonderful  and and the family ... Back-up.
We was happy  we was with our parents  sisters and brothers and families  you went with this friend  you went to the other grandparents and uncles and cousins - we was a big family.
Well  we lived with an uncle of ours  my father's brother.
He risked his own life  not only his own life  but the life of his family if they found out he's trying to help Jewish people.
What did it mean for you  for your family  to be enemy aliens?
Did your parents say  I mean you were young of course.
But it was not a case that a command told us  \ Hey  why didn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can  or something else  to the family camp?\
My parents  my father  he was religious  but not to the extreme.
So I found myself in the eastern part of Poland under Russian occupation and my dream then was only one dream...to go back to Warsaw  go back to my family to be with them.
And most of my relatives who we didnt have that much of a big family landed up in Israel.
So in other words  you knew that there were eight aunts and uncles?
You were just turning 11 when the Nazis overran Poland and World War II began  but the war came to you and your family in Belgium less than a year later  in the spring of 1940  before you tell us about your journey to safety and what you experienced during that time  tell us first a little bit about your early years  about your family and your own life before the war began.
And  uh  but the Jewish families  like I said  they lived on the other side of town.
Did you tell your children about your experiences during the war.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 >> Jill Pauly: Yes.
I did not know if my fam ily or those dear to me survived.
Before I went to the ghetto  I went to a place where the Germans were having a field kitchen  eating their meal.
I remember when I got engaged to Isaac  I lived with a family in Montreal for six months  until my visa was ready for me to come to the United States.
No family left  and there was no place for them to go back and live.
And you just stay in this house until you g ather your whole family.
My fathers side  they were all very educated  but different type.
You had to give a security so otherwise you couldnt bring a family.
After I was liberated and found out that none of my family survived  I was in a great rage for a while.
And I have correspondence from my parents to their family and friend  hundreds of letters that got saved and sent and kept with my mother 's artifacts  with non-Jews during the war and I  I have possession of those.
What kind of -- Did your mother come from a well-to-do family or a struggling family?
And  we 5 went to Utrecht  and I went to  a family no  a woman  what she was a nurse.
NB: German \ Treuhandler\  = trustee or custodian] And 5 he...uh....because of that  he was allowed some...he was probably getting some money for his work  and he was given ration cards  and so was his family.
Well  my family did not -- my -- my parents and grandparents did not come from Germany  they had -- they had -- they were American immigrants  they came from Russia.
What was reaction of your family when -- when Roosevelt died?
My fam ily was a very close family  and I never developed a feeling that I can be alone.
I mean  a whol e family  and an extended family would have gone.
Let me ask you  your parents  what did your father do for a living? {
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 And I suppose it was because there was really not enough money for the four of us to go.
And in fact  my grandfather  my mother's father  and his daughter went to Warsaw.
I said but don't forget I am in the middle of my preparations al so to leave Germany  and he said well  uh I can give you my promise that when this will be done and will be successfully done  it will be our commitment and our obligation to help you and your family to get out of Germany.
Tell us what got them to that point to say we're going to hide our entire family  and what they did.
And we went through Poland  but I heard that all my family perished during the resistant in Wa rsaw ghetto.
After my father and my younger brother were taken away  I remained with my uh--with my brother the--the other brother and my mother.
Did you know what was going on in Europe with the situation with the Jews  or what was happening at all during the war?
Your mother was afraid for you or afraid for herself and family?
Also she needed somebody like I needed somebody  when you are masquerading as a ge ntile After all you have to have family  to get some mail.
Now  since we had pictures from the Jewish family at that time  if you remember  maybe you dont remember  because your age  west Europe was already under the attack by British  maybe American planes.
And that  I would say to a great extent so she individually  as a family they also do things.
Sometimes I go with the subway and I say to -- you know  theres a funny feeling [indecipherable] says  you know  I think Im gonna -- Im gonna visit my family  you know?
So she was alone and she came back to our family.
And what was your relationship to your mother and father if you were so close to your siblings?
So a family was sitting around the table and telling us  raus.
And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family  without a Jewish community  without the   we were always Jewish there  but we were not  Jewish people were not the only people who were in Auschwitz.
Did did this make a diffe rence in your family as you were growing up  that your mother had not had the same opportunities  and so the same ability to to grow intellectually as your father had had?
I come from a family where I have one -- two brothers who were college professors  one -- one has changed in the meantime  to be an -- a psych -- a psychotherapist.
Not to the family; to the family  very  very poor we were.
They not only provided us with clothing  but also found a family with which I could live  which was a very Orthodox Jewish family  and for the first time Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 61 in my life  I was exposed to very Orthodox.
Did you have Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends in the town?
02:17:21 [Technical conversation] 26 02:17:49 [Showing photographs] This  is my family picture.
Then she opened the letter and it said we have been notified that you are the spouse and that there are three children wh o are the family of David Mendel ovicz  Private whatever and we should present ourselves with that letter at the army headquarters.
And But once your father was taken away  did you have any contact with him?
So they took me under their arms  and took me to their camp.
I don't know if they were taking another Jewish family or if it was too dangerous but we had to go to a hotel.
And now -- but your family was well off -- Yeah. --
So they went undercover  they were walking around every day to the villages  and threatening people that anybody who will help a jew will be killed on the spot with whole family.
Until 1939  let -- Q. I just want to ask you a little more about your family life before we go on to the war.
In fact  ransomi ng him with money from the govern -- Romanias government  and this is how Zolly and his family arrived in Canada.
What kind of contact did your group or your family have wi th Randolph Churchill?
Even when we came to the United States because people  survivors did not have family.
You're older  you have your own family and kids and you think sometimes what did your mother feel when they took the kids away.
And other thing interesting say at that time that I have to tell you was a girl in our town from a very high -class family  put it this way  was Jew.
Well  I graduated in 1936  and I got a job in a research organization  and at the same time also  I was always participating during my younger years  growing years  in -- in choirs  joining choirs and singing in the school  and -- and everybody in the family  including my -- my mother  of course  suggested that I have a beautiful voice  and I -- I should try to -- to learn  to study.
He had left during the war and was inquiring about his family 's fate.
Well  yes  clearly  the responsible for the extended family and particularly to his parents  he was very devoted to his father.
Some of their family members had been killed  and so  we set up a test case.
He said -- I said to him  ﬁYou know  what I would like for that  I would like you to give me a ration card for a family.
And then after that your mother came and got you and placed you with another family  the Von der Lindens.
And he has a family  beautiful children  and they came to visit me also to W ashington to Silver Spring.
At that time we couldnt come to the United States because we had no family here.
There was one Polish family living in that town  he was a doctor  his name was Bi aly  B-i-a -- B-i-a-l-y  with whom I was close.
>> Dora Klayman: To begin with  I was born in Zagreb  and my paternal family was in Zagreb.
And -- And did your sister support your -- your doing what -- Oh yeah  she -- as much as poss -- but I had to be pretty much on my own  because I -- I was -- made perfectly clear that I wasnt going to sponge off of my sister and her family.
We had no family after awhile   except the one cousin of my father in Paris.
So  you didnt have much relations with your fathers side of the family.
My mother was very religious  but my father wa s not religious at all.
I flew to Perpignan   and took a hotel there  and I decided to stay there for eight days  because I didnt want to spend two days there and not achieve what I came to do  and I brought my being a professional photographer  I brought my camera along  and this gentleman knew just the way to the camp  and I was ab le to get in to the camp  and I took between 1500 and 2000 photogr aphs over a period of eight days  I photographed everything that I could find in this conc entration camp  so that I could show myself and my children and my family where I actually was in 1942.
Did you ever  back when you were in Europe deciding what to do after the war  was there a time where you were really seriously considering going to Israel because your fathers family was there?
I had here two aunts  my mother's sister and my father's sister.
And the woman on the right is a sister of Pepi Berger  who was a Regina Felsen  or Feldrin  who married during the war  and -- to a Dutch person  and she was part of the family as well.
But when they see saw the Germans come for the family and theyre willing to let go of the child.
And my parents were married in the early 20s -- in 22  and the wedding had to be held in Frankfurt  because a large number of members of the family couldnt receive visas to go to Zurich  where the -- typically  the bride s family town would be the wedding.
Then the decree came out that all Jews should go in in ghetto; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the ghetto.
When the action began it was too late already for the Farber family to get there because the Germans were rounding up the Jews already and they couldn't go through the streets  so you know Uncle Farber and his two 9 daughters climbed up on the roof of the building and there was a big chimney like the European buildings have  those wide chimneys  hid behind the chimney and it didn't take long.
The reason I'm asking is that it sounds like your family had a fairly comfortable life style  and you were not highly religious and yet you were following -- you were concerned about the future of Jews in Lithuania?
>> Bill Benson: Do you know how many family members you lost during the Holocaust?
And then I do remember after the war was over that they sent packages over there for my aunt and he r family every week.
So she got to see your children  and know your wife and your family?
Also my grandmother  who died  but I was visiting her and my sister and my mother also  and my father.
A family I dont know  just -- just a family  you know  not my family  but was a family  you know?
And we lived two to three families in a two room apartment.
And I said  ﬁForget it  we go to America.ﬂ I had family here  right?
So uh it was not living in Sweden as much those couple of weeks as living in a Danish Jewish environment in a house in Sweden  and of course everybody was affected but uh by what had happened to them and whether all their family had managed to escape or there were some of their relatives who had been taken by the Germans.
Interview with Harry Ebert October 16  2010 30So he maintained his nobility name  but he main he kept his kept the Krupp name in the family.
No  I was working with a friendly family  who manufactured clothing.
And when I visited that family  the foster family in 1984  I think  or `86  they told me what had happened   that once I was told that my mother was no longer here  I became very quiet  sad.
Another family on the other side of the city in similar way they surrounded it.
And we made friends with her family as well; she had a son.
And when we reach ed home  since it was in a dangerous positions  we went to stay with a family  some friends of ours for a --for a few days.
And of course I followed very much myself  35 we did as a family.
It got one one payen one not not Jewish family that left there.
It sounds like it was something that was valued in your family.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 So we were picked up  sent to the ghetto.
Even that was not encouraged  it was my parents were not my parents were not that family conscious  I would say.
How long did you live in Israel before you came to the United States and why did you come?
I had a chance to go into hiding  but I didn't want to go into hiding with his -- my fiance's family because I wanted to stay with my mother.
And when I got this  and I he was came t o visit his family  and his friend  they walk to the city  to see that movie.
Now  some families  like the famous story of Anne Frank  Anne Frank's family went into hiding as one family unit in an attic  some were like her family.
Well  she told me that my mothers family was evidently very educated.
And there was a very Orthodox Jew with hi s long gray beard and this is family and  in a very dignified way  he conv ersed and communicated with his family and he probably wanted still something from the house and talk to them.
I could trace my family back to the 17th and perhaps to the 16 th century  and they probably lived there all the time.
His family -- His father was born in Saint Petersburg and his mother in Maylo  which is on the German border.
Anthony: It struck me that your aunt and your grandm other that you had family members who lived long lives when they had the chance?
Let me ask you  in those years be tween 1932 and 1936  when your brother left  your parents and other relatives  were they all very keen on having family members leave?

So I have quite a few in my family who did -- who were murdered.
So one day the Germans came and knocked on the door and your family...?
Applause] Susan  thank you so much for joining us today and for being willing to be our First Person .
My mother always said she only wanted two children  she raised such a large family before that thats all she wanted  and thats all she had was two children.
We were normal middle class family and every year we went to grandma's and this was the highlight of my life to go to the schitel and she came to pick us up from the train with the local kutcher   with the local guy that had -- Q A driver who had a carriage?
Now  I went through  I have my life here and family.
Th e other family found a -- a bus and they were safe.
And I born in a family where wa s four children  I was the oldest one.
I dont know if he talked different  but we were happy that the family was united  and we were all decided we go back to Poland.
But I was accepted into my American family as though I were a complete member of it immediately and was treated as such.
And becau se of the fact that the violin  I was exposed that early... Of course  these Gypsies returned me to my family after they found out whom I belonged to.
And with a husband who died in military uniform  so he was obviously a Christian  with he r mother signing this affidavit th at she was illegitimate  and the father was a Christian  she practical ly cleared herself and then set out to save the rest of the family.
And then I just would say -- stay with grandmother  with Papas family.
So I go in  I don't have a friend  I don't have a family  I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask.
refuse to answer  or would you say I dont want to talk about this  or -- Well  I tell you  most people  even the people who brought us here  they brought another family.
When you were a boy  and when you were a young adult  were you involved in any political organizations  any Zionist movements  anything?
When I was in hiding  well family life is the wrong thi -- well  my -- Why [indecipherable] -- originally  at -- down at the farm  I had my mother and my -- my -- my -- my father and my mother with me.
It was behind a chicken coup  there was a family there.
Were sitting there  and there were some friend of ma -- the family  and the next day the German invaded.
She says ﬁwell I knew your family from Europe  I am here in this country a few years  do you need anything?ﬂ We said ﬁno we dont need nothingﬂ. However she ran and she bought for us some cake and she bought for us some candy and chocolate and she pushed into our pocket a very small amount of money but that was the very first money that we had in our pocket.
And my grandfather said Herr so and so youve joined the Gestapo and the postmaster said I had to  to protect my family  but Ive come to warn you.
Slowly  slowly pushing her  asking if there was anybody Jewish in her family  because it was enough if your great -great grandfather were Jewish  you were Jewish  that's it.
What happened -- that was after they took my father away.
181) They didnt hear from him for many years  becau se something happened in the family.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
Well  first of all he risked his life because unde r the  the German  under the Germans  helping a Jew  not saving him  but giving hi m bread or whatever  endangered his life  and also the life of his family.
So wa-was there -- were there only you and his family  your future husbands family?
The family  we are  we still correspond with each other  and we still are close to our family in Israel with Moshe.
We went together -- >> Bill Benson: They came back much later than when you were liberated?
So what was the difference between your family  who decided not to sta y  not to register  to leave  and those who decided to stay?
>> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: You should be proud of your family.
What about you being Jewish and marrying into a Catholic family?
>> Bill Benson: Germany and the Soviet Union attacked Poland in September 1939  launching World War II.
Tell me a little bit about how your father I assume it was your father  supported the family.
I know you have  but did you go with your family?
And a lot of them came with their religious leaders  with their Rabbis.
You have grown up in this family  playing with other kids  Jewish and non-Jewish  what have you.
I had uncles and I had cousins  and some cousins were very rich.
Came to New York  came to some friends that knew my family.
And there was a janitor in that house who offered  you know  that I should move in with their family and live with them.
They married into another very  very old and very wealthy family of Ferrara   Minerbi   who are also again  the family is all over.
Because family held together  helped to stay you know  had your mind set out to s on survival.
A nd you want me to tell you a bout the other children  or Interview with Susan Berlin March 7  2003 36the family of [indecipherable]?
I was too young to join the army  but as a family  of course  my mother was figure out how to do it  and we went to Persia from and Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 74 Well  tell me about the trip from Uzbekistan to the point of leaving the Soviet Union.
>> Frank Liebermann: In 1936 when we couldn't use playgrounds  our family  about 10 families who knew each other  rented what was known a s a garden that is a space at the edge of town where you could rent plots of land to plant.
And how can I not talk about it when not only my imme diate family perished in it  but the whole Jewish-Polish-Jewish community in Poland wa s destroyed.
This family had a beautiful villa and they had these gorgeous pears.
Did you have any contact with your family while you were away?
In the case of my mother -- they knew everything about everybody.
When you came home to the United States  who was the first family member you saw?
Let me start off by asking when your family first came to Denmark?
You mentioned that during Kristallnacht that the rest of the family had already left.
My father  m eanwhile  was already in America and family meant an awful lot to me.
And so he didn't take the opportunity uh opportunity and uh eventually went to Auschwitz with the whole family.
One of the things that hurts I think the most about what happened to my family  and Im sure many families  is that they were totally  completely innocent  because they were totally good people.
Its -- its extraordinary because there wa -- there was such a stop  theres such an abrupt halt in any kind of family continuity becaus e there are no letters or photographs or visual sightings  or meetings or anything.
So I said to him  \ But if I move to a Jewish family  I'm already taking away the place that my brother could take.\
And also the ex-King of Spain  Alfonso  also lived for years in Portschach with his family; and  uh  then the English King  Edward the VIIIth--the Duke of Windsor--lived  uh  first there  after he left England.
So  we kind of led this normal family life  where the husband g-goes to work  and he went to school at night  and I to ok care of the children  and -- and we tried USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 17 to live kind of an -- a normal life  as Holocaust survivors.
There were aktions against Vilna Hey  tell me What did you do to the Geist family?
Every family knew each other  not only the parents  but also the children and the grandparents.
There was always this extra threat that if you don't follow orders  somebody else in your family will be punished.
Later when I went to Europe with my family and we visited Luxembourg  and we went to visit her husband.
When I went out from the family I supplied them with food as much as I could.
For -- for two years -- I guess its almost two years  you are  in a way  the man of this little family of you and Guy.
My parents -- there were five of us  as you know from the picture.
And can you tell us a little bit about your mother?
Did you think about your family when you were in the woods  or -- Oh  always.
You know  the irony is we had a lot of relatives in America  and the whole family had affidavits to come to this country  but there was this stupid quota  and that's whyI remember my father was the second youngest.
One example of that is you told me that your family was already trying to get out of Germany before the Kristallnacht.
My uncle  it was an uncle that came with him  my mothers oldest brother.
But its something we could never talk about  and she went to her grave thinking that I didnt care about my birt h family  because by the time 2000 - 2002 came around  she wasnt all that cognizant  so I didnt have to answer for my actions.
I remember when we were on our way to hiding in the forest  we stayed with that wonderful family.
So when you stayed at this place  at this place for a year  with Shairtza   yeah  with the family Shairtza   what was the husbands name?
3 -- and you learned you were Romanian and you went home and told your family you're a Romanian now?
Her parents didn't make it through  so she -- she stayed there  and she is  you know  the child of the family that adopted her.
Well my father did know where I was and he knew the name of the family Video Tape No.
In fact  before we turn to the war years  which began with Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939  followed by their attack on France in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 May of 1940  let's begin first with you telling us a little about your parents and their life prior to the war.
Is the was this courtyard in the building where your family lived  was it in in the middle of a town  li in Iai  or was it over to the side  was it a suburban area?
Years ago I stopped dreaming that and I really thought that was my wishful dream.
If I have not obligation to my family I go hundred times escape because was not so bad.
My sister Edie lived with a family in London  then when they were taking all of the children out of London  she was sent to someone out in the country  but she wasn't allowed to go to school.
And I didn't know what it was  but my whole feelings about my family  I just lost them... they were probably burning in that time.
Where my grandfather had -- you could see the trucks outside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and home  with the telephone number  and on the truck  branded names of things like percil and so forth  even American products.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 15 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: were in the ghetto.
But my family wasnt too keen about her  because my wife has a she talks a little loud  but she means nothing  but thats the way she talks and they couldnt accept her to right away.
So after Hitler came to power  you were still in Berlin for a time?
Sure  they -- my -- they -- my family [indecipherable] the region  thats right.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
And I understand that my nine-year old sister was the hero of the family.
So my father's partner came over with his family together to us  and we stood together til the German occuped Warsaw.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
06:46:30 I didn't have much to do with the Jewish poli ce  the only time that I had any dealings with them is when they separated mother and me from her family.
03:14:44 The old men and the women  everybody  the w hole family.
Who would be better at the... There were always in the family an uncle or another person that always will test you on a Saturday night what you learned in school during the week.
In that city  I knew there was a friend of mine  al so  a watchmaker with his family there.
And they and they and and and they got the tickets fo r all for the entire family to go to France   and the next day we left Antwerp  we left everything and we went to Brussels.
Its -- its just -- its just part of the way I -- I grew up  I mean  we -- we enjoy Polish food  Polish music  but I -- I dont think that we are involved in any way with what -- what are classical Polish American activities  but rather we have a definite consciousness of the background o-of three out of our four parents.
Put them everybody on the street  and they were driven to the ghetto.
You had referred to your -- to y -- to your wife  Paulette in the -- as we spoke about your -- your corporate years  so lets -- le-lets return now to that part of your family life  and tell me how you met.
They were picture of of loving  caring couple  and the and Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 13to me  like I said  they were picture of how the family should lo love and live together.
Bill Benson: When you were liberated  when you knew you were liberated and the war was over for you  your family and other Jews that had survived came under suspicion by the Soviets.
Yeah  he had a negative opinion  b ecause one of the of the important communists which he was exim examining his activities  was from a very rich Jewish family in Panevžys.
So we had  we have two children  a daughter and a son.
Tell me about your who in your immediate family survived  and what happened to some of your siblings.
And from that 35 family  one was a family who came about 20  25 years ago.
Because what they had done in Bergen-Belsen  when all  the first group of 370 people left  they kept back one member from each family to have as a hosta ge until the negotiations were complete.
So  over the years  my brothers gave me the letters  because I was the only one in the family who showed interest  and of cour se  the only one who could read German.
I came from a very poor family  into now a very well-to-do family.
This came from the farmers who we re there when the Gestapo picked up my...the family and you know  all the people at five o'cloc k in the morning.
My parents were first cousins  which makes the whole family thing very interesting.
And then I found out that they not only did that to the people in Bad Kreuznach but they did it in every town where Jewish people lived in Germany.
Embroider pillow cushion covers for birthdays and Christmas and that sort of thing for the family.
That is  what was going on in Germany   and what was going on in Russia ?
He  uh  said to me  and by then he knew there was only two of us left in our family  whatever you do  try to survive and carry on the name.
So how did you and your family find out you had to go to another ghetto?
The real thing about my family we found out only in 1960  approximately  when one uncle who survived -- let me go back a little bit.
I: Um–I think she was married  but I was an only child.
And I had another aunt of a uncle of my mothers 32 brother who perished before  well died before.
The special thing on the Frank family and this  it was like an honor.
And if they didnt do this  then they arrested your family  or even some of the buildings where this occurred  you know Okay.
That  in the end  when Israel was created  they started having what I called the Jewish Olympics  the Maccabiah games.
Is -- is transported surreptitiously from your mothers brothers  that is your uncles from the other side of the family apartment in Vilnius  to Kaunas -- To -- -- and eventually goes to -- Klaipda. --
Just say a little bit about what they've meant to you over these years and your family.
Right now  Id like to did you Id like to find out more about your family  the background of your family [phone ringing][break] So  you would like to know?
Interview with John Lang October 15  2010 16 Did you find members of your family there?
So  I remember I would sometimes have to go up to Prague because thats where the consulate was  and I remember having a large family of about 13 people Schmuck Lieberman and another name.
So your mother  your father  and all of your brothers and sisters.
So my father was able to get for our family transit visas to the Soviet Union.
I had another uncle in New York and had two a son and a daughter.
As you know  I was brought up in a family that was half Catholic  so I never noticed really.
So  all we really had are my mothers sisters and my mothers brother.
An d what about the rest of your family at that time?
And my only goal and strength to survive was to be reunited with my family that I had at that time in Palestine  from Germany.
Among other purposes  The Registry helps make it possible for survivors  family members  and others  to find those whom may have survived.
So this was a tremendous responsibility on the per--on the side of the person who wants to help the Jew  and put himself in the position that he can be lose his own life  but also endanger the family life.
I would like you to please tell me about your arrival in Auschwitz.
That was she married she comes from a family of bankers  Fefers  from Ostoriwiec and she married a man who was come from Sandomierz.
And my grandmother  and of course my parents  we all lived in one apartment.
He was very sick  I have no money for doctor and my -- that other family that I told you that they were very nice and kind would come an-and -- and -- and visit us and -- and my husband was trying to get a job  but h-he couldn't -- i-it was very hard to get that time a job as a dental technician and we cannot get nothing  you know  to the hires.
They...my parents loved each other very much  and so love was spread all over our family.
Except one day there was big me als and I think I was the only one in the family who was able to eat.
Maybe the people  they were members of my family  but I 48 couldn't recognize.
Your family -- And go through the -- -- your -- -- not my family. --
My father used to read the papers and he had family in Hungary.
And one family picture which I took from you know from when my lawyer brought it for me.
01:35:52 The next day  she harnessed a wagon with her horses and he  he took me to this to this family.
But we got to Belgium  we -- the fa mily I lived with were very good to me  and the family Guy was with  they were good to him.
And life went by and I used to go back to my in the summertime  I used to go back to join my my family to Rokiıkis .
We are -- because in those days women were not still involved in a two -- two family earning pattern and so wome n stayed home and -- more in those days.
Did you remember as you were growing up what kind of what kind of conversations would take place around the family table?
This grew and it ripened  and my family is not here to pick it.
But my father was very much  very st rong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew  but not a religious Jew at all  neither was my mother.
We had one room and we as a family  a whole family  you know the four of us  yeah  all four of us  yeah  my -- well  m-my father wasnt with us any longer.
As you were growing up  did you meet any Jewish people?
And then after two weeks we were taken by some other people to the middle of the country and we stayed for two years with a magnificent family called the Buchas in Bilthoven--uh  which is a small town north of Utrecht  which is in the middle of Holland.
And I was then working with -- staying with this doctor and I could have stayed there for years  but I was staying for months  many months and she aray -- Angela went there to school in -- and she [indecipherable]  she was anti-doctor and she went into her bed in the morning  Angela and she had no social life at all  only family life.
So I have never found anyone from my family  not even from distant relatives.
The context  what happened  right  to the Jews of -- of my family  is the persecution  the anti-Semitism  the hate  right  the monstrosity  right  that they created.
I grew up in a middle-class family and my paternal grandparents lived very close to us and so did my maternal grandparents.
My wife  I think she had nightmares sometime about  you know  her family  her brother  or this  but I never had any dreams about the war  no.
All of a sudden  I'm in this Orthodox Jewish family  but I was like full of wanting to learn th ings  so -- and I liked them very much  and really we discovered we really loved each other.
Th-The girls mo thers husband died  the girls father had died  and she theres a family of four children and the oldest is 18  and there is no shochet  and there was no rabbi in town.
What I remember   I  I was  my parents were in contact with the family what we had in America  of course  that  you know  my brot her was in America  my aunt was in America  not my mother's family  they were all kill ed.
You know  that sometime looks to some people kind of foolish  you know  dog on the monument  but I tell you  whoever ga -- love the animals  you know  the dog is like a -- a family member.
And for holidays  did you celebrate with the extended family  and your cousins  and Ah  ye sometimes.
And she could not come as a member of the family  much to the everlasting sadness that my father went through.
Did you go to school there  did you have a larger family from your fathers side  who looked after you?
There was a family living in it   a woman and children.
Half of my family in Israel  whoever survi ved -- whoever has survived is in Israel.
I have two daughters  I have three granddaughters and three grandsons.
As a matter of a fact  one -- I was the youngest from all my cousins.
You know -- and we s -- held the canon and sa -- whole dinner was not touch  and burn  whole family  we cannot eat -- Mm-hm  mm-hm.
Like here  and in Amer ica  the distance is so big that its a problem to have a family close together.
But you -- you probably need to remember that the family made a decision early on to join you.
They work on a farm.ﬂ So I knew the family is dead.
Nine years after my my birth  he sent the family to Italy   that he lost 2 000 dol dollars  when the banks closed.
She is working with the museum's \ Remember Me\  project which publicizes the photographs of over 1 000 Jewish children orphaned or otherwise separated from their parents during the Holocaust in an effort to identify and connect them with any surviving family members or friends.
So for a bit I got so disoriented that there was no -- that -- that my experiences really  you know  I was beaten into wonderful shape  and very quickly  I think  after I began to think seriously about that time  how ludicrous the thought is  because I would have preferred a banal  normal childhood  with my mother and brothers and family than -- than being formed into a fine shape.
And my sister and I and the cousin were separated because my family was afraid that we would talk or fight.
We didnt have money for the whole family to leave  and when we -- we sold what -- what excess of -- we had  in order to -- so that I could buy a ticket for me  and I went.
So youre talking about six properties  maybe 30 - 40 Gentile families  and us  the Jewish family  closing off the dead end street.
There was no welfare or things like that there  and you had to live on your own or family or friends who wanted to help you.
And this is the family who gave me my wedding when I got married.
They say that the male member s of my generation of our family were marvelous husbands because they all had th is training from their sisters.
When were you -- when did you have to go and live in the ghetto?
Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you?
And I liv ed with this family for a couple of months.
When was the last time you had any cont act  you meaning this time your family had any contact with your relatives in Poland?
Finally  I -- I -- I have to tell you -- which I have now pieced together subsequently  is my fathers niece  the daughter of his sister  and her husband had escaped the last minute from Monastir  went to Salonika because they had family there  but they were told they were crazy to come to Salonika  because it was under German occupation.
This is when you were still in your apartment  your house?
If one person would be missing  the Germans said they're going to take the whole family and other families  and they're going to be killed in front of everybody.
So we went up to the attic  and the rabbi's family was already there  but the rabbi wasn't there.
e-even a -- anything that reminds you of times before the war  when you -- No  before the war I was a child  and lived in a nice home  [indecipherable] nice family.
And then when  at Pearl Harbor the family was evacuated back to the States  mother had a  was originally from Kansas  she was from Wichita and so my husband  my Eva Edmands 21 [Date not labeled] Page 21 future husband and his sister and mother came back to the United States while his father remained in the Philippines and then later the family got word that he had been made prisoner of war of the Japanese and he wound up dying in Japanese prison of war camp.
They had to sleep in the street because there were no sanitarium no sanitarium beds for them  and it was very  very difficult because none of them family.
My family  my mothers family and my fa thers family  the only one who is left in the Uni ted States is my cousin Esther who lives in Texas and who is going to be 90 in August.
I was five  so that would be ‚40  1940  so somewhere between ‚35 and ‚40 is when the family moved from Almozd to Debrecen.
And  at the start  when Nazis marche d into Czechoslovakia in ‚38  he found himself in Switzerland  vacationing with his whole family.
I could not communicate with anybody except the immediate family  my mother's sister a nd brother-in-law and their son  their only son.
So he said  \ I have to\  -- \ I can give you cards for everybody in your family.\
Did the three of you go to synagogue as a family?
It was -- as I said before  just one big  happy family.
Also my grandmother  who died  but I was visiting her and my sister and my mother also  and my father.
I have two children and she has two children and that is one good family.
Now your parent -- you said your family was divided between different locations in Lvov.
Is there anything else you'd like to add before we go to the documents uh about your... Oh  uh well...after...when I start living in Derby I uh because I was teaching in Germany in a in a displaced person camp  I was uh...I was working in at all this time at Basset Company where manufacture and uh working to provide a home for family  and uh I always interested in history and uh I am involved with organization like a church organization where I belong to local church and also organization  national  like Polish-American Congress ...you know  of America and uh Polish National Alliance ...all the Polish... Foundation  so uh I uh organize some exhibit.
Now  your father is clearly known as an anti-Nazi  the family is known as an anti-Nazi.
That part of the family  but the rest of the family  they were in another wagon  not in that  you know?
He stood up and Dr. Elkes stood 16 and close  not far away from him and when there was a special hardship for a family to be...to be apart...torn apart or some...or fo r reasons  there was a man like who was a veteran Zionist leader and so on  so he asked this man is needed...w e needed a carpenter for the...for the building of the airport and so on  and he could rescue maybe 10  maybe 15  maybe 20  but he stood on his legs.
What do you know about your mother's family  a ny information that you know about them?
Interview with Adi Eisenberg 11 August 29  2014 You r family did do that.
And my Morrisstown uncle attached himself to a wealthy Jewish family in Morrisstown.
And he went to this Polish family  begged them to stay there for two hours.
02:15:40 And I come on the road and it was two gendarmes and they threw out a family from this house -- maybe they want to take the house -- and they threw out and they say ﬁHey  come here.ﬂ And they say  ﬁhelp ﬂ and I help these people to put on the wagon.
As the Nazi regime went on  what else happened to you and your family?
That he could take over the religious part in my family.
And shes married  you know  lives in Vilnius   has her own family.
My family on Sunday had a lunch  a family lunch and we went into the sun room where their radio was and we had the radio on when we heard about this.
No  there was Polish  French and Yiddish and I spoke Yiddish.
Oh  as I said  my father was not a religious man  but he was a Jew.
Were you with your f -- were you with your family?
Can I ask you  was this -- was this sort of typical of the problems that the refugees had  that the male in the family  the -- the adult male was not able to earn a living and the kids had to go out  or wa -- do you -- It was not -- it was typical in some instances.
Because I had older brothers and sisters  it made a big difference in my life.
I decided not to go  because I lost a lot of my family in both of those places.
Was your family From from the about 3 000 people   ab approximately 120 people came back  all of the all of the rest perished in the concentration camps.
And then when I came over to America and -- the children transport  and I got to my mother's cousin  that they took out -- they were looking who was left from the family.
And and th -the only survivor is  besides the two sisters  you know  from this family this is a 1914 picture Oh my.
I on the other hand was with a family where the woman actually had a nervous breakdown after I got there.
Delicacy and meats and fas Š How far back di d his family go that you know how many generations back?
My mother did not -- family did not originate from Lodz.
They brought their children back then  it was allowed  which was  I think  a very nice  humanitarian gesture  because Switzerland  who had the same problem  did not allow family members to follow.
I went to visit with my uncle and aunt and their two children.
From the bank I couldnt take out  but was a Gentile family  I dont know if they were anti-Semitic or not  they dealed with Jews to make a dollar.
In Italy  I don't think hardly any Jewish family keep kosher in the homes.
So  so uh  they right away took me  and also the family that was there  there was a father and mother and 2 children  and they all ha d asthma  I remember they were so sick from-asthma comes up when they  when you're nervous  and they were so sick  and the woman where they were hidden  uh  was an older lady from 80 years old  so the Germans asked me where I was hidden  and I didn't want to tell them.
Tell me a little bit about your mother and your father.
So the British ambassador  again  he managed to get this fee on th -- this guarantee reduced to 1 000 pounds for the whole family  but we didnt have 1 000 pounds.
Or -- Well  n-no  it wasnt a famil -- but it was like a family.
They put in another family with us  so as a result when they came in the evening -- and we only got like one room for everybody.
When you say you -- be cause of your family  what did your family do?
On this map of Germany  the arrow points to Berlin where Harry and his family lived when he was born.
Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 40 And I tell you that later  I dont want to get that on -- on tape  my grand -- of course  my whole family attended  except I had one uncle who was also a rabbi.
Interview with Frank Hyde May 4  2013 105 when your child was born from a bourgeois family  that child couldnt go to college.
This tape -- this is tape number five  side A. When -- when you think back about your life after liberation  is there anything in particular that we havent mentioned yet  that was very impor tant to you or to your family that -- that we should simply mention?
In any of this time  did you see a nybody die from the time Yes  yes  I saw for even a close  in my family.
We were in Duratso - oh  I have really sk ipped something that is most important  and wh ere the family came in very much.
They had a little daughter who was my age  a couple of months younger than me.
And the family sort of found ways to get situated among all that family.
One of them got married right I would say during the war  maybe in 1940s  and I dont remember whether she had a family or not.
And this time it was in Komarovo  in this village it was a Polish family  it was the father and a daughter.
Papa Bolla was the president of the Italian mountain club  the whole family  Leala  Rico.
We had arranged with everybody that we would go back to Frankfort  because then as a family  whoever would live would go.
When did you start to speak about your experiences during the war?
Your fathers fathers first wife was named Deutsch and theres also a Deutsch on your mothers side of the family.
My brothers were  my brother was already big and the ones that were over ten  you know you grow up fast then in a big family.
There were six children  four brothers  two sisters  my father and my mother.
After he saved me and my family  I witnessed the killing of my neighbor.
Yes  my mother was  she had there were ten siblings  five girls and five b oys and my father there were five boys from the first marriage and then there were two girls from the second marriage.
But unlike my family  where my parents never were successful  though they spent  so they spent a lot of time with us  we  we have  I think  my sisters  we have all really truly actualized ourselves  intellectually  emotionally.
So tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
My mother didnt have a very big family  she had a brother and a sister  both of them went to Canada.
I remember that the whole family used to gather at my house and we used to have Friday night and Saturday night dinners at my house and uh maybe because my grandmother was living with us  that so...we were the gathering place for the whole family  and that's what happened.
Or if they told him  he didnt think he could quickly take care of his family.
Okay  and then just tell me about y our childhood; your home and your family  and what what life was like?
And his family had determined that thats what he should be  you know  they they and hed gone to a ch what was called a chayder  which was a a d a very Orthodox kind of education and he hated it.
So on one Sunday I went with the family to Athens.
Well my family did not   my family  my parents and grandparents did not com e from Germany.
And thats where the whole family was gathering after the war.
We lived in the ghetto  even before the ghetto  they lived there too.
So they'd rather die with th e family than go out to pick up these leftovers.
And stories from our own members of our family who lived in the Jewish quarters that people are running to the Jewish Community Council asking for help.
Also where the disabled war veterans lived to a little room with another family from Berlin.
And so  seve ral years later  the family in Gastonia asked Dad or Mr. Heilbronn asked him if he wouldnt come to work for him as a  I think as a shift manager.
And she was 1 JR intended to say that his grandfathers suicide left his grandmother with a large family.
So then you arrived  and you were picked up by family?
Maybe because there were more peop le in the larger cities  where in our -- in Charleston  we had maybe five or six family of survivors.
So I keep on saying  you know  we were the luckiest family in World War II  to survive things like that.
I had a very strange relationship with my mothers family  especially my gr andparents because they were very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with them they forced me to wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of very strict kosher food  go to the synagogue every night and pr ay and  and in general  they cons idered me some kind of a  what they call in Yiddish a shaygets   somebody who is kind of just an outsider because I never really went along with their  w ith their religious rules.
Now the way you did it is you paid money to a family that was poorer than you were  if you could afford it; and somebody--but this was a voluntary arrangement--and that somebody would go for you.
Here I am  survived the camps and nobody else did did it in my family  so why should I be guilty that I survived?
And my father send them money  and so did the family out of America  because she -- my 29grandmother in Przemysl had three children in America.
Let me ask you  as -- as were moving forward in time and -- and it -- and its getting a little bit further away from the horribly traumatic experiences that youd had during the war  and youre getting older at the same time  at this point are you beginning to feel certain things  remember certain things  realize the -- the depth of -- of tragedy of what had happened to your family and -- and -- and to you personally  or -- or was this -- or were you just sort of going on in life and moving forward and youre living another life and going ahead?
You were still living in barracks -- your whole family  I mean  now without your father  unfortunately.
The one stark scene that I -- my family didn't want me to see that at all  and I only saw glimpses of it  like snitches of it.
Applause] Jill  thank you so much for joining us and for your willingness today to be our First Person .
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother as people.
Clos e in the family was a prescription Im sure of my family  probably because its a Jewish tradition but probably because they had suffered losses.
What happened with -- to the -- to your family  what happened to other Jews there?
Then I have a family history that you can have or a family tree and theres a letter from a di stant cousin in Virginia   who sort of got into the genealogy and he went back to a number of these places wher e my fathers mother  the rabbis and traced some of that history back.
The reason being  that my parents were torn away from me  as was my extended family.
And she tells -- she said no  I dont want to because I still hope that Ill find my family.
Alright  I was in a family where nobody was ever prejudiced  but I learned that  like Raoul  always that there are no colors.
And no of them were selected and all were put in a special camp  so -called a Czech \ family camp.\
My father died in didnt maintain the relationship with his new family.
My brother was pigheaded  he was born in June  June 22nd  and he said  I want to be a merchant  I want to be a merchant  and I dont want to be a -- my dad said  but in ou-our family th ere are no merchants.
I had this doctor uncle who was the only person i n the family who could foresee the future and despite many people who tried to discourage him  he was able to manage to get to the United States.
Naturally my husband began to to work to for our family and uh he asked some paper that uh which kind of paper can (cough) get Dr. Farkash from the Spanish Consulate  what can...what we can use like uh a shutzpass or maybe more  maybe a a passport.
I want to establish now  get get a sense a little bit of your early life  and of the family that you were born into  both on the mothers side and on your fathers side.
And then -- I always thought of her  because she was this wonderful person and we -- she was a fun person while she was still alright.
>> Nat Shaffir: No  not my family  not my own family.
We wanted to start by asking you  Marty  to talk a little bit about your life as a young boy in Czechoslovakia before the war  about what life was like in your town and with your family and your community.
And we shared a two -- was a two family home.
And because my family was so well known in Regensburg   and dote we had a lot of farming communities around there  they brought her food.
And she says to me  ﬁHappy Birthday.ﬂ And I looked at her  and she said  ﬁYour birthday was three days ago.ﬂ And I said  ﬁYes.ﬂ And she said  ﬁYour brothers birthday is September the 16th.ﬂ And I said   ﬁYes ﬂ I said  ﬁmy goodness.ﬂ So I said  ﬁYou must be Agnes.ﬂ And she said  ﬁYes  I am .ﬂ And Agnes worked for our family as -- taking care of the children  for seven years.
And we have this little hiding place  so me and my family are going in there.\
Your family was what what language was spoken in your family  if you remember?
We felt its irresponsible for people getting married to ha -- to tr y to build a family  build a family into a very uncertain future and having to protect those children  that is no way for us really to protect.
And I went to public ly thank this family that I visited many  many  many times.
Any friends that they made outside of th e family were still Dutchmen.
They took everything away  first our valuables and then -- one family they found a radio and they took the whole family  the grandma  grandpa  the parents  and they killed them right there.
And all the other children that were there were children of  I guess some of the Dutch  either aristocracy  as there were some -- a fe w girls  they were vaguely connected to the royal family and a lot of children whose parents were still in Indonesia  and the parents being Indonesia  they sent the children to school.
Th e one nice thing though about his visits back was that Carl would co me with him because there wasn't enough time for him to go back to Germany to visit his family so he would come to us.
Well  you know  every family is different and different people react in different ways.
Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday on the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family  my father and I was left.
Well  when I talk to somebody  either family  if my daughter is interested in -- in some detail  my wife  or this history professor  he wants to know more about it  then -- then I -- I try to remember additional detail  occasionally things come back.
No  and we had my Uncle Be ns family  who had go -- his brot her had gone to Palestine early on  before Ben.
And...uh...so it became apparent how to outsmart them is to separate  not to stand together as a family and...uh... and that was something that I will never forget when...uh...we had...we finally were separated.
Some lady with a bowl of soup from the community kitchen  take to her family after she used up her tickets.
So your recollection as yourself as a child  especially during the war period is as Moishe  or Mose -- Moise -- Moisei -- Well the diminutive name which my mother and everybody in the family used was Musi.

I wasnt really very religious  I mean I was what you call my heritage -- my -- growing up at home  in a Jewi sh home  big -- be -- my wife was a very for -- come from a very  very assimilated Russi an family.
The mother survived and she and her younger brother survived  because we placed them with ame -- ame - in hiding and my sister-in-law was placed with my family.
Did you is it is would it be fair to say then the last items you got from your family  sort of like th-the a thing that proves that they lived  was the suitcase with the photographs and the clothes  and th ings like that were sent to you?

All my family with three sons of my uncle from Saranac and the other family goes to Auschwitz.
33 also one of the founders of Rescue Children and she had at that time a little boy  David  and I think she was pregnant  and so I stayed with them and they enrolled me in the local yeshiva and I just wanted to know when I was going back to Fr ance  and it seems that Mr. Tenzer arranged it so I would never go back to France and I would just be staying here someplace and there was a family who was interested in possibly adopting me Š and they'll remain nameless Š so we had a trial  so they invited me for a weekend.

And that was a very callous thing to do  and he  years later when after the war  the man recognized that he had done something very  very bad  and he came to my father and my parents and and asked them for their forgiveness  because by by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us  he made life absolutely horrible for the family.

I never encountered a family that had a problem with children.
And my son lives in New York with his family  he also has two children.
But I married into a wonderful family  I really -- he was a true friend.
And then my aunt always prayed  once my only one paper in the family  one   you know  and she will be sure I am saved.
She rece received a notice that she has to show up at the wall of the square where many executions took place  and th the family   her family  that means my grandmother  my cousin and the two of us had to go and witness.

Now was this be cause your And he was a  he was a  he when they lived in Berkeley he sold shoes in San Francisco at the major shoe store in San Francisco.
And he could have give me an affidavit for my family.
and and and still and still I maintained and I I I remember talking with my husband  should I reconnect with my family?
His family got completely destroyed and he says  and I remember it like the day he was  I was fascinated with what he had to say  he said that one particular night he got drunk  he was a commander of a unit  and he started crying and he said when he stopped crying he said  let's go for yaziks  that's a Russian word for tongues  and they attacked a German outpost and cut everybody's tongue out.
One of them  what it was like so -- during the war  during the six years for me  and they each have it and Ive -- I have another one about sort of growing up  what it was like with this bigger -- this large family that we had.
And if I hadn't been crying -- I saved his life in a way.
How many people traveled with you other th an your family?
My family were German as far as we can research it back into the 1800s in the even before 1800.
It was two  two rooms and a kitchen; but here we got one room apartment.
So  part of the family remains stuck there and we are stuck here.
Li-Lithuanian was not spoken within the family f-for whatever reason that I dont know.
And then he finished there -- he -- he didnt finish the Petraburg University  he studied there two year -- for two years  and then I dont know on which family reasons  they - they left Russia for Poland -- but Poland wa s also Russia then  Poland was occupied by Russians.
Did you -- the documentation that you have ab out your family  did you ever send copies or any of that to the museum?
They really didnt tell us about the family  and what we have been able to gather is memories from different members of the family.
Somebody  appare ntly there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian.
What kind of image did you have in your mind  of what Europe was  based again  on family.

>> Frank Liebermann: My family wasn't able to get here. [
Yeah  they talked a lot about they were to this day  they were very much imbued with everything that happened during the war before the war  talk about the family  talk about what happened to them during the war  after the war.
We and the family of her the immediate family is stay together.
He came into the Netherlands where he knew he had family and that's wher e he met my sister.
We -- all of us were very close  especially - I have to say th -- especially Margolis  beca -- we felt  you know  like a family.
I know that I was with some people who I could have met  but they were not family members  and I just stayed there  and I did not know why.
So you mentioned th at your family was quite affluent  right?
My father was not very religious but we attend services in the next small town because the town where I was born and where we lived later  it was composed only of two other Jewish family.
Did you come home and talk about it with your parents  what you were -- what you were hearing  what was bothering you?

Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement ofŠcity tenementŠthat was given to people under a cert ain income who had too many children and not enough income  there  the Communis t Party  the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on this area and when  then  the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else  some of these Communist leaders  Communist members  came and actually re scued members of the family.
Now I already told you the story of the chocolate bar and how the UNRRA gave the mont hly packages and the family who had a child under ten received the added chocolate bar.
Uh  the one man said  \ If this is your child  and if you have more children in hiding  we recommend that you take them with you because you are going into a family camp.\
Because my father  and the rest of the family  first being religious  second they were against communism or socialism to begin with and it was sort of life at a time rolled back to working with them  being school influenced on one side  and being influenced on the other side.
I felt it very extremely  and because of that I wouldnt talk  and I wouldnt smile  and you know  I was my brother recognized the importance of finding foster family  so he was all charm and smiles and showing his intelligen ce  you know.
They cared a lot for us  and we were all  we were very happy then.
And since my father was  uh  a cattle dealer and horse dealer  while my father was  uh  gone  I became  I was the oldest boy  my sister was older than me of c ourse  so I was sort of in charge of knowing some of the millers  some of the flour millers  and go to pick up flour for our family.
And before that I think the social circle was just family and friends that my parents knew.

The -- The only thing I remember that  it was a very strange family  and that for the first time  I saw somebody who used opium.
Do you have any memories of your parents discussing the Nazi partys rise to power in Germany?
But they had done some business together  and my late father-in-law found out from some some Polish people from Krakow that who were neighbors of his actually  in the building where he lived  was a family from Krakow who knew my parents  and found out that I was here by myself  studying.
That I I may be and the out onset  I am the only one of the family left  there was a large family.
It was his -- but was it in the family before  or had -- did he -- I think he -- my father started that business.
We were always very careful to make remarks about Hitler in the Nazi time  so I spoke only to my -- mainly to my family about this.
I have a cousin  first cousin  Miriam  who lives in -- in Israel  she -- her -- her -- her mother and my mother were sisters  and she has done a lot of research on the Colonomus family.
And which members of the family would be on this boat with you  and did any of your household staff leave with you?

>> Bill Benson: You had the opportunity to visit his gravesite  haven't you?
There the husband of the woman who had taken in my sisters denounced his own wife to the Nazis as hiding two Jewish children.
And you know  being as a family  we could have never functioned there  and we were not going to strike out on our own  lets say  my brother and I  go to Palestine  leave my Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16  2001 97mother and my father here.
And we  and we stayed at my grandmother's for -- So do you know anything really about your father  when you left him behind in Berlin?
And in my journal it says how sad he was  first of all because his father died -- h is name was Emmanuel Mandels -- b ut also because the rest of the family couldn't join him.
>> Nat Shaffir: My entire family came from eastern Hungary which remained there.
And you you had said earlier during this conversation th at in the in the first years after the war you were you were intent on making a life for yourself  starting a family  and and being part of the the American dream  and the Interview with Fred Lorber December 8  2011 171American society.
And once when I was a little older  I walked out of the store  and that family living the same s-street there  and then the dog went to the store  and called my mother to pick me up.
She gave lessons  she taught  she worked as a tutor  she sometimes -- she was a tutor  living with a family  she was very popular with people  very  very easy to make friends.
Our immediate family consis ted of our three brothers  my mother  my aunt Miriam and my grandfather.
She said  ﬁI am Vera Ise n.ﬂ And that [indecipherable] the family -- Right. --
One  the name -- the first born by everybody in the family Szlinger wa s Mordechai  Mijatek.
One room per family  large rooms where people were living together.
And there's nobody to help him beca use there is no family.
As I explained earlier  we are going to be doing a lot of discussion  a lot of delving into the past particularly the European history of your family and we will start this with the most basic of questions.
I didnt know him then  that was -- my father had some business with him.
So she writes me a letter saying that I should write to the refugee comm ittee  asking them to be placed with a family.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
It was a brick factory and I want to see my family.
Not just thinking about your family but thinking about all this that there was.
But here were talking about a place where your family had been for centuries upon centuries -- Right. --
Because number one  we saw him  number two he brought food  which helped us to have a little feas t then  and number three is that he  we knew that thats what he would have done  he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four  family of five who were out of their own  well  problem s  housed in our place.
You know  it took 37 years and years before I ev er heard that there was such a thing like a  a family service  who helps people  so we never did.
So my father explained to him that yes  I am in Kaunas  my family is in Kauna s  but I cant -- I dont have right to work in Kaunas and I dont have right to register in Kaunas to live.
So the first family  I did not mention  the second family is Rorat.
And for the main reas on  because I still had my family.
When did you leave Europe to come to the United States?
The French medical association is very reactionary and very tight and they wouldn't allow him to practice so  since he took his medical degree in Germany he went back to Mannheim where his family was a doctor and he opened up a very thriving practice  so she had to join him there and I lived with the daughter in Paris and during vacation time when we didn't have school we would go to Mannheim and stay with them and then come back to Paris when school resumed.
Approximately we knew a -- there will be Passover  but nobody knew about -- definitely we can dream about matzos  was only food and bread  and bread was also so and so much per family.
With such a large family  did you did you ne have a need to have friends outside  that were your own ag e?
It turned out that my brother and sister  by this time  they were making arrangements to come to Brussels and were traveling to Brussels and my parents were going there.
And here I'm at th e crossroads  should I go with my family to Bialystok or should I go single  young and single go to Grodno?ﬂ And I made my decision that I'm going to Grodno.
I [indecipherable] Did -- Did you discuss with other Jewish people how they felt about that  at that time?
>> Bill Benson: And you would be reunited with your father.
So in April of 1941  youre moved to Rivesaltes   as a family?
A. If you want to know about the rabbis  I'll tell you what happened with the 11 rabbis.
As far as I was concerned  that they were Jewish friends and these were non-Jewish friends.
>> Bill Benson: What did your uncle do then to try to build a life with his niece and nephew that he was now completely in charge of?
Because maybe you'll be the only one who came back from your family.
Uh I guess my mother must have doubts of surviving the war because uh from th e earliest times on during the war she drilled into Freddie and me the address of both my uncle in Palestine and the address of my uncle in New York and uh we could have been awakened any time of day and night and could have could have recited those addresses because so many children were left alone in the concentration camps without parents  parent s who died  and who...I guess my mother must have wanted to make sure that we would not just become displaced children  since we had family that we would know where to tell them to send us if we survived and so I know we uh we knew those addresses from a very very early age on.
Conditions for your family quickly turned far worse than under the Hungarians as your father was taken and your mother  sister and you were forced into a ghetto.
Uh in the film  I initially...I...I referred to my mother losing much of her family  and I sh ow a photograph of my mother surrounded by her family.
So two weeks after graduating high school  I got married and uh soon after I started my family and I have four daughters and three of them are married and I have five grandchildren.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know how your parents  once your father lost his job  was forced out of it  how your parents managed to make ends meet   how they were able to feed their family?
The United States was very good to my family in -- in every possible way.
>> Bill Benson: Until that point  because he couldn't get his farm back  what did he do to be able to feed a family and take care of a family?
You mentioned that you went with your mother and your sister but your father couldnt come on those trips to Poland.
So thats the story that s gone on in our family.
All living with that family but my mother and I stayed -- What was their name -- wa -- what was the name of the family  do you know?
In my fathers side of the family  the Calabresi   there was my father and my two aunts.
>> Bill Benson: And  plus  very few of your extended family survived.
Well this was actually because of my father and because of the family a very sad time because I knew that half of my family actually went through the Holocaust.
Had you been hearing any news about the Nazis in Germany before the anschluss?
He comes from a higher up family  very well [indecipherable] in Riga  before the war.
On the edge of being a teenager -- So you actually have a picture of how I grow up and what kind of a family I was and what type of school I went.
Im getting very -- is that [inaudible] [indecipherable] I want to spend a little b it of time talking about just th-the -- the pattern of your -- of your life  some of your personal development  your -- your marriage and your family.
However  my family  I would say  were what we would now call modern Orthodox.
You si -- your family was okay  you came and you saw that the f -- Yes  maybe -- -- your family was all right. --
My mom started writing down her memories and what was happening in the family and specifically with me in the hope that one day my father would come back and she was able to recall the little minor details from my first words or my silly sentences  what food I liked and what I didn't.
Many years later  when I when we were here in the United States   my mother  and in fact her sister too  told me that in my mothers family  in there was a Jew that married a Lithuanian women.
On the 17th of September  Russia attacked Poland and as a result of that you and your family would live under Russian occupation until 1941.
And apple pea became the sort of family -- Tom wa nts apple pea.
Shes also an anthropologist  Ruth Cernea  very interested in the story of my family  and the story of the Jews in -- in Romania.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  very soon after  you were forced into a ghetto.
Tell us about about your father and brother being sent to labor camp.
Interview with Lore Schneider August 14  2003 19 Only in so far as they were talked about in the family  and the entire time  my father  after -- he took out his first papers by the way  first -- after three years  at that time you could take out first papers that -- with which you declared your intention to become citizens.
You have a beautiful family  you just speak up for the -- the ones that are less fortunate and you have to speak out when you see injustices done to -- you know  things that are done to other people  so that it doesnt happen again.
And you were communicating with your parents back in Germany .
What I wanted to continue is their love of Judaism  love of family.
I came in to the  to the  to the -- voluntarily from a free country like Portugal to this situation  because I knew that my family would not have survived any difficulty without me.
I think you know  it was a little I-I-I think for a lot of the people in the family  i-i-its almost as if they Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood April 27  2017 99 there was this mind shift  where suddenly  you know  you felt what it must have been like to be there Juden  you know  and like different in this place.
And one of the things that was still ok   that the family was together a nd that perhaps this is temporary and it can't be anything but temporary.
2 Could you hold up the photograph of your family  please  so we can see it?
Did more did more of the family die than your parents?
So after two hours of fighting in the -- well  the regent was -- he and his family were arrested and a new very -- the -- >> Bill Benson: The Arrow Cross.
It was just as bad for them as for my kids  you know  they -- they weren't used to that  a whole family moves in.
break] So so in the kolonia   it was  you know  people had enough to eat  they werent poor  aside from that one family that you that you mentioned.
Describe when you first -- We came from Berlin a -- because we met our children in Berlin since the whole family was joining us to meet Hors t. I had never been back to hal -- oh no  I had been in Halberstadt when we spoke to the students  and I was very much af raid that I would feel very badly when I would see my parents home.
Did you have a way to share it  or -- My children knew that I was a survivor  but a survivor of what and how and when and what was happening  they didnt know.
And other people in the family tried it and got killed.
And I guess that my family  and I only hope and pray that my mother really didn't fully realize that.
so she was somebody who became  she was maybe partly Polish  and she had some German uh family in th e background  and with 2 SS men or 2 soldiers  I don't remember.
And then we will help you to bring the family over.
Has a husband who is very ill...uh...and...uh... and has had difficulty... does not have as a good family life.
My name was still on  and Mike  the friend of my cousin said that if she's dead  maybe they'll kill the whole family because they can't find her.
And so  as I came there  we decided to go back to the ghetto.
The first thing  I looked around  and I didnt have my family.
Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12  2012 52 Well  th-the the famil y  my my fathers sisters family  they all were able to leave in enough time.
So  we had a family in each room  and we were squeezed into one room.
What became custom  the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 Jewish children were sent to relatives in bordering areas  where they could go to Jewish schools  but it had to be away from home.
Well  I was a housemaid there  I lived with the family  which didnt help at all  didnt make it any better.
Its a -- but my father fit right in with the family  he -- hes just a -- a very gentle and welcoming sort of person and -- and that is reflected in the way that these five other people treated him and accepted him.
A lot of my dads family was taken to a concentration camp and never heard from again.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 >> Bill Benson: With your sister.
>> Bill Benson: You were sent to Auschwitz in 1944  as you just described.
SB: And do you think you could talk a bit about what you're--how you mother worked to save the family?
My family went from   a big city in the south of Holland to a neighboring town  that was smaller  and my father had a printing business there  and he started a newspaper.
I have -- just as I talk to you I just thought -- why Im not able to find anythi ng about this family.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings w/AVRAHAM TORY page 31 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AT: The Germans said to the Jewish committee  you will not expect that we correspond with you in writing.
Uh my family  my mom  dad and I lived in an old pigsty.
And then we had a  there were usually no living rooms  in Poland you had a dining room which served as th e living room and family usually gathered around the dining table and this was just like sitting in a living room  you know  drinking tea from a   which was a big  brass   it was a silver for special teas.
When they have a family  they begin to give to others.
My mother with my father and all three of my sisters  the beginning  and my brother.
>> Suzy Snyder: So let me ask you a question about getting back on your feet  your family.
Family  I think  Interview with Esther Dezube December 7  2000 56for child survivors are very important.
ﬁPlease  I want to change my 35 name  I want to have the document for me and my family.
And Its interesting  if you think of it being a child with a strange family on a trip  leaving your country  going to Palestine   I wa I dont know who they were.
Going forward now  weve looked at -- at some of this mate rial  but that you -- you and your family are headed towards England.
So  we kind of treated her like the baby in the family  you know.
My mother had no family in Europe so that it didn't hit her quite as deeply as it hit my father  but she too was very concerned about wh at was happening to the Jews in Europe.
And he introduced me to the girl who was really from Germany  from Berlin  but she had spent the war years with her family in Bangkok and was sent to a Dutch school there.
They lived one life in which they paid homage to the Nazi party and everything and the trappings that went with that and they heard the stories about how evil Jews were  and yet they could live across the hall from a family of Jews and still find them as decent and honest individuals and work with them.
98 Okay  this is the st -- the -- the family of my daughter Susan  the oldest daughter  her husband l -- st -- her husbands name -- Its okay.
My father had six brothers and three si sters  large family.
Now  were your grandparents and your other relatives with you in the ghetto?
And when we crossed on the other side of the ghetto  we come in in the first house of the street on the other side and come into a Jewish family to rest or something  or to -- I don't know.
I thought that she committed suicide because of some -- some family disputes.
It was not a time in my time an yway where the family would sit as the do today and talk and explain why we are in this situation  why we are doing what were doing.
They were...I saw so many people killed  and the family was keeping only togeth er.
My parents were in contact with them until they left Belgium  but once we went back to Belgium in 1989 we had found out that the entire family  the mother  father  even the little girl who was my age  they had all died.
There was a whole Czech Lager  a special family Lager for the Czech families that everybody stayed together-men  women and children.
Then there were figuring that on my mother's side were 10 brothers and sisters  and on my father's side 9.
What about -- Do you -- I know you -- your family was very Zionist.
But my father's one brother  his youngest brother David  was with us.
At home  what language did your parents speak with one another?
There were nobody left from my family that was living right there in that section  so what I did is I said Momma  what should I do.
He had  beside us  he had: a Hasidishe family of seven; a woman  alone; and the man  Pupka  who was his contact for exchanging money for my -- that my mother used to give him.
My father family was living in north of Transylvania  because Arad is the south of Transylvania.
Well  yes  in a sense  that some people in the family  such as my aunt  who was very young  one of my fathers sisters  and  was married also to a young  twenty-one or twenty-two year old man.
But the atrocities that were being committed were some bodys worst nightmare and hearing them prior to getting this telephone call and from the news media and the people that had already come back so  wounded soldiers et cetera  made it  it becam e very factual and he could only  we could only Interview with Jutta Levy 53 imagine what had happened to our own family.
>> Bill Benson: Did talking to other Holocaust survivors give you a perspective on your own life?
And what who my parents Interview with Jutta Levy 9 associated with and who their friends were  who my friends were and but primarily about family things and where they were and what we did and th is was all as far back she asked me as I could remember.
see  the big family from ma -- my wifes side now  in Syracuse.
We were invited to a party  we were invited to dinner and it was just very nice people that we met.
But there was a family who had a little girl and as we were marching  the little girl ran out and gave me.
Well  we got the account of people  the Nazis  breaking into the -- my fathers family business.
We had to go to a theater  and there were a lot of people  family too  and other people  and usually people  they were mixed marriage  we had friends  she was not Jewish  he was  they came out.
I wanted to know  you know  about the children also and I -- Ive heard so many -- of so many situations in which  as a Holocaust survivor  its very difficult to approach the subject with your children  or you dont want them to know  or why should they know and you -- CE: They know  but they know -- but we -- some -- SE: Our daughter is very open  and she goes with a Jewish man.
I neve r experienced it  maybe because of the German orientation in my home  but some of the Germ an Jews told me since then that they felt severe antagonism on the part of people who sa id \ They killed my family so you could move in here.\
We had some -- some family in Philadelphia found us  distant relatives and we went there occasionally.
Of Interview with Phillip Abraham 42 August 21  2011 course I came and I again separated from my parents and my family.
You know  there were -- I remember meetings with Jewish friend  my family  etcetera  they were all talking about that  okay?
Nonetheless  conditions worsened for Jews in 1939 and got increasingly worse for your family and other Jews in Hungary from then on.
But --by the standards of some part of the Jewish community  our family would have been called  you know  fairly modern  rather than traditional but it certainly was expected that we would have--you know  keep kosher and go to shul on Saturday morning  my father and I  as I became older and observe essentially all the holidays.
Applause] Margit  thank you so very much for joining us and for your willingness to be our First Person today.
And she -- she ret -- she was finally brought back to her family  I guess.
No  no  I -- I -- I dont recall -- really I think that I couldnt distinguish any surface difference be tween the looks of my family or our relatives  and other Greeks.
R: Yeah  but still  I think I was happy in that time that I have him  and have the family  and came into the [indecipherable] I saw that its a noble pri -- family.
Tell me a little bit about your family  and your family life in Vienna.
So that was a terrible  you know  feeling for my parents.
I didnt know whether my family was killed at the time or not  because the city was on fire from one end to the other.
They maybe started earlier because my mothers family and my fathers family went way before us.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 >> Suzy Snyder: I've heard this before.
When the Memorial was built  there were some flags put up  and I have two flags of my two little sisters and the flags of my family and part of my husband's family that was killed from the Hungarians  and when they built it  it was the opening and I was co-chairing and I was the hostess at dinner opening and Hausner was our main speaker  and I couldn't sleep that night and I got up and I wrote a poem and I love that little plain poem.
Like I said  my mother's sister  my grandparents  cousins  they were all in the big ghetto.
Were you ever able to get together as a family except at . . .
He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family.
Before you were occupied in 1939  what did you know about what was going on in Germany with Hitler?
Can you extend it into -- into more people  if of our family  another five or six or 10?
Henry  it wasn't long after the German invasion that you and the family and the other Jews in town were forced into a ghetto.
So valuable in fact that all of our participation had to be sw orn secret  we couldnt discuss it with our own family.
And later that stamp collection would have importance to your family.
And again  we had story with my family and my friends and my relatives  that I dated some girl  and father dont like that.
So we were debating with my family  going to the market square  are we going to take clothes with us  are they going to let us come back or not  or should we just go  three of us  my brother  mother  and my father  and leave my younger brother with my neighbors.
And the two children really -- the two children with us form ed our little family.
And when the war broke out  I was back in my town with the grandmother.
But -- but still  was it important for you to meet  at least a larger -- to have a sense of a larger family there in flesh and blood if you will  was that important since you didnt have grandmothers  grandfathers in -- in New York ?
It went totally against my being because we were a touching family.
Did you have any favorite holidays that you liked to celebrate with your family?
Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 25 Well  I think in -in-in free relating to people  even (you know) even to family perhaps  that it interferes with that.

Interview with Edith Palkowitz August 26  2016 7 Had your family been affected by the depression  at all?
Now  in the early German decrees against Jews in your town  and you and your family tried to help  is that right?
So the the where you lived  was it mainly a Jewish neighborhood?
Plus in the case of your -- your aunts and uncles  they had lost family  so there was  in addition to the lack of empathy fo r what youd been through  there was also that -- the -- the pain and the grief of ha ving lost the family.
And at that same place with us was the Polish family  the one what told me  the policeman...he was hiding there too because the Ukrainians wanted to kill him.
But I maintained relations with one of the group  and his family.
It still is quite unusual and quite impressive that the two children in one family that is not so well-to-do end up going to college.
So  I suppose to go at that time to Treblinka on the train and you see I was one of the lucky ones  but how good is it that I lost a whole family.
Rita's family was able to bribe Romanian soldiers who took the family to a ghetto in Transnistria.
My mother was a very religious person; my father was not  but my mother was very religious.
But being there was very difficult for you because youre away from your family  you dont know whats happening.
>> Bill Benson: Take a moment  though   to describe when you realized that you were liberated  even if it wasn't the moment we like to think of and go   \ Aha  I'm liberated  \  b ut tell us what happened.
Now if you had family  then the family was allowed to go into that room and my aunt and my cousin came from Washington  all the way  to New York to wait for us and that was the most exciting thing that ever happened to us.
Its easy to say how could he do it  but today  you know what  Ive got a family and Ive got -- Im not short of -- of anything  you know.
What steps did you and your family take to rebuild your life?
I have vague memories  mainly of my family and my cousin  th-the one who died  who lived in the building with me  beating me up.
His boss saidthis was during the Great Depression  and his boss said  \ I know you cannot support a family on what I pay you so you're fi red.\
Though he was born in Riga  Latvia  Manny's family were Hungarian Jews.
And during the wartime so many people had it worse  maybe worse than -- than -- than -- than me  you know  like take any Jewish family  you know  like I meet -- even the Dr. Terry  you know  he losted a whole family there  he is by himself.
There were two of them  and one I think decided  you know  I can keep you for a few months  and then its over  you know  and then the second one was also -- What was the name of the first family  do you remember?
So our family moved to a town in western Slovakia which is called Neitra (c.51).
And so there was movement afoot to move the family  mother and me  up to Breslau.
If I dont go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a deserter  because I was sort of mobilized alrea dy by the Russian army to be on the railroad  and then they will kill me as a deserter  the Russian government.
>> Bill Benson: In September 1939  the Soviet Union and Germany attacked Poland which really begins World War II.
I didnt have to  b ecause I lived with my uncle  but the other young women and men had to work to help support th e family.
You know  and I felt for a longest  longest time until we had the first interview that Interview with Lena Gitter July 21  1998 8you did  I felt very guilty that I  my family  we were able to escape and here  and I was able  you know  the education that I that I have to make a success  and so did my husband here  and here my family and and friends lost their their life  and and so I I felt very  very guilty.
Now  I only know that the family I mentioned before from the headmaster  those children  there were five children  would have had an opportunity to go to England on the kindertransport  but Herr Luntner said  either we all go  or none of us go.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >> Bill Benson: You found out later at the time.
The end of the war  this is the end  I don't have her  I don't have my whole family with me.
Is it because you never talked about it with your family  or I f I felt guilty  Ive been feeling guilty about it that I cant talk about it.
So immediately I start going to the direction to see my family.
When you first got to Turka -- I wonder if we can go through some of the details  you said that the family arranged papers and then  can you ta lk a little bit about your father getting a job?
Its a here what is  its Holocaust Museum  Baker family collection  USHMM   tape 2828.
If you make it to the Permanent Exhibition today  if you look at the second floor where there is an exhibit on hidden children  you will see my teething ring  which accompanied me as a 9 -month -old when I was left with the Madna family.
I remember I do not know if other members of my family remember her crying out in the middle of the night having terrible dreams and it was Hitler  something about Hitler.
Now  in the early days  many of the young displaced persons went particularly  as I remember  to Poland  mainly to try to find their relatives.
So the -- otherwise  my parents were members of the Jewish community.
Can you tell me a little bit about the town that you lived in?
Max had family in Israel  however this was not an option for us.
Yes  because I wanted everybody...I wanted to have my whole family because they were part of the whole thing.
Here is another picture which I have  which shows my mothers side of the family  which was quite extensive  because there were nine children  and when they grew up  of course they all had children  so the family was very large.
>> Bill Benson: Marcel  you mentioned the aktions that the Germans engaged in.
Well  its always difficult  but realizing what we are up against  and the denials that they place every day about the Holocaust  it is my opportunity to stand witness for what happened to my parents and the rest of my family.
Its like -- you know  y-you -- I-I dont know some -- we -- were a very open kind of family and you know  it -- it was always part of their past.
My was  it was  my parents were observi ng Jews  not the...not too much rich Jews  yes.
They weren't clothed  they weren't schooled  they weren't permitted to travel  they weren't permitted to do anything  not to take their name  their dignity  couldn't mail a letter to anyone  even if they wanted to take the letter and give it to a soldier  and say send this to my family in the United States or in London or France  it was against the rules.
So coming back to pre-war and the Nazi rise to power and how it affected my life  maybe it emboldened the Poles to open boycott  because I do remember distinctly -- to this day we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 22 have an anecdote  the family anecdote.
I I remember  yeah  I remember that it was Don Angelo   it was a country priest at near my mothers family s villa outside Bologna   and this was arranged Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27  2017 54 by this great Patrick Azatti   but it was just a local priest who talked to my brother and me a little bit  and we da we were baptized.
And in addition to us  one of my cousins -- the uncle and the aunt who we stayed with  they had a son and a daughter.
I lived in a  it was amazing  with a Jewish family i n  near Columbia University.
And her family was a gen -- m-mainly a family of teachers.
When you were that age in 1938  ' 39   were you aware of what was happening in Germany?
She was a wonderful  wonderful human being  and so I was part of her family  although there was her -- she had lost her husband and lost her family.
One thing was good  the whole family was killed  and she was aliv e. And she worked very hard  and in -- it was the -- the patriation from the -- the Polish citizens after the war.
And then the family moved out to somewhere  they had relative in the country  so they moved in the count -- you know  to the country.
So  when you were with them in in Warsaw   did what did you see when you went into Warsaw?
We didnt have the means to move out and the family was too big and  I guess  that was the aim to stay in Rovno.
Anyway  so you  you get used to it and see suddenly a bunch of houses that look like being under construction  but they were destroyed  you see only some walls standing and you hear cruel things like one family decided not to go in the bunker and they were found in bed on the next block  you feel these tremendous deprivations and so you then develop  oh a small minority will say we asked for it  the majority will say  will display a tremendous amount of anger  would say oh  let's help to kill the enemy  so there are very few people  in reality who said  well really  we begun it.
Was your mother an only child  or did she have siblings as well?
Lucie  you mentioned the American Jewish soldiers who looked up your family after the liberation.
So my father started looking for people...you know for family  but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said what's the matter with him.
who didnt survive the Holocaust  and there are 15 of our family in that list.
I'd like to know about your parents  your grandparents  if you will  and your earliest memories.
Manny was born to a religious Jewish family on May 8  1936  in Riga  Latvia.
1930 we started in Switzerland to live in community  (clearing throat) and there right in the beginning a pastor came to us with a family of four children.
So my aunt  they used to send us money to Poland.
My I have to say my personal reaction is only what the vibe that I picked up from my family  my father es pecially.
He loved our family  and he used to bring us food.
In this photograph  we see Susan  Herman and two of their children in their family store in Baltimore.
He was the only survivor except for these cousins but they were not immediate family.
So  anyway  thats why I say my family would not be taken car e of.
Every day she ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 7 brought me something.
The friends that you had  were they more parts of the family  or where there a lot of friends from school that you played with?
You say th at you come from an Orthodox family  did you feel yourself to be very religious?
People  my family and people thought that I was dead because something I have not mentioned during this interview.
And the thing thats very confusing  if you look at the the family tree  or anything else  is that my grandmother  whose maiden name well  my mothers maiden name was Lowenthal Lowenthal .
People who had money or had family could go to an ulpan and learn Hebrew all day.
They are Heijmans and most of the family uh lived in the eastern part of Holland.
We stayed there until spring  and after after that  my my uncle on my fathers side  had in Finland also  he was a wealthy man  had a big estate in Finland   and the whole family of the Hessens  which is my maiden name  were reunited there on the on the fa rm.
Most of the people in this particular spa were Jewish  but this family was not.
He always said  She was quite happy living with her parents  and I was quite happy living with my mother  it was fine. [
When you were living with the family in the ghetto  the people that lived in the house  were they nice to you?
>> Bill Benson: And they were able to tell you things about you and your family.
And I didnt even know that she knew we were Jewish.
He s he said  I wouldnt have put my family at risk that way.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your grandfather returning to the bunker.
So anyway  he showed this man his copy of the birth certificate and the man said  all right  why don't ;you and your family wait along with maybe one or two other people.
No matter how such a family would ha ve wanted to get out of the situation  no matter how much a father perhaps seeing me squeeze thr ough  would have been tempted to also squeeze through  and get to freedom.
However  he returned to find nobody of his family  his wife and children were killed in that compound in Boocho j   lined up to the wall and killed and buried in the mass grave.
And I found out many  many years after I married him that his family name was actually Polits .
But what I remember even more was the f act that we went into hiding as -- as the -- the great arrests took place in Paris and all over France  in -- in response to the decision taken at -- in Wannsee a-as part of the conference -- So you were in hiding in Paris -- -- the Final Solution -- Were you in -- -- we were hiding with a Gentile family in an attic.
And we arrived to one city where a German family .... Well  actually not all  also mixed-German ... Germans hid us for a day or two until we were able to continue by wagon to...uh...Wierzbnik.
>> Bill Benson: And you would be reunited with your father.
Some remained in Lithuania   and some went to Russia  and two of them two of my mothers siblings went to Russia and became doctors.
I got a little better  yes  but then I had to go and find out food outside there  and I found a family and the lady used to cook spaghetti.
>> Bill Benson: In just the few moments that we have left  your father  of course  had left much earlier to the United States.
Did your family at home  did your parents talk about the Nazi rise to power?
Anyhow  then in November 29  1951 my second son was born  .
ﬂ Behind the statement  the long story which I don't want to bother you because I'm from a pretty dysfunctional family -- w ell  it's true.
Its like a Im sorry Im entering  but its sort of like todays family room  in American homes  and then the living room Exactly.
I know only Mr. and his family who were friends of my uncle  and I heard later that they went into hiding but the brother of my uncle and his sister and that their child was born there.
I was the baby of the family  and I dont reme mber any story or event that kind of left a mark with me  but I knew my -- my mother was a housewife  and remember cleaning the house  and taking care of the household events.
Can you tell us where you -- when you were born and where?
Were your parents listening to the radio or They were listening .
Before we turn to the war years  tell us what you can about your family  their life  in your very early life before the war began.
And so they felt having a boy in the family would be a good idea.
Im quite comfortable there  quite familiar  always something new to see  we always do something that we havent done before  although the bulk of the visits have been for th e purpose of s-seeing family  which now is more difficult.
Im not Im a Zionist in a sense of a great supporter of the state of Israel.
And then I was taken by a Quaker family up to York   in So it was one of those families who came to pick children [indecipherable] Yeah  somebody came on their behalf from the Quaker meeting in York .
And...uh...more details about it...it is in his..uh...document left to me...uh...about his...how he survived and how the circumstances how my family lived the last few months and...uh... We'll get that.
My  my mother who was the strong part y in the family stood up very well.
I have documents over here that I wrot e every place you could think of to look for my family.
We were very friendly here  in this count -- after Switzerland  after I got to his -- this country  he went back -- he and his family went back to Paris and then he retired and I cant tell you now the year  but it must have been -- oh yes  I can tell you the year.
She was a very bitter woman from very low family and she was from Lodz  yeah  Lodz.
And I actually don't seem to recall anybody of the family going to a synagogue  ever - except maybe when some friends had a wedding there or that was probably the only time.
And the hope was that when my fathers family saw how desperate they were  by sending the girls away alone  that they would send the visa for her  which indeed is what happened.
You know  dont forget there was still six people  father and mother  everybody we had some things what we were able to cash in  trade whatever you had.
Never ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 25 said there was a Jewish family upstairs.
So  what does that mean to you  to be the only Jew in your family?
Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the thirties when you were growing up?
Of their immediate family   only Irene and Serena survived the war.
Interview with Sol Mackler December 28  2009 48 They did tell you about their families Yeah  family  yeah.
And losses can and real losses you lost your father  you lost your mother  you lost your childhood  and mu and many I lost myself.
I know you already described th e apartment your family lived in and it sounds like you had a fairly modest household.
I -- I have to assume so  because there were a few painters in my family and sculptors on her side.
And my dad said  costs a lot of money to take a family of four  etcetera  etcetera  and without any guarantees  I rea lly dont know what to do.
So you were limited to the few Jewish family with which my mother was acquainted  and which I knew  d their children.
A My mother  my father  my sister  my little brother and myself.
In other words  he did for others what he couldn't do for his own family.
We have quite a few pictures of my father with his two granddaughters.
We had a servant for the speak you know off the kitchen there was a little room and they had their bathroom and that was only to be considered luxury so that was already an apartment for the communists  for their family.
And so we went into his living room  it was a rather nice house by the way  the house was on a hill in Heidelberg  it was a family home and they'd had for I guess many years.
Interviewer: You said that your family didnt have enough money to go  to leave.

>> Leslie Swift: To go back a little bit  you say your family was known in the town.
Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 54 November 17  2011 When did you learn then what happened to the rest of your family?
So when you father had turned his back on the family  it wasnt to his mother.
If I go to New York  hustle  bustle  too much running  going to work so long and coming home  you have no time to spend with the family.
They went during the war  we kind of skipped over time  but anyway  they were  during the war put in camps  persecuted  some of -- many people in my family died in that period  in camps  of -- were killed  or died of typhus and other diseases  and -- in the camps.
And when I meet my sisters from Warsaw  after 18 year s that they also survived the war  they told me stories about my parents  and they told me that my fathers family have a big farm  and they have 13 children.
And  again  how aware were you and your family in 1942   and what was happening in the rest of Europe?
So my brothers registered from Bergen Belsen that they are looking for family.
It was a tough time to convince my sister that I want to go  but I had to take care of my family and myself.
Not just in our apartment  we always had to share an apartment with anot her family  but there were every single apartment had additional people and depe nding on the size  you know  you were allowed to a room and then you shared the kitchen f acilities or whatever.
And it was a little Cape Cod  but I was fortunate  I got a room with this family.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 101 Not too long.
So that was really  for her  the end of the story of the family.
With my mother family  and the friends that my -- my father used to meet  they were like him.
Your family didn't keep a kosher kitchen yet you shopped for meat at a kosher establishment.
I want to know a little bit more about your families personalities.
I think that the family was grow ing and that might have been some kind of  maybe even disagreements  you know  as far as how the busine ss should be run and I kn ow that my father had the opportunity to purchase this tannery set-up in Krakow.
Were there other children with you  and Yes  there were many other children.
In Chicago  we start raising a family and we did pretty well.
With that in mind  I went out to Colorado  where I had an older brother and his family  and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado Lakeside Amusement Park.
My family is in...what's the name of the place...not in a camp but where I just left them  before .
Did you have -- when you were with the Soviet army  I mean  were there skirmishes  what were you doing?
Okay  I go there  in the center of the city  and go  a famil an old people  fam family living there  a very nice  old man and old woman living in a small apartment  very nice  very tidy.
That made the family larger even in the second  third generation.
I mean  she didnt want to dwell on it  Im sure  becau se she had the responsibility to her family and it was a very it must have been a ve ry painful and sad experience for her to go through with this.
And they -- we asking where we find this Jewish family there  and they told  \ Here  they're there.\
And my wife and I and my three kids  and Joe and his family are going there for the dedication.
Tell us about the move  why they moved to Palestine  and what it was like when you were there.
Did you -- did you go back to Poland to see your mother?
Now  th-the -- my -- my family -- yo -- Let me -- lets -- lets skip that qu -- that one because I would like to ask you something else.
And the talk was that if we needed help and needed someplace to go that they would be in a position to help the family.
Unlike my non-Jewish fellow su rvivors  I couldn't go ba ck home to my family  to my relatives  to my friends be cause Jewish home  Jewish famili es and Jewish communities were destroyed.
And when my mother returned...uh...a day or two later and my family told her what happened  she simply said  \ You are not meant to die then.
Uh there are members of the family who who didn't join in this.
Do you know anything from what you've learned about the impact of Kristallnacht on your family?
He moved with his family to The Hague right near the Royal Palace of the Queen and many of his clients were barons and baronesses of the Court for a while there.
And he had two sisters  two sisters a live at the time and him  who was the nephew.
My fathers family consisted of th ree brothers  two sisters and of course  my father.
>> Bill Benson: And it sounds like during that time in the ghetto with this kind  good -hearted family  that everybody tried to make the best of having a community as much as you could under those circumstances.
I live next door to an Indian family from Guyana  who are Hindu  and my next door neighbor on side is this Hindu family and the other a Black family from Haiti.
Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you?
But I really dont know much about that side of the family at all.
See  my mother -- from my mother's side  she had here her uncle and cousins.
Uh  talk a little more about  uh  what those early years under the Germans were like.
So he knew very well -- >> Bill Benson: Who you were.
The irony is that the father was to have said that at least my children will have something to eat.
No  but -- but what happened -- Did you -- did you see your family while you were living there?
And then I went into the Air Force and actually in London  in England we had some distant relatives  who were– I was just looking at the family tree today  were– a guy named David Tichauer who was related.
And we we re married by -- by the grand rabbi of Luxembourg  who had been a memb -- who ha d been a friend of the family.
So from both side of the family  we had in our family a-around 200 people.
>> Bill Benson: What led up to their finally being able to leave?
So i-it was a thing that bothered us in the family  a lot.
Until we came back to Lub lin to look for mostly to look for family and friends.
So and we tried  and then we were fine  because we had the other family  his name was Farkos   who was a neighbor of ours in Michalovce.
Then  my husband really wanted to be closer to the family and at that time -- I enjoyed Des Moines.
You know  we'll talk about how I was reunited with my mother but it took me a long time to come to understand what had happened to my sisters after the war.
Courage that we had a family finally  you know  and they wanted us to come here.
So  I asked the family where is the nearest church  and I took the children every Sunday  and I dressed them and I went to church every Sunday with them.
And then one of 23 those children remained and came with us to Paraguay and she is now mother of a family.
Again  when I visited the family years ago  the parents had already been deceased.
You -- my family were well off  and they did fin -- financially very well.
And there was a great deal of  uh  jubilation amongst my friends and my family that I had made the team.
At 11 oclock at night  Italian Fascist doctor  a major with a Fascist uni form  come over to the door and 50 tell to Neila Fussi  that our house ki -- was hiding at -- say you got here a Jewish family hiding  and she almost doody in her pants.
And he said a lot of people call him  write to him and they say  ﬁIm born in a Catholic family.
So I went with my brother and my father  a couple of uncles.
End of Tape One 22 Beginning Tape Two Zdenko  I -- I understand that y-your family was so conscious of what was going on that you had a family boycott of all German goods  is that right?
This was the fall of  this was the fall  suddenly seeing your father in this  he was always in control  the provider  the protector  suddenly seeing him in a situation with this fa lling you know at the time when the whole family was relying on him  you know  this is something whic h still today can give me the creeps.
So he went in   and they waited  made him wait an hour  and then he saw the man; and he told them he has a family and he has 11 people that he would like to bring into his group; and the guy gave him a name from the Jewish Committee to see and tell the person that he sent my father over and he should take care of him.
They sent it to the Allens  and I left Germany with a considerable number of old phot ographs  family photographs.
I wasn't too religious  but all the holidays we were keeping and we got together with the family  mother's  father's  and this was it.
So  sort of what the whole family saga turns into was that  they would say that after wandering in the desert for 40 years  I came back.
And -- and lo and behold  we meet one of my mothers cousins  but not the cousins that I mentioned before.
Uh  my family was taken al ready while I was convalescent in  in my aunt and uncles' home after uh  co-uh  ton-uh-tonsillitis operation  and uh  I had nobody but my aunt and uncle  and I stayed with them  and I acquainted pe ople that lived next door to us  which uh  liked me very much  and they suggested that I should co me and work for them while we were in hiding  and nobody will know that I am Jewish  and um  the Germans  when they invaded Belgium  took his factory over  so uh  I was doing camouflage work in the factory  and the owner was very  very nice to me and was trying to help me so that we could stay in the apt and uh and  and live there and a little bit of money I made there  I helped my aunt and uncle to buy groceries  and um  while I was doing the work  at night  in the evening  there was another neighbor who knew I was Jewish  and he had a beauty shop  and they uh  made connecti on with this uh  gentleman there  and  uh  asked for me to go and work there  and learn the trad e as uh  an apprentice to do manicuring.
Could you tell us a little of what life  when it came to what...what your family did before 1933?
I mean  I had no Had you known by this time what had happened to some of your family?
And everybody thought that if and thats what they the Russians assured us that if you were from the west  you would go back to say  you know [indecipherable] in Pozna   where my mothers family was.
In the ghetto  in the apartment where we were  there was several families.
The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was played time and time and time again.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 >> Gideon Frieder: Because I was Jewish and because my family was known in town.
When did your family find out what had happened to the Jewish community in Europe   and what was that like?
Yes  of course  and as as I as I grew older  I can remember  well  when the war started  1939  and my parents [indecipherable] of course  at that time  and their concerns with the people that they had left in Europe   their family.
No family  no friends  no one close  so that became very difficult to handle and it became a recurring pattern later on as well.
We didnt ha ve much family here  so her mother was able to help out.
Lot of pictures  a lot of pictur es and theres a -- he had cameos  two page cameos of different families  and theres one of me and my family  and you know  my father with me in a stroller  and all sorts of pictures.
So  from both sides of your family  tell me a little bit about your mother and your fathers families.
My mother had confided to one family that we were going to try to leave the following day  and they had seven children.
So that was very tough on your family  I would imagine.
It's only when you grow a lot older that you realize that here was this family  the Slotkins  and they took an unknown 12 year old boy  I mean  think 35 about it  with certainly not a great background.
And in that hut were living quite a few families in the family camp  as I mentioned before.
Especially I was very friendly with the...with the children of the director of the school and I was there...we were the only ones from my family that attended school on Saturday...but the other Jews did not attend Saturday school because it was against their religion.
She carried me into the living room where the whole family was sitting in a circle.

We had one room  we lived together in one room  my parents and me.
>> Bill Benson: During that three -year period that you were all together in Belgium  before you came to the U.S.  was your father able to resume his work?
Shall I confess at this point that the two of them had tried to remain close to us and form a family unit with us and that I  certainly was trying to get away from them because I knew that our chances um  our chances were slim to begin with.
Probably my mother family more than my father fam -- my father family  they didnt speak Yiddish at all.
And was not lucky  my sister  Irena  who we please  we ask Ir ena help this family son  because the parents was a good -- not friends only  good business people  and we respect this.
But the children also -- the family had to sacrifice  they had to give up a room.
But we keep a kosher home  and we keep all the holidays.
That was November  December  they announce on posters that ever y Jewish family has to turn in all their fur.
So when you got off of the car  you saw your family?

In fact  the family resided in Switzerland since 1914  when the war broke out.
And so they asked me a little bit of my history and I told them  you know  where I come from  where my family comes from  you know  and what happened.

She had a family friend that worked for th e underground.
We accepted a family who stayed with us till  till the uh German took over Krakow  some of those people survived  some of those people perished   but the hospitality of Polish Jewry to those people who were expelled by the Germans from Germa ny  this spirit of ------- was the best you  in the most humane way  everybody was trying to help  and shelter them and feed them  and protect them even though they were outsider.
Well uh I...my family was a closely-knitt ed family and my father  bless his memory  was uh uh a commissioned salesman and he had uh developed his own business before World War I when he was called into service and the business then had to be closed.
And that took place and we actually moved into a house in the ghetto and those people who owned that house occupied the house we lived in.
I had three brothers and I had three sisters and I was  I was the youngest one.
She was also the o-only child  and my family was killed  so and Steven didnt get married  and Michael now has two little babies.

One of Mr.  especially Mr. Price was working some social organizations which together with my mom in Gora Kalwaria  in his family.
So  the only people that knew that we are hiding there were the Polish family  and two priests from a nearby church.
Is there any -- any message or advice to give to you r grandchildren?
So the -- otherwise  my parents were members of the Jewish community.
They basically sort of said to her  how can you -- how can you 115 consider going with this boy when  you know  youve lost your entire family.
Close -- its close enough to German that -- that she learned Dutch fairly quickly  thats what my father spoke  and certainly  you know -- they tried everything really to -- to -- to become a part of the -- the Dutch community.
Bill Benson: Did any other family members make it out  Frank?
It would have involved of course taking permanent residence there  and it would have involved bringing my family over  that is Alice and my little daughter over and live to be sure decently as a matter of fact in one of the villas that were not destroyed in near in Berlin  if you know the place  where American officer personnel were .
And without the radios  the only thing we had -- this is before -- it's almost like -- honestly  you can't believe how important a radio was to a family.
Lets talk about you as a young child now that weve talked about your family.
>> Bill Benson: So here's you and your brother now are with your aunt and uncle.
Poland helping Jews was an immediate execution   including the whole family  and the neighborhood visiting  too.

So number one they had to move out of their house  their house was given to some German family  a a lieutenant or whatever he was  you know.
What sort of contact did you ma intain with your aunt who stayed in Germany after you left?
When I came out of Indiana and -- and we got married  I really knew that I was already a person i-in my own right and it was time to really make a home for myself and -- and whatever I felt was going to be my family.
I need to The spirituality of my family as well as myself is very limited.
I had a brother and a sister; and my sister was two years old and my brother was one year.
My fa my family was not very religious  and neither was my mothers family very religious  although my moms father  my grandfather which I never knew  everybody talked of him being as a religious person.
And this family had two daughters a little bit older than I was.
It was a family affair to earn a little money for brea d. Anyway time went on and the Germans  the Nazis rather  - I won't say Germans because I feel ve ry strongly that there is a diff erence between someone born on a certain soil and someone taking on a certain ideol ogy - the gestapo kept coming around  as I said  occasionally  more and mo re often.
So when I got that scholarship  I took a train off to Springfield  Missouri and yeah -- and I should say that my friends  the Haas family  they --after some initial difficulty  settled in -- in New York and Margaret's father got severa l jobs  improving as time went on  in the garment industry as designer  pattern maker and so on  in la dies garments.
These two boys uh may have uh ended up being uh raised by uh some childless family like uh I was supposed to.
Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 27 Another was di was there a feeling that theres a difference in the culture and Im talking about in that sense of a person an individuals individual culture  a turi ra   between how how you saw  you know  your life as a Protestant family  and how the Catholic families Religion did religion did not cov nobody talked about it.
Now why this happened  you know  there was seven  four brothers  and there was a gathering of the family  because Volbrum  town Volbrum had to supply X number of people -- soldiers to the tsar.
Some of my friends went to Paris because they had uncles in Paris and they wanted to be with their family.
And they still had intended to go to Israel  but eventually hi s mother convinced them to come to the United States.

She was pregnant  and she was rotund  and nobody knew that she was pregnant  not even her husband or her family.
>> Gideon Frieder: I lost almost all my family during that period.
The regent was arrested with his family and taken to Austria.
I'm not talking about when they were slaves  but the discrimination against the Jews was awful and I didn't want to have this and I said  ﬁNev er again.ﬂ I was the first one in my family that said  ﬁNever again.ﬂ It just turned out for professional reasons  finally  I didn't go back to Palestine  but my sisters did and my brother.
My husband got 65 percent  because he got in touch with the lawyer who worked in Germany  who was from Riga and knew their family  and he signed the paper [indecipherable] Mr. Ike USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 21 Mischkinsky came from a very high class of Jews in Riga and was used to a very high standard of living.

Shes really the only one in her family that even talks about th is stuff.
So there was a family living in the private Yes  there was a family living there.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
German and Czech  because my sister wer -- was born in -- was Czech  because she knew German also  because the rest of the family kne w German  and Czech as a second language.
This lady that worked for the underground  boo we went back  after my grandmother died  I went back to Germany with my whole family  my husband and my three sons.

Yes  brothers  and we were seven children  and I was the youngest.
A Lithuanian -- young Lithuanian Jew named Larry Lebetsky  whose family had survived the Nazis in Lithuania  through the help of -- actually I think it was a German military friend whom they had come to know during the German occupation of Lith-Lithuania.
Was there anyone in your family who you c ould talk with?
Before this time were there any change s in Hungary  any laws which affected the family business?
I dont remember what we ate but what strikes me very funny is here I am again in the dining room with her with a damask cloths on the table with the fancy china and with the napkins and even the family cres t on the butter  which we did not have at home but the table was al ways set for eating in a proper manner.
She was the one who broke  broke  completely broke off the family.

Before when we talked about how your father had discussions with students and other people about Germans  the Nazis coming to power and that kind of thing.
And the first part is... TECHNICAL CONVERSATION This is a family picture just before my parents came back second time to the States which was 1939.
In September 1942 after having been in Brussels for about 18 months under the circumstances that you touched on  at that point your parents made a profound decision and that was to put the family into hiding.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 >> Bill Benson: Life on the farm.
The other thing was we wanted to see our savior  this Muschau  who got his righteous papers there  and his family.
By the way  my mother came from a fairly Orthodox family.
I was sure  at first  that she must be a German.
And they were  they had to risk their own life of course too  to get all this  and having to take care of all those children  which I didn't know at that time  uh they they had an enormous job  so sometimes they brought me cards  and the family that I lived with had to have some help because we had no food.
And we knew...I'm trying to think; I th ink all members of my family who died--and not all died  but most of them did--in fact  were in Auschwitz or on their way to Auschwitz.
So  I found myself for fir st time in an Orthodox Jewish family.
And I got to talk to her  and she said her mother was Jewish.
Apparently it wasn't big enough to accommodate all four of us  so I was selected to be handed over to another family  a very Orthodoxed Jewish family   and I was not an Orthodox Jew  but I knew enough to say I'll make a go.
Now  you could talk about -- more about the camps than you could before.
In the meantime  a lot of people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people  and so my father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just about six weeks before the war started.
I had a cousin i -- my family was very modern  everybody had one or tw o children  period.
I would like to start the interview to find out a little bit about your life and the family you were born into and the world you were born into.
Were you the only one in your family who went to this school?
Can you just tell a little bit about any other recognition that the Madnas have received  the Madna family.
Of course  in the -- but of course that we are in the same area  but my family was everything intact.
His..... (Husband)She was the only one from his family that survived.
So after that my parents asked to move into Brussels itself.
It was a wonderful Catholic family  like most French people are  Catholic.
The husband would come and then bring his family  but my father knew better.
His parents were sent away with the whole family  sisters  two sisters and a niece and his parents  and we stayed behind.
I was adopted  not officially  but I was adopted by the family in Palestine and Israel.
She was raised in a Russian communist orphanage and she was working with the family as a help  raising children.
All my family  and feeling the love  that I was loved.
Now  is this literal  did you by now have a family?
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
What was your relationship with the othe r children in the family that you were told either later or that you remember?
I don't know whether it was the larger or the smaller but the rest they chased out later  so my Aunt must have been  and her family with them.
72 No  no  I was not connected with any malinas a nd we were a very such -- I was in a family where nobody would be able to build a malina or something.
It was called the English fleet  the Englisch-Flotte  it was very well known  and it was  until about 10 years ago  carried on by a much younger child of hi much younger than my mothers child  but thats a long family story that I dont think I have time to relate.
Apparently he came from a family that was relatively well-to-do  because he -- he -- after he arrived at Holland he was able to take piano lessons.
Uh...He told me that my family went with this and group to the Kosner group and he doesn't know where they are now  but they are not home.
The woman in that family was also very religious  very devout Catholic.
The fact that you had to leave  we-were you still -- did that change your feelings about being Jewish in any way  that you had to leave your town because you were Jewish?
Mr. Moise  tell me a little bit about what happened with you and with your family when the war started?
And she was taken in by a Scottish family who wanted a daughter and they cut off communications to the outside.
We were very friendly with...wit h that family  as a matter of fact.
So -- Because  for instance  with hiding  we understand what it means -- when I talk to somebo dy else who has been in hiding  I know what it means to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 37 be -- have been in hiding  and have your schooling in terrupted  your family life interrupted  your friendships interrupted  everything interrupted  I never was normal again after that.
And thats what we had and thats what every other Jewish family had that had two kids.
One of your family  I dont know whether he was married or not   never knew.
F or a substantial period your family was able to avoid being deported.
In 1944  you and your family -- your immediate family were put on a transport from the work camp in Starahovichen  its in Poland?

And there was another Jewish family in our home town what  had a little house  very poor little house in a very poor area  and  we moved in that little house in.
It Its partly  you know  German anti-Semitism  Holocaust  but its not just a story of what somebody went through  but how it affected life and affected the families  and Interview with Riane Gruss March 1  1999 204affected every-everything; how it changed things; how it showed I I I also noticed that in my own family  that my mother was the much more  somehow  resourceful person during the war than my father  who had a tremendous position before the war.
In those days  as I said  my family  my father in particular  was Orthodox  my mother not as much.
Her name was Blanca Brown and we were like family  like sisters.
B eing raised in a big family  you become very -- and my parents were very strict too.
Even though it focuses on Austria  one part of the family went to Yugoslavia and there is a description of Jasenovac in a few pages.
>> Bill Benson: But as far as communication with the family in Germany  as of September 1  1939 -- >> Kurt Pauly: Pretty much p etered out.

And he came becau se he had no way  all the family was sent out someplace.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
They feed us -- we eat by the same table with the whole family.
And I think everyone has  you know  lived remarkably good lives  given such a rip in the entire family support system  fabric.
>> Edna Friedberg: How did life change for your family after Hungary?
Since he had six children  a large family  it seems at that point they decided to let him go.
And I didn't talk about any gory details because I wasn't interested in my family reliving it with me or anything like that.
In the neighborhood where were there many Jewish neighbors  or was it Oh yeah.
Im like the steel; I love my family probably more than its normal but they are the most important thing to me after my freedom --- before my freedom.
I should say that my family occupied maybe half the street of the furniture business  very popular.
Did you  did you witness for deportations done by the . . .
The only way I found out about hi s family was that we found a cousin in California who was really whos like my thir d cousin or second cousin.
So  she comes from a powerful family with a lot of money.
And after we got married  he lived six months with us and six months with my sister.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
And my mother was taking care of eight or 10 children in that family and she could not get in touch with her own children.

Why did you -- why did you think that you should not raise a family?
Uh he was known as Emil in the family and his early years  certainly in Poland his official early years  he was known as Meilech Weiss  which was his mother's maiden name and uh that was because in Poland in those years Jewish marriages performed by rabbis were not recognized by the state and the Jewish children were considered illegitimate and took th eir mother's name on official uh documents  so that I have some documents showing my fa ther as Meilech Kurz.
Tell me a little bit about your father  your mother  and any siblings you might have had.

If they caught us  if the Germans on the road caught us  we all had been dead and all his family dead.
What effect did that have on your father  on your family life and on your perception?
And after awhile  which I dont really remember how long  they formed a ghetto in my hometown  an d everybody from all the villages and different neighborhoods our house was in the ghetto.

I tried to -- as a matter of fact  i -- bef-before -- and lets see  it was -- must have been in the 50s  yes  it was in the 50s  my father -- I dont remember how he found out that the cousin of mine from the family in Warsaw survived.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
Again met with my aunt in Pa ris and my cousin in Vienna and I just mentioned my family on the kibbutz lately.
I remember that -- I know that my mothers family were very close  as I have already indicated.
Wa see  one of the people  family  that had been working in in   they sent him to to this place in Palestine to be in charge of this of this business I see.
Over there  I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will hide us.
When you were still a girl  when all political things started happening  did your parents in talk about what was going on in Germany  or what was going on in Russia?
Just -- just having family members and friends with the same background that was our -- that was the extent of our Jewishness.
Did you know any Jewish people when you were growing up?
And my father  and I had an older sister  and she took care of my grandmother  and my grandfather came and my little brother and my mother and my sister that survived.
At that time  I was 5 and my brother was 2  and so we shipped off and that's the beginning of the family history in the United States.
He was asking me questions and I didn't trust him  but it took a while for me to gain confidence in them  and we told them about my family and the first concern was do I have somebody living  and I knew...I pretty much gave up on my parents.
So we stayed and stayed and every time somebody came back again and again we ran and again we tried to ask  \ Did you see anybody from our family?\

And she didnt want him to be named Jacob  be cause she didnt like she doesnt like her 9 family.
But he came and he met the rest of the family.
And Freddy  who does have a family and a lovely wife and wonderful children  well that still  he is a very closed up person.
The cousins of the Schraeder family went to your father  came up to he said  they happened to be a cousin of a Schraeder   mind you  he sold a rifle to your father.
It was kind of it was a large space  but nothing to it  and then when we had to share it with another family because it was such a large space  it wa s not a home of any kind.
>> Bill Benson: You and your family  as you began to tell us  lived then under the Communists until 1950  another five years.
And the family becomes unit  and if you work together  you survive.
My uncle and aunt  the ones we said stayed  had two children  my brother's age  the boy  they were close friends as well as being cousins.
So you were there with your mother  your father and your brother?
Maybe I shouldn't remember so much  but we were very close family  and I just can't forget it.
Oh  my mother  oh my father  oh my uncle was in Warsaw.
Well  I was sent to one of my -- to -- out of the way  a-away  away  to an estate of friends -- of -- of -- of -- one of the many estates of family members and I stayed that -- there  until -- because -- yeah  I stayed there  helping in the household  you know  learning about household and all that.
Well  I can tell you first about the family camps  rather than getting into this subject  because that's a more lengthy subject to talk about.
Now  who is the first members of your family to leave Germany  and what prompted them to go where they did  and Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27  2010 11 Well  since my father had to go went backrumpt bankrupt when the factory could no longer sell enough  we didnt have the financial means to get an immigration visa from [indecipherable] countries  because in the early 30s there was a depression all over the world.
Each family gave one day to a Yeshiva bokher.3 And since my mother had relatives in Vilkomir who were some of the most established and wealthiest people  so I had pretty comfortable every day in the families where I was eating every day  except for Thursday.
Marcel Drimer: All of those family members that I was telling you about  they were gone.
you know  and I -- now that I think back  I wonder how the Germans who were in the air raid shelter with us  felt about this foreign family who was in their midst.
You know  it's... And I come from a family of three children  my parents  my grandparents  bunch of aunts  uncles  lot of cousins.
I think my next oldest cousin is ei ght years younger than I and then she has a sister who is three years younger than I. They grew up at Strasbourg like I did  but its interesting  I cannot remember our family getting together for holidays so very rarely [indecipherable].
Being that I was single and I didnt find my family  I knew I was all alone and young  I decided to join this organizati on which I was with them for quite a while and working with the organization in Bittem.
So  I really didn't think that my family is alive  and I really did not choose to have a picture of how they died because it wasn't very clear in my mind either  how.
And income -- my mother was a  as I said  a widow who had to come up with  with the support of the family  and there were Jewish organizations who helped out in that respect.
Were you or your family in touch with those people before they were killed?
Tell us about your family and what life was like before the Germans invaded in 1939  please.
Some tell me that it wasnt Max   some tell me it was Marx   and I learned just a few years ago  that it was really Manczyk   m-a-n-c-z-y-k   and we had relatives in Brazil   the Manczyk family.
Is that what your mother [indecipherable] You had more of a Jewish life there.
We build the same thing  you know  to last for the whole family.
I mean  its too bad you gotta a -- a price with your -- and a lesson what you went through with your whole family and all that  you know  that be good.
I'm wondering  you're someone who has  who doesn' t seem to find it hard to talk about your experiences  who has been able to go on and have a family and a career and business and   but yet there are some people who haven't  who can't.
>> Bill Benson: And then amazingly you would connect with your aunts.
What did the Nazis do after taking control of your town and what was the effect on your family?
Most of my family was hiding in th e the in the barn.
Did your did your rest of your family know that you were involved in this way?
But those who were hiding  and were perhaps with a Christian family  they could still listen to BBC so that was the  the entire existence was the war and the topics were just that.
They had some pretty bad fights living close quarters like that with the family.
And my other aunt  my mom's other sister  came to the United States and lived in New York.
And dur ing the -- a meal  we sit together  eat and later theres sometime discussion about what happene d during the day  and what was good  what was no good  and we was very close family.
But he always said to him  ﬁIf you want to 54 be a real artist  dont get married.ﬂ But he wanted to be an artist  but he– I mean  he didnt have no one else but us  that was a fam ily  so he wanted a family.
And he himself didnt know where his family was  where his parents were.
They thought I have bigger chance of this I can get caught if I will [indecipherable] You mean the family became afraid that [indecipherable] Yeah  the family.
>> What were some of the customs that your family practiced that would go away in that childhood with such values of how you lived through it and where you are today.
In the ghetto  in the apartment where we were  there was several families.
>> Bill Benson: You and your sister Annette were hidden with a French family  the Bocahuts  whom you remained with until the end of the war.
Did he ever later express in light of what happened to the family  did he ever express regret about not having taken one of those positions?
One in the United States  the one who actually brought us over  who was his -- his -- my fathers uncle  my great uncle and his sister in Brazil.
Did your family have any contacts in the -- in the United States at that time?
We had a large family  uncles and aunts  grandparents  niece and nephews  nieces  cousins.
In a way it's true  I always liked to be independent  but also I did  I felt bad  I did want to be with somebody who  who will substitute my father  a family at least.
What was the impact for you of Kristallnacht  you and your family?
And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go  what they were going to do  and it was like a big family meeting.
Here we see a contemporary photo of the house where the family hid in two rooms on the upper floor.
He had had a imagination that uh he will be able to disappear when we are when we are taking other identification for the family like Christian people.
So I  being the head of the the family at that time  obviously.
So he  with his family  he took the few cows  and they were run into the forests to hide.
But I have  as far as family  family  but I ha -- I have no close ties.
The -- Well  as you probably know  Holland was invaded in May 1940  when I lived with my father and my mother and my two brothers  who are eight and 10 years younger than I -- than -- than I am  in a little town called Delft  in Holland.
My parents  sisters  and brothers -- I mean  my mother had about seven siblings.
we -- w-we agreed in the family we wouldnt talk about it.
And it the deal ended beca use they left for Israel  the whole family left for Israel and and I got I said goodbye at the New York  at the si ship.
Tell us first a little bit about your family and your life before the Germans came.
Well  I was out of the family  I was a -- a -- in a [indecipherable] because -- what is it?
He was a member of a very old  Catholic Ludbreg family.
Tell me about what -- My support system was very much the family background.
We had also relatives in Germany  my mothers sister and children were there.
Or my parents registered me as a member of the family  I dont remember.
Do you have any memo ry of whether your family was aware of what was happening on the German side of the border?
Well it meant that you know we didnt have any supportive family around.
I thought maybe because the war was coming  because at one point  the family had even a a kind of earth tunnel built  or something  that you could go in  if the bombs start falling  if they start shooting around.
But I personally dont know of anybody other than this family.
Ghetto still had some semblance  and I use that word very cautiously  of family life.
First of all how many were they in your mothers family.
But it was already too hard for me and on Thursday I felt that I cant take it any mo re and I packed two suitcases and wanted to go on the other side of Neris  into -- in the outskirt of Vilnius where the family was.
As a matter of fact  you know  Mother had a very good voice  too  but it was Father who really loved it  and as a matter of fact  my uncle from the United States who was the next to follow my mother and  Uncle Moish  and in the family of the nine children  they were the two closest siblings.
And how did you come out from that big house with th e rich  very well-know family?
But for somebody who didn t even know the story of the Holocaust  to go with the -- the three generations of family and everybody was impressed and he himself  couldnt get over it.
I'm curious how your parents spoke to you about what was going on in Germany and the world during the time you were grow up there and then ultimately why you were coming to the states.
And both households had a cook and a maid  and in my mothers family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to le arn another language  absolutely.
And he went to Israel  and it's true  the family got splintered  you know what I mean  and split up like this here.
Actually  I think you told me that's been sort of a family joke.
I said  \ Yes  I have it because my has a basket which is full of family pictures in a container and that also survived during the war  interestingly enough  and I can cut out some of the photographs.
There was another family there  a woman and her husband and a son.
Tell me a little bit about your mother and your father.
It is  when did your life  your fathers life  your mothers life  how did things happen in the family?
I guess during the war a lot of people want to save themselves and their families  so whoever want to be militiamen  he felt that he can save his family being transported out that fast.
But usual  in a case like this  they took away some family...family members  and the family 7 which was left usual...usually sent some Poles  Christian Pole  a friend  to go after the train to see the destination.
>> Harry Markowicz: They did it at great risk to themselves  the whole family.
I don't know if you know  Kohanim means from the priestly family.
During this -- all of this time being in the ghetto  were -- was your family able to observe any Jewish traditions  any of the holidays in any way?
Was there talk  was there room  was there space  I'm talking about a kind of a intellectual  emotional space within the context of your religious community  the synagogue  to talk about  was this an important... No  again  you asked first about my cla ss  were there other Jews  that I  did know other Jews besides my family?
And so they requested that I pay  I think its -- probably was like 2000 dollars to an individual in the United States  and he would arrange with his connections [indecipherable] family whatever  to pay them in rubles or whatever   so that it would settle with the government.
Uh I don't recall much of uh the uh children that I was with uh except those a few a few of those that uh survived with me .
>> Bill Benson: And there's you and your sister  so at least six children in this house.
And so which members of the family were standing guard that night?
And um later  I found out as I got older from my family  he tried to um force my sister they should have relationships with her.
It was the name which I assumed during the war to protect my family.
And Wh-Wh-When did you leave Germany and how long were you there?
I would like to -- to get a sense of what it was like to be there  and what your family said to you  because you were still thinking of moving.
When you were born  April 1941  the city with your family lived was under Soviet occupation.
Of course  I had seen photographs and incidentally  the family  after they heard that we survived the war  they sprang into action and send us lots of care packages  together with clothes  together with food.
And we  when we came back from the  after the war  we went back to Lodz to look for family.
I have family in New York  I have family upstate New York.
You become -- you don't feel Jewish after a while  except mentally that I felt that I am Jewish  that I was born Jewish.
The only thing I was glad you know and happy to find somebody from my family  my cousin.
So  here  in addition to what I remembered fr om home from a way back  was that butter which was cut in small pieces with the family crest on it.
Mean th -- no t on -- only family and other people has a very [indecipherable] for my father.
And the family that I had  uncles  could not take care of my sister and I because one of them survived Auschwitz .
My son is very angry because he feels he doesnt have an extended family.
You see  just by his judgment he knew what to do and came to our family in 1918 and...uh...when Poland became independent  he also had to enter the Polish army.
Well  it was did your parents or yo ur family ever talk at home about all of the political changes that were happening?
Germany threw out Jewish people that their ancestry was from Poland.
And -- And where did you and he live when you got there?
I spoke Russian with my grandfather and grandmother and my mother  and French with my father and my mother too.
No  when -- when you realized the war was over  where were you living?
My mother was very religious  but my father wa s not religious at all.
As a family we lived in this very  very tiny apartment together and so we became much more involv ed and I think we shared a lot of things 24 whereas they didn't share that much with us in Germany  partly because they didn't think it was proper and partly to protect us  but here in America we were really involved in the ups and downs of the congregation.
The next year  1936  circumstances for your parents and family turned more ominous and became more difficult  if not dangerous.
So before the break  we were talking about the first several months that you r family lived in Wilno Vilnius Yeah.
Nobody from our family  87 percent of our family doesn't come back from the concentration camp.
So sh e says to the family  this is where Im gonna send my children.
This is tape number one  side B. And you were talking about the two boys that came into your family  that came over from the Kindertransport and stayed for six years.
>> Bill Benson: Then  of course  your father returns in 1946 and it would be another three years before you would get to United States.
And theres no other family members  those -- They didnt want to.
Was this and added burden for women then  unless they got married and were part of a family?
Not just one  two  four  six  eight people of a family went on that terrible day.
And how long did you live at the fa with the family?
So I told her  lets make arrangements because Rachel is going to run aw ay with this family and you will go with them and we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister.
And by then it was -- the six of us and my aunt's family  her br other  sister-in-law and two boys.
So you were able to have reunions with both of your siblings  your brother and your sister?
So could you tell me a l ittle bit about your life  your your early -- the earliest you can remember?
There were three families that my Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 24 Were your family.
I'd like to ask you to tell me a few words a bout your parents and about your family and how was your life as a child in Iasi?
Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in Boreslawiece except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were  where the...my mother's family lived.
Tell us what you can about your father being forced to go to the Channel Islands and then about your mother finding a place for the family  the rest of the family to hide.
But that is the end of the Altarac family from Vlasenica.
The Jewish person would leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him.
was it -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 36 Comes from a very religious family.
They understood that  but at the same time  they were  you know  I was 16  and I think they were mostly worrying about who am I going to marry  you know  and how is this going to go on  and Im going to be lost to the family forever  and that kind of thing.
No  those are strangers in the famil y. The family lived in Washington Heights.
And I was working  it was a German family that owned the farm.

I dont know how well-to-do that is  but they were a more prominent family than my fathers family.
I think really if I th ink now in retrospect  I think the division of labor in the upbringing was -- Paulette was much more -- her family more structured USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 72from a social standpoint.
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?

And as I said before  only one family out of 10 000 famil -- families was offered asylum.
So he was well-known a ll over the place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and frien ds by number one  contacting a fasc ist officer and Ive no idea how he did it  who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and  and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara George.

And I would put in the names of all my entire family  of whom there were 18 members  to see if anyb ody got out alive  but we heard from some lady who had met them in Auschwitz  and she said that they had been killed.

And so my mother had said  r un and go to Czernowitz and stay with this family  trying to remember their name  Is inger  Isinger.
But they -- they were adorable people  so nice  so nice.

A few days before the Russian came  somehow a family child came from-- eight years  10 years or whatever years old--he came to this uncle.
Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28  2015 94 Holy Family Academy in Chicago .
And if you didnt have that  there were a few instances  but not in my family  where an organization  a char Jewish charitable organization might find a way of providing what was called an affidavit.
And can you describe to me a little bit about your family life in that home?
But through my experiences in the Army and then in Europe and then especially at seeing Dachau and seeing what racism could do to people  I came out with an obsession of not letting myself or any of my family ever become racist towards any ethnic group or color of people or whatever.
Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family was wiped out.
What he did was to sell off parcels of land there  that later would have enriched his family so much  because it grew in value.
Not strong  but friendly  friendly we became like family  you know.
I mean not much because we were not a family that was very materialistic.
In February  the congregation in Bremen  the Jewish congregation in Bremen  organized itself again and they had a temporary president  vice-president an d  but they had no place any more to live  so there was this one family  I mentioned before th is family Greenberg that was a different  a brother of this Greenberg and they had a house in Bremen and they had alre ady left this house in September 1938 and they had sold it  not even sold it  they had given it as a donation to the Bremen congregation.
And all of a sudden  I started concentrating mentally : that I want to return home  I want to be with my family  I want to be free again.
And so we were  of course -- obviously it was not a matter of denying that we were Jews.
And your uncle and his wrote that to you  your family?
And I raised a family  and in the meantime they married.
Only th ing I remember  when he was let go  an-and we were co we came home when we knew he was home  and I remember him sitting at the at the table in our family room  shaving off his beard.
They were from the Milsch family  M-I-L-S-C-H. Sort of funny that I married Milkman.

Jews werent allowed to do business  and turned over a ll the funds to my family.
Because that is why I went from the family to the -- to -- to the [indecipherable] because they wanted to prepare the Jews for emigration.
13 Actually nobody from my family uh was eliminated in in the reduction of the ghetto.
I guess what Im trying to get a sense of is how how much your childhood  your growing up was within the family  and within a Jewish community  and how much was it mixed?
Me  my mother  my father and the two brothers  my tw o brothers and my mother's sister and aunt.
She is the only member of the family upon whom the dreadful pa st did not leave any trace.
Talking about friends  talking about family  talking about pain or illness  about whatever  but I can tell you one thing  it all came back.
And  I mean  here was my brother  who had his own family  who was such a mensch as to go up to my father and thank him for being my father.
So after the war I had a choice of either going to Israel  where I also had relatives  because my fathers whole fam ily was in Israel by that time  including my grandparents.
My mother  my father  my brother  my sister  my aunt  my uncles  large families.
And I wouldthe only thing which kept me after the war is my children  my family.
>> Bill Benson: And you had it with you in Kenya.
But its hard to know what would happen  at least in my ey -- since I didnt follow the families in many of the -- these cases  its hard to know what their ultimate -- what the ultimate affect of this case was on the family life.
Had my family  five people in the family  with my mother and father was seven.
I am -- you know  almost 70 years old  so I want to travel a little bit  and as lo ng as I can see my family in London  my son  my Interview with Halina Peabody June 3  2002 44sister  her kids.
Even when I got my first job  through the family  my stomach was so nervous just getting on the subway in New York and going to work and not to know what to expect ther e  all the unknowns  everyt hing that was unknown was so scary that the first seve ral years and I'm not talking about months  first several years  I was having a real hard time.
And Were you were you the witness of the liquidation of the Terezin family camp?
Now Szymon -- yes  Szymon was a friend of our family.
I am  I  maybe you say that I am old-fashioned  but I feel that if you hav e a problem  you have somebody close to you  it doesn't even have to be family  a good friend  you can talk it over.
Oh  my mother  oh my father  oh my uncle was in Warsaw.
Was thr ee kids  and two g -- brothers and a girl  and a 14 Melamid family and grand family of Melamid wa s Birnbaum.
Did you have any idea of what was happening to the Jews in Poland ?
And this I made  to send it through one of the workers and guards in that camp [to my family].
She's married  and she has a nice family and I was very  very happy.
Now  the other doctor that I'm telling you  he was exceptional good  and we were lucky that our place where we stayed next to us was a rich family.
So they went into hiding there and I stayed with a French family.
Well I -- I am curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered in many different places  and your mom would -- would travel [indecipherable] and Im sure its -- what [indecipherable] look like.
57 Now -- an-and among the friends and associates of other members of your family  did th -- were there any other stories like that  of -- of people who had been friends who suddenly turned against them because -- No.
And of course I had the full support of my family who really wanted us to come here.
Do you think thats why he kept asking you what -- Interview with Helen Goldkind February 21  2001 43 Yes -- -- what happened  because he was thinking of his own family? --
So my father told her that I am like miles away in this peasants family  and I'm far away and I'm being taken care of  more or less.
And the next week  it turned out that was about a week before the rest of the family was going to be called out - we disappeared within that week.
Now  you have to remember  my father was a first World War veteran  my grandfat her  my mothers mother -- father was also a veteran.
You have no contact with your family  I take it None whatsoever.
So they piled the stuff that they had on it and then they put -- the other family had a little girl my age  3 years old.
And becau se my father  of all the Nazis  he -- he hated th -- the one he hated the most was Goring  because Goring should have had [indecipherable] a flier  a gentleman  coming fr om a good family  he should have known better.
And did you say anything to them about any of your experiences?
They killed quite a few Jewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family.

>> Edna Friedberg: Speaking of your sisters  when did your parents start a family?
Underneath that was the family of my cousins  uncle and aunt  theyre called Weidman  right  they had several children.
We tried to help them join families wherever we could because what is life without family?
We were  like I said  middle-class family-- nice home  clean home  beautiful children  everything you can ask--'til Hitler.
Did your parents have any contact with their family back in My mother had some kind of stomach condition and her cousin  Freddies father  Hotzel  one of the Hotzels  Leo Hotzel had moved to Switzerland and with my cousin Freddie who was I think a year younger than me  who eventually became a physician I understand.
So our apartment was occupied by this family  but our neig hbor took everything  you know  our clothes and our valuables -- Personal things?
I would say the id eas of Hitler were as far from our family as the moon.
Bill Benson: Being mindful of the time that we have  tell us  if you don't mind  about you were forced ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 into the ghetto but your father got you out of there.
Oh  it happened to be very important in terms of my connection to Palestine or Israel  because I had family there.
With her family there too  or she had a separate place?
So that was your grandmother was Grandmother or my fathers mother.
He never wanted to say anything about his story or his family.
Hes okay -- my husband isnt a close  warm kind of person  though his mother tries in -- in -- on her behalf  I must admit  her mother tries to keep the family together.
Yes  the entire family and all the workers a nd everyone who lived there.
The other family were assigned Thursday  Friday and Saturday for lunch.
And of my fathers side  only c-cousin Anja and Uncle Alexander and with his wife and the two sons  of c -- who of course survived  but not inside th -- inside of Poland.
And I -- also I heard that my grandmother and grandfather family from Vienna left.
So actually half the family stayed and half the family escaped so.
The house is still staying  one floor  a wooden house  and there was our house all the time that the whole family were living together in the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: And the mayor  I think he provided you  the family  with false papers.
I didnt feel -- I didnt need the outside to accept me and love me because my own family did that for me.
And I think that he was from very wealthy family in Vienna.
He had already his family outside  and he had prepared his place for himself outside.
And tell me just a little bit about your -- your family background  and your childhood  just a bit.
So they were hiding in a barn not far from the house.
And we  after  of course  our house bo house was bombed out  and this was a two family house  we he invites us to live with them.
Sakharrov was still alive  so he offered the family to help because he speaks English and he speaks Russian.
And see for the present  for the future  for my family  that means I didn't try to  try to live in the past.
I came to a family that opened their arms to me and did the best they knew how.
My maternal grandparents  because my paternal grandmother lived with us and my grandfather had died.
When did you find out about your parents  your mother and father?
My mothers family had a friend  and his he was a a romane he was he was a Romanian  or he lived in Romania  but he was Hungarian.
Okay  but they get to Krakow  and they have a very good life with the family i -- my family there.
Her family  she had a daughter -in-law who was still alive and a granddaughter.
And the family packed up  one  two  three and moved to the Midlands to a sister.
Did you have any non-Jewish friends as you were growing up?
That picture is taken in 1937  and here is my family.
It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage  letting the world know this is what happened to my family.
>> Bill Benson: But you knew you were in Germany now.
He was a Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 35journalist who had studi ed the history of Hitler and his family.
Before the liquidation of the ghetto T family escaped to a small village.
But in 1954  I think -- I was also connected at one point with another member of my family that survived.
But my sister  and as I said  her family went over.
And the one who did the most sacrificing was my oldest brother  Fre d. So -- because he supported the whole family.
Why was she putting away certain things or giving away some money to another gentile family in a small town who came to see if we had everything.
My grandmother and brother went one way and then my mother and I. Six weeks after we got back  my father came back to us.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Well  he was seven years older than my mother.
And his father was a policeman that was killed by the Germans during World War I. And so essentially  he came from a simple family  and he was born in a little town on on along the Nemunas river.
>> Bill Benson: What was your father doing during that time?
Switzerland was the logical place and besides  we had that family that had supported us partially.
There was a Jewish family that Interview with Ruth Greifer 52 When you first saw your parents.
Already had huge sacrifice by having our father not to be supporting family anymore  being tortured.
So  are mostly the people that you spend tim e with are Teresa  whos your caregiver and the members of your family?
Also  when there was a family which was less fortunate that we were  I know that they were supported.
As I said there are more happy events than bad events.
So she is done  shes -- her picture is -- is -- I have a picture of my family in our bedroom  but I also have a picture of Mary Mills in that room.
And then it says her new family I do now know.
Well  [indecipherable] a bit later for -- Yeah  but you [indecipherable] -- a-and the whole family  and the -- the boy was one year in the senior American school in London.
And I -- I -- I can still reme mber going on long walks in the middle of the mountains  and sitting on a rock  a nd looking at the horizon  beyond which you cannot see  because the next ridge intervenes   and try to go mentally beyond that ridge  and then I would see the family.
And thats due to my foster family  maybe  they taught me the when my foster mother was sitting with me every day to teach me  when I was living in their house  and thats how I got good in all these areas.
So  Eddie had a number  his family had no affidavit  however.
Uh  the Queen was looked upon as a wonderful  wonderful person  the whole family.
Because what youve described up til now  like the family outings Right.
But I suppose that was part of the game plan  to create a heritage in a family.
He was  during World War I  in the Austrian army as a physician and therefore then  wh-when the war started  the family went to Vienna from Chernowitz.
And I assume that its that family background that en abled you to -- to cope with life.
And when you get married and then start a family  your thoughts turn to the future and so we raised two boys.
Now  does she remember being in hiding  though  her -- her family?
Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger 7 I went to church with the Bandyrowa family  with my best friend Wisia and her mother and her older sister  and at times I went to school.
Do you have any recollection of what it was like for you to be taken from the Bocahut family to move from there?
When you were there  were you aware of what was happening in the rest of Europe ?
Well  since my husband was Jewish and I had then lived with my family for a year  I had really accepted that faith as mine.
And Id enjoyed  if I can use that word  or indulged in that hatred for many years  particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways  and seen his family destroyed in grotesque ways  and I -- at least his - certainly his father  who was beaten to death in the house in which they we re on the Kristallnacht.
Well  you better not react it  because if you expressed yourself to somebody  you were not certain what that other person how that other person would react  and perhaps tell somebody that Hedi said such and such  and then that could hurt my family.
The family of Franks   and no  not Franks   it was more Herbst   as she born into the family of Herbst .
I didn't have anything  any tangible proof  or anything that I could look and remind myself  because some days I was just wondering who I am  and who my family was.
>> Mic hel Margosis: So we never saw family  never saw any relatives.
After a while   they took my father away from the family.
Maybe youll get sent you to work  I will take care on your childrens and we will be a family.
And th -- what -- they were fluent in German  I gather  as well.
Oh  I -- oh  you -- yeah  to Israel  you see  what happened  it was Palestine.
>> Bill Benson: Tell me a little bit about your husband  Jacques.
Okay  tell me a little bit about your the family that you created together.
And the living  what you say Š you had four meals a day – three meals a day; and were a close -kni t family .
He gave the father of this family Swiss money so we could go onto the streetcar that was going back and forth between Geneva and Annemasse.
My mother  I dont know how she got the addresses of the family that was in New York.
Can you tell me a little bit about your house and what kind of street you lived on?
My -- my brother went to a --- a -- he -- we knew this  he went to a -- a f -- a -- one family that came from Koblenz that lived there  and I went to a family that my dad used to do business with in -- in -- Right. --
When your children were young  when your son and your daughter were young  did you tell them about what you had gone through  what Oh yeah  I used to tell them a lot.
He was in the parliament and he was also from the family of Franz .
So with that  my mother turned to me and she said  \ You know  we fought all this time so that we have our family ho pefully together again and we suffered all of this and then  now that t he war is over   we found out there was no reason to fight and to suffer  because there is no family left.
Like I went to Africa to work two years  with my family.
And they  because my father was on the black list and he was a writer  they gave him this chance and gave him and his family another chance to come to America.
Did you feel more Jewish after what you had been through  because -- No.
In that time for her grandfather to go to to college...this I remember that two days before she graduates since she supposed to encourage to go for girl from my family  it was...it was a revolution  that my grandfather found out that she was dancing at a dance...you know  before graduation  with the boys  and she never graduate.
Uh  one family would come three times a week  and another one would come three other days a week.
Did you and your sister do any work to support yourselves?
And then I went to  nearly every year and a half or six months  to South America to my family.
>> Michel Margosis: Everybody who were living -- they were in Barcelona together  living with a Spanish family.
So my family started in what should we do -- they called me the boyjik.
Interview with Ellen Kaidanow November 8  2008 7 So  the ghetto  how many people of your family do you do you recall more or less?
Not only we  the whole family would have everything  we could sell it.
>> Bill Benson: How long do you think you were in the attic?
And in March of 46  we were already in Poland   the whole family  also [indecipherable] hot  it was more comfortable.
You were born in 1941.What were you told about what happened when the Germans first came?
I had a very happy childhood  very close -knit family  lots of love  two sets of grandparents  not too big of a family  we were not a very large family; but kind of well -to-do  not extravagant  and very happy.
>> Bill Benson: So Jill  during that time  those years that you were in Kenya during the war  and of course as you said the war broke out shortly after you got there  did your family have any real idea what was taking place in Germany  and was there any ability to communicate with any family members?
What was the age range of your sisters and your brother?
As a matter of fact  I saw an accident  somebody came out from the kitchen with a pack of soup  collected for his family  then all of a sudden a boy jumped the women.
And they w ould take down  because if still bring people  you know  his family  it will be saved.
And also I was torn apart  I didn't know whether to be with my mother  my whole family was hungry  or be with the children.
Ive never been able to verify with her whether thats how she was transported  but she did tell me that she crossed Denmark  which was then still occupied  and was taken in by a family in Sweden.
And we actually did get another family to live with us  and they happened to have been actually German Jews from Leipzig  who must have been also sent into our city.
At least she had her family and so they were in hiding and however horrible that was  at least they had each other for a long time.
And you stick when you want to do something you stick to it  and help each other and I want to see close family  like I am with my sister and my brother now .
>> Bill Benson: So now you're in Belgium  your family is reunited with your mother and your father and your grandmother and your brother.
I had a sister older than me and a brother 12 years old and a little sister 8 years old.
With Mauri -- We did  but not too extens ively  but we did talk about different -- about the family  about different -- other different things  yes  over the years.
She ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 came back.
And one of the things  just to give you a hint at  as a result of his speaking and doing other things related to the Holocaust  he became acquainted with people in Indonesia with a unique story about this Indonesian family.
You know  we had -- we had a family  we ha d children  we went to the PTA meetings  we went -- we went on vacations with our children  but there was so much else.
15 And I wrote that I already found out that my family perished.
He said  \ My  my goal is to chase the German and give them back what they did to my family  to my family.\
I decided I wanted to go to college  although  I'd been the first one in our family to graduate from high school even.
Paid extra money  and together with this merchandise  I could bring it in and then later to supply my family and to sell something like this.
It was mean c ompared to where I had been in a loving family.
the on my mothers side  the the leader  kind of  in Mothers side of the family was her sister al Elsas husband  Karl Heiman   who was very Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 31 wealthy  had a big textile business  and he knew everybody in government  and elsewhere.
They they had dealings with the with the Nazis  and so on  and so the family sort of ignored them.
I know it for a fact  because two days later the men who were segregated were brought into our camp  and they were crying like little babies  that they left their family.
>> Esther Starobin: Both of my parents  there were 10 sibblings in each family.
In fact  by then  when I was in Israel   they also came to visit me in Israel .
12 >> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: First of all  learning it and not forgetting it.
It touched me  but I didnt feel it  that something is wrong with myself or with my family.
They said  they  \ From the whol e family nobody survived  just us three  we have to be together\ .
As for me  I -- of course my -- the -- the -- the center of my life was the family  the school and -- and -- and religious school and this very active Jewish youth movement.
Germany threw out Jewish people that their ancestry was from Poland.
I mean what-- No  there was a notification from the police  ﬂYou have to report tomorrow morning to the train station.ﬂ We were the onl y  I think  Jewish family there.
When I left Israel my older sister gave birth to a little daughter  and those were still the days  1952  when going to America meant being lost to the family.
The original  and the supported by the other one  they felt that this was which it should be a normal thing  I mean  if the if the uncle provides an affidavit  you would expect that he would then also accept the family  and that the supporting affidavit was there for financial reasons  if it ever came to that.
Tired of fighting  tired of battling  tired of  that is why they call me wishy-washy in my family.
And the war may end in a month  in three months  and the longer you can keep your family together  the better your chances for staying together as a family for surviving.
That I I in buni I went for myself in business  and You raised a family.
Before 1939  had you heard a lot about Hitler and the Nazism?
My mother had an apartment together with her sister and her sisters husband.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 18 The family  the [indecipherable] father.
>> Betsy Anthony: You've told me before that despite the Nuremberg Law against it your family kept kosher during this time.
At some point my father and the relative  again  the one responsible for my parents' marriage  they bought a kind of -- I don't know what you call them.
And it's also true that my father  although raised as a very religious little boy  as an adult was not religious.
And you know  if I said it privately to you before the start  or I said it otherwise  I think I have come to a time where almost every important event in the history of the persecution of my fa mily  and Im talking about my immediate family  that I have gotten the evidence.
Did you know or did your parents know what was happening in the rest of Europe at the time?
>> Bill Benson: And where did you -- you ended up with another family.
That's another thing that we've got to keep in mind  he came out of prison  he was a prisoner  he came out  he's now w ith the family  he's in Heidelberg(p h) where half of the town hates him and the other half of the town puts the red carpet down.
All right  and then were going to look up Mr. Liebenaus family.
Bill Benson: Your family  Henry  suffered a terrible tragedy in 1932 when your brother died.
These 33 individuals  aunts  uncles  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 cousins  grandparents.
And did your family obse rve holidays that year in Lvov  Jewish holidays?
>> Bill Benson: After war broke out  your family left Paris for a second time but returned after a short period.
Yi ddish you can learn  but a good family  you can't -- you must have  or you don't have.
I did occasionally  like in college I needed somethi ng and I went to his store to buy it and uh but about what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a bar mitzvah in Worcester and Leon came.
12 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD Eventually  towards the evening  one man dragged himself in and back to his family  and he told us what happened.
I feel like you kind of touched on this  but did your family live in a Jewish neighborhood  interact mostly with Jewish people  or mixed Hungarian Well  basically  there was such a huge Jewish population in Budapest   that you can hardly pinpoint a a Jewish neighborhood.
I -- I dont really -- Im not a religious -- I like tradition  a little bit of it  you know  with the family  and we spend the holidays together  but it means more to my children th an it does to me  to be honest.
>> Bill Benson: Did some of your siblings go to other Christian families or to J ewish homes or did it matter  just whoever would take you in?
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
Bu t years ago  that was a more patriarchal society  like in my family  the men worked  the women stayed home.
I came into this camp as a youngster not knowing at all where the rest of my family is and being assigned to a barrack with lots of people  sleeping one next to the other on three rows high of berth or with some straw on it.
There was a beautiful  little Mung girl that Sylvia was friends with her mother and her family.
I didn't...it was like  it was like staying w ith the same family almost.
The -- all the family from my father's side was living in north of Transylvania  in Salonta  very close to Oradea.
I never told my wife that  but I delivered 4 500 babies in family practice.
Now we  the family of five now - my grandparents from my father's side and the three of us - went to one of these farmers with the family of Pavel Vancik and his brother Andrei Vancik.
And the second one was ﬁWhat would you like to eat?ﬂ And I said  ﬁBread  herring and potatoes and all the water I can drink.ﬂ And the next thing happened  they came in there -- Red Cross lady came and she said there was a family -- a lady -- a man and a lady who would like to take us out for the day  they would like to show us Copenhagen and buy you some clothes.
I was the youngest from the four children and the only girl.
Because we -- yeah  because we wanted  the family wanted a -- wanted a DVD.
Did you have a particularly close relationship with any of your fathers siblings?
The family camps were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the figures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons  we would find that the biggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the forest  was from the family camps.
In closing  is there any short message yo u wanted to give to your grandchildren?
So when the family first left Wanska  it -- it -- it wasnt so much that the family -- that your father felt that you and your mother would be in da nger  it was just because of the war  per se -- Yes. --
And my mother's family  now  my moth er had three brothers and one sister.
Not of any national significance but a totally inhuman story was contained in a letter that I came across from a youngster who very proudly reports to someone in his family that on his 13th or 14th birthday his father gave him a rifle and three Jewish prisoners to be shot.
It's not really a two family  but they had bedrooms upstairs  and downstairs they had a kitchen  they had everything  you know  in the house. \
So I had a uncle  and a aunt  but they are deceased.
He was also a survivor and he too lost at least 90 percent of his family.
That's when my father thought that the family in Holland would be able to rejoice al so.
We were very nervous and careful but we managed to hide about a dozen people o f our family.
And then  from then on the family knew  they had it from a reliable source and if they wa nt to take chances  they could pass information on to friends.
But of course  I didn't know anything ab out my sister wi th her family  this I didn't.
As a matter of fact  we we were close to four families.
I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away.
Were you aware of what  the nature of what was happening to Jews in Europe?

I have a large family  and all my friends and everybody else I could think of.
I mean  you first of all its its interes well  its its perplexing to me to hear of some of a family thats Orthodox and religious  that would be inc lined to si to think well of communism.
When did it sink in for you actually  the magnitude of what had happened during the Holocaust?
That was too far to leave the family  so my compromise was to study physics at the University of Vilna.
Our children grew up  we -- we had wonderful  wonderful family.
I mean  there was not one si ngle Polish family without some victims  but a Pole had a chance to survive.
I have a Jewish mother  I have a Jewish father  and obviously I was Jewish.
What was the name of the family that you stayed with in England?
And we had family living in Vienna  broth -- my fathers brother was living in Vienna  and I had a cousin.
>> Bill Benson: Fred  as you said earlier  you left Germany six weeks after the war began.
And then came to live in Zagreb  and my fathers family tended to be cantors.
Then I had uncles  aunts  they had children  a lot of them  from both sides.
I dont want to mention his name because he has his family.
My fathers brother  and family  and and and one other family.
It happened in 1939  it comes the war between Poland and Germany.
However  in those days at least there was no killing  no mass killings  I th ink a few Jews actually did die due to just mistreatment  but I mean which is horrible enough in its own right  but at least most survived and the Gestapo let it be known that anyone whose family can produce an emigration visa to another country will be im mediately released and will have to leave the country within one month  giving him one month's time to wind up affairs and so on.
It was a family of about seventy or eighty people and I am the only survivor.
And still sa -- we was invited to later there  I maybe mentioned to Melamid family  where was on Bar Mitzvah and etce tera.
Yeah  and when did you hear about what happened to all the other Jews during the war?
Now  did you go to synagogue when you re at grandfathers?
We were the only family of three to the best my knowledge that lived in that camp.
Nobody told me because people doesn't -- didn't tell too much because that can be -- that can be dangerous for somebody if it would be found  nobody knows if it's good for him or for his family and maybe it's also not good because now his 31 family will know -- so  no  it was very  very privately.
But when the grandfather broke up w ith the rest of them  then the family had to follow.
When did you find out about your parents  your mother and father?
I mean -- Was your family -- did your family know what you were doing?
There were my family and my aunt with two children and my grandfather and grandmother.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023 21 Yes  I came to my hometown  I joined my family  I stayed with them and my friends from the original -- original group  the OP  the defenders of Poland  which was already incorporate into ZWZ  appro -- came to talk to me within probably two days after I came back and say  ﬁHey  [indecipherable] want to rejoin?ﬂ ﬁWell  tell me who and horah.ﬂ So we had a few meetings with local people and then we went to meetings with the so-called overall command and we identified -- I mean  I was the only one  I identified myself and told them what I could do.
No  19  wait a minute   yes we were there in '39  and one day the war was declared between Germany and Belgium and the boss of that family camp said to my husband  he was an announcer 16 in the dining room  as I told you and he said  don' t say that word war  and then we left  from the family camp  in a group  where a ll the other Belgium and Jewish  everybody fled   wanted to go to Paris  which was not yet occupied by the Germans then  but they got there before we got there.
Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28  2015 108 Something like that  and and some mo re  because because they were a large family.
And this Polish family  they planned for 11 us if everything -- because we heard that certain towns were being -- all the Jewish people were being taken away.
Although you were born in Austria  your family moved to Prague  Czechoslovakia  when you were very young.
What would -- what did it feel to -- like  to be walking down familiar streets in Budapest  where once  you know  you had family   friends and all this life in this community and what was it like then  after the war?
My uncle in Isaac Makowski   who lives in who at that time lived in Brooklyn   New York  in United States  he was not happy with th e family that I was living  because they were not religious Jewish.
So in flipping through pages  hoping to recognize people that I knew or family  I actuall y found myself in it as I was standing there after my sister was separated from me and I was motioned to go to the other side.
And I was the eighth child in the family; so that means a big family.
She was from that connection  but thats an whole ot her story  because she was very dependent on me for many years  so she was more like friend because she -- she was psychologically USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 218 damaged and she was part of my family as l ong as she lived  for the reason that she was a needy person.
But when I decided -- a friend of my family Lotta Kalinaski  also from Berlin who was -- is quite a well known psychiatrist here in the States I think -- .I went for shock treatments and things.
And once we were on the way to a ji -- Jewish family  four or five girls  I dont know any more and German boys came against -- came on the other direction and when they passed us  these German boys  they said  ﬁKriksdani.ﬂ This means lucky stars.
Actually  tell me -- tell me that -- your wifes full name  and more about her family background.
May I ask how many people in your family  your brothers and sisters.
>> Bill Benson: To not only keep going  but take care of her family as she did.
My parents took him out of school  sent him to live with a family in Berlin  and he went to school there.
I did not dare tell Thanassis where my father was  because we were told  and enjoined when we had this family council  we were going to go into hi ding  and other then because of need  like going and -- and -- and getting money  or s eeing  you know  a -- a loved one  we are not to divulge where they are.
I never had that in my mind  and y ou go by maybe a member of th e family.
In that village and around this village was living most people of my family until we can say '39  until the Slovak state.
And so -- and so thats the last moment when I left my family.
His o -- whatever he di -- the purpose o-of his -- him staying 34 alive was to save his family  and he constantly was working how to do it  how to find the place that he can hide us  that he can spare us f-f-from being killed.
And the second thing is that this is one of the few times youre going to get an opportunity to meet people who knew your family and might be able to tell you things.ﬂ And as usually  she is very wise person.
I want to ask [break] Okay  so you you have no real knowledge of the larger family that your parents came from  other than they were not from Vienna .
>> Bill Benson: At that time  at Christmas time  December 1944  of course for you in that area the war is over but the war  of course  would continue elsewhere until May. Do you know if the adults knew what was going on with the war elsewhere and did they know what had happened to Jews all over Europe?
As an observer it would seem to me that -- that start that you had in life  of security and a -- and an extended family  a really stable  good backgr ound would give you reserves  sort of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 42inner reserves that might help you to keep going  but do you -- do you consciously have any thoughts?
Later on  when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family  I realized we really copied -- we copies–no  we didn't copy it.
We had also relatives in Germany  my mothers sister and children were there.
So now youre back home with your family and what did you do then?
What were the kinds of conversations that you would have around the dinner table with your family?
It was a family house  you know  so that Yeah  yeah.
Tell me about your parents and your family before the war  when you were growing up.
I also then recollect going into an own -- little house or barrack or something  where th e family as a unit stayed.
Oh  this -- one interest of me -- one of my hobbies is the famil y  and I dont know if I showed you the family tree  that I got the family together.
So maybe you want to do the whole se lection of your family again just coming off the train.
I -- I think I am a bet -- a bit better believer than I ever was  because I am alive  and I have to give resp ect for mine deaths  for my family  for all the deaths  for all the millions You did not want to speak about it for a long time  but when you did the interview for the Holocaust Museum -- I did.
>> Bill Benson: In a little while you'll tell us about your life with the Harrison family.
And uh  was some kind of discussion now and people start to talk more  but was only talk at this time about Germany  about Hitler  about the situation in our town.
I'm going to see to it that the family will be reunited.
Could you tell us your name and where you were born and when you were born?
And I took the star off  and I went with the train to another town and helped an older family  an older couple  what they were not allowed to have any help anymore from notJewish people.
So the only other person -- well  actually two members of our family ended up in Palestine.
And I know that she got a rich family what she they used to have a store on mar Monjaewska Street.
All of a sudden my mother a patrol  a German patrol came by and stopped my mother and they already had two women  French women arrested there because some Christians were also trying to get to the other side to see their family.
So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: You describe that period of time moving frequently as the Lejeune family.
What was the response from your parents when the war began?
Only go to temple when I go to a Bar Mitzvah  somebodys Bar Mitzvah  but I never been -- the only one who was actually religious in my family was my grandfather.
And she said he was on a– they were taking a walk with the family when they ran into an acquaintance  w ho said to them that if they were going to get out it was necessary to go to the U.S. Consulate in Berlin.
He had to choose which of his family should get them.
I I w I went back to the school when I went with my family  and I said  could I look at my record?
Much of our social activity took place at our grandparents  and much of the family met there every  I guess every w-week or second week and for dinner  and some kind of occasion.

So at that point we had lo st all hope of getting my father's family  which was still in the ghetto  out.
Do-Dont forget please that in the 1920s and 30s  fathers were absolute rulers in the family.
Well  first thing I told her was that where where I had come from  and I told her that I lost my family and I still didnt know where th ey were or what happened to them  which is something previously that I had tried all the time.
And when she came  she brought all of it so that we could write to our family and tell them who we are and where we ar e. So I said to my sister  \ Nina\  . . .

So all of a sudden  my family was in one country again  for 20 years or so we were in three different countries.
Did you have friends or acquaintances that you got to know who were non-Jewish at the time  or were you mainly moving in -- in the circle of your family?
>> Bill Benson: Which was before the Germans arrived just outside of the city.
Thank you very  very much Mrs. Gabis for agreeing to speak with us today with for agreeing to share your story  your experiences  and in this way help us understand how the awful things that happened during World War II and the Holocaust occurred  how it affected ordinary people.
Tell me -- before you -- before you got sent over  did you have an opportunity to say good-bye to your family?
Did you -- and so you -- you did certainly identify with being Jewish?
Ive forgotten the name of the family that was sheltering you right at the end of the war.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 6 My hopes -- we were not a well-to-do family  but I went to a private school and I remember it was -- Hebrew was taken and then the Polish language.
>> Bill Benson: Steve  you said to me that your family was highly ass imilated.
And you were communicating with your parents back in Germany .
>> Bill Benson: What did you find when you went back home?
And he introduced me to the family that I am going to live with them and I and their mothers sisters daughter who died so they are to take care of me and I come from another town.
My mother and then there was another family there  you know.
I was thinking family that is something what is not breakable.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
And at least I knew enough I was Jewish  you know.
>> Bill Benson: Why -- do you have any thoughts as to why the other villagers  maybe out of their own fears  wouldn't have denounced you or denounced the family?
Every city I guess got the same thing  and they  they remained a little portion  they make a little ghetto for those t-people  and they done you know work  tailoring or was some sewing was  so  so they took me out to remain so that and my  and my family and the parents  they just went straight to Treblinka.
10 Spitfire (Polish) 9 It sounds though like a very unified family.
Meanwh ile  I had made one trip to Luxembourg on a special assignment to go back a nd see if I could locate any of my family.
He left a note and then killed himself and his family and left a note about Treblinka.
When did you actually rea lize that your other family members had been killed?
And uh his friends were...we had a very close relations with one family.
The whole family  my grandmothers children  they were born all there  but my grandmother was actually from a place  Zam Plain   its called  from Slovakia.
Maybe the whole family in a room  one or two rooms.

And they never had  really  a young life  because they had to work  and bring up a family  a nd everything else.
So  since this accident  there was a bad tension between us  between the family and me.
Interview with Doriane Kurz May 13  1997 Well  I'm Dorian Kurz and I came to this country in 1946  after the war  with my brother  we were orphaned during the war and we were brought over here to America by family that was living here and the first part of my history was recorded by the Holocaust Museum a few years ago.
She married July 4 th to a very nice guy and then she had a baby in 1942 and that baby was put in  in with hundreds of other  I dont know how many hundred  shuffled from one family to the next  her name is Betty  after her brother.
I got 58 pages  copies of letters between this man and my family which were donated to the Holocaust Museum in London  and we got the copies  because -- >> Bill Benson: Within the last few months?
You mentioned when you were talking earlier  about your family member who went back to Stadbush.
So  I think even before 39  part of the family m-moved to Palestine  at that time  you know  Israel was not existing -- Right. --
Did that give you a different feeling of relatedness in terms of family?
I cried  and I did not cry again until my family and I saw the Wallenberg movie.
So I said  \ I'm going away  there is  got left from the war  from the family\ .
Ive also noticed and  and again I dont know if this is related at all to the Holocaust or this is just your family  but it seems like theres an extraordinary number of people in your close family who are in caring professions like medicine  nursing ... Yeah.
There will never be a perfect world  there isnt a perfect family.
And then our stamps  our food stamps had J ude  Jew  stamped all through the food stamps  and if I went to a butcher shop with my food stamps -- I did all the shopping for the family because my mother worked.
And I had asked her  as soon as I got off the streetcar  I said  ﬁPlease call my family immediately.ﬂ ﬁOh  its 11:30 at night.ﬂ I said  ﬁPlease  call immediately.ﬂ USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 31 And she did and my aunt came the next morn ing to pick me up.
We -- my time was shared between the opulent homes of my mothers family on the hills above Buda  and the rather modest apartments where tw o of my fathers sisters lived with -- 26 In Pest? --

We were thinking of going to the forest and hide but we are a big family  I had younger sisters and my mother and so on.
What efforts did your family make after the war to try and find survivors?
You know  I was fifteen when the war ended  and I regret this very much  but outside my family  my family is the only one   and there are only two members living in my family and they are the only ones.
And then at that farm you had to work very hard  but a pparently you had meals at the table with the family  the food was plentiful  the food was good.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  very soon after  you were forced into a ghetto.
First of all we were thrown out from our flat  and we had to share a flat with another family.
At what point was the family completely reunited and stayed that way?
We didnt find anyone  and he was also -- he was from a family of six children  he was the only on e. So everyone looked for -- not finding a relative  everybody looked for companionship  for someone to lean on.
And some of those families were in a camp  but in -- n-not of the same camp.
In the Danish community  by the way  was influenced by the Danish patricians  the Danish officials went on telling us  don't be afraid  we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the Jews this is what you call   this would be cause for war and then we would resign and the Germans would have to run the country.
So  no  we -- you know  like every day  I would take my mother someplace else and we would just go and look  you know  and I remember the whole family one day  we went to Marseilles.
Well  in the summer of 46  his lawyer  Dr. Zeidel came to our family and said  Mrs. Frank   there is no chance.

We wanted to start off with what your family life was like before the war.
The moment the family would hide a child  the rations would be taken away  so not only the child didn't have the rations  but the family wouldn't have the rations.

There were k ids that had to take care of 11 years old and their family.
Yesterday I came here to show my family they I have grandchildren.

Had you talked about your Holocaust experience with -- with very many people in -- in America?
03:36:55 This family photo of my grandpar ents on my father's side and thei r 13 children were taken probably in the late '20s  early '30s.

The first time this ha ppened  my mother realized this could happen again so she started rationing our own family.
I mean  she was ; yes  second husband  and second family.

Yeah  I think I was maybe eight or nine years old  where I saw for the first time  brown shirts and I saw a man who was frequently drunk and would abuse his family and nobody liked him very much  he became somewhat of a lieutenant or something like that with the SA and the first remarks of my father  saying something like  we don't got the kind of pigs that they recruit  something like that.
Can you tell us what happened to you  and to your family once the military operations started in June 1941  the military operation done by Romanians and Germans against Soviet Union?

When did you find out details of what happened to your parents?
But we make a good living and we are very happy.
And came over Swedish people -- Jewish people -- and they looked around  maybe they can find families or something like that.
Now as soon as something like that came through we had to go somewhere  or they would  we would hear that all men over sixteen would have to go to workcamps and so in that family my brother was over sixteen and two more were over sixteen years old so they would...we had to do something.

But then the Russians said that if you are Polish you have to go back to Poland.
Right... What became of your mother's sister and brother and their children?
I assume that there were Jewish families  but that it was not a predominately Jewish . . .
I remained with this family for about another two  three weeks and they came an order from the Germans that from each family somebody has to go to work in the fields or somebody to collect potatoes or other -- you know you take down from the fields.

And thats all whenever we get together  we ask about family first  th e second word is about the Holocaust.
Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you?

Wh-Wha -- was your family afraid that you would be labeled rich afterwards?
Would you be so kind to tell us few words about the life of your family and your life during your school years?
My mother was a Jewish person  my father was a German.

We were always afraid if something  somebody discovered the older people  the older members of the family can withstand the torture of  of the authorities  but the others were not trusted with that  but when we come there  my  T----  my older brother says  \ Thi s must be Auschwitz or Birkenau  what we heard on radio.\
Every member of that community of my city is that was murdered by the Nazis  including my family  is listed in this book.
And the reason  I think  why I do not discuss it with my family  I mean  you know  really sitting down and talk about it  although my children did watch the tape  is because A  I know my husband went through his share of experiences  like starvation  you know.
And he said to me  you know  th-the Quakers highly recommend you and your family.

We were put in a one -room -- one room with several families in other rooms.

My mother and I would go into town to Maastricht where she was born and where my family used to live and we would go  maybe we would go shopping.
She..it seemed that after my last visit...the last time I had seen her when I was in the orphanage  she...the whole family  uh  was taken to  uh  to concentration camp and  uh  they were all exterminated except her.
So you moved in with the Debrackelaer family and you would live with them until Belgium was liberated by the allies in September 1944.
They didn't go upstairs because he was good enough not to say don't kill me but go upstairs there's a Jewish family.
They b oarded with a family and it was expensive but we were happy for them to go.

Well  I had four sisters  two brothers  and my mother and father.
>> Bill Benson: Although your parents were able to keep you hidden  for the family to remain together under these conditions that became even more improbable in the summer of 1944 when the Nazis decided it was time they were going to liquidate the ghetto.
And especially on my dads part  because I believe that all his life  he lived with the guilt that he left and he lost his family there.
My sister -- and my family was in Rasha for turf  but they went out in September wh en the -- it was very hot.
Two of my uncles returned  but of all the family  thats all.
But when we interviewed the family  the fa rmers -- after the war  they said  you know  all of us were scared and you never knew if your neighbor was going to denounce you.
And we were housed  we were taken by an American family who had very good inten tions but the man was a manic depressive so you could never figure out for one second to another how he would react to you.

I did discuss  after my sister Judy had come to see me  before she moved to Lawrence   and told me the stories of sitting around the table with the family  that  number one  my father and his new family had come to the States   which I had not known  and that they when they would occasionally get together  they would say how nice it was  how wonderful it was that all the family were together  except for Mama and Bela .
Part of the family ha s assimilated  and part of them remains Jewish  part of them became quite wealthy business people and part of them were rabbis.
And oh  well or I wanted architect ure or interior design  and my expert family in America  of course  interior design  in America nobody uses that.
So does that mean that you have contact with these Germans?
We some of my family did  but Hannah and I got practically nothing.
No  my family also belonged to that synagogue in the Oranienburger Strasse which wasnt exactly -- which wasn't Orthodox at all  nor was it Liberal.
Having survived myself  I wanted to do that for my family and anybody else I could possibly do it for.
Whoever have a a relatives in uh United States or or Canada so so ask for signed papers  so then you wait and you get them  but uh see I wrote uh to home because uh many people go to Poland...(pause)...especially like a big family because there was not so good in a in a one room  whole family in a wooden camp  so they went to back to Poland and they write to us back uh you better try and go some other...find another country because Poland is now occupied by Russia and different government  but it's different situation.
I had an older brother  who was eight years older  and a sister who was two years younger.
Well  I dont know  but we thought  the family thought that he was baptized  he was baptized  I think and didnt want that they find out that he is a Jew.
Very nice  brought clothing and candy and treated us  and -- very nice  and told us about the family linkage s  and all of that  and so it was either total stranger -- we knew th e name of the famil y  the -- these -- okay.
In our group was my grandparents  my other grandmother  three aunts and three children.
>> Bill Benson: With your father losing his business  how was the family able to make ends meet  to be able to put food on the table?
Do you and lets talk a little bit about your fathers side of the family.
Many happy photographs of the family coming together  going to the park  trying to go on with normal lives.
End of Tape #1 7 Tape #2 So when the Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't --when I saw we  I'm talking about the family.
Im just telling the story of my family  and every single blood relative of mine was saved.
How did you -- how did you live at that time?
94 Have you thought about what sorts of long term impact these experiences have had on your life  had on the way youve lived it  you raised your kids  or just on your personality?
But my husband had testing more more possibility to use out after when he made for our family  for the father and the mother...passport they didn't get...only shutzpass  the other part from the family.
So I said to her  ﬁWhy did you say this to him?ﬂ And she said   ﬁWell  you know your fathers family.ﬂ And I dont know anything about my fa-fathe rs family.
How did you get to the ghetto  what did you take with you?
Maria Austria was there  who became my foot -- photography teacher after the war and who also took many of the very beautiful pictures of our family at the time.
And from there we left nac we left that little village and we went back to Marseilles  because we wanted to get back to Belgium to find out what happened to the re st of our family.
It was not as \  dangerous\  as Poland where Germans and Nazis were all over the place but the family who took care of me had to be very  very careful because any day  you know  there were Germans and French police looking for resistance fighters  Jews who had escaped.
Your ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 mom  grandparents  you're trying to manage.
In our group was my grandparents  my other grandmother  three aunts and three children.
But yes  I did have my values I took from my family  and all these things that til this day  all the things that we worked for  like Jewish education  because it was very important in our family.
So could you tell me where you were born  when you were born?
Three days later they were sent to Auschwitz and my aunt and my youngest cousin died three days later and my uncle we don't know  and that whole family was was wiped out.
Like I said  I dont know if I said it to you  when I go to weddings  or Bar Mitzvahs or places  and I see the people go into a family picture.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 4 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Tell me about it.
>> Edna Friedberg: He was lost to your family all those years.
So tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
Uh Harry didn't like this at all because in these unsettled times he was afraid that people would steal whatever little he had left  but uh reluctantly he uh evacuated the family to a cousin of of his wife's.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
So when you go  ju st make sure the door is locked.ﬂ Nothing important of -- I find out the following day that they will sitting until late in the night  tolnote that the Polish captain who came wa s a scion of a rabbinical family  and the British officer was a scion of a rabbinical family.
It was was always very difficult for me to to divorce husband  because you know  I I was doing everything possible to keep th e family.
I -- I -- I dont think I could answer th at  because w-we were a close family  you know?
So I'm going to ask a few questions about your child hood  your family life  and then we'll go from there  and we'll explore all of those issues that relate to your experiences.
But I know there was all the family felt pretty badly about that.
And we I was told that she came from some very aristocratic family.
I have made errors that in retrospect that if I had a kindly older person to consult or advise me le t alone having the kinship and the warmth of the family.
Every one of us had family a nd they advised us that we shouldnt go back to Poland.
My fathers family I traced back to about 1789  and my mothers family  I would say the 1850s.
So that was another Jewish family when my sister already had two friends  gi rl friends  Jewish girl friends.
I was with my family on deck  whic h was much better than being in the ships hold.
Here was my mother  my grandmother  and then my aunt and uncle.
Tell us  when did you learn what happened to your parents?
I met my cousins  my ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 aunts  uncles.
And then there were other things  a few more  I dont know exactly what  so they separated from -- but its very close  its only that -- you know  the [indecipherable] and we have been very lucky  because our fe -- our royal family are Christians and they are always members of the Reformed church.
My mother used to correspond with cousins who were here in New York.
And then she's asked then they do ask her some questions about herself  and she says where she's from  she lost her whole family  she's all alone  she's now 15  16  she's been to 17 concentration camps  when she was released she went to a city  she developed typhus fever there and she gradually worked her way west to camp Fohrenwald  and then she sings some more.
Technical conversation] This is a picture family picture I s hould say  but my grandparents  my paternal grandparents are on this picture.
And -- yeah  she was -- sh-she -- and actually her family was wonderful.
And how aware were you of what was happening in the rest of Germany at this time?
Were there other compromises that you had to make raising a family and working in this country?
The theresien -- Theresienstadt family camp -- No  no  no  no  no  Im talking about the Birkenau camp.
The Germans already being in Bulgarian the unease -- especially of our family -- of having to confront German soldiers daily from early morning.
And my father realized  as time was going by  that there was no way in which he could get his family to the U.S. within the time timeframe left.
But my grandmother  that is my father's mother whose name was - well I should say that my father's father's name was Avraham Rozenblit - and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit  after whom I'm named  Marsha - Masha  his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the family.
In ghetto they gave him a Jewish name  uh a Mr.   and after that he left by train back to his family.
His parents  Max and Mar ja  emigrated from Poland shortly after World War I. This photo shows Harry's mother's family around 1914 in Widawa  Poland.
But they -- when they took your wife's family  how did that come about?
He said  ﬁAnd this time its not for the family  its just for you.ﬂ And I was happy as possible.
After the German army invaded Poland in 1939  Nesse's family heard stories about relatives from their relatives in Lodz  the second biggest city in Poland at the time  hearing that Jews were horribly tre ated or killed.
But by the way  I want to come back to the ghetto where there was a family that the man who was also a Judenrat.
The -- the Jewish family had then to go to Rus how  to the ghetto.
And at that time we had to  my father and I had to go back to the lumber yard to sleep.
So the family had eno ugh money left for a downpayment on a farm.
>> Bill Benson: And then  of course  10 months later  September 1  1939  Germany invades Poland  launching World War II.
This uh privilege was also given to the whole family  uh that is for my mother and also for my grandparents  who who came to live with us uh in the mid-forties  probably in '43 and uh that's when they left Trenin and came to Martin to live with us  because it was safer for them to stay with the breadwinner who was actually exempt.
And  um -- By the time we got to the railroad station we were already thirsty and were begging for water  and the friends of ours sister and her family were in that same (inaudible) who was -- who had diabetes and we had seen her without food there going through all the worst way you can see somebody slowly dying.
And how aware were you of what was happening in the rest of Germany at this time?
Where were you when you first heard about the German invasion of Poland?
They brought their children back then  it was allowed  which was  I think  a very nice  humanitarian gesture  b ecause Switzerland  who had the same problem  did not allow family members to follow.
My family  my father was still working as a ta ilor and there was not much different than it was before.
Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19  2013 6 What about your mothers family?
During my fathers trip finally to the United States to try to find affidavits for the family a nd the affidavit being to guarantee that whoever comes over will not be on welfare  and would be supported for a year  he fou -- he sent my father to Philadelphia to check the grates records.
my father and mother worked very very hard in order to provide a decent standard of living to the family and give their children the best possible education.
It is your And Edgar s very straight  hes got a nice family  and hes a grandfather  and he was never that way.
But Did you know what was happening in the rest of Europe  what Hitler  what the Germans were doing in the rest of Europe?
So as I said  we were hidden by a protestant family a Communist couple  and then Catholic boarding schools.
And one boy who was very important in this regard  whose family was in India .
Were you in touch with the family that had -- y-your foster family in Belgium at all after the war? [
For a period of time your family was able to avoid being deported.
But she wanted to go to Israel  so my father went to Israel.
And did your mother have relatives that were nearby  that you knew?
There was -- not they didnt talk because they were -- they didnt ha-ha -- crimes they didnt want to  it was too painful to them to talk about it  because its -- its -- its very hard  you know  God forbid if people lose a whole  entire family.
You talked a little bit a bout your relationship with your mothers family and I was interested in hearing your relationship with your fathers family.
In fact I cant remember my family ever talking about Japan.
My cous ins  aunts  uncles  my mother's sister that was in the big ghetto they didn't have much more.
Again I want to go back to ask you abou t th-the fact that your family did not leave in 1938  when th-they had made preparations to es cape.
And if you remember your history well  that was the time that Hitler came to power  in 1933.
It would be very dangerous  not only to the teacher but to our family and to everybody else and that what had happened was early in the morning when all these people were calling in saying that the Polish Jews were being rounded up and this family was rounded and this family was rounded up  my father somehow thought of this teacher and was able to contact him before they arrived at his house and had said that he could hide in the basement.
I was the youngest  and I was the youngest that came out.
So we were  by now we were my grandmother  my aunt  my cousin  and I  four of us in one room.
So  we suddenly were a very odd family in that village.
It wasnt a long conversation but it was enough so that he got an almost full picture of filling in gaps of things that we had only heard about or read about or listened to on the radio and now his worst nightmare come true as far as our personal family was concerned.
He did a lot for her and for her sister and some of the family.
10 Okay  so -- So the family planned to [indecipherable] our situation  and what wa -- was happening -- what happened was that my mother and two older brothers  Erik and Josef -- Aron and Josef  they went to one location  my sister to another  a nd my brother and myself to another.
And the rest of the family  everybody ended up in England   except your father.
Even what I can tell you something about the -- how I -- how I lived with my friend  the Jewish people  yes  because as I mentioned to you  my father  and my mother came from the small town  especially later  I was very much more attached to the family of my mother  especially that my godfather was Jusef Meeta  was a soldier of the Pilsudski army  a regular soldier.
This is tape number three  side A. You were telling me that your father - before we get back to the -- the chronology -- Mm-hm. --
And were you able to stay with your family  your cousins?
So Id like you to tell me when you were born  your date of birth  where you were born  and your name at birth.
And I'd like to get an understanding of how it made sense to you why the Germans were doing what they were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 33 doing.
21 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: So how long was your distant cousin able to do this?
That sounds like it must have been nice  that to have your  you know  a larger family  even though you had moved.
And he told my mother  my family  before the revolution was fairly well-off.
No  but it turns out– his name is Meyer and it turns out that  that–that his father  that this Meyer  who was our sponsor  that his family and our family come together in the seventeen hundreds with a family connection named Budenweiser  which led me to think they actually identified someone who was very distantly related.
And at 2 that time we had gone back  we had gone  I wouldn't say back exactl y  my mom did go back  but we went with my mom to Romania because my family or iginated from there  and that was the last time I saw my grandfather  my grandmother and many of my aunts and uncles.
Lets maybe talk about something that is more joyful for the moment  and thats the family of your -- your daughter.
My father...uh...was a very educated man  and uh...he had a factory of...uh...uniforms...uh...sort of like...sol...for soldiers or like...uh...boy scout uniforms also and like preparatory ...uh...school uniforms...uh...and...uh...we were slightly upper middle class family  basically fairly well-to- do.
Yeah  we had we talked about that  but he hes the only one in the family that went oh no-none of the othe r boys went.
Yes  family hous es of miners  and in so was a very light  a very small light...of light.
Do you remember your parents talking about politics or talking about the Nazis in the household?
And Rosh Hashanah came and always the -- the husband brought home stray people from the synagogue to have holidays with -- with the family.
Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 32 October 8  2010 Do you have memories of what it wa s like the day your mother and younger brother  when you decided to brea k up as a family and she left?
You described for me the time for you and your family in Czechoslovakia before World War II and before the Holocaust as a time of hard work  but also a good life  one in which you said there was a sense of safety.
And I met his family and his mother wondered about me I think but accepted me.
And I've taken both her daughters in as -- put them into my family.
That was an apartment maybe of three  four rooms  but there were three or four families in the apartment.
Of all your family members who would credit as being your single biggest source as to what happened to your family in Germany and then outside of Ge rmany?
As a father  this is a very painful uh experience  of knowing you have a family that's starving the hunger  even so that you yourself are starving  but this does not enter your mind  you're always worried about the kids and your wife.
And  finally  they found these pictures  and this is the way I really remember my family.
>> Bill Benson : You would live under those circumstances until the fall of 1942 when then you were forced into a ghetto in Drohobycz.
5 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: And where you lived?
A nd this was a family that they had two children  a 56 six year old  and a baby.
And because people were asking  but its a cute story that it happened in New York with whole family  with my wifes -- it was an aunt  her mothers sister  that we were invited for dinner there.
And were you born into a large family or a small one?
Uh  we lost half of our family uh during that selection.
But anyway  your family had a large farm and your father -- there were hunting grounds as well [indecipherable] Oh yes  yes.
And it is a mistake  a big mistake to raise a family.
I think the expectations of a rabbi aren't real and the rabbi's family equally -- you're supposed to be a role model and be perfect and so if we did go to the synagogue and so forth it was expected that we behave especially well and be a model.
And my fathers sister was there  my fathers sister  my aunt.
And now I am coming to the very  very special situation  and we -- our family  and Jewish people.
My grandmother and my grandfather  they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.
Again my family wouldnt think of running; not only mine  the majority didnt think of anything.
He y-y you know  hes he has a Masters in history  b-besides his other de gree  and hes  you know  very much in into history  al-also family history.
I had problems my family was all over  until I was able to bring my sister over from South America in the family  which they came in 1962 to this country.
One of the family members had a vineyard in Nagyvarad  and I stayed there in a vineyard most of the summer.
Ok and when they left had your mother been living with your fathers family in Germany or was it  they living on their own.
She write ever -- couple times a month  and she said  you know  certain ladies say hello to you and wish you the very best  and -- and theyre thinking of you and theyre so happy th at you -- you -- you -- you have a good life with your family  and -- and that you got a good husband and a good children and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 60everything is worked out go od  you know.
There wasn't a family that was not mourning a death of a son or a father or a brother that was either killed or executed or deported to the concentration camp.
My father was already here at the time Tell me a little bit about your family background.
And they were willing to help them get out  but only if he -- if they both converted and didn't ever acknowledge their Jewish family any more  which they did.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VER BATIM RECORD 10 Most of these people were  as I mentioned  illegals.
My father even told him   I have known you since you were a little boy  known your family for all of these years  can't you do something about forgetting that order to evacuate us?
The ideal of universal Bildung  which I learned  so to speak  with the milk of my mo ther -- in the family  it was deeply working on me.
First  let's begin with you telling us about your family  your community and yourself in the years before the war  then what happened when Germany attacked Poland.
Can you tell us now what happened to you when the war broke out?
And all my grandmothers sisters  who were living there too when she was a child  all their children were all born in Budapest.
Not extremely close  but definitely friendly with them  theyre come -- we go to each others family occasions.
The oldest daughter in that family  Giza  whom we saw in the photo  was actually 15 years older than my mother and was sort of a surrogate mother which  of course  made me be almost a surrogate grandchild.
I remember it very well  how I felt when I saw I was going to be separated from my family at that point.
And I know now that if anything had happened to my mother  that this family would have kept me.
Tell us about the ghetto  what that was like for you.
How did he keep the family My father my father had a store in Bratislava   which was imported material for suit and mens and ladies clothing Textiles  uh-huh.
In Stankievicz  my family  meaning the Bielski brothers  who were my first cousins  they were born also in Stankievicz.
My father  my mother  my sister  myself  and I think my grandfather.
>> Bill Benson: Your parents didn't get a last chance to see you  you are with the Madna family.
Do you not think it's important to talk to your family about you're experiences?
So  Im sure I think that I had some of those mixed feelings and wasnt  I was younger th en  that interested particularly in trying to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 41 41dig up a lot of Jewish history.
If you are working as a militia man  your chances of holding on to your family are much better.\
And do you know how many brothers and sisters he had?
My fathers family  of which Ill talk later  they were really newcomers to nobility  meaning they were mor -- they were n obilized in 1657  while my mothers family goes back to -- to Charlemagne  documented.
Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 80 Did your parents eventually find out what happened to various family members?
Mrs. Shor   Im wondering if we can start by telling me your name at birth  and the names of your parents a nd siblings  and approximate dates of birth of the family.
I went away from there  and I never wanted to go to my house where I was born and raised and I lost the family.
So -- He wrote to my mother that he's the only one who survived of the whole family  that they were all gone.
Did you have quite a bit of relatives  cousins  aunts  uncles  grandparents?
Your ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 mom  grandparents  you're trying to manage.
>> Irene Weiss: Yes   my father  mother  and six children.
Now you need to know the third sister  my sister  the third sister.
It was an ap artment  not really  th e apartment she lived in  she shared with another family so there was not even a wall between the two apartments.
>> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And your family in the United States moved from Cleveland to Dayton  I believe.
He went to th e ghetto  and...uh...an d...the only way I hear d from him was the day when I was in Juliana's house in another room with...uh...with the Blachowicz family which lives in Israel.
Some of them did go east  but my family decided to stay.
She has a son Ste phen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited Mitchell and I here last year  and he continued to operate the restaurant and we still lived in that house the whole family together.
He was  my husband was the only one fr om the whole family that he was helping and trying to bring over here that showed any interest in  in his  in being a professional man.
After that lager that you were in in Halline for four years  what happened to you and your family after that?
They were a very cultured family  and it was through them that I was exposed to classical music and paintings.
He was a Yemenite  from a very  very wealthy family in Aden who usually sent their childre n to Switzerland  but he needed to live in the highlands because of his health.
While we meaning my--my parents and two more brothers  myself slept in one room in the other room.
She was making money  and she was helping the whole family.
Physical therapy  I was a very good therapist and but the trouble with physical therapy is you are involved in the whole family.
Take your family and go to America and he didnt follow this.
But I had somebody  I know that somebody in my family was alive in that time.
>> Bill Benson: But the bribe took everything you had to do that.
but otherwise  everything was just -- But no serious illnesse s in the family -- No  no  no. --
The other thing I wanted to ask you about your family background: Was your family very conscious of being Jewish?
So I thought better let her think that I am dead  and I turned back and went to these people where I was staying  only family of my brothe r-in-law.
Also  there was my uncle  my fathers brother  who was also with us  his wife and two little children  four year and six year.
Well  your family had a very difficult time in those early years right after the war.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your mother and father .
I had one of my uncles  my mothers brother  that was the only man in the family  who was never married because my grandmother was 35 years ol d when she was a widow and left with five children.
According to a distant relative who married my grandmother a nd comes from Warsaw  a fellow named Max Muskowitz  told me th at our family originates in Spain.
And she said that  you know  because my father was such a marvelous boss for decades for her and she also considered herself as a friend of the family  that she would do anything to save my life.
And we said  we want to go to Poland to look for the family.
Tell me a little bit about your father  your mother  and any siblings you might have had.
But for the first time I met my family in Switzerland   any of my family.
And because we there was no one other Jewish family that lived Interview with Fred Lorber December 2  2011 29in our apartment building  who left very early  they were very close friends from my parents.
What was I mean  what was your f was her family a farm family back in Poland ?
We found a wonderful sublet apartment in Washington and became very  very friendly with the lady who sublet it to us and her family.
My family come to Auschwitz  they came in 1944 from ghetto and uh  that's the last time I saw them.
As a matter of fact  they kept certain things for us  like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned our valuables after the war because I also ha d - we also had friends  they were also teachers  that we left some clothes and st uff like this  and when we came back  they wouldnt give us anything.
>> Bill Benson: Did he or your mother -- do you know if they had any idea where he was going?
And there was in my wife and our family  and my son also.
Tell us what you can about the circumstances for you and your family once the war began and then about your father being conscripted into the Labor Battalion.
You could only survive  either you had somebody in the family  like a sister  or you made yourself or you became a friend with somebody and that one looked out for each other  you looked out for each other and that -- they were like two brothers.
And as I said to you before  wh en my father sent somebody to convince me to go back  and I said to you that I had boundless faith in the wisdom of my father  sitting here just now  I also believe that I was afraid  especially that I came from a family that was a wealthy family  that I would end up in Siberia.
So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those children  there was one woman special  and she is in -- in the book th -- what they wrote  ﬁMy Hundred Children.ﬂ She collected chil -- she lost all her family  so she collected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee  and they were on -- they had that [indecipherable]  but she didnt had wa -- what -- how to feed them.
Very soon after we were lined up  I got  I did get back together with the family  and we were put on the road  marching.
Tell me a little bit about your family and your town.
But I know a lot more about the family than than she does.
I dont remember about Jewish holidays  if we observe or not.
And was there a long history -- you said you did not have other family in the area  so how did your immediate family wind up in Kavala?
My sister and I immediately left th e farm house and we walked back on foot  back to the ghetto to see if somebody from the family survived.
My mother first hears that he is sick in a telegram from the family saying that he is dying  in early 1941  before America is in the war.
Um  it just so happens that uh my husband had uh  my fiance had identification card because he was there legally  and uh  in Budapest  but uh  anyway  I had this everything  we had everything worked out ahead of time  and then when the conductor came I was  I was uh just praying silently that uh  he shouldn't think  she shouldn't u  uh  he shouldn't recognize that I  that I am Jewish  but uh all he was looking was at this paper  and gave a very satisfied uh you know a wink and uh  and then I knew that that I have made it  and he also did not uh bother my husband  just asked for the tickets and he saw us reading these papers  and this is how we reached  we reached ------------- before it uh  before it started slowing down  slowing down  we both jumped  first I jumped  then  then he jumped  and uh  I fell but it was grassy there so it was  we made it and we came uh back and my family of course was uh ecstatic but uh unfortunately not for too long.
Did your family have to turn in any jewelry  any valuables?
You were 15 - 16 years old at the time of Kristallnacht.
I mean  s he was a young person and just working for the royal family was really something very special.
One was a family Leiberbaur   who was like a manager  the right arm of this German who was in char ge of this lumber yard  and another was a young boy  maybe nineteen years old  who was managing the outside.
Tell us what that involved  what your parents were able to do to keep you from being deported during that period.
And my family -- and we -- we received a room on the property of the sof-house  and again it was sort of like a circle for various functions.
I dont remember much about them  I think they were very quiet affairs but -- but we had the family there and we made a little -- and we tried to make a little party for them and I think they were very  very happy.
For instance  we could not take out more than 500 crowns a week  per family  from our own accounts.
But right now what I want to get a sense of is just who you r family the names of the people  a little bit about your pa rents and so on.
When did your story when did you star t becoming interested in the story of your early years and your family?
Q. Had your family in Switzerland heard anything about the camps  about the deportations?
And my father said  \ I'm not going to leave my family behind and  and go anywhere.ﬂ He didn't go.
Then  Im sitting and watching the news and it was David Brinkley and John Chancellor  talking about a group -- I mean  I love news -- about a group of people that congregated themselves in front of a home that an African American family had moved into that home.
>> Whenever you're in the Holocaust  did you and your family have to wear like stickers saying that y'all were Jews or nametag saying that you were Jews or no?

But luckily we had family here  so my mother wrote to them in the United States saying that I needed streptomycin if they could possibly get it for me.
At that time you just didnt pick up and take your whole family.
From what you know after your father was taken and before your mother was also caught in a German roundup  before she went somehow she was able to arrange for you and your sister to be hidden with this French Catholic family.
And his family was very nice  and he was the only son.

My mother married into that family  that wa s a zo -- the -- they are -- that was old nobility around Lake Constance  and very Catholic  so she had to agree that in case my half sister was born as a boy that he had to be brought up Catholic  which is  I think  a very brutal decision to split a family that way.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 29 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: before the Germans came.
All right  l et s talk a little bit about your family.
And I came back after three weeks with a very intellectual family  which I relished.
So that was totally lost  you know  all the family photographs  any kind of personal belongings  mementos  whatever  what you will.
And we did certain  you know  the holidays  of course  we were always together at my grandmother's and my aunt  my mother's sist er from Breslau  came to Katowice and we were always a happy family.
And so in my fathers case  he received  while he was in Russia  so-called care packages  and -- from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 3 the Winter family.
My mother really come from a wer now its a suburb  it used to be a village by Krakow and my fathers family came from Italy  I think  during the Renaissance times.
I do know that some some of my cousins  my husbands family  his they seem to have had a lot of contact with their cousins  which I didnt because I was in Vienna until I was five  so I until I was five I certainly dont remember any other children.
So my mother came and picked me up and we went to Guilford  the last place where we lived  where she and I got -- she got a lovely job with this -- with the best family in the world.
My my grandmother like I says  my mothers family and her brothers were soldiers.
I had always told him  I will meet your family only if you can guarantee me that they were okay.
10 >> Bill Benson: So the rest -- your mom  dad  and baby brother.
>> [Laughter] >> Bill Benson: Soon after   Germany tur ned on the Soviet Union in June 1941  German troops occupied Drohobycz and life for Jews then changed dramatically and tragically.
I used to help a little bit because I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it home instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit.
This little immigrant family in Sparta nburg  South Carolina had one of the very first automatic washing machines in 1941.
And I remember that  you know  before before the  I guess ghetto  and an d the destruction of the Jews  our family doctors were Jewish.
So my mo -- my father decided it was better for him  and for us  for the family  to move to Friedberg where his parents had a home.
7 Tell us  tell us what happened at liberation...what was it like and what did you and your family do?
She came from a family from a village not too far from Kowel.
Are you -- are you religious now  or have -- di-did you raise your children Jewish?
Yes  he came from a large family  and curiously  considering what I mentioned earlier  as just an observation  my father was very angry at his father  because he his his mother was pregnant all the tim e  and he had a a large number of siblings.
And if they would find  the whole family  including small children  would be killed.
You said that you were very happy Oh it was unbelievable With your family there for about a year.
And my dad was in those days we had a very musical family.
So there was never anyone until I got married  and I did marry into a very large family  and I found that very  very comforting  because my children always had cousins and friends and and the whole thing.
I really dont know  but there were hundreds of families  but I do not know the exact number.
Looking back  how do you think that the family atmosphere  and your fathers outlook on life influenced your personality  and your thinking?
And a lot of them I think had left the camp.
And that's when I was told that I was not to say that we were in hiding  that we were friends of the family.
I did not mention at great length  that in the forests there were also family camps.
Did you have a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins?
I says  ﬁI am not sure of nothing  but I hope it will be all right.ﬂ And he said  I said  ﬁLook  my aunt knows his aunt and they know the family  so I hope it will be all right.ﬂ And he called up from Uzhorod  he called Uzhorod and he called up the senators.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
You had to give it away to his family and so on before leaving Germany.
My mother  Bella Lakeman  her maiden name  then Stoliar when she married my father and then she remarried in Paris and her family name then was Tomashin.
So they sent us  if you had to and my f-father had someone in Bratislava  in the capital  a family who he used to make some a little business before the war.
Marcel and his family returned to Paris in May 1944  and Allied Forces liberated Paris on August 25  1944  which was also Marcel's birthday.
But of course there were some Polish families there that my parents knew.
While we were with the Galops family  my mother had taught me how to read and write already so I knew how to read and write.
Various members of the family came and were to be given this priority arrangement.
Shes barely one year old  and the picture apparently was taken at the same time with the initial picture when the family went to the only photographer in town  because the -- the parents  Chaya and Ushar decided to leave the country  109 so they made pictures.
In 1942  members of Marcel's family  including his father  whom we see here  were deported to concentration camps where they w ere murdered.
And I said yes I would but I would need ask my family.
But when I f-found when I got in touch with the family  cause I had the number  everything was w ith number  I first the first thing I spoke to to Andrew.
And did your family didnt wasnt very religious  but did you realize you realized that it was anti-Semitic at the time.
My father  I went along with my father to a synagogue but it wasnt the same place we usually went.
Well  I think this had the the very positive effect of creating this extremely close-knit family.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 >> Bill Benson: But relative to that.
But anyway  thats thats the kind of relationship we we had  in taking so he was good to the family.
And they couldnt help me from my family co uldnt help me.
What did it mean  in your household and your family  to be Jewish?
Now  prior to 1939  what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and Germany?
Like one family Mr. Kacherofsky  he was the principal of the elementary school.
And who looks at those or Researchers or people  family members who would like to hear the interview.
The year ends in June or so and then in June I traveled to North Wales to stay with friends of the family I never heard of  but they somehow-- Were friends of the family?
During this time  did you continue to observe Jewish holidays  the Sabbath?
I was with a church group and they sponsored a Jewish uh  family that came over  and I remember this this family...very brilliant people  and uh  wonderful people and they uh  they were Jewish.
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 39 So you rent your family rented cars out and used them as taxis to make money?
So  I said they shaved my head and I have to go and find my family.
>> Bill Benson: Jill  while you're at your aunt's house in Cologne  tell us where your father had gone.
And so you and your family stayed together in the car?
Well actually and again my aunt  my cousin but my aunt was one of those wonderful well educated  wonderful person who had absolute her idea of how she was to treat me and accept me in her family.
But basically in 19...for two years we lived as school children and we lived without our parents and we lived with fear and I can remember saying to one of the other girls  the daughter of the family  I said I have a very big secret but I can't tell you until the war is over. (
We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family  to see Grandmother  and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you  in Germany  are complaining about anti-Semitis m. You dont know what its like in Poland.
Its a ya you know  you dont know from on e day to the next whether your home will be destroyed  you see  so i-it its more or less everybodys looking out f-for them for first of all to for their own family  rather than look out for what happens to some kid here or there  you see.
And this is where I said we had one room per family  plus a kitchen.
The DP camp was in Maastricht and there of course we had had a business and my mother knew people from the earlier days and even though the the conditions in the DP camp were very ba d and we were treated more like prisoners  locked in and so on  nevertheless we had these connections and they came to see us and my mother was able immediately to notify our family in America and in Palestine of the fact that we were alive and to and to ask for their help  and the communications that I  that my mother wrote uh in those days and in the weeks following that she wrote to my family in America and in Palestine  those letters with all her recollections are in my possession and many of the documents that uh uh we have from from the tim es we were being returned after the war are in my possession  and uh the uh eventually uh the Dutch people took care of their of the Dutch citizens who were brought back to Holland.
And I thought I would like to get in touch with a family what had a private place  because it's nicer to live...live with a family there in a home.
And then later  nothing was impossible for me  because the family allowed me for a lot of things.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 >> Bill Benson: With your sister.
Now  when your father died  were you living with your parents?
And we stayed with my relatives for a few days or maybe longer.
I had a sister   19 years old  a little brother 12  and a little sister 8.
I was very close to my aunt as my mother was very close  they were very  very close friends.
He was primarily Germanic because his family had m oved from Paris to the Saar Basin  at the time that Saar was still a part of France.
Did he ever talk with the family about the things he had to do  the trials he went through?
When I was in Florence at some point in time  I went to Kos  and I stayed in Kos for three months to try to see if there was something that was still there– my family.
And ther e is a family here  Shatzkin  who adopted her.
And o on my mothers side  there was my mother  a sister and two brothers  and his mother her mother  as well.
And my father was a station -- gas station owner in Oslo  I -- my mother was Mar gda Lear  and all that  was a big family  and so they all believed me  then Swedish state [indecipher able] security police  a nd I got out  but then I put the name Gunnar Lear  that means in E nglish  you know its Gunnar Liar.
So we were  by now we were my grandmother  my aunt  my cousin  and I  four of us in one room.
So by night they smuggled me out of the convent  me and the three other Jewish children  and took me back to Brussels  where I was born  and they placed me with a Christian family.
There were a few  I remember there was a Polish  couple of Polish Jews.
The best thing that I decided which was really against my family was to go to the Hebrew College.
They took her in because they know the family and my father and Leshno went in the night time so both the farmers know from each other.
So they just are assigned several people  or one family  or two families to one room  and its Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 92 And thats it it just started up like that.
My wife and I in front and our four children  Gregory  Peter  Carol and Laura and their spouses  and my son-in-law Ithzaks family in the back row.
Now  did you go to synagogue when you re at grandfathers?
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
I joined those three children as the fourth member of the family.
But you you and your family expected the war to be over so you could leave  I gather  right?
The pogroms started in and the day Regina came back she went to her town  and she went up to her apartment and knocked at the door to find out if some of her family may have come back.
So they said you can go back to United States but your family has to stay behind because we can't issue visas anymore for your family.
I lived in the city of Czstochowa  and I'm walking up to this Polish-allegedly Polish--family who was...where I was staying with this Polish family.
Did your parents talk about what happened to them  or to people they knew  or Yes.
This -- What I -- what I want to know though  is about your family life.
Your family  you  your t -- your brother  si ster  mother and father left Germany in January of 33.
And then Where did you get food and things like that?
Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the Ghetto.
We finally realized that they tried to be family to us and we integrated (couldnt hear) into the family.
>> Bill Benson: Because your father is gone by this time?
My mother came from a more religious home than my father.
And then we [indecipherable] by this 31 Italian family like I mentioned befo re that helped us eventually  we even -- Italian -- they -- you know  this was the war.
Oh  ma my friend  they they digged her ho a hole under the house  a beautiful house  and the f whole family wanted to hide from the Germans in the war.
But now  her family was Orthodox  and over time I guess I sort of swung in that direction  as a result.
Tell me a little bit about your family  when you were growing up.
But I saw some photograph when I was doing  I was doing a history of the family.
Oh thats no problem because this time in Warsaw mostly the gold was valuable thing and you can buy and sell and something like this  you know  and it was in my family  we was not poor people  you know  and that was one  and I never saw the girl again  she was killed or sent to concentration camp.
It's a privilege to have you here as our First Person and also to see that we have your family here right in the front row.
And my whole family is being h idden in the ghetto inside of Warsaw.\
But I -- perhaps for my family I was too -- too many days away.
Their most particular character trait was kindness and fondness for the family  and that was felt in every step in their contact with us.
Jewish school  religious Jewish school where they had all the Rabbis?
And the Lithuanian family that moved into the apartment before the war  she was very good to me.
I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters  and my mother had two brothers and a sister.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ETA HECHT page 17 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: because this was a colleague of my father's and he knew exactly where I was but I  I think what happened his  he felt in case this picture would be found by Germans  that of course they would be able to locate me and also I realized  I got very emotional when I found this picture because I realize how hopeless the situation must have been that my parents felt that they wouldn't survive and so whoever would find this should send it to my uncle so that he could you know find me and take care of me. (
But the OSE people  when they took us out  their prime mission was since they could not reunit e us with our family was to make sure that we were -- reconnect us with our Judaism.
It was  of course  not known to anyone that this creature was working for the Nazis and that he had...he offered to deliver to the Germans this stone which he knew my father had in exchange for some further time saved from being transported for himsel f and his family.
Before we talk about the war and the Holocaust and what happened to your family during the war  tell us about your family before the war  what you can about them.
>> Bill Benson: Your parents would have three children  and you were the youngest.
At that point when my mother knew there was going to be an uprising  she made arrangeme nts for my sister and myself to be taken out of the ghetto and taken by the Poles  one family was called Doblinkov (?)
Well that was just unheard of in my family of going to college  you see.
yeah  difficult  difficult to go [indecipherable] searching for pe ople  for my family  survivors of the family.
Tell us what you recall and what you know about the events of that terrible night and what happened that ni ght for your family.
Did they live with you or was it just you and your parents?
I didn't even know one before the war in a Jewish family which was traditional but not very relig ious.
Her mother is of a family that claims to have been brought by Titus in his triumph  in 70 Common Era.
I have here family  some have moved away  they went to retirement places.
So he say okay  tomorrow morning he is going to be out  have his family from Zabno  from my hometo wn come  Im gonna give them papers so they can go in there to Italian border  and then clandestine over the mountain crossing with Italy  you couldnt just legally cross to Italy  because thats already 41.
This was our -- we have no family in this country.
So what -- now what year are talking -- what month and what year are we talking about that he came to your family and to the synagogue and offered this?
Q. Do you remember about how long you were in the Ghetto for?
But no  Ana gave me a batch that I have to put down the whole family history because they are making family trees  and for me  for my husband  for my husbands sisters and everything  in the school.
Did you have other friends or other neighbors who were not Jewish?
But Im sure hes not more alive and I dont know if he had family.
What I did  I used to help my family  wherever I had to my fa mily.
My family paid $600.00 under the table to get me this apartment.
And from there we went to the ho -- my mothers sister and her family.
What do you see as the is there a thread between the family that you were born into  and the family that you created  that you see it got passed down?
By then I knew that my parents and brother are not alive but I hoped that someone else  some other people of my family.
We were assigned this one room  and there were three other families with us to share that one room.
Were you  for any period of time in a DP camp?
Now  my mother's parents also lived in Poland but all of my mother's sisters lived in Germany.
After two months in being home  not doing nothing  my other hospital Felix Horn 72 [Date not labeled] Page 72 in the found out and I am one of the founders  the Holy Family Hospital in Desplains .
Can you please tell us when and where you were born?
There was only two black families  my family and another family.
And what you can tell us about your family and their community  what their life was like before the war?
It sounds like you family was very involved in business in [indecipherable] [indecipherable] yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah it was.
How did she get this connection  was it through her family?
Were you trying to get in touch with your parents  with your family  or was there no way No way  no way.
But in one way  you know  I was glad finally to see with my own eyes and h ear what happened to the family.
He ha d relatives in England who were on the stage  and they were in theater  and they were nice family.
Happened so in the be ginning we got pieces of bread  but we had to divide the bread between the not workers from our family.
And on the way back she told the family that was living in the small apartment in the back  the Runjaks family  she asked them to take care of us.
I mean  how did all of a sudden your family get together again?
No  I dont have much in common with the -- with the people of the 20 th of July  just a few ma -- family members.
Did -- do you remember having conversations with your parents  were your parents telling you were trying to go to -- Oh yes. --
I didnt know what happened with my father  with my sister  with all other relatives.
And  for example  the family who rented the first apartment for my sister and several apartments  a nd then that other lady give her her apartment.
There were all kinds of family th ere  a big to-do.
We were taken in by Jews that surv ived and all the survivors became like a family.
My parents  my father could not make any business anymore  and I got involved to help out my family.
It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me.
And  uh  I have received good nourishment from my...m y family.
And Mrs. Maun was an outspoken lady  but very strong also and together they -- they ruled this family and I felt some structure  real structure there.
My mother with my father and all three of my sisters  the beginning  and my brother.
And there was a family who they got killed  and about many as we  and the same age.
And today he is alive with all his family and with grandchildren and so on and my family is in ashes.
But my family and my mo ther  father  and my sister  we moved together with other family  Blywise and Himmelstein to one of these little houses.
And I fell asleep with my head falling on the plate.
And he was always at sea  and a lot of our family were seafarers.
And  had your father been a soldier in World War I?
So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a death penalty on his head was hiding  by in a Jewish family.
Before 1939  what did you know about Hitler or Nazis where you lived?
And their son and dau -- two daughters  also were in England  s -- and my uncle  their son  they lived in Newcastle on Thames and in -- immediately at the end of the war  they began making inquiries about our family and found out th at the children had survived.
Also even in the Jewish ghetto so there was some normal life  family life.
I know a family  no -- were -- we re connected with them through the marriage  and they lived in Lithuanian  and his wife was very energet -- his mother was very energetic and she saved a lot of kids  giving them to the Lith uanian family.
We had families  we had parents  we had grandparents  great grandparents.
And they had a rule that children  or teenagers or whatever  family members may be reunited for a period of three days every six weeks.
Although she explained a lot about the family to me which we found out was pretty reliable what she told me.
My father lived in Germany 19 years  my mother 14 years  but they hadn't become Germans.
And I ha ve a picture of that someplace  in a family album.
Do you remember your family talking about what was happening or whether there was anything for you to do  or whether it would come to your town  these kind of problems?
And  but I never denied my Jewi shness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion  I say I am a Jew but Im not Jewish.
A. Yes  there are many unpleasant memories that would trigger me but I would never relay that to my family.
There were three sisters all together  both younger than my mother.
One morning  I went out again to be  to be wait  to look for the opportunity to be captured and taken to units outside the ghetto that I would be able to bring in some food.
So  of your family of six  only your brother in Israel -- Yeah. --
So  from that side of the family  my Aunt Kaita  my -- hers -- my fathers sister married somebody -- they lived in Posen  and Posen -- I used to know the Polish name of it -- but in Posen -- Posen also kept changing from Germany to Poland  from ger -- and it -- they moved each time  they stayed in Germany.
And incidentally  I used to send every month I was able to send two packages  and I used to send to my relatives in in in Kovno   his family.
His family  you know  his family was good and woul d have accept y -- anything and was happy that he was alive and there and all that.
And when you went home  did you ha ve friends outside of your family?
Uh  what...what...what else was your family doing during these years of occupation?
Can you tell us now what happened to you when the war broke out?
Also  when I was separated from my sister with the Doblenkov family  this was petrifying thought for me that I would be a Pole the rest of my life with a family I dont even know.
Well  here you feel very Austrian and and youre told then you your family says youre going to be leavi ng.
And I often its not that I berate myself  but I wa I wonder now about the relative insensitivity of our whole fa my whole family .
Your father might have still had family in Russia or any concern there might have been in the family for Jews in general or specific people that you knew?
And you know at that time you didn't ask why when an officer told you  so he took the family and they walked to the house of the officer and he said you stay here.
Did your did your parents say anything about that to you?
And of c ourse  I was notified that this is it  that we would be going to Israel and I bid fare well to my family and got an instrument case  boarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionis t members  the ones who were in my group  and we started toward the Czecho slovakian border.
We kne w...at that time we already figured out what has happened to my family.
And also  while you were with the second family in in meeting other people in their town  did you sense any difficulties cause you were Jewish?
END OF TAPE but then he said I'm very hesitant to do this  but I see that you ar e interested in this  that you're into what happened to your family  that you went in sear ch of your family after the war.
What did your parents tell you ab out what the Germans were doing?
But somehow we were put in that line  and my father somehow had his decorations from first world -- from the first world one with him  and I dont know by what miracle he convinced one of the men to let us go  our family and the other family.
And she wasnt there at the time  her sister-in-law was there  and she asked me  ﬁHow does your wife like it when you are travel from col -- from Pittsburgh to Ohio  and you are at home only over a weekend?ﬂ I says  ﬁIm single.ﬂ So then they introduced me to the single girl in the family  and thats how it happened.
On my fathers side of the family  a few siblings survived  half of them.
So for those nine months that she was ill  we were most of time living with the family Roos in Rainin on the dike and I therefore am not really  I  there's not a w hole lot I can say about Amsterdam and what happened to it.
I-I had -- my school friends were Jewish  but I had also -- we had a lot around.
And a you were you close to your cousins  and aunts and uncles?
>> Bill Benson: So she had to move home with t he family?
Lots of family  but again  there was no visible signs of depression on his part.
I stayed with women who knew me  who knew the family  and looked after me up to such time as Krysia and Hania joined me.
One thing was that it was the feeling like bearing witness to be ther e  established the fact that it really happened to me and to my family and to my people.

Were your parents fairly wealthy at this time  so they could afford this?
Now these are all Holocaust connected  history connected to our family  that we were quite free to share  and to -- and to talk about  and to inform  and to update constantly.

So I walked out with a new name  with four pem -- pr -- family plots  no job.

However  I had very little luck helping my family - my parents.
And so you got together with cousins and aunts and uncles?
So they had to live on moneys that my family had smuggled out the day I was born.
And they're very loving and very devoted to the family  my parents.
They 41 didn't want to stay in--because my mother saw all those dead people  you know  when she walked in the street for her--this street  her brother  who was no longer there  her sister  her brother-in-law  her nephew  I mean  she only saw ghosts and she had a lot of people of her family that were killed so she didn' t want to stay and my sisters  who had done such a beautiful job in the Je wish army  had become very Zi onistic and so they went to Israel and they stayed there.
So  did you and your husband try to get to the United States ?
Of course  we had no after the war we had so little  and we  as a family  had more.
What Im interested in is that -- the -- sort of the -- what -- what your family was like.

And my father and all the men in the family didn't show up in Cologne.
no -- no  it wasnt -- just somehow -- I -- I could compare because th -- I-I adopted a family in the neighborhood.
I had relatives there  an uncle  brother of my mother  and cousins.
But my mother came from a reli religious family  but an -and we were relatively religious.
We lived in an apartment with one room and one kitchen ; th at's all   a two -room a partment.
Maybe we would have all been better off going to Haiti as a family.
I was the only one that spoke Yiddish  so to speak.
My family  uh... Well  I mean  they were glad that I did.
>> Bill Benson: Manya  eventually you would be forced  with your family  into a ghetto.

So again you were the only small -- Small -- -- child.
She had she had a couple brothers  as two sisters  I think there were five in the family.

Interview with Erika Tamar December 18  2015 32 I wa I was I was with family.
When the war broke out  the first day in 1939...as soon as the war broke out  the second day we had trucks that my father took the family  us and my uncle and another twenty people...whoever wanted to go...and we run away from Kielce to the Russian border to get away and I remember that my grandmother...t his I saw with my own eyes...took out  at that time she had twenty thousand .
Now  my family -- that's an interesting question  had left already.
I just loved the farm because I was with a private family who had a daughter who was  I would say  about 3 or 4 years older than I and  uh  they had the grandmother live there and this was really... My fondest recollections  you know  of the war was really the happiest there  was just a big farm  and it was just really wonderful except that now I became a Protestant.
>> Bill Benson: Until that time when the mass deportations began in the summer of 1942  you continued to live with your family in their apartment during that time.
The other family  my mother  my father suffer very much  and my biggest brothers  they have -- when you say you have no to eat.
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
And that they would want me very much in the family.
But I know my grand on my on my fathers side  my grandparents came from Poland Im just [indecipherable] my mothers family came from France   and my in -laws came from Poland .
And your mother  did she have brothers and sist She had she the brother  and a sister.
Do you know what kind of work your father was doing then?
Where is that land -- what happened to that land in the family?
But that's why my brother also remembered it and made sure that in case someone of the family is alive  we should try to go.
The vengeance is I have a family  my wife is Jewish.
The first ghetto in the city was that very  very just Jewish area  so my father had a friend who had a house nearby that some eight families went to live with that family.
And apparently th ats where my family comes from  because my Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinz a  which is Esperanza for -- for a young girl.
ﬁWe dont need an Eastern Eu ropean Jew in the family  and we dont need somebody from the camps.ﬂ The irony of that re mark was that all the other cousins married Eastern European Jews  but many years later.
So the -- otherwise  my parents were members of the Jewish community.
Well  unfortunately my pare nts  you know -- I come from a very Orthodox family  Jewish Orthodox family and my parents we re divorced and my mother left me with my father and my 2 grandparents.
Staying there under the S  Salsitz  a guy USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 20in lumberjacket comes -- approaches me again  and asks me if I know a family sal -- Salishitz  hes supposed to come.
My sister  she was a little older than me  like two and a half years older.
But when the man  Mr. Chiandafelis heard the word Agrinion   he became very excited  because he told us that his daughter Theandafela was working for a family in Agrinion  the family of Davaroukas.
Uh life was no normal  but we were still a family.
When did you become interested in re searching your own st ory and really piecing together your family history?
And that -- that was true for each of the three families that you were with  you said?
How did your wife -- or did she -- educ ate the children about the Holocaust?
Tell us what that time was like for you and your community and your family when you were under Russian occupation.
My mother was placed as a governess with a family near the Eiffel Tower  actually.
And there were Jewish families in every -- all the little villages around it.
He knew  he -- he knew the sa -- a-and -- and the -- the tales he -- but his knowledge of it was limited to his own family expe rience.
Did you tell your children about your story  about what you went through?
My mother  my father and I and my mother's younger sister.
To think that my family they are taken so what makes the decision for me to go further  was this movement by the eye  a wink to the eye of my mother  that mother  Bluma Levin  born in Wigoda.
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
My bosss wife fed me lunc h  and had a satchel for me to take back to the family.
And a you were you close to your cousins  and aunts and uncles?
Now  was this because your family was a -- And he was -- When he lived in Berkeley  he sold shoes in San Francisco at the major shoe store in San Francisco  I can't remember the name of it.
Now  we knew that we had a part of family in Palestine.
When the results of the plebiscite were announced in 32  and they announced that Hitler had won  what was the immediate reaction in your family?
But this is why so many people were displaced during the and my family was one of those  on my fathers side.
What happens to you and your family as all this is happening?
So his he had family here and they werent too nice to me but I frankly didnt realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the Americanization school.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VER BATIM RECORD 21 My mother was very reluctant  because she had her mother and three aunts living in the same place.
Did you know about  or did your family talk about  wh at was happening in Germany prior to 1939?
She shes a very beautiful person  and I think that she wanted to pay respect to to the family that perished.
While my parents were both actu ally highly educated and very intellectual  the family of Margaret and her parents  family Haas   were on the other hand -- I mean Mr. Haas was a -- a tailor and designer of wome n's clothes and -- and actually had owned a factory be -- until the Nazis took it away from him.
And if you can tell us about where you were born.
So -- And this aunt and uncle of mine  their family  they were so cl ose  you ask me about my parents  how close they were and I couldnt tell you  but I can tell you about this aunt and uncle.
There was a camp in Ba tik  the outskirts of Batik  that the children in the camp can get out and be kept by a family  you know.
They walled in a section of town and my family had to move in.
Well  let me tell you about this aspect of the family.
The area b-by the slava -- where my pa -- p -- fathers family was from  became  after the Nazis occupied Czechoslovak  the Czech part  Bohemia and Mulravia  that Slovakian pa rt became inde -- sort of independent  but it wa -- he was a Nazi  he collaborated with th-the Nazis.
And eventually there was a family  a whole family was -- survived and the farmers saved them.
And to plan a mass murder on that scal e and carry it out is -- is totally mind boggling and so -- and -- and then another thing is that the fate of my immediate family is -- I'm -- I'm trying to picture my father  even on the -- on th e de -- on the deportation train.
And she was a very beautiful child and different from the other children in my family.
Store downstairs  the wife upstairs and close-knit family and I -- in f act  I have a song Las Tias  the aunts  all about my aunts  because every day  every holiday was a different aunts house.
Some people were sent to what was known -- oh  some people to San Vittory prison  something  somebody sent to remote area in Italy  where 4 these people who were intellectual  writer  artis t  doctor or lawyer  could not see the family  except maybe once a year  twice a year  I cant re member correctly.
And thats goi ng to be to ask you your when you were born  the date you we re born  what was your family like  and well take it from there.
Was your Jewish identity very important to you at that point?
You mentioned very briefly that your meeting with your second family was awkward when you were an adult when you went back to France.
But you feel that you have friends that are like a family to you?
He was very upset because he left -- he lost his father.
I dont remember my mothers family as well as my fathers.
A total of seven brothers and sisters that he had  so I am dealing here on hi s side an extended family.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 25 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: yes.
01:13:34 This is a good chance to go back for a moment to think about your family.
And we also had a history of another family  emigrate d to the United States -- rather  to the 4 colonies in the middle 1700s and were a pretty leading family in Philadelphia.
>> Bill Benson: Julius  in 1935  when you were 6  your family then moved to Palestine.
And he in this Falticeni  a very rich  local Jewish family gives us this shelter because they son found us  and he considered that this is honor to do this  and duty.
He was worrying so much about that uh family of his  so that Kuczbara-who...you know  who knew almost everybody  uh...especially in in uh...in the area of...in the hospital area.... Because he also was a dentist--although he told me he never was a dentist--but he was pulling the teeth in...he  he he was acting as a dentist in...in the camp.
So  I lived with one family  and and she was very mean to us  so we moved out and we lived with anothe r family  and then finally we got our own apartment.
When did you find out about your parents  your mother and father?
Also  I used to go and buy food for the family  and few people knew me.
No  we were c -- a close family  we were close to the mother and father and we had a very -- a very nice fam -- life ma -- life.
She gave me pictures that she carried with her  pictures of the family  I suppose  hoping that I'll just look at them and keep my mouth shut.
Could you tell me something about your family  and growing up?
And he wrote many articles in the -- their papers and in their -- in their journals and magazines and that was the interesting thing about that side also  of the family  how very artistic -- how very internationally artistic they were.
Do you know much about your mother's family  what they did?
Do you recall when you--did you have direct contact with your parents at some point while you were in there?
technical interruption] Before we go into school  I wanted to dwell a little bit more about your family.
Was one house where one Jewish family  and  and we went to that where there were more Jews and we went and we stayed in there.
Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
I said -- my cousin said 31 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD who I was.
The next morning  after I had said I wanted to go live an Orthodox family -- Mm. --
Only my father knows the all others  and one day he take a cab  two cabs  and they take all the family with another Jewish family to the mountains.
A. Of course  that's obvious that you don't have any family you're on your own and that's something that any person who is by himself he tries to seek a new family.
That is to say uh I I got to know and meet one from each side of the family.
And my mother was the oldest of six girls  and one son.
He stayed in the Soviet Union and this must be a -- from this same family and he was wearing elegant white shirt USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 35 -- clean  white shirt and shiny boots  with military  navy pants and he used to walk -- see - - and now we had to -- it was in the Steppests  you know  the flat land.
They had you know  thick walls and thick and they  right away they separated this lady from her family.
And -- Wa -Was this the four of you  or more of your extended family?
It was a get together with some friends and mainly members of the family.
And I looked if my father or my mother -- my family is there.
So of course my mother had told us a lot about her family there and my Uncle Elias  her  her  her brother and his children  one of whom was close in age to Freddy and me.
And they have written to their friends  their family in Lithuania   telling them  well  we saw Poronus and his family here in in United States .
We found ourselves close to a family and they say well they are going to the Russian part too  and they have a maid who lives not far from the Russian border.
Before the war I used to act  and for Jewish people acting on the stage was like a disgrace for a family.
She was  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 what  4  5 years old.
Did you have any religious training with your with your aunts family?
Did your family ever think of leaving Germany  even if -- Im talking about before Kristallnacht.
I have two daughters  I have three granddaughters and three grandsons.
Uh...It's that kind of heroism and unselfishness that you want to  you know  to hold on to one's family whatever was...was left.
The wife came from a German-speaking family in Prague  a ve ry bright  very nice woman.
I'm curious about the D ebrackelaer family and have you kept in touch?
Did anybody else live with you or was it just you  your mother  and your brother and sister and father?
And when we registered there in the camp and eventually through the Jewish Agency  people came and helped you Nesse Godin 21 December 14  1995 Page 21 to go to wherever you had family.
And somehow we got to Brooklyn where the family had set up an apartment sort of like a  like a railroad flat.
Nothing about the past  that I was raised by a period of my life with a Christian family or that I had a birth mom.
How about  tell us about your mother and your father  where they lived   you know about.
It was for me  for a child it wasnt so bad that for them  but I could f-feel th-the tension that was going on in the family.
At one point  my family  the husband of the wife brought up a girl and she had a document  she had dark hair  she looked like a typical Jewish girl  and he started to interrogate her and she had the paper and the seal was like of a penny  or a dime  and he started to question her and he took her away to the Gestapo  and he interrogated her in front of me.
I was glued to the radio and listened to Italian news because that -- I could get Milano on my radio and I was translating from the Italian  which was so close to my Latin  which I knew then very well  to the family what the rest is talking about.
06:04:30 Every letter was micro; what was happening to me  family  whos this  that  so on.
My mother with my father and all three of my sisters  the beginning  and my brother.
And few of them came my adopted mother  her name is Badana   the the her family had the school and kindergar garten in Hebrew  in Lodz.
Can you tell me a little bit about your parents  when you were growing up?
I have kept in touch with one family in the village.
Nothing much  I had -- my family was very big in Bialystok  I had a lot of young cousins.
A fe w times they took us  they had to as -- they ask us to -- each family had to give a certain amount of work a week.
I was working in the middle of the city  and I saw  you know  a a a truck going there  you know  an open truck  and I saw  you kn ow  the family we knew  who was my fathers  really  superior for a time.
So if you turned in a Jewish family  you might stand to gain some of their wealth?
So every picture that you saw on a tape or later if we have a chance Ill show them to you there on display  my family room.
Well apparently while my father did know of course where I was  I was with this Christian family who was a colleague of his from before the war but he was obviously afraid to write it down because he thought if  in case someone would find  a German would find this picture they would know where I was hidden.
So my father used to come to this camp  pick me up  bring me into the partisans.
I was with my father then and my two sisters  my older sister and my younger one.
Let us talk about your parents and how long your family had been in Romania.
Did you uh have any contact with your parents during this time?
And after the war  Horsts father said to his two sons  who were now teenagers  ﬁWe have belongings from a Jewish family  the family Cohn  and Im trying to find them  and if I dont find them  I want you to promise me that you will always look for them  and we have to return these items to that family.ﬂ So I couldnt belie ve what was happening.
Who she was  where she was born  what her name was  what her family was like.
So my mother was extremely upset  for u nderstandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit up and  constantly reminding her that ther e are certain things we cant change and she still has to live for her own little immediate family.
Did your parents talk about what happened to them  or to people they knew  or Yes.
But maybe if everything would be in target down there in my family and my things  I dont know how would it be.
So the whole family lived in Poland and we used to be a very close-kn it family.
The family was composed of my father  mother   four brothers  and myself.
And when we went through and that I really never forget--when we went through  you know  whe we came closer to the German  he was standing like this  you know and he said 'Right  left  right  left' uh so he asked us  is that one family and my dad said yes and he said 'Please  straight ahead.'
This was a rule that came out I believe in late 1941 that the Jewish family cannot -- they started to disperse and there was a time that you could stay with other Polish people but not as a family together.
Litvia or small village  and my father was born in Poland  in Warsaw and had a large family in Warsaw.
Certainly in the early pa rt of this trip  you were in the same car as your parents --?
They had torched their house and his wife and baby had been forced to flee so he had just come  dropped his family off at the priest  and left and later on  he was shot by the Resistance.ﬂ So here were all these...all these people...uh...being with us  but ...uh...you know  when she first knocked on our door and she said  \ Don't be afraid.ﬂ For some reason  I...I was more afraid than I have been so.
No  my mother was Gentile  Protestant  and my father come from a very Orthodox family.
Im glad that  you know  I did go with my mother  cause we did have a loving family here.
They were in Justkowicz   they made I have a cousin who its not a cousin actually  shes part of the family like from grandmothers side.
I visited once  my aunt  and I had other family  my aunt  my second and that was in Vienna and I had all the  two cousins.
But we were sitting and praying and talking between the family  you know.
And we we were watched by Vichy police Were you and we did work early morning til ni evening  but but my mother mentioned there was another family there  a Jewish family w ith also with two children.
Probably my mother didnt want to stay away from her family.
You I were they the only two boys  or were there more children in that family?
And how aware were you about what was happening in the rest of Europe at that time?
The Hungarian soldiers came in and said you had to go  how much notice did your family get?
So what happened was when the war broke out  I told you.
Because I was always tall and heavier than the rest of the family  and she couldn't stand that.
That he was a policeman before the war and he was the only Polish family what lived in this village.
I  uh  my mother used to cook and used to wash  and we ha d dinner together as a family  and we have people over  and all the good things in life.
Now  when your mother was taken away  did you stay in contact with her?
But there was on the one room  six people  my mother  my father  three sisters and I who were the six.
And the woman had family in Marseilles  so so we went she knew she told us  when we get to Marseilles  we can stay by her brother  okay  he lives in Marseilles.
You us ed to see sad scenes out in the street  if you saw somebody sitting on a doorstep crying  you knew something happened to the family.
And did you go to school while you were living with your aunt?
A ctually  there was a vote in the family to keep me there.
Very few were more than us alone  so anybody who had family like two brothers  the Swedes took us alone.
My father then changed his mind and he stayed to take care of the family.
Well  we were talking about  that you talk  you speak about the Holocaust a lot these days.
You -- you spoke about the fact that youre -- in your teenage years  despite all the deprivations  youve -- you felt as if your family was -- despite the hardships  maintaining a semblance of n-normal life with -- Oh yeah. --
And just taking from that and the in the larger experien ce  what in in your your sense  in your spirit  what message would you want to pass on to the younger generation in that kind of Hashkafic message to future generations  what happened to you and your family  what are the if I can put it in that way  what are the lessons from your experience?
That -- the two uncles  my father's two brothers  and two sisters that he had.
And so -- 03:10:16 Do you remember what you talked about when you were at home with your family?
Well  my parents were not rel -- they were Jews  but not fanatical -- not religious.
So as a result of that  education was the most important thing in our family.
So they ran away and ha hid  an d their family was taken and dep brought to the railroad station.
I-It was -- it seems that it was a safe house for at least two Jewish families -- well  one family  one woman  and then a Communist partisan  who happened to turn out to be an important leader?
Now the story goes in my family and I dont Interview with Regine Ginsberg 23 know if  and I dont remember it but they seem to remember that mother told them that she with  some of the jewelry that she had  she either bought off some of th e principal there or the guard there and after seven weeks my father and my brother were released and came back to St. Gaudens.
What do you remember about what happened to you and your family and friends when the war broke out?
And then you know how it is when you  when you enter a new family  there are  if children are especially children who are the same age and Diana and I are three months apart  there are lots of adjustments and accommodations that children have to make and there are  there is lots of power play that goes on and where before Diana was queen in her own castle  except for a two year old sister and you know  there were eight years between her and her sister  she came back from camp to find two siblings of the same age and it was a very rough adjustment and there was a lot of politicking among the three of us as alliances got pushed and pulled.
And I remember very much very well a member of my family in Amsterdam...I think a cousin of my father's...who stood in the open market in a stall and sold underwear and socks.

Can you describe your father's occupation and the type of scho oling and the family life you had before the war?
Uh  can you tell me... You've ta lked a good bit about the relations with your family.

When was the -- where were you for the end of the war?
So  no help from the family  or did your mother help him sometimes?
Mr. Funkin was a very well to do -- a Jewish family from before the war  and you know  Jews could not keep in Petersburg -- this is the capital of -- of Russia unless he was a -- big merchant.
How aware were you  and how interested were you in -- in political situations that were going on in -- in those years  or in broader social and cultural issues  or were you more focused on just trying to build your own life  and your family   or were you kind of aware of some of the -- some of the things like the -- were yo u following the Korean war  and those issues  or -- or the -- the Civil Rights movement as it started up?
My family certainly could not send me to Syracuse  because we didn't have the wherewithall  uh  didn't have anything close to the requirements to go to an away-college.
My uncle died on the way  but my cousin and m y aunt came over.

First of all the whole family got on the train together still?
Thanks to my grandmother  at the time the Jewish people spoke German  the more cultured families wanted expose their children to German at home.
But unlike every interview that we do  where normally I ask and I will be asking this later  I usually ask someone to start at the beginning  where were they born  what was their family like  who were their mother and father and so on.
Thank you very  very much  Mrs. Tobis  for agreeing to speak with us today  and to share your experiences of what happened to you and your family during World War II.
Let me then take my fathers family  and because that deals with this book.
And that was the last time I saw my mother  grandmother and sister.
This is my fifth family  Judee  Rachel and the others who are here.
Did you know anything about your family members at that point?
How did the Nuremburg laws or I guess the Nazi rise to power  how did it affect you and your family at home?
Did you follow the events in Germany in the early 1930s?
And he just couldnt understand why  Interview with Charles Stein June 8  1999 14and then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened to his family and others.
And did you live in a house  or lived in an apartment?
You better do this  or you better but  it was a religious family.
Later on my parents left -- rent a little apartment  like two rooms and kitchen  where we st ay with -- entire family used to stay there  you know just those two rooms.
A family had one room instead of four or fi ve  six  or seven.
So the pressures and the strains  you know  of the family -- and between my father and my mother  they were able to get us over there.
It never warmed up to a level where they were really fine with their family  and so  of course  I was not part of the family there.
Q. Now  at the time the war broke out  were you married  were you working  what were you doing?
The older sister got the birth certificate from another family and her certificate was altered slightly  but she was traveling with this birth certificate  right.
Before you go back to Slutsk  did you learn th en what happened to the rest of your family?
Up until that point  had you heard about what was going on in Germany  did you know who Hitler was?
I have no idea because  as I say  we did not discuss family in my family  politics or Yeah.
You all that I had wanted to become a doctor  to help people  to raise a family.
Did you -- wh-what kind of social standing did your family have in that community  though?
I got permission to go out of the Ghetto and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better.
What kind of tell me a little bit about your mothers family.
What problem did your family have  as a unit  adjusting to life in Cuba?
And he had found one place for the three of us but we nev er wanted to be together because if we were found the whole family would have been destroyed.
Bill Benson: Marcel  in -- I know there's so much more you want to share with us  so let's talk no w about when you were -- you and your family and all the other Jews in Drohobycz were forced into the Drohobycz ghetto.
Look  it means that they should prepare the killing of this whole camp from  the family camp.
Because at that time  I had my people  and I had my family.
However  my feelings  the feelings of my family  were exactly the same.
Then her oldest son  Erich  who was really like a black sheep in the family  not a very good person  and who she didnt like  but he married later.
And he always told me he has family in America .
But again  from what I understa nd  the Germans lost interest in us not long after we disappeared because they had other worries than one Jewish family.
And I remember that I went with my parents to Mosc ow  my father had his family there and m-my uncle made me a present  such a sewing machin e  a childrens sewing machine.
Well  my father from what I know now  I was in that home  my father was in that camp in Saint Jomai  my mother was in (?
My mother's neighbor  one of the neighbors who was Catholic  very religious  very involved in a local church  she talked to these two priests  and they're the ones who really found this woman  this family willing to take in my two sisters.
Tell us about the ghetto and what the conditions were like there in the ghetto for you as you started to describe you were forced into a very tiny space.
Lets get a sense of your -- your family before we ge t into your particular tale.
I hope that you can come back and join us another time.
I think that a -- I mean  thinking back  my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.
When you sat down with somebody  you talked to them about how many members of his family were there?
I was hoping that I am goi ng  when everythings over  Im going to end up staying forever in -- over there  because all the children  you know  the -- they have  the Polish orphans  they didnt have parents  or they have dysfunctional family  or th ey were children they never had any parents.
What would you like your family and friends  or anybody who might be listening to this tape to know about you that they may not already know?
New photo shown] This is the picture of the Gelb family with the kids.
He took him to Warsaw to his family  he saw his family in -- in -- in Warsaw and hes -- when he came back he says  oh  Warsaw is -- is [indecipherable] theres no threat of being killed  you know  like here  we have every day.
Second is that I have an American family  and my wife was ready to return to the United States.
Wha t was that like for you and your family  your mother?
But that basically is the last time I saw my parents.
We always went to their house because he knew how to do it and it was a family situation.
I guess that was the question -- This is a -- -- more like should we  is there something missing that we sort of -- Yeah Interview with Dustin Dezube December 7  2000 23 -- sort of should address in terms of friends  interests  your grandparents  your family.
O nce more this family didnt have a lot of money either.
So then I But you moved to So I I moved to here to New York   and I stayed with my uncle and aunt up in on the in the New York   in Washington Heights .
But that was good because he then  we  as a family  he was getting paid  and we were getting ration cards.
But we remained in Chemnitz  the family  until spring of 1945.
I know that your family was always Zionist oriented  and Mayas family is also very str -- was very strongly Zionist.
I knew th at my immediate  when you say immediate family  doesn't . . .
If his family was prosperous  even if they weren't rich they wouldn't have suffered much.
I me an  this is 60 years ago  it -- So when you -- when they moved into your family  you were in your country home  is that -- No  when they first came to us it was in the winter of 1938  and we were -- we were at home.
Also some of my grandmother's family uh were immigrating to the United States and they came to Holland  so we had families coming through before they boarded the boat in Rotterdam to the United States.
Because if not  they going to kill you  and they going to kill us.ﬂ And when I was in this family  as I remember  it was long enough  because when -- when the Germans was in this place about a half a year .
And a you were you close to your cousins  and aunts and uncles?
And my cousin thought I was a little bit out of my head evidently because that 's what he told his family.
Tell what it was like to be a family arriving in Auschwitz.
His wife was making me some clothes  and I was going to tell them that I came from that village  from the Polish village and I needed to hire myself out because my family was too poor and could they take me in as a cow hand.
I took out my family and the rest of the people.
What should people  grownup people that were hungry and were afraid  talk to a child that was not their family.
I realized you mentioned your sons and we should just clarify a little bit about your family.
My only stand -- I mentioned was the knowledge that I still have family in Palestine at that time.
When I...all of a sudden  I don't know what happened...they ...family Birnberg  family Birnberg.
And then we were at some kind of family gathering and I dont re  family was talking and they asked my Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 72 grandmother something about how her life was in Europe.
She took me to the market to buy pigs and I fell right into this family and I was doing everything together.
Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28  2015 31 Do you remember how your family spent that last summer?
We had quite a large extended family  but they were all in Krakow  in Warsaw.
And -- and the rest of the -- the family  my grandfather was a clockmaker  something Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 8like that  yes  a-and the other wa -- you know  as I mentioned work in my fa-father business  they never make it at the same le vel that my father  in term of revenue  income  etcetera.
However  that didn't really amount to mu...enough money and at this time  at this point  we were living out of the  out in the uh on the uh farm  if you want to call it a farm  but that's really what it was  and uh together with ye t another family  friends of ours  and uh the two families   my parents and these people  Mundle was their name  Feenie and Walter Mundle  uh decide d that they were going to uh wash laundry for Italian uh truck drivers.
Di is that did you get yo ur luggage  your family  were you Yes  yes.
By then  I had lost my association with the family here.
And he was really overjoye d because he had family back here.
What did your parents tell you about their own childhoods and growing up?

Wer do you think the family was trying to pass as non-Jewish?
She had two sets of aunts and uncles  a handful of cousins there.
You said your mother came and got you from the family.
They were  uh  young men who  who were to be conscripted into the German army and they did not want to  uh  join the army because they didn't want to have anything to do with the Germans  so they were also fleeing and they were also in hiding and  uh  they did not...and they were sympathetic to this as well as the other neighbors in the area were sympathetic to the same  uh  to Jews as well as to Protestants as well as to conscientious objectors or people who just didn't sympathize with the Germans  which there many of and it seems to me that my  my memories of this family and my life there were really  uh  very good memories.
She wi she had done all the work before I came  because she had everybodys name   who were all from Germany   but she didnt [break] Okay  so she brought you in  and she showed you items that were pertained to your family.

Everybody was kille d  all my grandparents  my aunts  my cousins  everybody was killed.
My mothers  my mother had  she was the oldest of four children.
They came  they grabbed up my mother's family  which was my grandmot her  my grandfather  two brothers and a sister  and forced them off into the truck.
Did your parents tell you many stories about their own childhoods?

People in my family did  but I didnt  not that I remember.
They took away mine...half of the town  almost the whole town  Jews already to...uh... Poland...Poland  Ukrainian  my father's whol e family.
And so you stayed there  and what did you what did you and your cousins think was happening?
And then the other daughter and her family are near us in the same same same area.
You end up in this little village with this family called the Harrisons.
So I feel that I imparted some good things and it wasn't that bad that they didn't know early on what was happening to their father a nd to their family  their grandfather  their grandmother  and all their relatives.
And also they took in a cousin  my uncle's daughter who was left.
And I remember befriending him and I remember being close with him and I remember again then having to come to America and being uprooted from from him as well  and I don't remember seeing my family  the farm family  at all after that.
He went he stayed with a family in London   wi before  I mean  no.
In the Jewish buildings there was always one family who were Christian  mostly the super  and in this particular building the super was a Mr. Varga.
What was Germany like right after the war for you as a child?
Wa s there any poor treatment of you or your family because you were Jewish?
Would you happen to remember their last name  this aristocratic family?
One of the places that we eventually ended up with that gave us our final hiding place was a Polish  catholic family  they were extremely religious.
I was in retrospect  Im surprised  cause we stayed with this I stayed  you know  with this family that didnt have children.
We have...a part of my mother's family is American...had settled in America...uh...a generation or two ago.
So Id like to know about your f -- your family and your house and all of that.
Also  as I mentioned before  food was rationed in Belgium  and because they were a family of three  mother  father and child  they would pick up food for a week in rations  and I was not listed there  because I was there illegally.
Do you want to tell us about him and how your family knew him?
Now  my husband has a sister and he had a brother who died.
One day when I asked her what would your family do if they would know that you keep Jews?
Do you remember talking about it with your parents or what your feelings were?
I -- there were -- maybe it had something to do because we had family in this country already and we couldn't do any business any more.
And the reason why my mom were not ta -taken and myself  and my sister  we were the three survivors  is because we didnt live in the same place where my grandmothers live and the family.
So  the first thing he did  which he wasn't silly  but he went to to 3 see his family because he came from Vilna.
They were very close to the family  and those there is still in Greece.
And you said to me that 4 for your family -- and this is a quote -- it all began with the exodus from Paris.
Jacob... And he lives now in Stockhol m  I mean  the friend of ours passed away  but this is the whole family.
We didn't know -- >> Bill Benson: Were the Germans really gone ?
Like a I I never thought that I will see someone from my family again  or if they someone will survive  if they will see me.
I want you to tell me the story once more of your  of when your father came into the camp  but I want you to give me a context  I don't want you to say  \ As I Said before \  I want you to say  \ I had been in camps for about 4 years when the transport for 4 years when the transport from Lodz came in  in 1944  my family was on it  and then I want you to tell me that story.
And he was crying a nd I was crying and that was the last time I saw him.
And tell me a little bit about how you remember your family before the war.
One of the the doctors there at one point was Thanos Papatheodoro   a very fine man  whose family also lived in the vicinity.
They claimed that if you take a good boy  from a good family and match him -- match her up with a good girl from a good family  that it has to be success.
Im angry because this happened  and Im angry because Im the only one from my immediate family.
I grew up in in a family where I was loved  and hearing about parents love children.
He was kind of a disappointment and disgr ace within the family because my mothers family was all very aggressive and very well to do.
He couldnt understand why people who were family men with children would want to go home at the end of the day and not come back and work at night or work on Saturdays or work on Sundays.
I mean  what other things sort of color you're experiences  as youre creating you're family?
We stayed in a furnished room during that time ; again  to save anything possible and get ready for a family reunion in October.

JL: Yes  my mother uh--uh was pretty much uh the brain in--in--in the business and in the family.
The wife was sitting over there while he went inside  tortured the two men and executed them  and I could never understand how a 9 person who obviously had tender feelings for his family  who thought that it was a good opportunity to take his wife and children on a Sunday spring outing  would just transition from by just crossing the threshold of the gate and to become a a terri...a terrible torturer and executioner  but these were the things that happened in the camp.

Do you have any memories of this man Hitler in 35  36  37?
And each family had like a bed  and if you had two or three kids  the kids slept in one bed  and the mo ther and father slept in but could have been five  six  eight  10 families in these bar one on one side  hi and a curtain on one side  a m-material curtain blocking at night and another.

Oh  well they -- they must have kept everything as far -- See  he was the only one in his family who immigrated.
I still have it in my old passport when I -- when I left Germany.

Right  right  and my mothers family  one of my uncles was a very prominent physician and another uncle was a banker and -- Uh-huh.
There was this one family that returned  the Weinrebe family  whom I adored and they were Striceks best friends.
My brother Fred conducted audio interviews with the whole family  my father  my mother  myself  my brother Ott  my cousins  my wife.
Then my aunt she was the aunt  my mother's sister  her kids  four of them.
It was a triangle that the family just tolerated becau se the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the husband  everybody  so ther e was even humor then.

SWB: What about looking for your family  other than your sister.
11 Uh uh one of my best friends survived with her whole family which was very unusual.

Your school friends  did they know that your father was Jewish?
And of course we had no knowledge of any family relationship or existence or anything.
17 No  I go to -- well  first I go to Switzerland  cause you see  what happened after 33  the advertising agencies of ours  which were outside Germany  they went with the family  yes  not with the German  but with the family.
My grandparents lived in a small village not far from us.
The brother who was in Belgrade  Yugoslavia and his family was never heard from again  and my father of course died.

Halina  her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifying the family as Catholics.
And  matter of fact  she USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 52 was the only one who wrote -- used to write me almost -- every two  three days  and her fam -- her family did not.
Esther wore this tag attached to her clothing as she traveled from her hometown of Adelsheim  Germany  to Thorpe to join her foster family  the Harrisons.

The four others had family and friends which they went  but they didnt although they were my age  maybe a couple years older  they didnt live long.
My father's side the family came just after the turn of the century from Ukraine  a town called Romney.
Tell me something about your family background  what your parents did?
And there was an-another -- there was another younger brother  my fathers brother that his name was Schloime  and he married a nice woman and they had one daughter  Sabina  very chubby  very beautiful girl  younger than me  and we were playing together  we were hide and seek from one apartment to another  running  you know  everything was open like one big family.

I mean  hes on my fathers side of the family  but when I was there  his hearing was going  his eyesight was going.
So  when you first arrive in London   youre placed with a family  then a hostel  and then eventually Right.

>> [Laughter] >> Bill Benson: Your father was a remarkable man.
But my mother really wanted to go to her side of the family  which was uh in America.

How did you -- you or your family react to tho -- that news?
And what what kinds of things did your family do in the community?
But he a bi -- eve -- be -- gradually  systematically all the family  except the younger brother  is split on the Adriatic coast  he was married to the gen -- he could get out too  28 but she was convinced that she can save him  and he didn't want to leave his wife.
It's not a little town  it was a fairly dece nt sized town  it's ca lled Satoumary in Romanian and the Hungarian name was Satmarnamaty and so we stayed here close to a year again  hoping for somebody from the family to come back and actually one more sister came back  out of eight.
Maybe she 20even said a word or two to the family  but basically she was in such a deep depression that she could not speak to them.
I have to add that my mother had two brothers  and they were also taken to forced labor camps and they never returned  but the early years when uh my father kept coming back and we had the extended family around  they were fairly happy times.
And he told me how I w ill never forget what the Forshan   that's the name of the Jewish family  who survived.

I was determined to find out more about my history and about these people  the De Chot family.
And if your family knew the extent of what was happening in Europe  what was happening to you  what was happening with the Holocaust at that time?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Well  my uncle  my father's sister  of course  and her family  and my grandmother a nd my mother.
But my aunt and their son wound up in Auschwitz  and of course  unfortunately my -- my -- my aunt -- my aunt  she just didnt survive the camp in Auschwitz.
You see  and again  probably subconsciously  when you know that you lost everything  that you have no family  you are trying to forge a friendship with somebody wholl be with you  giving you the feeling that you are not alone.
42 Well  yeah  its just its just you know  ha th-the the horrible feeling inside  you know  I mean here here is the country that destroyed your family  destroyed you know  so but there wasn t much discussion again  you know  and again  what happened is that we came out of Hallein by  I-I I think was trucks  an-and got to another camp close by.
The kitchen was together  but we had two rooms and after the two rooms was the big dining room what separated us.
So  it was a family owned and operated  a closed corporation that all these families lived out of this business.

T here were several -- there were two families in addition to us in the apartment that was only a three -room apartment with one bathroom.
Thats my family and left is Irena  I am the ta llest one.
Nonetheless  as you started to tell us  conditions had been getting worse and worse for Jews even going back to the 1920s.
What was that like  when you knew you were going to be leaving?
And my mother caught my father there  which was very much to the dislike of he r family becaus e my father  they felt  was much below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life.
For the time being they didn't know  but for the last time  their family or their friends  so we exchanged the beds and she went  you know.

And family was very religious  my grandfather in Poland was a Talmudic scholar.
Do -- was there any -- did your father ever consider going to Israel instead of the United States?
And it  it's to me incredible th at a young person today who is now twenty years old would say that when obviously there were many choices and there are many people who did other things and not what this family di d. So my memories  uh  are that I that I led a fairly normal childhood there and and I  uh  helped on the farm.

So there was something there was an identity within your family Yeah.
And I saw I met li a lady who was I was just asking million questions  you know  and just between one sentence and the other  she told me about my family.
So I lived there and Tell me how you met your wife.
I know that my grandfather died I was told  but my grandmother  my uncles  all my aunts and the children and my uncles and the two little girls  Sarah and Rivka.

Since you understand so what it's like to lose family  I think it also gives you an understanding of what it's like to  to have family.

In the fall of 1944  after your family had moved to their final hiding place in the farming village of Oneux -Theux I believe it is.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 14 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: time.
So went another family and she took me in with her husband and she had two boys and she said I Video Tape No.
Ah -- End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.
So this is the place that I come to reflect and be reunited  if you will  with my family.
Well  I oh uh I know  uh  uh  we all were in the ghe tto of Krakow  and by that time I was already married  and the ghetto of Krakow comparing to ghetto of Warsaw was not as terrible when my mother could not stay  when she stayed with us in Krakow during the pre-ghetto days  when ghetto was established  oh  oh even before that uh people who came after September  1939  to Krakow  who were not uh before that then  had to leave the city  and they could choose  uh  any city or town within the gen  gen  general government  which wa s not the Deutshe Reich  the uh German Reich proper  so she chose to go to Warsaw  and for a  uh maybe twice I went to visit her with a special permission.
I mean  mass extermination and we knew that somewhere something was going on  I mean we knew about the shootings in the fields  we knew about the shootings in the forest and I should mention this one  in '43 a Slovak boy appeared in our town  a young boy about barely 12 at that time  I was 14 and rumor had it that he was rescued from Poland  that he was taken from Slovakia  with the whole town  with all the people  together with his family and everything and the way the story was that the Germans tied them together by fours and they fired one shot through the four bodies.
So thats I remained in the ghetto with my family  until the very end when they announced an akcja an akcja mean meant that they were liquidating the ghetto.
Uh  they had started  obvious to me  tried to make inhabitable family quarters.
My grandparents were  on my mothers side  were also in the same town  about half a mile away.
This is my passport from Nazi Germany to the United States.
You keep on repeating over and over again a different name and my family... Your family was able to arrange this?
>> Bill Benson: Do you think your mother and other family members had any idea at that point what would happen next?
That's the whole family came to Lodz to me to beg to me he should be released from prison.
And I ran to our friendly family  where they are  our good friends  they are Polish people and we did a lot of good things for them.
This was a very -- >> Bill Benson: You're going to describe for us their house.
Somehow you take much Barbara Farkas 40 December 9  1995 easier that you are not alone in that terrible situation  losing your family.
Well  a sponsor  that's a guy with a family who is responsible let's say for the Behr family if we came to America from soup to nuts  everything.
You see  we were very close and I wa s the youngest in the family and if I wanted something it was all right with the family.
You know you think they took your family  they took your clothing  one more thing  your gorge ous name.
How long were you with this particular family before you went --?
S-So I remember one time  it was another nice family that I dont know  they di I dont think they wanted to adopt me  but anyways  I sort of ran away from them an-and ended up at the harbor when the agency found me.
And what about your contact over these years  as you got here  with your family?
She had an aunt who and a husband and family  and they went to Paris from Warsaw  and right after the first World War.
So no matter what the physical cost was going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I knew that she was taking a risk and did damage her condition further by bearing me  but that she felt that she lived for a purpose and the purpose was to have a family  and that was me  but there was only just me.
So  I had a good friend  a family friend  and he was blind.
The family left the key so when they come back they open the door again  okay?
But my parents  of course were part of the Jewish community  but we were not Orthodox  we were not -- we were secular.
What it meant - the Germans took away the Jewish businesses  and he was like - he was checking on all those businesses  and among others  he was checking on this family that I was going to.
And my fathers family came and wanted us and I decided not to  which was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.
Those people were well off and they were friends in the synagogue and were always very nice  but we werent– they would  you know  go to Florida  or they would travel  and do things that my family   my parents didnt do  because we couldnt afford it  because they werent interested in it.
And can you tell us a little bit about your mother?
But after he died  a nd my mother remarried  the factory sort of reverted to the rest of the family.
My mother had an extensive family with whom we were very  very close.
And the reason why I protested against having another interview  I think that interview with Joan  I have the tape and the interesting thing is only two -- three parties of my friends have seen it  none of my family.
Did your grandparents live in a neighborhood that was predominantly Jewish?
He was -- he didnt have family  he live in hospital.
And I  therefore  did not want to hear about family camp at all.
And you know  we stayed with his family and all -- that -- that was all wonderful and -- and -- and great  but I think we were more with my part of the family and I think Ive always felt like they were -- they were -- they were surrounding him and telling him and so on.
I had a question about the manager  too  who had been helping out your family.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if that's -- because of that  economics were obviously more difficult  feeding the family  do you know anything about that time?
>> Esther Starobin: My mother had always told Bertle she had to keep the family together.
Everett Arnold  a son of a missionary in Africa  sent there by the Arnold family from North America had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus is  the way of justice  peace and love  which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time.
There was one surviving member of my mothers family  my cousin George   who at that time was Ludzic Saltman  who was interviewed by the museum  and wrote a book  and you know  it its easy to research him.
What were your parents doing in the early part of the ghetto times?
>> Bill Benson: Halina  besides your immediate family  your sister  your mother  your father  did any other relatives survive?
At five o'clock you had to be home and uh the family who came living with us and the gentiles were really nice.
She had her own singing family  which was well known as the Altarac family  the singing Altarac family  five daughters and three sons.
So we -- I mean  family helped each other in those days.
>> Bill Benson: But they were letting the Germans know you were a Jew.
1 And I lived there till the war broke out with my family.
>> Bill Benson: One of your relatives had left Germany in the mid 1930s.
Did you have other friends or other neighbors who were not Jewish?
And Aron and I lived with an Italian family  a Christian family in Rome that took us in as a family.
Well  home was where my parents were  you know  and we had a very strong family bond.
We are going to start  because our time is so limited  so let's start first with your very early years in your family.
They they was afraid  even the Jews  but they didnt know if th we are Russian Jews  so move on to the Russian side  or so they were Interview with Paul Jonas May 3  2013 35 What how did life change for your family?
Not true  because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends  but they were not that close because the children could have been very close and we went to school together and everything was fine  but the parents of that group did not really want their daughters to mix so much with the Jews  so we were not kept very close with them.
I came from a family which was for generations living in the same city in Warsaw.
Our family  when we were still together  promised each other that if one of us would survive  we should try -- at least one -- to shout to all the world  to all the nations  to all the people and to bear witness to what we were going through.
So while I came to the family for help  I didnt get the help I wanted to get.
>> Bill Benson : So you were reunited with your sisters and Josiane in the spring of 1945.
My mother's family  on the other hand  lived in a small town of Ludbreg  which is very far north  very close to the Hungarian border.
Like any other family  they had photographs taken at the ceremony.
But its interesting though  your family - your first family is still close to you in Austin  around -- around the Austin area  isnt that right?
Mother found this family w ho was willing to take me in .
>> Bill Benson: What did the family do to make those plans to be able to get out?
So remember your sister gets  your sister's family gets one half of the estate but since they didn't apply for it nobody gets it unless you're willing  you know  unless you're willing to let them get paid through you and you will agree to pay them which I did.
My father was Hungarian  my mother German  and they went to Vienna  its no secret really  because my fathers family would not have my mother  who was a very pretty young actress  much younger than my father  but extremely pretty  well they would not have her in Hungary  not at -- at his place.
And I married a German woman who's not Jewi sh  and my children grew up Jewish in remembrance of my parents.
It's ju st amazing that we did survive as a family.
She has an how many  I dont know [indecipherable] maybe five five brothers  I think  and she was the only girl.
Of course  my cousin and his family were shot during that time.
Very  very  very a -- from a poor family  what you would call.
But my wife's -- my wife was adopt ed by a Quaker family and grew up as a Quaker and also was treated very well.
I dont know whats happened to his family  I dont know anything.
My husband  who is sitting here  who is related to the Anne Frank family  found out that his grandfather was murdered in Midanak  and we didn't know this  until a couple years ago.
I have a family and these are the -- the new branches of the old tree  you know  its -- Well  lets pick up on some of the more positive achievements  then.
So it was you and your brother in the car  and who else?
What Je wish traditions did you observe in your family while raising your children?
And I asked whether this man who had been involv ed in the arrest of your father  was in Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28  2015 36any way part of this family.
But they left Poland after one year of being in Poland.
>> Bill Benson: After your father  your sister  you and your Aunt Cylli  you all survived  tell us about other members of your family.
Interview with Fred Gutter October 30  1999 56 Her family name is fe -- is Roosevelt.
And I belonged  as a kid   to a Jewish organization.
Do were their were their family roots from Poland They didnt want me to they didnt want me to speak Polish.
And did you have a lot of friends when you were growing up?
Do you know  were your parents members of the Jewish community?
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: We learned by one who lost his family.
Laughter] >> Bill Benson: Of course  you were school age in the ghetto.
I think we comp lemented each other very well this way  but we we re very close to each other and as I say  we were intimate in our relationship and I knew of the losses she suffere d. She knew very much of my family life.
And for the family  you know -- I mean  135 for my father it was devastating.
And -- Thi -- this reminds me of what you said earlier  as a child you worked for your family -- Yeah  right. --
I told him where I was a nd what happened in my family.
And -- and from 30 -- and it was a lovely family affair  and very warm and close.
Only an underground group who was making false identifications and this came through my non -Jewish family of Paul whose sister was married to a resistance fighter who was in prison and tortured and beaten and sent to Dachau and whatever  and we were involved with that group and we were lucky.
And they had a mentally retarded child  so it was not a very ideal si tuation for a newcomer although she was very nice to me and I stayed there for a few months and then eventually  I met a professor 37 of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the University of  Washington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen  Colorado  a house  and he and his family spent every summer there because he was a member of the music festival.
>> Bill Benson: So once Paris was liberated in August of 1944  your father pretty quickly made his way back to Paris and then came back to get the family later.
01:19:20 Tell us a little bit more about your family and its religious beliefs.
A lot of them seem to come from families who were much more educated than my family.
What you do know  or what you have told me is that your grandmother  who was really your grand-aunt  who raised your mother  was someone who loved you and your sist er and your whole family very much.
No  it was terrifying because you always ha d very much -- you worried terribly about your family.
Crying) And then during that time already  we find out that North Transylvania became again Romania.
Were they -- They -- this I remember  I have no idea why all those thing happens  you know  aand the first family didnt even tell me.
And so your father  your uncle  your your aunt  and your brother were there all together.
So no t all of the family lived in what is now -- >> Bill Benson: What is now -- >> George Pick: Geographically in Hungary.
And was a girl from a good family  from a good home; and she did this to us.
So with that -- that armory right behind our house  Momma wrote a note  Christian family with organ and piano  somebody wants to come is welcome  fo r in the evening  reading the papers  or -- and then the two Friesians came  and they late r told that they quick had taken the paper off.
Well  we were always a very closely knit family  my mother and her four siblings.
Always very much in control uh of herself and although my dad was a very very st rong personality  the typical Jewish father  uh the patriarch of of the family  my mother certainly proved that she could run the family during his absence.
My mother with my father and all three of my sisters  the beginning  and my brother.
For instance  a whole family moved into one single room next door to a guy who is making harnesses for horses and so on.
And the father of the family would join you for a m on weekends  and the month that he took vacation.
But that didnt linger  and inst -- and it was s-supplanted by now  in the coming days  youre going to rejoin the family and you will then be able to pursue what youve been hoping to do.
When did you come to terms with the fact that your family had been lost?
After all  the ghetto cut almost in half and every family had somebody ta ken away.
And...uh...I stayed in New York  and then before I was allowed to even go and see my family in Cleveland  I went to...uh...we went to...uh...Washington to give a report.
Tell us what you know about your father's conscription in the labor brigade and what that meant for you r family.
The men  uncles  all the men in my close family went into the woods.
And I thought it was so pretty  my red nails  and she just  oh So the first family didn't allow for your mother to keep you for the holidays  right?
So my family  which means my grandmother  my grandpa  and bunch of cousins  they we re hiding in the barn paying  of course  huge money for it.
I got authorization to stay in Chernowitz with my family and so after three  four weeks  we retu rn to our apartment  wh ich was -- was vandalized and so on  with -- d-during our stay in the ghetto  and we started to live in the ghetto  in the -- in the town.
So  Id like now to talk a little bit about your family.
Not spending like crazy  just ha ve the family  have the friends  and celebrate in the synagogue.
So the apartment was empty because he took the family with him.
They were a protes tant family   a couple with two young daughters.
Okay  because -- Because there was no such thing as a Jewish Boy Scout Okay  okay  and  but at that point your family didn't consider trying to immigrate or -- Yes  my father did.
On the way Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 52already  being freed from the camps  the fa mily who lived with us  their name was also Buch  but we no were no family  the parents died in the sled  both of them  the husband and the wife.
Can you just tell me something about your childhood  your home?
Your did you know anything of your family history  beyond your father and mother and maybe grandparents?
All I know is that when we got off on the train station  we met all the family at the station.
So your grandparents to ld your parents that–.. I think somebody called the house and spoke to my grandfather.
And I loved her almost as much as my father  much more than my mother.
He also told me that his ancestors  or his father  which is actually my grandfather  his father came from Vienna.
And they placed me with a Catholic family  a mother  father  and a little girl.
And although you were too young to be able to tell us firsthand about all that you went through and what life was like in Germany for your family  perhaps we could begin to the extent that you can  give us a sense of your family  your parents  your extended family  what the hometown was like and what their community was like in the years before the war and certainly before you were sent away.
Did you talk to people about your experiences during the war?
I go to the toilet  I dont close the door if its just my family thats in the house -- not when there ar e other people  because I dont like closed doors.
And he knew my family and he must have liked my mother and he...uh...decided to save us though his family  his wife and his children didn't...was...was against it.
And went to Leer and all of those small towns where my grandmother came from and her family came from .
But your brother and sister were older than you  or Yes  I was the youngest in the family  but I had a child the first.
So  of course  each and every family was a ssessed with some contribution in order to create the funds that were demanded.
Do you or Im Im sorry  did your family participate in any of the home front efforts during the war  like rationing  or victory gardens?
When did you and your mother definitely hear about your father?
but in two hours  the government completely collapsed  Horthy was arrested  his family deported actually  and the Arrow Cross  the most extreme Nazi Hungarians took over.
But he didn't get used to this picture because I was always well-dressed and a well-to-do family  and so on and here -- I try to explain to him not to worry about me here.
It was the desire to help the Jews to get away from that life they led because they were not educated; they had no profession  no skill.
And what would happen to them if the Germans ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 32 had known?
In the next room lived a family with two children and they assigned us to live in this room.
When you were still in the camp  the DP camp and you were with the other kids your age  did you ever tell each other the stories of what you all had been through during the -- Yes. --
I was taken into the living room where the whole family was sitting in a circle  and they passed me from lap to lap.
It also meant that no other Jewish family could be moved in with you if you had a lot of -- if you had a large apartment.
Did you -- you were obviously preparing to go to is -- Palestine.
But I do want to say this  that the cover of the book  some of the books made by the city of Kiel  and the state that I was born in  Germany  recites and refers and relates the history of my family  my grandfather in particular.
It was not like uh we know today  that every family has a radio or TV.
So your mother must have been the youngest of the family or close to it.
I have family there  and I have a history going back.
So what was very hard for me to say good-bye to this wonderful family  you know?
Some part of my family from Ludbreg  my mother's sister and her family  did try.
My father was -- came from Orthodox home  but my mother didnt.
You were adopted and you were raised by this great family.
Two  three days before the -- and I should probably also say that I was brought up in a soldier's family.
We had an unc -- my -- brot her of my mother  Hans Marcuza was living in New York  and he filled out all the necessary pa pers for our family.
The number of the la ger was called 32C. Later  I learned that the gypsy people were living there with family.
I was born on August 22  1923 in a town at the time called Breslau  the capital of Silesia in Lets talk a little bit about your family  about your parents  who they were and their names.
And I have a brother  Arthur Spielman  and we survived as a family.
I think they did have some family come over but then they were aware of where I was and who I was.
So one family got killed too  they  the Pollacks killed them.
There's a man who has written a history of the cemetery there with the names of all the people  so I can look up some of my family and the next project this man did  there's a cemetery of the man -- of the people who were on the crusade.
In fact  when we went back with the family  I walked around trying to think if anything looked familiar.
But I think that she had a great responsibility for the family [indecipherable]what arrived 2  because my father was on the uni -- the U.S. quota  and I think that she didnt want to move because of the house.
Well  this family  Andrei Vancik family and Pavel Vancik family  they the adults were about of the same age as my parents and they had kids.
When did your parents -- when did and your parents learn about the fate of the rest of your family  what had happened to the extended family?
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
I -- I could have married in the family Nazi  bu -- but in -- Im getting off the subject -- in my office in Heidelberg was a soldier  a rabbis son  who married a German whose family were big Nazis  and who told him never to come to their home [indecipherable] Nazis after the war.
But that other name A2: [indecipherable] That other name of family  the boy was going with me to school in Mexico .
And my parents took me out of the school and sent me to a Jewish -- parochial  Jewish school.
Was there other did he hire people outside the family to work?
18 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD He says I'm he re visiting family.
Please tell me your name at birth  wher e you were born and when you were born.
And he was quite -- and her family was quite prosperous.
Anyway  I did go back to them and then I was transferred out from there to another foster family called Maniken   where I met my husband  because he had been their foster child  too.
When they returned home in 1944  police were sent to arrest the Garihs  but agreed to say instead that the family was not home if the family would leave immediately.
And it her sister and two and her brother were left in  which was Russia then.
But that might have been when they knew that we were twins.
But when you realize that you come from a family that had actively  even at -- to an extent peripherally participated in the Holocaust  it gives you an -- a sense of -- of immediacy  and intimacy  which you cant otherwise get.
He found an aunt  the aunt had a husband who wasn't Jewish.
And later on only when I am here  so I read somewh ere that it was written on the -- on the wagons  SB  Sonder Behandlung  and that meant -- that what they write in the book  that meant that six -- for six months  or -- I think six months  they had to stay there as a family  and then they sent them.
Oh  he lost his parents  his brothers  his sisters  his aunts  un cles cousins.
Were your parents able to get anything out of Germany when when they left?
When you became reunited  did you sit down with these family members and exchange experiences?
Not my sister  not all my family  not my mother  not my father  and I have to be grateful that I was chosen by God  or I don't know.
>> Bill Benson: Susan  with your father losing his business  how did he manage to feed the family and make ends meet after that?
He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in Germany  after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back home.
No one said anything for my family  no one hid anyone from my family.
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg July 29  2000 78 Where were your parents living?
Okay  can you tell me  when the Russians come in and take over that area of Poland  what was it like?
You didn't feel like strange person th ere  it was one whole big family.
Like it was done that way and especially in traditional Jewish families.
So my mother thought that here my girls are going to die from starvation  let them go to work  maybe they will be fed  maybe they can bring home some food for the rest of the family.
An d I told him under the w -- on the way  under those -- during those four days  the whole set up with the farmer  his family life  and what I did there  and gave him a complete information.
I -- I did keep in touch with my friend Sonya in Duluth and -- and of course with my family in Columbus and New York.
How is it that you -- t tell me about your decision to leave and why you decided to leave when the rest of your family was staying.
And  your family  while they believed very strongly in charity  was that ever on any organized basis before the war?
Well  this was the first time I'd really had a family.
So was her family from for many generations  as opposed to your family?
I didnt go until November  and stayed with his family  where where because the family had two daughters my age  I sort of I I as I remember that time  i-it was an exciting time  because th-th-they they treated me as I I suddenly became a member of a new family.
I want to thank you very mu ch for your very candid... But I think I should add  I almost feel obligated to add what has happened to other members of my family.
And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were leaving.
And we later had an old aunt of my fathers move in whose two sons had emigrated to what was then Palestine.
He spoke to me in Yiddish and he as ked me my name  whether I had family  where I had come from  and in the e nd he said  ﬁLittle German  you may stay  and youll hear from me.ﬂ He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time.
Tell me about your relationship with your father and your mother.
And th-the family  this was Fryman  and they provided work  lodgings and so on for them.
So we might  it's possible we were even more than ten and that was very fortunate  a lot of apartments have a lot more than just ten people because this was  it sound like  it seemed like a safe haven and of course  all the relatives were coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous doctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole family was there  so.
So someth ing is  you know  they get connected with people who have a similar family history.
55 -- Jewish schools  but yet your parents were not religious.
When you have your family  you first  you feel more like a human being.
What kind of work did your father do at the time?
I mean  up until now I people the we we lived in a house where in a building where two or three Jewish families lived  the rest of them were not.
The whole family  we were all excited about those two potatoes .
What did your parents tell you about their own childhoods and growing up?
Well  you know  where to send in Romania  you know  cold  but my -- only wher e we have friends and family.
But we didnt have so bad like really in some families.
And it was pretty hard  you know  for my mom and dad and me to kind of become a family again.
My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children.
Was there ever any discussion in your family of sending people out?
End of Side One) 19 So we were talking about your family is being marched from one camp to another and you were going to tell me something a bout your grandfather who is too weak or feeling weak.
Tell me about your parents and what they did  and your childhood.
you know  the family was -- and it was licen ned.
Your grandparents  for example  they grew up when this area was Hungarian.
I found out that on that night  on the night of my mother's birthday  they didn't only come to our house and break our windows and loot our apartments but they did it to every family that was a Jewish family in Bad Kreuznach.
I still see him in my mind  and with a whole range of ladies he had with him  and so he came and we had to present ourselves  family for family  and we had to show our papers.
They contacted your family in Prague  and the aunt or whoever  came to the gendarmes home  who lived nearby  delivered the stuff  and he brought it in  and you pick it up at the gate  or so -- And why would they do that?
I had three brothers and I had three sisters and I was  I was the youngest one.
On your mothers side of the family  did she have brothers and sisters?
I have at home many albums  which I redone  sa taking back the history of my family to 1840s.
She had family in this country in Providence  Rhode Island  the papers were all ready and everything  and she went and got me released on the 15th of September  one day befo re I was supposed to hang.
And the -- the order -- yeah  was a -- then there was a Dr. Vondaykunt in Belgium  picked up on the street  send him away to th e camp  his family never knew where he is  what he is.
And I get the impression also that since your father went to Vienna to go to medical school  he must have come from a family that could have afford to send him there.
But I was liv...I was living  if I can say that living several months there and my fam...our family went up to Budapest and I born in 1914.
And the apartment  our apartment  had been vacated by the Germans.
Were their families from Germany   or were they from another country  on both sides of your family?
>> Bill Benson: Before w e close  I think probably like everybody in the room  we have to really 14 sort of grapple  think about the fact that you've pieced together information about what you went through  through different happenstance ways  going back to Germany  seeing your home  and finding out that people that live there could share with you things  coming across the nanny again after all of these years   be cause of technology  family members being able to find you or at least inquiry are you family.
Tell us a little bit more of what that life was like and about your parents.
Was your -- was your family involve d in politics in any way?
03:38:17 When there was a family there  so that there was a husband and a wife and a child or more than one child  was the woman having more responsibilities than the man usually?
And the rabbi whose wife was a woman who knew my family  was born in the same town that I was born in Germany  who knew my family  hes still alive today.
Saying not only did he save his extended family and took care of everything  but he had such a very active role in the resistance.
Like old farmer would risk his life and his family and help us w here the priest  who was a man of the cloth  didn't.
And then it sounds like that you offered to go to ja il in Split  to stay with your father  to stay with the family?
And were there a lot  were there many restrictions imposed on you and your family?
In 1938  a family friend who was a policeman  warned the Markowiczes of an impending outbreak of violence against Jews in Germany.
But that basically is the last time I saw my parents.
