I mean  hang the Jews  kill the bosses  or something like that   I mean like thats the most marvelous songs.
We should not...we should not use the weapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time.
I dont mind if you kill all the Russian Jews  but the German Jews are good people  they work  theyre qualified  I want to keep them.
Other Jews from Iasi received the same order  and the fear was that this is a sy stematic call again to -- to eliminate them  to kill them.

And came with a gun  I thought they were going to kill them there.
I always said to myself  if they would kill me  it would be easier for me than to watch somebody that I knew and maybe  and ate together  and stayed together and suffered together  and planned  it was very difficult  was very d ifficult.
And Ludwig tried to kill him by the German  by biting his throat through  but another German came through and shot him point blank into the so when I found out that he was killed there  I ran over there  and his body was already removed  but his brain was still lying on on on on on o-on on the ground.

The SS used to come in every day to the Ghetto  take people out to work  kill a lot of them while they were doing it  and we even had a little hospital over there.
And all of a sudden Germans stop us going to the -- to the ship  and since I knew German  I got out of the car  and I said  ﬁI dont understand why you taking us.
You can kill me if you want  but I'm not going to give you nothing.
Some other cases  could have happened that they go behind us and if somebody wa nts to step down  then they kill them.
A big  again  my husband can give you because he knew more about guns than I  a big uh I think it was a machine gun a nd some uh handguns and some uh  uh other uh arms so we would be prepared if the Germans would try to kill us at the very end of the war because this is what they tried to do.
If they want to -- they want to kill you  they should kill you as a non-Jew  and you cannot admit that to anyone.
If they could uh if--if they could prove to themselves which they didn't really have to  they could kill Jews any- time they wanted to.
But the  the kapo would appoint  would appoint the  uh let's say could appoint the blockeldest  or the SS could appoint the blockeldest  but a studentin was appointed by the  by the blockeldest and they had the same uh power and the same  I mean  they could kill you  they could beat you up  they could  they  they didn't have to account to to anybody and to anything  and some became very vicious and it wasn't a nd I don't even uh I know that some uh of the prisoners then killed these kapos when they had a chance  and some even blockeldests.
They put the Polish people again[st] the Ukraine  the Ukraine again[st] Poland...uh...again[st] Polish people  and each other begin to kill.

What is not known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and -- and essentially kill them.
And they went to the Danube to kill them all  and suddenly  the car arrives  and this one man in a coat and hat  they already knew that must be Wallenberg  demanded that these are my people  and I  they are under my protection  and you Germans have absolutely no right to take them  and he brought them back home.
He threatened us that the Germans are a ll around and they are going to kill us and we'd better leave.
And I don't think  th e SS were just trying to get us away because they didn't know what to do  and I think there must have been a dissention among them whether to kill or not to kill the pr isoners.
That's one thing not to like Jews and that's the next step is to hate Jews  then the next step is to kill Jews and so there was a big 4 difference  but already by the age of maybe fi ve or six  I knew that some people hated me just for being Jewish and that's the kind of world 01:14 it was.

And then as we started coming back  I remember my father saying that if there was anybody in our home he would just kill them.
There are some people who are deeply concerned about this wall coming down  about  in terms of what it means for a united Germany?ﬂ And her response was  ﬁAhh  why cant they just forget it?ﬂ I wanted to kill her.

A lot of things indicate that his plane was sabotaged and he was downed and so were basically you know attempt  not only attempt  successful at tempt to kill him because he became inconvenient.
And didn't know whether they were going to be belligerent  whether they were going to try to kill us  or what they were going to try to do.
I never saw him crying but for him  to kill children  innocent children  and there was no reason  it was just fun.
So  that was it  and when he said  I I have to kill you  I assumed he would turn his rifle on me  and I looked down the road.
He did hit me with the rifle in the back of my head  this must be made out steel because I dont know how he didnt kill me.
But i-i-it wasnt that we were afraid that somebody will come and will kill us or something  79 n-no.

So you never know  I mean the dead ones don't talk and the ones who killed them wouldn't' talk  so  and with this guy I'll get to  I'll tell you my philosophy and the suffering which got me through it  because when we carried those pre-fab sections  it was horrible  real back-breaking work  I thought  it'll kill me and I couldn't believe that I survived it and I didn't want to die the next day  because I said if I survived that  I don't want to die now and then it was again some very hard work and somehow managed to survive and then just didn't want to kill myself  but it would have been a way out  so it just  one hardship after another hardship  sort of just kept me going.
