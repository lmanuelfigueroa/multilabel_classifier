And that was And I was out of school  my par pare nts protested and what does a kid know  and after six weeks  after a lot of red tape going through the with the with the German government  the I finally was allowed to go back to school.
We were going to school together  playing together  living together next to each other.
And the high school used to call in -- in European  we used to call you gimnasiu m. Which translates evidently gymnasium here  but -- but thats not what it was.
And one day  in December [indecipherable] or maybe maybe it was January  I dont know  it was very cold  wintery December  and I wore the same thing all the time to school  cause I had all my clothes were we didnt buy clothes in you bought clothes  but we had our clothes made.
And I had to walk to the school  about two miles out and we were there with the goyim in this school.
Well then of course it was all my Jewish friends from school.
Was a gi rl from my school  she was on her way to Chile I was coming back from Cuba  and a -- a -- you know  these little things are so -- they illuminate how crazy everything was.

And in fact  when w when when when we lived in Germany   DP camps  we met up again and we finished high school together in Germany .
In Berlin  at that time I was 14 years old  I was no longer in school.
So now you were in America  in Ne w York and you would go to Jefferson High School  and the next questions are -- will be about that.
Following that I went to summer school in high school  made up another year and graduated at 16.
And some of thes e people from the shtetla were in school  I knew them and they looked well  because you know  in the little shtetla they are [indecipherable] air is good  and th -- and they were for a week in the ghetto  and -- and they were [indecipherable] and we saw that  and after a week they said that the trains are ready and they are going to Kovno to the -- to view the factory.
But I dont know whether whether I I was very busy trying to finish high school.
And when he -- we came home  thats when my father and my mother s aid we couldnt play any more and we couldnt go to the school any more.
I went I went to that I was the only Jewish child in that school  and I was permitted to be there because I was considered a Polish citizen.
And interesting enough I remember that my late brother when to the same primary school a year before I did  and my brother  George  much later...it was already almost war time  he went to that same primary school which was called Princess Julienne.
Since I went to the Kalmbach private high school  every one of my high school teachers was from what you call it.
I remember I was a child and I was studying school and I was helping too to put the glass because he was working in the villages.
But in school proper  the amazing thing was that the teachers would very often stand up in my defens e or would give lectures to  especially a teacher of German -- of the German language -- which I was forced to learn at the time.
You know  I went to school in the Bronx  I went to school in New York  and they still talk about that period  which is wonderful.
I took them to Sunday school   because I felt like they should have that background.
You know  it was a st range experience to go to school.
And we were there nice place  by the way we were there maybe two week s when we were told that we had to leave the place because near us was a the RAF  Royal Air Force had a base  and they needed to house their personnel  so they were going to take over the school  and we would have to leave.
It was not university  it was still high school at the time  but there was a program called the university.
I reme mber the first incident at school where I didnt even notice it  but my father immediately did  where we handed little forms indicating what religion we were  you know?
My mother was a elementary school teacher and...uh...my childhood was I think characterized by the very few years during which my parents lived together because of the economic conditions in Poland.
And there was some members of a family who had moved from Zagreb to somewhere else whose sons were in England already in school  thats right  at the university both of them  two boys.
As a matter of fact  I went to school with one of the fellows  who later  I feel that he saved my life because he came to Auschwitz much earlier than me and he had  by the time I arrived in Auschwitz  he was a (sounds like schrieber) on the block.
And he was... he told me  \ Look  you know  we can only have a uh  special... It is not in this...in the hospital  outside of the hospital; but it is occupying a school just across the street.
They were Protestants and they patronized  the patron of the school was that Protestant princess of the past.
And all those kids had -- from the farms  came to his school   and Hein was the oldest of 10 kids [indecipherable] I dont know  [indecipherable] that he was born  probably.
They walk me -- it was about 15 kilometers to Svalava   which was a military complex  and there they [indecipherable] me up there and said [indecipherable] I was the only Jewish kid  was a lot of the Gentile kids  and the lieutenant asked me questions  why didnt you go to school  and I didnt have a chance to answer him  and he gave me a slap on my face  I thought my f -- well  even my head is going to spin off.
Well  uh  I had a reputation as a track athlet e from high school and  uh  it was expected that I'd go out for the track team and  uh  so I di d. Uh  I ran the first indoor season after my freshman football season.
And then one of the counselors  who was also the math teacher of the school  said  \  If they go  I go.\
So now I had to wear a star to school which was not very pleasant.
I was bring nothing but Ds and Cs from school  and I was an A student before.
Some of the -- the young people that you had been friends with  and now youre not going to school with them  maybe youre not even in contact  did -- did you begin to become suspicious or alienated from old friends and neighbors?
And then one day  coming from school -- and this would be closer to like 1938  other kids would call across the street  look at those Jews  look at those Jewish children  and the kids would throw stones at us.
You continued to go to school and be with friends and then what was the next change?
And then after first semester my grades were very good and so they were quite pleased to put me immediately into gra duate school  and I was fine.
I really grew up in Po...yes  in Poland and I went to school  to elementary school and my father was a working man for kind of like business.
It wasn't very long that we went to the other school  and I have no memory of it.
I saw the apartment  I saw ultimately the school where I went.
All of my friends went to the Jewish high school  which was very diffi cult to get into.
There was a lot of time she brought the kids home when I brought the kids home from school at night all day she was working  and when I brought them home at night  I took over and she went to work.
And I think they were anti-F ascist  but in school  the subject  history  writing  reading  she was very good  and just marvelous.
She was in school  so sh e was in that house near -- very close to the school.
We moved to Riverdale and then in in Riverdale into a co-op and then when my daughter Inez became of school age  we decided to leave New York and head for the wide open spaces of New Jersey.
He was already in Alexandria   I remember  in Egypt   because the brigade moved in while I was in school  to Egypt .
Did you attend school at all then after you came back there?
And I hea rd that and because they were talking about it in school  but I thought oh thats too bad you know.
She knew what [indecipherable]  and I took Latin in school  dont forget I went to school from -- Thats right. --
But I worked at the Rohm and Haas during 1958 and took the law school test.
This time in Kovno  I remember there were many  many shuls   or synagogues  about 40 I remember from there  and I think it was more or less right  a 2 real number  and I attend a Hebrew primary school.
Now when the -- So yo -- when do you start school?
Thats right  so they sent me to that school; it s the same place where the CIA is now.
And then when I was uh ten years old  I went to a Russian school.
Being in Polish school  there were -- When you finish 10  see the sister was there 10 classes in the Talbud.
But being raised in a village which had -- half of the population was Germ an [indecipherable] population  I had German friends from school  which we were t ogether [indecipherable] and as soon as Hitler came to power in Germany they stopped talking to me and they stopped chasing me and they stopped knowing me.
And I rememb er when we were going to this school there  there was like a little it was like a corridor and on both sides the snow came up to practically my to my shoulders  I just my little head was out there.
He was -- he -- he wasnt in school any more  anyhow  so my older brother became the leader of the Jewish child ren  and he decided that were not going to wait until were excluded  were going to separate ourselves.
But but my question is  when you were a child there  in in the school  when they were doing these operations  did you suddenly feel like something was wrong with you  that you before  you didnt feel like anything was bad about you  and then now somebodys telling you youre no good.
So now youre there and you said youre at the school.
I went to grade school there--I mean grade school  not high school.
Well  there was one major in th e school who was what they call a tactical officer  who is instructor -- Actually  we did the figures.
Yeah  and he -- he came home  he spoke English  and I learned from him  and I was listening to the radio  and I was re -- i -- He just picked it up in school?
So all of the English kids who were in our school  were in the exactly the same position as we were.
So my school was called zabawkarska   something prepared to make toys.
Uh and the Protestants are more flexible because of the heritage and we can do the whole thing in eight months and you have to go to school and learn the catechism a nd so forth  so part of the experience is one of how to survive in a totalitarian environmen t  how to adapt  how to change your skins  your habits  your behavior  because that is what the rules require.
And I wen -- went over there with my group  over there to recognition  and this time the German who wi -- the German -- we was in this school building what I said be -- from -- from which we go -- make all action.
They have many children and they were very poor so my mo ther every week  Thursday  she packed few packages to take to the poor one...to the poor families and when they came from public school  she gave me this to...to...to deliver to this family.
Did their parents ever try and get you out of the school?
I did this for one or two years  well until the Kristallnacht  and then I th ink that school closed.
The school helped us to -- we didnt know about applications and things and such.
But then in  uh  April  March actually  1944  when the Germans came in  we had to put on the yellow star and Jews were not allowed to leave leave their houses actually and  uh  we were not allowed to travel  have businesses or go to school or do anything.
It was very strange because we were for the new school year.
Then this was couple Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 132days like this  and then  before actually  before uprising started  I was put to work by cleaning some old rifles that were recove red from the hiding pl aces  for an attack by the grownups  of that School 100.
So I worked from  he was five  63 to I went to -- full time to Columbia School of Social USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 18 Work in s -- I worked for 10 years  73 I went there.
We didn't grow up as fast over there as children grow up today  and being 14  15  really meant to be under the care of your parents all the time  especially when there were no schools -- I was completely cut off from school for three years already.
It was not a pleasant time for me  especially when I came home or when I passed a street when somebody -- it happened also that my friends from the school sometimes when I passed they took the hat so on this side they thought that maybe I'm collaborating.
it was  but he was obviously four years ahead of me  howeve r  he only went to school for about a year and a half.
So you went to school and you said you did not experience any antiSemitism before 39.
I dont -- I dont remember th -- I was -- Did you like school?
B ecause during the Hebrew school -- see  the -- the Testament  Old Testament is same.
And we knew that was Communist meetings  but you didnt dare to think about it because you could get expelled from school  and kids were getting expelled from getting involved in Communist cells.
So he proceeded to tell me about Spanis h riding school  and the history of the Lipizzaner  very fascinating.
There was competition in school  in writing  in reading  and knowing cer tain answers and so on.
About 75 children went to my father and only nine children when to the official school.
Both of us had military preparation  I had it in my high school days.
Remember  I had missed school for many  many years and it was very hard to catc h up.
We went to school and we ha d a headmaster who was very anti-Nazi.
My other problem is  the school was in Brussels and my father wouldn't let me live in the dorms  which means I had to commute  which means I had to get up every morning at five  be on the train at seven and be awake in class at eight.
They had six or seven of them around the country  but typically what it would be  the Quakers -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 38the Friends -- the American Friends Service Committee would invite f -- foreign students  about 35 to 40  put them in a pla ce  usually a -- a private school  the grounds for a private school that -- since it was v acation time  and we would stay there for almost eight weeks  and the idea was to talk about life and -- and f-foreign affairs  and things like this  and we had every week some prominent individual from the university  a professor would come  or -- either of political science  or psychology  and he would lecture  and he would hold a -- a -- a -- a -- discussions under a tree.
Its th-the sy the school system is very ve was very different and still is very different from he here in the U.S. I went to a eight year gymnasium  which was very strict  very difficult and very  very cut and dry academic  I would say.
We were married -- yeah sure  we were married 58  went to -- I was married all through graduate school.
Yes  because in Brussels you had to learn in school Flemish  and [indecipherable] still bilingual today  you know? [

After two years  I switched to the Horace Mann School up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx  where I was one of the few boarding students.
I had a bad cold and wasnt going to school the next day.
I was very comfortable with it  and we went to school  our first school experience was when we were five years old  kindergarten  and it was very Jewish and I was very comfortable in it.
There was a normal Russian school there  which was run by the Siberian railroad si siber Siberian Si-Siberian Central Asia n Railroad.

Then when I finished cheder my mother waited for me to give me something to eat and I was eating while I walked to public school.
Wh-Wh-When you were in school  up to the age of ei ght  did you have any unpleasant experiences  or any unpleasant experiences in the street with other children?
I went to school in the 22 morning  and I loved it.
But when you were in school  were there any incidents with the other children?
You dont go to 12 th grade but when you reach the tenth grade  youre done with high school.

Holland  you talk better about Hol -- SE: So we came in that camp and they were -- were not very friendly to us and so -- and she di - -and so we had to stay first in quarantine for three days and sleep there on the floor in the school building and finally we went with the freight train  they brought -- freight car  they brought us to my hometown.
But not on a regular basis  because it was already being censored  or whatever  so So you were out now  youre in this youre in this sort of camp area  in a dormitory  going to school  getting adjusted  having a new routine.
I did not join a sorority and I was pretty well an outsider  I was an oddball and I had ambitions for the stage and joined play production and eventually did get a role or two and walked from my house in Kew Gardens to those performances in Forest Hills High School on Friday night and Saturday and did that with a lot of trepidation.
They would leave the d oor unlatched in the morn ing before school and I would go in there and practice piano.
It was towards the end of the elementary school years that my parents took me out of the school and entered me in a special Jewish school with many other children who left the public schools.
It was very moving because some  very few who remained still from that school that orphanage  came to greet me.
We had other struggles because we had  obviously  to make a living  and my son went to school  and that was alright.
I spoke abou t the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from grade school were killed or murdered wa together with their parents.
We observed the holidays  and I was raised as a Jewish child  but I was going to -- I didn't go to a Jewish school  so I was mixing a lot with Polish children  and I spoke only Polish at that time  and I was a blonde little girl.

Oh  I have to backtra ck a little bit  I worked at the Searing School as I said  for 10 years and then something else very bad happened.
Is there and you were hearing this is there anything that youd like to add to what your sister had said about what life was like before the war star ted; about what your settlement was like  the people that you knew  the people that you went to school with  something like that?
Very few children  because -- I started school in 1932  and in 1934  I went to higher education school  but then 1936 I had to leave school.
And I wanted to make life for myself and go to school and I had to work and learn on the job because I wanted to be free and I wanted to be away from from everything.. Sandy: Tell me about the --tell me about the physical condition you were in when you were liberated.
She went to a school there  she went to the -- to another college  to a [indecipherable] shula  they called it.
Okay  shes married to a guy who is an accountant and they have two children  one of them is Rachel   shes in second year college  and Jossy who is a senior in high school.
We did rent the upstairs  we didnt have a a penny  but I actually I went to grammar school during the day  made sure my grades were done.
I came -- I think when I -- they had a little bit of schooling at the synagogue in Genoa  so from the school I had to go to the -- to it.
And I think law school made you aware of that  especi ally in the context of my experience in the military  that the South– th at we had to do– you know  that things would have to change in the South.
In fact  I remember my junior year in high school  I spent more nights at camp than I did in my own bed at home.
It's now three generations and I'm absolutely appalled over the fact that when I went to school  the Civil War was ancient history.
There were several Jewish students in my class in the Atheneum  and we had religious -- Jewish religious instruction in the public school.
No  you know  at school we been miserable  terrible miserable  because how you can listen day after day  you know  about this  then we know that that  you know  they came  and and occupied us  and and we how you jump  that I finish school in the June jul June.
And so you went on with life as usual at in in high school?
But you you finished your your officer's school  and this was about the end of 1943... '44.
What was it like on a day -to-day basis in school for you?
I remember in my school  being taught in Hebrew about Voltaire and Gerter  by the same teacher who taught me also and Hebrew history.
I had one scholarship in Chichester and decided that I wanted to go to secretarial school beca use I was very much aware of the fact that I was being supported by people who were not my parents  and I also felt that if my parents were saved after the war  I would want to have a profession to look after them.
Lets say I went to someplace in in New Jersey to a school  who a teacher who took was with the museum on this they have the bulf -- Balfour scholarship that they bring teachers  Balfour fellow  and the oh  whats this I dont want  I cant think of it  of the name right now  but it was actually in New Jersey that I went  somebody  one of the teachers Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 69that was at this conference and she called [indecipherable] and wanted to have a survivor to come and talk to her class.
Because I was the only Jewish child in the entire school of 800 children and there's a  there was a city pool they used  on the outskirts of town and I was  I went in that pool once  I think it was in first grade  was in 1932  or thereabouts  in '33  then I could never go in there again  they let me  I had to sit on the si de  while  while all the other kids were swimming.
So I wasnt aff -- afforded that opportunity  I came out a harder way  through officer candidate school.
He was with parents oh  I think ho he had both parents  I think  and I was in orphanage  but in school they kept togeth er.
It was time when we had in -- we didn't go to s-school  school is in orphanage.
I think the children -- ac tivities there was  but for the children  they used to have school.
It wasnt the school that I went to  but it was some other school  a nd again there was no lawn in the front  but they did have these sort of both ornamental and -- a nd physical heavy iron chains.
So from -- so that wa s a -- a -- obviously a total loss  and -- and then my father tried to make a living  you know  or bl ack market was a -- was the -- was the thing to do to try to  you know  scrape up a living and get a work permit  everybody had to work  you know  my -- my brother worked for the railroad do ing some -- he was mechanically inclined so he did some locomotive repairs  and -- and I we nt to school  you know  I went to -- to a school and -- and then I -- all of a sudden the -- the Uk raine became the foreign language.
As you said  first you had come out of hiding  you were taken to a place where there was lots of other kids and you're free to play and do all the things kids do  started school.

Was it a Jewish school  or -- It was -- yes  that was the reason they sent me away  in order to go to a Jewish school.
I was the last graduate before the war  then the school was closed.
Now at that time really to be admitted in that school and to that specific teacher  you really had to be...uh...very tops.
professors  and all the Jewish students  and they mi -- they took a building that used to be a really Jewish school  but they took over that building  and people -- Jewish people from all over Amsterdam were congregated there  a nd -- and classes were held there.
An d in school they knew who I was already  because the name  and she was writing for Stanislav Kiersnowski  and I got a letter and I found out that my mother and my sister is alive  that they are in Teheran.
Then they had to have their secular schooling so there were there were two great schools - one was the Kaduri School and the other was another high school which I  slips my mind but I have it in my notes  and in these schools the children went to high school to learn their secular subjects.
Then my mother went to a German school in Germantown was the name of a town where she was  but it was a farming community.

And then I got him around to go to law school.
Well  I was really aware of parties because in school some kids this was this goes back I would think to 1931 32.
Unfortun ately  the school in Germany taught them very  very little  she says  go  maybe you can convince some of them what was for real.
It was a nice school  we had -- it was also -- we had Hebrew and things like this.
So I remember Aesops Fables  they were all translated into French in a big book by Mr. LaFountaine and they were pretty strict in school  so we have to learn a fable per session  whatever it was.
The Beacon was the name of the school in Tunbridge Wells  and The Beacon has b een a very big part of my life.
So they put all these people together in this school  and I remember that I had a violin at home.

And Yiddish was -- and I went to school to Gymnasium that was a little (inaudible) learn a little German  because the guards at the commandant gave orders in German  and if you did not respond to the order that was not in favor either.

And a Miss Mundy  who was English  who was the school secretary and I doubt that she was Jewish.

So this was the only school  and it became -- it was no longer 39segregated and they admitted boys  so we ha d boy and girl -- boys and girls  but it was taught in Polish  except that we had two hours of Russian every day.
And I think the thing was with the school that it was full of other kids who were not anywhere near their home or their origins.
And I remember the first time we went -- I went to Sunday school  we had an assembly which was -- they ran out of money during the Depression so that the assembly hall was made into the Temple  a dual purpose with a -- with an everlasting light.

I think that Julius and the– I think that being in law school and remembering my experiences in the Service probably had a lot to do  it just sort of came together as a way of having me ultimately decide that– I mean when I first went to law school I didnt even know if I could get through law school because it was such a big change.
I know we went to the Jewish school together  I told you about  and I don't remember her name.

Maybe it 3 was a school or a former synagogue...I don't rememb er.
Because I did not have full cycle of education like normal school.
Coming from the militaristic Nazi school  now to a very ort hodox Jewish school which  at the beginning when I came there  seemed to be without any semblance of discipline.

My task was to go into the library at the school for the Humane school for the deaf in Paris and do research there on what was available on French sign language.
Yeah  only on the si the summer month  when the school was closed.
So as I said  we went back and I met Professor Firchcot and managed to convince him to take me on to school  which he did.
We we re maybe fifty  sixty girls from that school to send and get the railroad tickets to send everybody home.
And when the children were in school  I worked as a dressmaker.
used to have a school there of a dramat drama and its now owned by some American foundation.
That is the older kids were teaching the younger kids to continue our education because the Germans  of course  closed all the schools and prohibited in the entire country any normal education except the first few grades of elementary school.
After the war there were t-two of us in that school who were Jewish.
I re member vividly  I must have gone to school because I was in Heidelberg  and they had a bi g exhibition under a tent in the middle of the town square of some of the war booty that they had captured in Poland and France.
And I think by the time we left  she just about finished school and was doing some working.
So  if you're going to school  you must go to school immediately.
What I remember is that we went to school with my cousin  with another cousin  a woman  Helen.
And he thought very highly of German education  and thats how come when I started school in 1931 of course  I went to a German school  a Volksschule  and in 19 my brother was born in 1930  and in 1936  he started the Volksschule.
So she She was accepted but there wasit's ca lledyou don't have t hose things here  volkenyensadig ; you have th is  yes  yeswith the hope that in a year later  twoI was so I had to go to work  to regular  normal school.
I went to public school and then after school the boys went to what they called Hebrew school and the little girls went to what they called Yiddish school.

Did you understand that he was such an important figure when he was in your school as an apprentice  or was it later that you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 25 understood what he had done  or -- and -- and -- and  if so  what -- what were you aware of him?
And so  I was already really  you know  culturally deprived  I mean I was  I don't know how I managed to do well in school because I did  but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and putting them together  but not having a coherent view of things.
Actually  the first discussions about my going to a school in the Department of Haute Loire in the massive central had come up already.
And I dont think I really had more than a couple of weeks when I was no longer allowed to go to school.
Its the only school experience that I had that was negative  and I dont know why it -- why that was particularly.
And while you were still in that first school  were there only the refugee children?
And there was one guy  he was a German Jew who was a farmer  and knew about  you know  fa rming  and other than going to school  homework  etcetera  he would teach us what to do.
This is a school  a school he went to in Hungary You dont know which–?
And each school had their own tempt elders and the chief of labor assignm ents which were Jews that were assigned to do the selection for the outside labor detail.
And thats how I continued my education  by going to school at night.
And we had one professor who later on I met in Los Angeles  Dr. Bergel  and he was a professor of history  and they really had attracted terrific people in that school.
My parents chose England  so we ended up going to England  where I went to school and my mother refused to put me in the Polish school where I wanted to go  because I knew Polish so well  and English I didn't know.
He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him  but we kn ew who Cal-fus is  I knew him very well because  like I said  I went to school there.
So we -- so you -- the only thing wa-was  had to get -- had I -- ha -- I was thrown out of school at that time.
So I went to that Roth and told him who I was and that I survived and -- and I had a-an address of a school friend in Connecticut and my uncle.
There were Jews from all over  from Poland -- I met a young little girl my age in school who did not speak a word of Yiddish.
If you -- if you did not want to attend an-and that wa s the type of school where it still does  I think.
End of Tape Two 36 Beginning Tape Three Julian  you s -- you went to a Polish high school again when you got to Tel Aviv.
And so I got ahold of them and wanted to know if I could go to school there and get a degree in electrical engineering and learn TV and stuff like that  and so I signed up for it.
But it became dangerous because we had to use the same bathrooms and on some occasions...uh...we have heard that...uh...some girls were abused by the soldiers so for that reason alone  the school was closed.
School  I was still allowed to stay  but certainly I was of -- invisibly marked in the ey es of my fellow students  I was a bourgeois.
The same time I attend to the Polytech Institute because in the m -- in the beginning the German close the old school  and later they opened the school on ly for the technician school  you know  they need -- they dont -- they need only the people to work  the working people that there is on that -- they opened the school for the tech nician and this -- this way we working with -- and I attend to this -- this Polytechnic Institute  I study mechanic engineering.
On in your free time  or when the German children were not in school  did you play with them  did you talk with them?
And youngsters were asked to go back to school because it was September  and the school year was disrupted for a little while.
But it was not they were not in the country  and they certainly all left  after they we graduated  they all went back to the States to s to school  an even if their parents remained in Brazil .
And the school closed in 47  only half a year  you know  of schooling  because the war this was going on  shoot shootouts were going on.
So  from th is police area I think they took us into a school.
And it was the wife that had to put in roots quickly  school  church  neighborhood.
Did you go to a Jewish school or a Polish school?
I realized the first time when I was in Vienna  Vienna  in the school   they call that.
So I had the opportunity to go to a good high school  out of town.
When I went to the Ha rvard Law School which was in 1935  I saw a lot of people there and  as a matter of fact  I've  a group of other people and I got together and organized - with a fellow named Nathan Isaacs  who is a professor at the business school -- he came over to my little apartment that I was sharing with a couple of other characters  and sort of gave us lessons in the Talmud  supposedly every Satu rday.
And when I was in the Jewish school  we had our own swimming pool.
The the resistance in the ghetto or even before we were incarcerated in the ghetto  was entirely of different character and entirely of different dimensions and entirely different aims so uh when the historic and dramatic meeting or assembly of the Jewish...of the Jews...Jewis h leadership of Kovno to elect a over-Juder   a chief Jew  and this...and the committee  in the very same place  in the very same school  former school  two hours later we we held a meeting in another room of this very same school for leaders of the various Zionist groups.
My school was not the real -- Samson Raffelhirsch religious school  it was a school that had been opened in 1804 by a secretary of one of the Rothchilds.
So I did the embassy of the Bahamas  which was also a nice experience  you know  and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was northeast Washington.
I was in school already in January  in high school in Patterson  New Jersey.
At any rate  we were the oldest group in that school.
When you were talking about being in high school  werent you at some point in something called a farm settleme nt that we didnt talk about?
I was [indecipherable] I in the in the track team in school.
Because I was dreaming about journalism  and in high school already  I wrote to some papers.
Okay  so at this time were you st ill in school  or were you out of school?
Because I wrote letters to the Romania Embassy that I want to go to university and if I not getting home in time  I will lose th e year  to study  you know  because in September start the school years  writing  writing  writing.
Uh when I started going to school  she would cross the big street to help me cross back again.
And we lived in what was know n as a Jewish neighborhood  which encompassed sort of six  seven streets in Antwer p. We went to school  Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner  Saturday we went to synagogue  but Saturday afternoon so metimes we snuck off to the movies.
We have to always look out for our next door ; if it's a school  a bully pushes somebody around  you can't allow them to do that.
So I went home and enrolled in graduate school and got a teaching credential as a fallback position and got a masters and got a PhD and the rest is history.
And we went to this school till 1938  I would say -- 39  Im sorry.
But as we see  I showed them th e list and when I talked at this school  the high school  I was surprised that after the school was finished  after school was finished  people came and they stayed and they asked more questions.
So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him  and he told me  \ There is a guy who lives next house  and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the airport.
When we had raids  we first of all had lots of practice at school to get into the shelters.
My sister came here -- she went in 1939  she -- her school had a whole group of kids they sent to England.
And here he has to give it all up and move to Israel where his children dont speak the language  where -- well  he spoke some Hebrew because he went to a Hebrew high school  but its starting a whole new life.
And did you encounter any anti-Semitism during that period while you were going to school?
Six when I started elementary school  and 12 years old when I -- 12 years old. --
I went to a Jewish school which was founded in 1935  I believe.
But in fact I would go  every six months I would go to the draft board in Brooklyn and in Brooklyn they were very severe because there were lots of smart Jewish kids going to school but theyre only doing my brother was in the first  in the Second World War but I would be drafted for going to Korea or something like that.
Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29  2018 103 That was during  you see  during the ske school season  I was hol I was in .
And if its a school  then I talk to them about life here  and what they have here  how they should -- comparing my life  and how I view the United States when I came here  what we have here  and how appreciative they should be  and really appreciate the life and the schools  and everything they have.
I went innocently to school on November 10th in the morning  not knowing about anything.
When I went to elementary school I went with a bunch of Jewish girls and all that.
Well  it was 1954  which is when I– 1954  I wa s in navigation school in Texas and I think clearly I must have known about it.
I went to German Lutheran Sunday school  and I think I just  you know  went once a week and it was just part of my growing up  I guess.
I look at Colorado  it does not -- I mean  it -- its -- its horrible  and to hear that one of the killers mother  after it happened  had her hair done in front of the school  you know  like ‚I dont give a damn.
And shortly before I I I was arrested  I took all the pictures  including the pictures wi-with my diploma  Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 72graduation from high school.
But we had just a -- the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 5Volkschule  that means the grammar school  and that was no college that time  because that were not time.
Took care on us children  sew buttons  see that the shirts are clean to go to school.
Tell us tell us about your school  what what kind of school you went to.

Well  he went to school longer than I did  because when our school was burned down  d -- Duisberg was the only -- Right. --
Cause he was going for the first time to his new school  so he wanted to look good.
And they send in from the [indecipherable] and he -- she was asking for a job  because she finished high school.
So he he made me go to temple Sunda y school.
There was none of this that you hear today  in 1997  where you -- where a teacher looks at a kid the wrong way and the teacher runs -- and the -- and the child runs home to his parents  then the parents come to school and the teachers in big trouble and so is the administration in big trouble.
And a th-they were there was intermittent because the teacher that finally came to our school came from the neighboring town called Straubing  and he had to come on the train.
Q. So how do your days look  in 1942 without school?
I run away  went into a house  an empty house already  and there was another  my friend from school.
An d that school did in three years what all others did in four.
But the school  it was somethingŠI was not interested in just only to be after a girl running around.
So I had a lot of expens es and the school was in Adel-fy so $20 or whatever  $18 of th at money went for travel.
Oh  so you were in a public school and then you had extra hours after  okay -- Yeah.
Before the war  probably it was 19- No  I didnt go to school in 1939 because September is when the war broke out.
My name  at home and at school was Jeanine  it was a French name.
And then when I was 10  I was sent to boarding school  and from then on I was in boarding school from the age of 10  to the age of 18.
But as little school I had  it was in comparison to high school.
I attended Brooklyn College for four years  then applied to medical school.
Was it a public school  or It was very much a public school  because my father felt that he was a very interested that I not be brought up in an elite environment  and was there were a Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 16 lot of poor boys  from poor backgrounds  who gave me a hard time.
And then we spent the night in a Liverpool boarding school.
He graduated in 1949  when I was first graduating from high school.
So first of all  we we said we need to train youngsters to for as artisans that is so much needed for the German war effort  so this they understood  so it was that the school it was a course for preparing of artisans  but it wasn't...for all things and purposes it was...it was a school.
And he was hiding the dean of the medical school  Jewish Dr. Beck  B-e-c-k  and his wife and two children.
And therefore  the tuition was  of course  very high and I remember that was the first time sort of I heard about that this was a sort of a big sacrifice for my parents to put me in that school  and actually  I was scared because I would be thrown suddenly into a totally English environment  I mean  the teachers were all Americans  some maybe British  actually  and English was the language.
He came even at our house  and to tell my father and mother that I could not see him any more  because he was going to the school where he goes at night  and hes he would sit there til he came out of school  and going home  bec ause then he cannot see me.
Yes  yes  because I want to study  I want to -- to the medical school  and we were there  and it -- the students were also fascists  ver-very -- very -- as a g-group  the students were fascists  because they -- they were unfriendly relations to the Jews  becau se [indecipherable] maked demonstrations against Jews  right?
And I  one day  had the truck convoy stop outside the school  and went in and talked to the administrator  and this [indecipherable] lady.
In fact  I was offered a job in a school; because I have the credentials to teach.
But it was a rather Orthodox house  so I was going to a secular school  a private gymnasium.
Now they said  \ If you come to school  you have to do everything.\
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 28 And she -- she died of natural causes and the father put them in a -- into a boarding school while he was working for the Jewish agency.
And this relative wrote a book on the students who all had to go to that quickly established Jewish school.
So this is at that elite high school that you went -- Elite high school  right. --
So I was sent to Fort Riley Kansas  the cavalry school.
But anyway  I finished high school and I was 16 years old.
So  you know  after th ese five months  practically fi ve months  of wandering around Poland sometimes we would be given  you kn ow  they had school lunches and they would give us some milk and potatoes to eat.
At that time  we were not allowed to go any further in the school  only basic.
They ask me questions all the time  and perha -- now thats -- the curriculum in the high school that they have  or the schools  or middle school  whatever it is  they usually have th e curriculum on the Holocaust  so they come home sometimes with questions.
Any other experiences there that you would like to talk about while you were at that school in England?
I attended private school all my life  and it was expected of me to do my homework and to be a good student.
But  as a Jew  she is religious and I told her if she will have children  if the children will go to a religious school I pay for it  and I do.
I had heard about an American school in Biarritz  France   and they says  okay.
Yeah  in the sense that I put them in Jewish school.
I didnt have my own car  but I mean I could always borrow a car and there were parties and I was a very social and outgoing -- it wasnt though  with -- with the public school crowd  it was with the -- the Jewish crowd.
So this was...this was the first time  and it bothered me  but when  you know  young girl  going back to school and this was the end of it.
Interview with Michael Lin February 27  2000 60 When I came home I go this information that I -- so I went to high school  because this was junior high school.
The fact that I I m I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of youngsters out of out of school who were going to cadet school and they were studying pamphlets.
So we did  we spoke to a group in the school called the Pius gymnasium  named after Pope pa one of the popes  Pope Pius  one of the Piuss  I guess.
I met  she was an arti st  painter and medical school was next to  and the cafeteria was together.
And of course  there was always a Ukrainian who would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends from school saw her and she said to her  \ You are still alive?\
You see  th we have the they had the high school in Romania is like in France   you have to pass the baccalaureate  you know.
Sometimes when I wasn't in school or vacation time or whatever and they went out.
Well  I -- my skill that I acquired in hotel school   I did pretty much run the kitchen there  yes.
My mother was working for this -- Doctor Breeker was his name  you know  as a -- as a secretary or something like that  so I was in -- I was in day school  and sometimes I would stay with the Breekers in the evening.
They were still going to school  too  but I think til 1941  and then they were not allowed to school -- go to school any more.
Later on  the father of a friend did a history of the high school.
I went to officer candidate school and became I was an artillery officer.
And my cousin  the first cousin that I had  that he because he lived across the street from the school and instead to rid the school  they hit the house nearby where he lived.
But my father decided to organize a school for the children in the camp and he did that.
Well  after the liberation I went to the first years of high school.
And I had a  quite a good year  from the  let us sa y from the emotional and  point of view   however  our standard of life went way down because my father is a lawyer  did not earn one penn y  only what my  the very poor salary which I earned and my sister also teaching in some school.
Anyway that s where I went to school for the first year.
And that was it then I found out from myself from a woma n who was the librarian in the high school in the neighboring town  the daughter of a Lutheran minister  who t ook it upon herself to assemble a history of the Jews of that whole area.
When you arrived and you were put into school  because now you've got to go to American school.
This was taken in the school building when we were living there  after the bombardment.

I [indecipherable] so bad  I never went to a a high education  because I missed too much in school in France.
I had to work very hard  24 because the French school system at the time was very difficult to get through.
Well  I attended my my basic education I attended in public schools and uh later I was admitted to the university  the technical university in Bratislava and I don't seem to recall suffering much from anti-Semitism until after I was out of school.
And so you were in this Jewish school after public school  this wa s between grades what and what?
And she worked there  and our girl went to nursery school there.
She called him Barney gets to go to school  Onnie gets to go to school.
The name of the pr incipal of the school  of that shop was Chaimowicz.
And  also  my sister was a very pretty  feminine  little girl and she could get away with a lot that I couldnt because my father decided very early that I have to be a doctor and I was a good student in school but I wa s always knew that I have to have very good gra des because  this  I wa s the oldest one and I had to further my education.
It meant you had to go to service  I think twice a week  generally on Sundays  and the  I have to tell you another thing about another school  generally on Sundays and it was instructional and that it  you learned the Morse alphabet  or you learned the flags  in the navy  you know  a  b  c  d  x and all.

So I had no education other than a high school education  and I was drafted in February of of 1943  and I took my basic training at the infas infamous Fort Hood  or at that time was known as Camp Hood.
So  he had these two franchises that kind of brought him back on his feet and things were looking up  and we were growing up and ready for school and– I want to ask you some questions about your sisters  but Im curious  when you all were singing  was there someone playing the piano?
I was close to fourteen years old  I was still 13 years old  when I finished that trade school but it forced me to learn--to be a pastry maker.
I just didn't have the  the courage to go school  college.
Who would be better at the... There were always in the family an uncle or another person that always will test you on a Saturday night what you learned in school during the week.
I should have been in fifth grade  but I skipped so much school that I really didnt have the skills any more.
I wouldn't call this a better job  because when it came to being  they only took into the police boys that had high school education.
So  there was a woman who said oh  I'll tell you  I just come here for business  but I live in a little town about 17 miles from   and I am sure that you can go to school there because schools in Russia are free.
AR: The ghetto had an orchestra and it so happens the first violinist of the orchestra of the ghetto didn't have a bow and I gave him the bow which I had when I was a child because when I was a child besides going to regular school  I also went to music school  took the Video Tape No.
Were you upset that you werent seeing your friends  or did -- I saw my fr -- -- you see your non-Jewish friends after school?
And their boys had gone to school in England   and one of them had gone to Palestine.
We had other activities through  you know  thr-through the school  and I made other friends in school  and so th ey they werent necessarily really connected with the synagogue.
Uh the children were in school and the fathers were at their place of work and the mothers were in in the houses cooking and things  and just were arrested  one after another  put to...not not given time uh to pack anything.
No  the schooling was -- and I went to a special high school that was of a kind -- because from early age my father determined that I s hould be an engineer.
Here in the States  we're very grateful for the education into high school which is free of charge.
I went through a Civil War interest period  and about the time of the appearance of William Shirers book  ﬁThe Ri se and Fall of the Third Reich ﬂ I began to become interested in the military history of World War   and that matured into an interest in the political history of the second World War  a nd the Nazi regime by my high school years.
But other than that  the year went uneventful again  and you went to school and you -- my Uncle Jupiter was not too {Coughs} excited ab out it because he was a businessman.
And in the -- in the boarding school  the principal used to  you know  call me in  and I remember getting a letter from -- my parents got out in '41.
So my father says you know theres a  theres a school in Yafa   the outskirts of Tel Aviv.
In January  I was in high school in Paterson  New Jersey  and became a high 18 school student like everybody else in the United States and enjoyed it very much.
I now was living with the rich uncle in America and his American wife and going to school in Forest Hills  Long Island  P.S.3.
And in junior from junior you can go to medical school Oh  you can?
Well  so the next  when I was probably 16  I suddenly was in the Communist school in different city.
And -- and when I -- I saw that I needed some more money because I was getting older  I went to night school in -- Thomas Jefferson in -- in Brooklyn   to be able to get enough money so I can have -- a-at least go to movies or something like that.
We cant use you.ﬂ I mean  I was I had taken a course in school  but I was not a seamstress.
Did you stay in the same school system for your For three years  then went to Beirut  Lebanon  where I spent five years there at the international college.
And when you went to Sunday school  was it terrible for you?
And not only that  but every child had to be at school.
There are songs written which was th ere were secret groups in a school  and the songs were against one occupier a nd another occupier.
And I I couldnt wait to get out of there  which I managed first of all to be sent to the school of infantry  and that was a course  company commanders course.
Do you think they came he re to  to  to go to a rabbinical school?
And they took over a place  they call it Adjibat school.
I had to sign a paper that I would go to school and get a creden tial.
The child was away two and a half years  and when we came back from the sanatorium  my husband was enrolled in a school  which came under the rehabilitation progr am of the State of New York  and he became an accountant and he completed a program in nine months which really takes two years.
So I remember the first two years of elementary school we were integrated.
But later on  you know  when I was already 12 years  13  I remember certain things  yeah  in school.
What kind of school did you attend  was it public or private?
And my brother also got a dditional e -- when e -- we had English in s -- in school  but he got additional lessons.
It was young uh girls--uh  at the age of fifteen  sixteen-who were interested in knowing  because before the war they went to Polish school and Yiddish was strange to them.
So we came here and I went to school and I had -- I want to say hello to Mrs. Harris who in the third grade was so wonderful to me.
And then  of course  when I went to grad school  my mother was sick and it made it very -- very difficult.
Advertising people and mostly people lik e that and maybe so me people whom Jim had known as a child  because in fact I had met a couple of  of people he had gone to high school with and I became extremely friendly with one young woman who had gone to high school with him  who stay ed my best friend until she died a couple of years ago  you know  th ey lived in Connecticut  but that was a couple who was extremely close to us.
Sometimes they were dating people who were teaching school where I went.
We were no longer allowed  uh  to go to parks to go to movies  have businesses  and to uh  go to school  uh  no kind of education  um  we uh  uh could not buy uh  uh food or  or anything in stores  we had to wait till the last one was served before if ever we did get it that we could ask for something.
We're talking now prob ably around 1937  I guess  wh en you graduated from high school.
They used to live in Los Angeles  but they found there a very good place for the children to go to religious school  and they are practicing -- they are definitely practicing Judaism  and the -- Rachel was very an xious to go to Israel  she went to Israel in a group called Young Judea  which is unde r the auspices of the Hadassah.
They were state schools  as the Ukrainians and Russians  but I told you that first  I wanted to go to a Jewish school.
And he said  I really envy you of having all these experiences  while I  he said  I went to grammar school  then high school  then college.
What do you remember about any cha nges at school after the anschluss?
He was engin eer; at that time he was workin g  he was going to school and he was working  and so we went to the Rabbi and we went first to the civil  we had to go  and then 14 to the Rabbi  or the other way around  I dont rememb er if they were the same day.
But I didn't get to practice that  those that much  I mean I went to school and it was French  so I spoke French at school and then they taught me Hebrew  they started to in that school and  you kno w  I just had great ease of learning so they used to parade me in front of  you know  they were trying desperately to get money for the school and so the donors came and  you know  you have to parade the monkeys in front of them  so they  I was their monke y  you know  they knew that they could rely on me for giving the right answers and reading and doing all these things to see their wonderful methods of teaching and so I would really take advantage of that.
So I had four years of high school English and I thought I spoke fluent English.
One of my classmates in physical therapy school told me that.
And he told the story that they met  they knew each other from the beginning from prior years in Switzerland where they were studying at the same school and this little Pleti was a small little boy  Jewish  weak  and how the older people  the stronger bo ys  they were terrorizing him.
I didn't want to go to school  I didn't want to participate in anything  only hustle.
I don't know how long she was in the hospital but she had to be removed from school and had to have surgery.
And my life at home  my life in school  which I remember from the first grade on  the teachers and students and everything.
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala January 27  2015 121 As I was walking to school  this was  I think toward the end of May no  toward the end of April  because May  th-the uprising stopped.
And it takes the kids up through uh secondary school  through junior high school  but then for further education  uh the kids have to attend the public schools or other private schools.
Like  even in Latin  I was getting harder work  like when we had an exam at school  she would put me at the end of the class with a longer exam because she didnt want me to sit there while the others were still struggling.
This is my first year of school  my first grade class.
Not that I was a cook  but I had a cookery book in Austrian for -- what a -- somebody gave me and you wouldnt believe it  but they liked my cooking  because the girls ha d never eaten -- I su -- I suppose an Austrian would have thrown me out nex-next day  but they -- but these girls in the school had never eaten my cook -- Austrian cooking and they liked it.
I think boys and girls were separate in school  Im pri -- Im sure they were  but to religious school we all went together.
And with the public schools here in Louisville in such a mess  they want to put the boy into parochial school.
Anyway  so Idid -- what I did myself in order to express my feelings  afternoon or at night I come to the  to a new -- through this old building of the high school and stole Hebrew books and brought them home and I was very happy.
I was -- I was rushing through school so much that when I graduated early  I didnt get to attend the graduation ceremonies with my friends because I was already at the next level.
But so it was not exactly a glorious time staying in that school  but it saved our lives.
When I came out of that ghetto  I did have to go to school to finish I have only six classes.
Yes  I went to -- You went as a little boy  as a little boy you went to public school with Jewish -- Public school for four years.
So the first hour in the school was devoted to Catholic catechism.
Well  the main building was used in the school and administration  but then we were in some barracks  all around.
I used my skill and knowledge from school and I produced profit and losses and balance sheets and those  which was something new.
And I -- I certainly had to decide on which college  but there -- I dont remember ever questioning that I would go to graduate school.
Well  Ill tell you  my sister Selma had a major influence on me  both in terms of going to Horace Mann  because she had also had some cat ching up to do school-wise  having not gone to school for several years.
In Limoges I went to school and I have a feeling that I was kind of lonesome but there was some -- I remember some really nice things.
So French  which I -- as I say I really learned to speak quite fluently and I went to school there  and then I took it again for  I dont know  a f -- a few years in high school.
The Amer icanization school was then on 18th and Columbia Road on California Street.
And there were children who danced and this was our school and this was our social hall.
Since my mother worked in the office  it was in the same apartment  I had a babysitter  or whoever it was  a part-time governess who'd come in after school hours and do homework with me and read with me  take me out to the park.
Mine was  well dual  Greek primarily because of my friends and going to school  but at home it was obligatory to spea k French  bo -- my mother was a teacher of French  and my father had studied in Paris  or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in French.
I say  you know how many fours I had when I was in school?
So I had to go to Jewish school in 1936  and I went to this school until Easter of 1940.1 So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of school.
Now you also had to leave Sunday school  so you couldnt see -- because this is 19 -- No  but I -- yeah -- Well  37 -- 37 Im -- -- hes already -- is -- I was home for the first time from boarding school for summer vacation  and then came the news that he had been arrested.
So like I said I  I cant remember when my elementary school teacher told us we had to say Heil Hitler.
I walked to the school  it was probably three-quarters of a mile  every day  from where we lived to the school.
So now you and your brother are going to school  every day?
All the other cities  they have transportation from one school to the other one  even private.
For a long time  I used to have anxiety attacks when I would have to plug in an outlet and it was especially painful to me  because I went to school and I majored in biochemistry and I taught physics and biology and I would have to do these experiments with the class and I would have to plug these things in and I'd get these horrible anxiety attacks when it had to do with electrical things and magnets and things like that in physics.
Increased incidences in anti-Semitism  increased -- Well  as I told you  the -- the mob of the Hitler youth on our way to school and from school.
Well  let's say for one thing the Hungarians had a similar thing to the Hitler Jugend  which was called Leventer(Ph) and everybody was all  any kid over 12 year old had to be in it  it was like a pre-military training  but did not involve any weapons or anything at that point yet  it was mainly sort of to be in a group  be in an organization  be under command  be drilled  perform together  march together and things of that sort and again  let's say I should say that I went to Hungarian Gymnasium  which is secondary school  and I became  in 1939 I was 10 and it was  for me it was a big step in life  going from elementary school to this big  middle school  which was an eight year school and I went there for the first two years and my father had the notion that I should do very well in school so I could get into a university and in that respect he was quite unrealistic and quite  just wouldn't accept the world as it was because no matter what kind of grades I would have gotten in that school  the chances of my getting into a university with my father being not on the top  on the accepted list or preferred list was virtually nil.
One -- one these letters weret -- ones from a mother has written us a letter and she says in the letter  this says  ﬁWhen my son comes home from school  I ask him  ﬁHow was school today?ﬂ He said  ﬁAh ﬂ just [indecipherable] and said  ﬁAh.ﬂ This time  after we spoke there  he came back  he didnt wait ev en for the question  he said  ﬁOh  you know  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 138 today we had some people from the concentration camp and it made so much big impression on me.ﬂﬂ She was so ex-ex-ex-excited about it  tells us the story.
As luck would have it  he also had a son who just graduated from law school.
So you had cultural activities  you had school  you had sports?
We were four or five Jewish children in town and at Hebrew school we had a teacher.
They went to  well when we lived in New York they went to  my daughter went to religious school  my son was too young.
And where did you and your sister end up going to school?
I was called one night one evening I was called in and was told that Washington   in quotes  at that time wanted me to go to wanted me to go to the intelligence school  which was at Fort Ritchie  right in in Maryland here  then called Camp Ritchie.
I I was always interested in foreign countries  and I used I loved to go to the to the library in the aftern day after school  and and read all the city newspapers about what was happening.
I went through high school  and that's as far as I went.
In school I had to learn the Latin  the French and Polish and my English  the accent is broken.
And shes teaching and then she went -- teaching grammar school  she wanted.
Yes  I was able  but sometimes it happe ns that somebody was shouting on me or doing something  I had to go from the school very quic kly and I was afraid.
I had started school in Brighton Beach  Brooklyn  at PS 225  with Mrs. Field  in class 5A. I will say that in the course of that first term  I  I got to speak English fluently.
The Greek fellows of our transport broke into the clothing stores of the Hitler Youth School and emerged with brown Hitler Youth uniforms.
I went to do a high school soccer game and Hans Gut was also one of their one of we were three referee three three people.
Well  we found out later that these women had become pregnant with uh  uh  German soldiers and the children were uh  taken after they had reached a few years old and put into a school  taken away from their mothers and put into a school and later on as they grew up  there was a small military camp.
You know  for instance  for a Jew to be accepted to high school  he had to have much better grades  and had to be much better prepared than a non-Jew.
Well  at this time my wonderful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class -- I mean for their graduation  they have Hebrew school and then  you know  religious school and then the people -- the students who want to go on after their bat mit -- Bar and Bat Mitzvah when -- they call them to confirmation class.
We started our own school there  and I remember that there were 3 woods.
Interview with Fred Firnbacher September 16  2010 59Conclusion of Interview you wanted to go  but you were going to ask me a question  so well go that its a one room schoolhouse  there were abou t six or eight of us  each one of us a different grade  and he taught us all  and I think we learned more there than we would have in public school.
I-In school all the students and teachers were as nice and friendly and cooperative as possible.
School was pleasant too  at times difficult  which is something that -- that ev ery child meets.
But hopefully  if I get well soon enough  we're going to try it again  because I think it is very  very important th at we share our experi ences  for one thin  to discredit the people who ar e claiming that there was no Holocaust and also for those people who come after us and I'm afraid there is too little written about it in school books where the children can learn abo ut it and so whatever way that they can learn about this most horrible happening of the 20th ce ntury  I think it is very important that they learn.
And so I was -- I was doing that and -- and going to school at the same time.
I was thinking to go to school but there was uh very difficult in 1951 to go to college especially I don't know...was no no English and uh first I have to work and start uh...so uh in 1956 I was uh married to a girl named uh Dorothy Goodrich .
Theres a gimna -- gimnasium  which is like a high school  and also technical schools for the rich.
It was the end of that school that were mixed  the Poles and the Jews together.
Did you have... No  no  I wasn't so cr azy about school.
So then we went to the school which was Atenao  a parochial school for boys.
Tell me a little about the fact th at you mentioned that you're ba sically taller and stronger... and the business about your father letting you be an apprentice... Before I go to that I just want to mention that as a result of th e pressure being put on my mother to take me out of that high school  I ended up commuting to the high school in Sosnowiecz  where my uncle was the director of the high scho ol.
So  and he had a da ughter  and somehow I had a lot of friends in the Italian school in Budapest  the Italian embassy ma intained a school.
Q. So those two years that you spent in school  do you remember which grades they were  which classes you were in  which grade?
No  not far from St. Lawrence  which was by coincidence turned out year later as a school for Paul.
And I did want to leave  because I guess that my feeling  after a few years there you see  going to the American school ha was a it was a mixed blessing in some ways  because my classmates  who were all American  were children of diplomats  business people  an d they kept coming and going.
I...you know  because I was uh...uh only 11 and a half years old  and uh...still had to go to school.
But after that Jean and I went over to Montgomery and helped work on another  on a school case for several days.
When you were in school in Berlin   was there did you feel different from the other kids  because you were Jewish?
Right up her alley  and she  in Breslau went to school and studied physiotherapy.
Th e school would start  I believe about eight 15 or so  would be over by 11:30.
Couldnt believe that we were Jewish  that my father  particularly the he took  when he would see them  the medical school and so on  as patients  to speaking to them in German  because then they thought  oh then maybe this person sp speaks an odd dialect of Yiddish.
I mean  and the other uncle  had been a teacher and so he tried to learn diamonds  but he really wasn't gif ted and so he got a job in the school  that Hebrew school.
But because of the background and because of the school I was not involved in it.
but started the school  and when one from then Texas  and my oth the older brother lives in Texas now [indecipherable] but he went came here  and we went together to to Lvov.
And the sequel was that my pattern of circles again  is that 50 years later  my wife and I were in Vienna  were going to Vienna and wanted to go to the Spanish riding school  to see a performance there.
So I came here and I went to high school and that's it.
So you were with child -- And I was the only Jewish kid in the whole school.
Because  you see like for instance  I was not long ago I was in the -- to speak in a -- in -- in a school  and there was -- it wasnt -- there were not Jewish students  there were mostly Christians.
So in school he met with more kids than that  when he started school  which at five  you know what I mean?
Turin  which had a university  a medical school and a Polytechnic Institute.
And so against their advice I got my first job in downtown New York in a dye and tool making place  based on my experience and the school.
But there was name of my school friend who survived the war because she was in the group in ghetto that was in hiding.
I went to a secular state school  middle sc hool because it was exactly next door to my house.
Does so when you went to this sc hool  this Orthodox school  did did you stand besides being called the Kraut Didnt last long.
Do you know how it came to be that you were sent to a boarding school rather than taken in by a family?
And -- and I  after having my first hot dog  this is 42 another early memory  is being taken to Nathans in Brooklyn to have my first hot dog  which probably cost 10 cents at the time  and -- and then s-starting school here.
So well  my father had to pay to clean the walls  repain t them  and I left and I went to a school in Bornheim.
And so we went to school together and sometimes we didn't see each other during the day because we were not in the same class.
What they did while I was away in school  is that they smashed all our showcases.
And she told me that on Friday afternoons in school  they would say  \ Who is going to take Ellie?
And then we moved to Long Branch   New Jersey  where I went to school  and my mother and father worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family  with a New York lawyer.
And from that moment on  she [phone rings] –She came fr om the high school.
And after that we were not allowed to go to school any more  my mother said no  we were not going to go.
It was a very  very good school  and it had the regular curriculum of the Venezuel an government  you know  whatever the Ministry of Education had  plus a Jewish curriculum.
They built  you know  that colonies when they came  they built beautiful school  we have we have  and we live not too far of the wood you know  forest.
Just called the Shanghai Jewish school  is that where you went?
And I told them I was a high school graduate .
I mean I didnt have to be in public school until nine oclock so I started cheder in the morning like 6:30.
We mixed with the friends that I had in school  but socially we hadn't mixed.
But since kindergarten her mother used to bring her to school every single day.
As he is speaking  we hear troops marching by the school  Japanese troops were marching by  occupying the Ma rine barracks across the street from us.
They came to the house and they were begging me to come to speak in the high school there.
I had a lot of private school friends by that time  because of camp  and -- and Sunday school.
I had to do exams from the nor mal school because I didn't have schools  yes?
School you could  if you gave some kids protection money  they would prot ect you and you could have your commandos  and for a centime or two or so  you coul d ﬁbuy your protectionﬂ and they would become your protectors  and I had my allo wance  whatever  maybe a quarter a week which I would spend maybe ten centimes a week to pay off these guys.
I really maybe  maybe I got married a li ttle too quick  maybe if I would have gone to school before I got married  maybe my mothers idea wasnt the best one.
And I also remember that I was not allowed to answer questions in school  even if I knew the answer.
She hated the traveling part of it  because it -- it entailed being on a school bus for an hour each way every single day.
So there was a girl in school that I lamented to many times  Dorothy   because many time I just wanted to quit.
I was enrolled in a high school in New York  at the Seward Park High School  which was on the east side.
And obviously I was well off that I was -- I was out of school 15 years.
And after the war we had a big influx of Jews from -- from eastern Europe from Nort h Africa and -- and the second generation or third generation of -- of the Jews born to Russian immigrants or Polish immigrants because the school system is so open went to higher education and all of a sudden they are engineers or .
First I went to public school and then they sent me to private  one of the best private schools in town.
As a matter of fact  there was a school in Berlin where the children of the em-embassies  American  Englis h  would go and learn English  and speak -- get their own education  the British education.
And something that I didnt ask you about  you spoke English because you had learned it in school  is that right?
Previous to that  what did you do befo re you finished high school?
Uh .. one of the people who worked for the British Red Cross  a lady -- I spoke so me English because I had taken English in school  and probably spoke more than a passable English -- not really great but more than passable.
And it was in the same school that I dont know what grade he was  but anyhow  the there was a time when the ve Viennese Jews came to Poland .
It must have been expensive  there were all kinds of kids of Its a private school.
So I said to my mother  \ I want to go to school too\ .
Well  you mentioned that there was a boa t  a ship going across the ocean that where something sank  like your your cerifi Oh  that was my school certificate.
Not in terribly significant ways  but one instance that come to mind was  not long after I had been there  I had put the whole organization to work to develop a list of requirements  how many of this  that and the other machines do you need in your school  in your district  in the Zone?
I  I took off for a session of the summer school at Columbia University and took medical librarianship and my teacher there came from Washington and was chief of reference in the Armed Forces Medical Library which is the predecessor of the National Library of Medicine.
I found out later almost all my friends from the school did not.
Then they came again and they said no school  no Jews are allowed to go to school; no Jews are allowed to congregate; no Jews are allowed to go to the synagogue; no Jews are allowed to have communications of any kind with one another.
I know my kids never wanted so much to go to school and they had not the condition.
So I didnt turn out -- Im going to the right school  and -- well  in Heidelberg.
But my mother was old  my brother went to school there.
He went he went he wanted to continue with his Jewish education  because they were very  very good Jewish and by the way  Jerry won the valedictoria in Hebrew  he was so good in that Westchester Day School.
Interview with Dino Brugioni November 13  2014 12 I was I was a a sophomore in high school.
So I found my way in and emptied the cookies and distributed them thro ughout the school  and I said  well  I better not be here when he comes back .
No  this had nothing to do  we just wa nt to give them [indecipherable] school  if they want it  if we would be able to  to give them a better education.
When I got my first job after graduate school -- no  no  no.
But my son did his PhD. in England   in scon London School of Economics.
I then ended up at Northeastern University at night  there was a Springfield division of Northeastern University -- it was a high school equivalency certificate and I went to Northeastern for six years -- always continuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales person.
And I always wanted to have the same cl othes as she did  I was dreaming of her being left back in school so we could be in the same grade.
Values of love  peace  justice  and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a school to be...uh....wholeheartedly going in one direction.
We were always worried  but we had the children and we had school.
He said  ﬁYeah  well wh-what do -- exception would you have?ﬂ ﬁAn exception for height.ﬂ I know that the minimum is five foot in o -- in -- in officers school the same thing  but they give a -- a exception.
And most of the people who are here  I show later in a big picture  went to this Jewish school organized by Jewish community center and many are now in the United States  some are in Israel.
And then my late husband says   you do it anyway  go back to sc get the degree  and and do it full tim e. So I went back to school and I did it because I still tend to overextend myself.
They had a long history of religious oppression  so they had a tradition--there is a very strange population who understands oppression and that's why when we were in Brive--actually the assistant mayor  his wife was a music teacher--the assistant mayor was also I think a principal in the school.
You just went to school  Im -- I attended a Hebrew gymna sium where all the subjects were taught in modern Hebrew.
Here I was -- my father was working his rear end to go ahead and send me to school  my only preoccupation was to make a decent grade  which I tried to do a little bit by studying  but a lot by cheating.
Is that where your completed your high school and college education?
And my parents decided to take her out of the school.
And one year  the first year when I speculated like that  all winter  on my school re-record  I had six two.

And then my the school that I went to in England   and I dont really have a 9 clear picture of that school in London   decided to evacuate everybody out to the country.
They were so gullible probabl y  and they believed that another few months  another few months everything will come back to normal so we shouldn't lose time and we should be tutored privately so we can attend school after the war is over and everything comes back to normal.

During this time you  I'm trying to get the chronology right  at this point had you graduated from med school yet or just school?
Somehow the Germans didn't enjoy this very much and they started to play pretty rough in school and started to round some of the kids up and so forth and some of the teachers must have been in contact with the Maquis of the French underground and I was called out a few times to help them with translation  translating German letters or documents that they found.
So that's why I went to the knoll  to see who was really going  and I saw some friends of mine and another girl that I went to school with and her father and her sister.

My sister and I  we took private lessons  but not in school.
About  when she first came to this country in junior high school  she changed it to Carol because she didnt want to be called Suzy.

But what I remember was that I was not happy in school.

Let me ask you  you mentioned that your brother had gone back to school  and how strange it was to sort of all of a sudden be studying  you know  open your book to page one.
But then  you know  towards the end of high school I was -- I got more into it.
My aunt thought it would be good if we started school  but at first she uh used to tutor so we would learn English  and he was wonderful.
My sisters must have been up preparing to go to school.
There was another high school right near  not far from me  maybe 15Šminute walk  but this was a very wellŠknown  scholarly school.
I tried to assimilate or be like everybody else  but yet  I knew I was different  because there the fi the girls at school  their their way of doing things   the way the ate  the way they their behavior was so different than mine.
There was a Jewish financier in Sweden who opened up a boarding school and my mother was successful to enroll me.
We children -- the school was -- consisted of just maybe a hundred children.
My wife   born in Berlin  my first wife born in Berlin went to a German school so she knew both Ge rman and Yiddish and in in October 1938 the German government got into a dispute with the Polish government because the Polish government was was not very friendly to Jews   very reactionary and almost anti-Semitic  accepted a law that uh the passports of people li ving outside of Poland had to be renewed  but that the passport of Jews living  for instance  in Germany  would not be renewed which meant that uh those people would loose their their th eir Polish citizenship and nationality and the Germans uh...and after all  there were thousands of Jews from Poland liv ing in Germany still then.
Actually  for th e first time about a -- a month ago  I went to the Hungarian consulate  which is a gorgeou s  gorgeous brownstone in the east 60s  because this friend of mine from Boston  that I went to school with  is a wonderful photographer.

And was the the only Jewish kid in in school in that town  and the only Jewish kid that anybody in that town at least  the children had seen.

And I think as middle school kids  too  to know the history   to know the history of our country and the changes that have come about in our country is important  too.
Ou r whole school  all the boys wearing the same sweater.
And  you know  everybody keeps telling me  didn't you hate school?
So  my memories of growing up in Milan are memories of a quiet childhood  going to school there  going on vacation Public school?
Because five class -- five were ca -- public school  that means the lower classes  and th en there for six years in the gymnasium  thats 11 years  and you started with six years  so that was 17.
Yes  so that was the only issue that was the issue  but I promised  I promised solemnly that I would finish school  that I would go back to school  and when I came to the States  I thought  oh  God  starting all over again.
I first -- elementary school I went to the Jewish elementary  which was huge.
So I got a little room in the orphanage there and I went to school  back to school  and tried to learn a trade at the same time.
It wasn't that difficult because when the Windsor Mountain School started  there were only about eight students.
Did the school Oh well  yes  yes  because first of all  right  they forbid us to say prayers  because we used to  before lessons started  we used to say short prayers  in the school.
Well  the elementary school they have Hebrew too a little bit.
And for instance  my wife went to the state social training school  okay?
She stayed and as time went on  I -- I continued to take a lot of courses  either at the business school  or at Hopkins  where I went at night and took English and literature and history.
Then in the ev ening they would put the chairs in there and  in fact  you know  since I was so young  I knew so little about the Yiddish culture  that through these plays I have learned a lot about Jewishness and Yiddish culture from way be fore because I had no opportunity to learn this because I went to school during the day and th en I learn  had the Hebrew lessons in the afternoons and such or Hebrew reading  but not  there wasn't enough time to learn about the culture  that would have come later  but I never had the opportunity so this is how I learned some of it.
That was the only year that I had school out of the nine gr ades required by Czech law  I had three years all together  and that was one of the three.
This is a picture of my father standing in the middle surrounded with a group of his students  of the students of the e -- Jewish technical school in Wilna  made in Wilna in 1934.

J: And I went to Hebrew school  and he was my Hebrew school teacher.
I went to public school until I was 12  and that last year I commuted.
And after the summer was over  she enrolled me in the local high school and this is what I think is interesting  because I was 16 and I -- she managed to place me in the 11th grade  which I could never have been in  had I stayed in Holland.
When you were a young girl  before the war  what did you do for for fun or for entertainment when you were not in school and not in services?
This is school  its -- I tried to explain to my wife  its a high school and college combined.
I didnt really kiss  I didnt think it was sanitary enough to kiss the ring  but I did and from then on I went to high school.
And I looked up the name of one school friend of mine and sure enough  there it was.
Well  the nec -- the day after when I went to school a friend of mine came running up the stairs  you cant go to school  theres a pogrom.
When we  when my  when I was in the high school  in Oradia  from '37 when Barbara Farkas 75 December 9  1995 we moved to Oradia  til '40  three years  the last three years of high school  I was going to the State high school in Oradia  by name  .
And so I got the benefit of a British boarding school education for the two years we were there.
You had just finished school  your father was now working  you were in this place.
That was nice  but then it also that was a nice day or something  but the regular days  going to school was not nice  because I was the only Jewish girl  and everybody made fun of me  you know.
I did go to the Jewish school where obviously you had the regul ar Yugoslav curriculum for -- for grade school  it went from one to four.
But these school -- trade school  they had at least an idea how a normal person works.
And the hospital had -- they gave me a stipend  which meant they paid me a full salary while I went to graduate school.
I arrived here on August the fifth  I went to school at the beginning of September and by that time I s poke English.
So you completed high school   you went to high school?
Well  there was a lot of hitting  you know  rulers on the hands and there was a a lot of disciplining  and since I didnt understand what the discipline was for  it was frightening  and and I really did I hated going to school.
My husband opened the pharmacy and me  they wanted to teach in school and  because I wasnt prepared to teach young children  I was prepared to teach at gymnasium  I had a Masters Degree by then  my gis-trof-osovisia which was a high Degree .
But she hired me some tutors for Latin  and for so  went to India   went to high school  to the first first year of high school  and I was struggling a little bit.
I -- And is high school four years the way it is here?
She enrolled me to school  we we re she was dressed up  you know  very Interview with Eva Brettler November 9  2008 12fashionable  and dressed me up pretty.
In the later years  in 1937  I applied to go to agriculture school in Palestine.
Its just that I brought to it a certain attitude already  which of course lasted me for the lifetime  that school is jo y and I loved it and it was good.
In Germany  they call the high school... They don't call it high school; they call it \ gymnasium.\

So when I -- so in March  when I became 6  I had to go to school.
I smoked one evening with -- w ith a friend of mine that I went to junior high school with  that was my next closest friend  right after camp  I went to junior high school  eighth grade  on the we st side  and -- and shes still -- were still USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 25 very good friends.

But when look -- when looked at from the big perspective  it was always my mother who was the one who was involved in all of the school activities for the parents and in support of the children.
This -- this was never a re -- a religious community  but for instance  my daughter Jane went to Jewish gr ade school in -- in Caracas.
We both graduated and then I went to law school at the University of California Berkeley  Bolt Hall   which is about as -- as premier a law school as Harvard   right.

I was in a Jewish school with all Jewish girls and boys who all loved me.
So there were sort of remnan ts of different student in different schools  so that was the new school.
Course  they got a little exposure to that in school  but what was the Holocaust ?
As a matter of fact I received a cer tificate from my teacher  uh Jewish teacher  only Jews were taught by Jews  and it said in there this letter is instead of certificate because the certificate was destroyed by fire   which was the fire in the synagogue  and uh  this man by the way is still living in New York  my old head teacher from the Jewish school and he is 87 years old today and I'm still in touch with him.

But it was a very nice school and everyone there was Jewish and they were all new faces to me.
You know  there was always somebody who was taken aw ay by the Germans  so the school was not a normal school year.
And so the three younger ones went to this very  very g ood private school and it made a terrific difference.
At some point  the Foote school  which was a wonderful private school  made really wonderful by the fact by one fact of discrimination  that Yale had no women teachers  so that many of the teachers in this little private school were the wives of professors  and immensely learned  and interesting and so on.
I went to -- I would go to the Protestant elementary school in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a cheder  to a -- a Hebrew school which was in a buildi ng adjacent to the big synagogue in The Hague.

But school  I remember my f -- early on  I had to -- I came home with a poem  which I had to learn by heart.
It was a preparatory school for young women for young ladies.
You could see that principally in that -- with the formation of this youth group  then very often y -- friends would appear in school already dressed in that uniform  not only -- not because they really wanted it so much  because they were ready to go to a mee ting afterwards  and they didnt want to go back home and change.
So we ended up sleeping in that school  together with all the others  a-and and thats as wa you know  what are you do?
But I remember finally going to school and I knew how to speak eight languages.
Well  [indecipherable] a bit later for -- Yeah  but you [indecipherable] -- a-and the whole family  and the -- the boy was one year in the senior American school in London.
It started  I think  on the 28th of October  when a number of students from the school where I had been at that time were of Polish descent  and they were sent away.
We moved after ten years  out a little ways  near a school where Michael was going to elementary school.
And so by Wednesday  I mean you can imagine how I felt when I got to school.

So  he arranged for me this school  lik e  found this school that was for gifted people that was in a half a year you could do a year.

When I was a little girl and we were going to school  the janitor and his two daughters were always helping us with galoshes because the climate in our town was very severe in wintertime and many times we would share our lunches  we considered them our friend.
When I came to the United States  I actually started in private school.
And I remember coming home from school and often going up there and visiting with some of the workers.
And so my mother was making arrangements to see what the school about me tr ying out  well both of us  trying to get back into school in the Fall.
We talked about with friends and in school and parents  too.
And there was a young man that I knew that I really knew yet from the Russian occupation because he went to the same school that I did  but he was older.
And t hen I had  my oldest son was seven and the younger was three  I took him to school and  okay  after a very short time he learned English  but it was a big deal from him  you know.
I remember a time being in a sort of a nursery school with a nun  and we went on a walk.
I went to a public school  a gymnasium in Germany  in Berlin  where we were educated according to the very strict rules of German humanism.
I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about it because if the German find out that we have a secret school  they are going to burn the village and we have to have a school.
My school commander just couldn't see how we could be betrayed like that and left.
After the day school they finished in Westchester Day School first Im talking about Jerry.
I never joined a temple  my son never had a Bar Mitzvah   simply because my first husband didnt want to pay for it  I couldnt pay fo r it  and I was very angry because I wanted to just send him to religious school just for the training and they wouldnt do that.
Anyway  from like I said from Pasay we did finally move to Ermita because first of all there were no jobs to be had over where we were living in Pasay and there was a nice school with American nuns and I think really that was the main reason that my parents moved to Ermita.
The one who is very interested in this now is Rebecca  the 11 year old granddau ghter  who goes to Hebrew school in Potomac  Maryland and theyre doing a good job there about educating the children on the Holocaust.
I felt I was again with my family  so uh I started this uh Victor High School  but it was hard for me.
So after school I would go and run all these errands and things and because I learned English very quickly.

So in our life  I speak about  you know  23  and I got to school when I was 5 and a half  20 years  29  30  32  and all the way up to...I would say...I remember the date on 1938  that my father was at the table sitting at lunch time.

Before they formed the ghetto  were you going to school or was school suspended?
In that school of Franciszkanska where I have the picture where the German took a picture in color.

So I didn't have to go to a public school whereas some of the children at that time  Jewish children were already beginning to have problems.
So in you know  in transit we could stay then  and we my parents rented a room to live in and we ate at my uncles  and it was a I went to s of course started going to school in Holland  went to a trade school and learned a trade and on then the American visa came up and my parents ni the decision  the family decision was to take we had three numbers th at my mother had gotten for my father  my mother and me.

He went to the same school that my father went before he went in many years  but it was the same kind of setting.
Over there I went in some trouble and I quit the school and went to work in a resort place.
Because to send two boys to his school was a big expense  a big effort.

If you wanted a higher education  as I did  you went to a differen t school where you sat for eight years.
And I was -- since my father had been in the World War I and fought at the front  I was -- the Jewish children whose parents fought  their fathers fought in the front  they were allowed to go to German high school.

I dont recall seeing anything like that  except for when well  now  even when they took the children out of school  they didnt forcibly tear them apart or what have you.
I -- for some reason -- by the way my sister didnt -- did not  she married a Gentile  she married that Russian  I was -- very -- very possible because I suffered from an -- anti-Semitism all my life  being o-only one in school  and being one in school in Leningrad  and being so outcasted  that I want to be among my -- among my own.
