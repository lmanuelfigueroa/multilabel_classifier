>> Manny Mandel: Well  school was -- I began school at the age of 6 and 42.
So in high school I have not terribly good memories of all of that.
The teachers  they came to school every day in very difficult times to teach us.
But um  I uh  I remember it um  now  actually I was terribly busy  you know  first of all  my father had suffered a heart attack just a few weeks earlier  and was a great deal of uh concern and turmoil and all that  and this was our prime concern  and another of course  um  school was going to start in another week or so  so you know I was getting ready for school and talking to my friends  and um  n-not really truly being aware of uh  of what might be happening  and that was the last week of August or so.

You know it was very important not to look neglecte d. What was very strang e  the directress of the school  I think  she knew very we ll who am I. I thin k some people called her and ask her to take me.
By strange coincidence  the other high school was a private high school; however the majority of Jews  Jewish children  went to a school which was called the handlowka.2 That was a commerce school where you were prepared for accounting  for bookkeeping  so something like that.
The Russians came in and of course that school was closed and we went to a Russian school.

Thats a Hebrew school which is -- they had two -- its little bit on the higher standard  as about -- you finish 10  see the sister was there  10 classes in the Talbud.
They said they will supply  you know  the...uh...with gas so I came home from school and the war broke out in September the 5th  39  1 and my life was shattered right away because my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army.
And life was pleasant   you know  with three sisters  sometimes we played together  other times we fought  we did hom ework  there was a beautiful cloc k at the end of our street  and after school we'd go and play there  we'd ride our bikes  we'd play ball on the wall next to our apartment house and life kind of was pleasant.
I did not join a sorority and I was pretty well an outsider  I was an oddball and I had ambitions for the stage and joined play production and eventually did get a role or two and walked from my house in Kew Gardens to those performances in Forest Hills High School on Friday night and Saturday and did that with a lot of trepidation.
He was the -- from the old school  where the father was the lord and master  the husband  you know.

And he went through grade scho ol and unive -- and then -- and high school and university in -- in Israel or m -- and then came to the States and studied and then went back.
I have to say you that in school during the last two days of school  I felt a strong anti-Semitic propaganda because Romanians were avoiding us.
And the sheriff of my home town had his chauffeur to drive me to school.
I also helped my parents later in the bakery which they opened up  and I would work there after school and on weekends  helping out.
And I think he got a lot out of it  so that was good and incidentally  when he was in fourth grade  he asked me once would I come to his school and speak to his class about what happened and I did  and -- Now  is this in LA?
On their way to school would see human remains that were in the streets.
My sisters must have been up preparing to go to school.
In the town that we lived in there was no Jewish day school.
Now  I don't know if my sister and I needed anything because we had to go to school.
At the end when she graduated  the family sent some people to the school to pick out a few to work for the Royal House hold.
So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of high school.
If I had gone into elementary school  probably it would have been better for me because in my nature  it wasn't in me to be a police person.
I think my father had a very– you know  he was very strong with his own convictions and had some very strong ideas  but again  you know  if your kids go in a certain direction– raising children is as difficult for anybody in school.
But even the school  there was no no no latent anti-Semitism.
The few Jews lived in the city and the surrounding around lived the non-Jews but we went together to school and everything.
And the history books in I I should add in my school  they they substituted all of the history books with Nazi edited Right.
They had the scum of earth in ch arge of us  it was not teachers or any– we had to report eith er at school or somewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired in structors that were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in an y movie  any Ameri can movie  because its not that  it was not just the physical  the physical abuse can be tolerated  bu t it is the mental abuse  but that was so  so bad  the way they called us everything  a Jewish this and a Jewish that  an d these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching and  and digging and building  co nstantly  we were abused and constantly even physically so.
We had to prepare our studies privately and take exams at end of the season  at end of the year in the public schools from or given by teachers who were public school teachers.
That was really the reason that I still was allowed to remain in school  that they simply ignored me.
I-In that camp we got under the command of Major Skwarnicki   who formed a special AK school units  because we were youn g guys.
The owner from the Jewish school  from the Hebrew school  lived in my apartment building where I lived.
My ties  and you know I still have very good friends who I went to school with in North Carolina and Gastonia and that sort of thing and in the Service.
They decided they did not want USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 65 to go to grad school.
Well  yeah it was -- I think it was in 1983  and at that time my husband was out of the military  he had a new career  our son was in school  and -- already in college  I guess.
We went to school together  we went and -- and was every -- ev -- it was very  very nice and very  very congenial.
Did you have similar experiences when you went to school in Romania?
And did you share -- as you were growi ng up in high school and in college and so forth  did you share your background with other people?
He had -- they went to school in the small town at night  couple of time.
And he told my mother he was so glad that I didnt show up that day because the principal sent somebody in  youve got the only Jew in th e whole school  send him home.
Do you think that th at school was helpful in terms of morale  in terms of education?
And wa -- did you -- were most of the child ren boys  or girls  or a mix  or -- did everybody go to school?
So we moved to -- the school then eventually moved to Manchester  Vermont  and then to Lenox  Massachusetts.
And when I went into primary school there wasnt a nonJewish child in my class.
They had the scum of earth in charge of us  it was not teachers or any– we had to report either at school or somewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors that were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in any movie  any American movie  because its not that  it was not just th e physical  the physical abuse can be tolerated  but it is the mental abuse  but that was so  so bad  the way they called us everything  a Jewish this and a Jewish that  and these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching and  and digging and building  constantly  we were abused and constantly even physically so.
The Russian school did not enjoy any special privileges and the Polish school did.
As a result though  I was gone about a year and a half and went to school there  i-in Romania  so going back to the - my parents homes.
So when I went back to school at the age of 6  to me -- but I remember May 8  1945  which was the end of the war  the capitulation  unconditional capitulation of the Reich  the sirens blasted also.
And the children was going to school  my sister and me.
Soon as school starts  I get phone calls  and I would say in an average  about five times a month  for sure.
Now  the classroom at the medical school  the anatomy building  is something like this theater.
But theyre kids  and they were born in here  in America  and they go to school  and they -- theyre children.
So I remember after awhile  I had to take the bus to Sunday school and I would take the bus  and I would not get off at Sunday school.
Unfortunately I had to pass the bar within less than a month after school was out.
So this was no big problem  the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are ou tright anti-American  anti-Russian  anti-Sem itic  they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if  if we sh ould tolerate this  if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low  the usual way  and I said  ﬁNo  I am not going to do that.ﬂ There was specifically one teacher who had  I forgot  had a German name   a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very proGerman  but agitating.
It was unbelievable because he went to a religious school  at home because he wore all the Hasidic garb  and the director of the public school was trying to persuade my father he should let him go to the public school because he's such a smart boy  he would have loved to have him there.
In the meantime  my father was involved in expansion of a high school.
And  I began to have a glimpse of another life and then when I started school I very quickly learned how to read and write.
She couldnt believe it  because I th anked them  you know  for integrating us  allowing us -- this the front of my high school .
After coming back from Switzerland  do you -- did you go back to school?
I quit school and I started to -- to partially f-feed my -- my family.
You were saying that you we nt about as far in school as was usual for that time?
And  you know  and I would ask of so me -- because o-of school  people who went -- I mean  kids who went to school with me  you know.
Well very often I walked to school with two friends  and very often there was a dozen of them.
In fact  I went to the same high school that Elvis Presley went to.
So I had four years of high school English and I thought I spoke fluent English.
And he kept talking to me that I should go back to school.
When I came here -- this is amazing -- my parents said  \ You got to finish high school  got to finish high school.\
And I went to as I mentioned  I think  earlier  I went to speak to the Gutenberg gymnasium where I had gone to school.
But because I had worked for a doctor and gone through McLaflins medical school  I knew one bone from the other.
I came to my office  to my school and I told them; th ey took her.
But after that Jean and I went over to Montgomery and helped work on another  on a school case for several days.
And as it turned out the progressive school didn't exactly jive with the Nazi philosophy where everything was controlled and consequently eventually 1938 the school had to -- was closed and the teachers were out of a job had to look for a job -- had to find a job.
She went to school here to speak Eng lish  and she was a seamstress for a period of time and during the war working in a -- a -- as a supervisor in a factory making uniforms and raincoats and so forth for the military.
I understand as of late right now  they changed that any public property -- like  for instance  a synagogue  a Jewish school  or the cemeteries or any lots of that nature that had belonged to the community as one  if they had claims to prove through legal means  they would return it back to the community.
The army had arrangements with state of New York board of education  that for military people who needed a high school diploma  they can take courses  or they can take a final examination for high school  and the state of New York will issue a high school diploma  even if you have not graduated from high school  provided you pass the exam.
I had my pare nts  you know  and I had my school work and I had friends  an d I was eight years old  you know  and as I sa -- as I tell my granddau ghter now  being eight year s old then and being eight years old now is an entirely different story.
And one of the -- one of the strings attached were that the Jews have to go to Jewish school -- to German schools  to help Germanize the non-German speaking regions.
And they learned -- went to night school as soon as they came to the United States.
I would a my brother wa s lucky  he started school in 36 and and my mother was called to school that he wasnt doing well.
My mother knew some French and my father studied Greek and Latin in school  and -- but of course it was the reading language of Greek and Latin  I dont know that he spoke it  other than memorized poetry.
So I had to go to school and learn Lithuanian and Lithuanian history.
So  again  here you have a situation where undoubtedly the principal or whoever was in charge of that public school knew perfectly well that he was accepting some students of questionable background but they also protected us.
Young people two years learn in school they know  but I didnt know enough.
It was a new school then  he asked that I join th e faculty it was that easy.
I feel this is my education  my  my uh bringing up  up upbringing from home  and from school.
My mother went to school the next day  which I thought was pretty brave of her  not speaking very much English  and she wanted to know what had happened.
Your daughter will go to school and  and you'll be fine and I'll write to my commandant to  to arrange for you.ﬂ So Pepi asked me  ﬁDo you want to go to Russia?ﬂ I said  ﬁNo.
So they passed me and I went into Junior High School.
But then when that school closed after Kristallnacht we did not expe rience anything at Kristallnacht  at that school  but it was closed afterwards.
He wanted children so badly th at I had just finished law school -- we were married still when we were in grad school together.
Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the town where I went to school and to high school.
Everybody started pushing forward with their papers in hand and the Germans  the...additional German officials came out and was shooting in the air and beating and pushing people back  and it it happened that the man in charge of that office was a a man of German origin who lived in our town before the war and was a teacher  a high school teacher  my brother's high school teacher.
Interview with Irena Bach December 12  2015 17 Oh sure  yeah  from school.
But you had to go to school very little was exams  even then at ten years of age we had a whole day of exam to be able to get into this gymnasium.
You know  children  if theyre left out -- whenever something very serious took place  the children were sent out of the room  or parents waited for the children  while they were in school or outside  to -- to settle their differences.
Here you see a picture of Manny on the first day of school outside his family's apartment in Budapest.
Well  I took -- are you talking about the Jewish school  or the wa -- that -- the Gymnasium?
And while at the Law School I didn't do too well except that I organized the Harvard Law School Union and became its first president.
This school did not only teach agriculture  it also taught homemaking and all sorts of other things.
I had one scholarship in Chichester and decided that I wanted to go to secretarial school beca use I was very much aware of the fact that I was being supported by people who were not my parents  and I also felt that if my parents were saved after the war  I would want to have a profession to look after them.
And then in  in that small village near Miedzeszyn there was a nursery school  kindergarten and somebody told me that there was an opening there.
Two years ago I was invited to Brooklyn in a junior high school.
In Hungary   LeventeLevanther   and -- and it meant that in the school  one -- once in the week  three hours of patriotism  or -- and the Jews couldnt be LeventeLevanther   because they were Jewish  and -- and -- but to -- to make certain works -- this is absolutely no -- no reason  just to -- just to have an occupation parallel to the Levente Levanther movement  with -- with yellow armband  because it was yellow  the Jewish colors  you know  and baptized Jewish who -- so who racially were Jewish  but administratively not  they had a white armband.
And -- and th -the director took pity on her and said he s -- hell send her to another school in Fulham   which is southwest London  where they did Interview with Halina Peabody June 3  2002 21accept me.
I was the only Jewish girl in school  by the way  (laughter) again.
You know how it is with -- later on I went to another school  and after that I went still to another school  Polish schools.
And I had an English teac her  a a a woman  its just her name escapes me right now  but sh itll come ba ck to me  cause she was indelible in my mind  who stayed with me after school maybe two times a week.
I got my Ph.D. in pharmacology in medical school   University of Chicago.
And likewise in Europe  where Ive spoken in a number of places  including Austria  to high school teachers  who said  we cannot speak to our parents  they will not answer questions  they will not tell us where they were  and so on  or what they did.
And I wondered if you would say something about your -- your father  and your mother  and your -- your school experience.
And so  the typical day was just  go to work or go to school and eat and sl eep.
So was he in the same school with you where you have -- No.
So we went to the school and then we came   when the end of the day  we came back.
I knew I was Jewish  I went to a German school.
He opened in that house and he finished in high school and he opened an office in the house.
So  you can imagine when you graduated school it's like two years college in the United States.
And my entire th -- wa -- culture was written with a capital C. And I went to this school along with a lot of other children who were refugees in Switzerland during that time  and among the student body were two brothers and thats a very interesting item.
There never was any pressure on me to  to if there was any pressure was exerted it was rather by the school than by my parents.
Waiting  wa iting and making the biggest mistake  we should both go to Heidelberg  I should go to medical school  he should go to engineering school  but this is passe.
My kids were in junior high and -- or high school.
I always wanted something higher  and I -- in school  I was a very -- I was  in my class in the public school  I was always the best student.
You cant be doing too much of carrying  organizing  but you can organize school.
And therefore  the tuition was  of course  very high and I remember that was the first time sort of I heard about that this was a sort of a big sacrifice for my parents to put me in that school  and actually  I was scared because I would be thrown suddenly into a totally English environment  I mean  the teachers were all Americans  some maybe British  actually  and English was the language.
My personal tendency was towards engineering and I became the outsta nding physics student in my high school and 6 that love for physics stayed with me afterw ards.
I do remember as the wagon was going  and when we had finally got to a stopping point  my father told my mother that he had passed one of his school friends who was a Lithuanian murderer  my father knew for sure because he saw him kill some people  and he was a school friend of Daddy's  a school mate.
I dont remember my brother  he probabl y went to public school  he was younger than me.
People that knew us  students that I went to school with  they boycotted.
Shortly after I graduated from officers school I was pulled out -- well  I was in Oklahoma.
And what did the psychiatrists tell you in their lectures  what Well  I re I remember that the time we le we were there for a while  we got a received a lecture  say  you fellas are getting a 90 day resting period  and and Interview with Anthony Acevedo October 13  2010 82 you must you must not go to work  you must not get married  you must not go to school yet.
So  I attended high school  so they took me  and I was working there.
They get it in the Jewish schools  the Sunday School  they always talk Harry Alexander 53 October 11  1995 Page 53 about it  yeah.
So I had to go to a a Hungarian public school  which was perfectly adequate and nice.
There was somebody in charge of Mississippi  somebody in charge of Alabama and somebody– Bob had gone to the University of Texas Law School.
But  mostly  people that I talk to about it  is people that I go to give talk about it  like in school or college or -- or group of people that are interested.
But  allin-all  I was able to get by reasonably well and was able to finish medical school  which was  as I said  in 35  two years after Hitler had taken over.
It was -- we were not -- we we-were worried -- just worried about our school.
He actually went to the busine ss school after I graduated.
And was this a school thing that No  no  it was a it was by then a Jewish kids.
And then shortly after that I was able to leave the school and happy word came that Wait a minute.
Otherwise  my daughter used to come from school  she used to make the homework  and she used to cry  and I was crying with her. \
And in school there was the kids who came from the farms  and they had big sandwiches.
And some use -- some young boys were attending the school  and making some  you know -- I dont -- I dont know even what they produced.
Yes  I was a very good student  and it makes me laugh that I came up with all excellents  and it didnt really do me a ny good  because this was from a Hebrew school  and I came to America.
I was 13 years old  I was tall  lanky  and I was I I think they sent me to school immediately.
Also  they went to school  so we have to meet after school.
My brother apparently had been at school someplace else and was home for one of the Jewish holidays that day.
But it di dnt take me very long to learn English  and I always did very well in school  and I o -- never had any trouble making friends  so -- you know  I had friends.
>> Edna Friedberg: In fact  your parents actually enrolled your sister in a Catholic school  did they not?
I wanted to be a brain surgeon  but in order to get into a medi school of medicine  you had to learn Latin  and I was just learning English  and that didnt appeal to me  so I decided to become an architect.
When did -- I think when my son Allen wa s in the last year of high school.
Well I you know when I was in Italy I did go a little bit to school in Italy.
