If Im not going to school  I have the time to help others.
Yes  and it was for one year  but I still we nt to school  and thats when I really failed all the subjects.
Usually I went very early before going to the school  and I helped some German farmers to put vegetables on the market.

Well  as I was saying  upon returning from th at country school where -- where I had been while my parents were -- went through the very serious emotion of liquidating our household -- Right. --
Now  I was about seven years old  and one was the daughter of the principal of a school  and one was a daughter of a local physician.
You had a Jewish people  working people  that raised families  they were housewives  the husbands went to work in the morning  the childre n went to  to the  to the  school if there was a school.
I went eight grade to Folich School  to the School  and then I went three years for the uh to the uh this high school.
We were I was harassed at school  and all along I knew I I was taught what what I coul d do and what I couldnt do an d how to behave myself.
And we came back to the big city  city where I went to high school  we came to the hotel and we lied down there fo -- to have a nap  to have supper late -- oh  yeah  th -- I didnt tell you about this story.
And in my view  they always had no school because I would go to school from eight to six.
And I remembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady principal and she would turn to my father and said  \ Mr. Mandl  why do you want your little girl to come to our school?
And there were about 10 of us in the class  six or eight who had to come to school   and then we had meaningless classes  because we had to have meaningless cl ass  because the others werent there.
And -- an-and one other incident is  when my daughter was in high school  her social worker called me and she told me  ﬁYou know Mrs. Klein  I had to call you because your daughter is very unhappy and -- and -- and I have to talk to you because she tells me that she i -- when she is home  she always has to be happy.
In the same way  I didn't know high school was supposed to be fun.
I don't recall ever having been harassed in school while I was in Berlin during the first year.
The button is orange and the writing is blue because this was the -- those were the colors of my high school.
That was not in school  I didnt notice th at so much.
We have to be washed  clothed and we have a breakfast and everybody have to prepare to go to school.
So you were at this school and they just took care of you?
I had done quite a bit of secondary school  so it was not hard for me.
I mean we ve had this  even with the go around with theTen Commandments weve had in this state recently  that we have educators and superintendents who dont seem to get it  and dont understand or cant understand why anyone would object to putting those Ten Commandments on the walls of the school or a public building.
Were the children  did you have any chance to go to school?
It was a home for the aged and was also a school and th the building behind the buildi ng  behind the school building there was a gymnasi a gym and that gym had been converted into a makeshift hall where there were about 80 anywhere between 80 and 120 cots.
And then I started going to primary school which was a Jewish school and I loved it .
When they were living in Aachen  they went to the Jewish school there.
But there was also that feeling of relief that I don't have to go back to school.
And my school was almost  I mean all of the child ren of the school  almost all of them  were in those first few transports.
And since the teacher that I had in Yugoslavia  her husband worked in the factory of my fathers  I got a glowing report how good I was  which my father knew wasnt so because I -- I always acted up in school.
And I -- oh  I started kindergarten in regular school  and a few months after I was in the school the teacher called my mother in and said  Frau Hagan  this is not my policy  but your daughter can no longer stay in this public school  she has to go to a Jewish school.
But school  I remember my f -- early on  I had to -- I came home with a poem  which I had to learn by heart.
They gave money  you know; because to make such a kitchen to keep... And...and I was in charge for 4...4 years of 3 This was the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School on Tongshan Road.
And he told me that and bu I forgot to say only that in school my foreign language was German  so I could talk  and he told me that he will show me how to make to become a draftsman  and will be his helper.
And of course I came home and I carried on and so my father and my step-mom went to school and they said  how come you gave her such a little book and all the other kids got big ones  she got just a little one  you know.
She lived in New York  and fo r a while longer I was in Philadelphia  for a while longer  but shortly thereafter I joined her in New York and went to high school in New York  finished my high school year  my final high school year in New York and then I left Philadelphia behind for good and then as I say I lived in New York  joined her in New York.

And of course when I ran that race I  I ran the second fastest school boy  school boy mile in the country  four twenty-thr ee four.
As I said  the school was unique as far as the public school system was concerned.
And so the war was very  you know  important in that way  and remembered the wa -- the fact that the windows in the school had masking tape on them in case we were bombed.
I remembered the average age in Poland was to start school seven years.
Uh life changed abruptly because I remember coming home one day from somewhere  nursery school or something  to uh find my mother in tears and my father not ther e. I want to backtrack before I get to that because there were some things when my fath er was still there which uh I don't want to leave out.

My husband and I jo ined Temple shortly after we were married  and I was vice-president of my sisterhood and very active in the Temple and saw to it that the kids went to religious school  and -- So why is it that you did that  as opposed to your feelings as a young child?
