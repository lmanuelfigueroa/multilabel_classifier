When I went there in 1986  I went finally to the synagogue  which of course was converted into some kind of a music hall  but next to the synagogue was a small chapel  and everything was piled in  what that was left from the synagogue into the chapel.
At the end of the month  picked up the rations  went to the office  was arrested  and sent to another collection point that happens to be the synagogue where my bar mitzvah was.
The Memorial tablet was created from thick sketch paper and shaped into a synagogue ark  fold  Video Tape No.
We lived in the house that was adjacent to the synagogue  a big courtyard out front.
What I remember is that after 1935 or 36  when there was a dictatorship in Greece and this Metaxas  my uncle kiv -- came from Salonika and rebuilt the synagogue.
And I even remember playing a prank here or there in the synagogue by putting some bread -- breadcrumbs or cookies into some mens jackets.
Thats true yeah but there may have been other schools where they also had Jewish children.
And I looked up at him  you Nazi  you in the synagogue?
So  I was very anxious to go back and I had to ask for the key to the synagogue at the -- at the city hall  because now its closed.
He ran back and forth to that synagogue being proud his son I was only 13 when I started bar mitzva and then up to 17 and then his younger son  every three weeks.
And I did have a Bar Mitzvah  but it was in somebodys house  cause theres no synagogue  there was no Jewish community  and there isnt to this day.
She went to Hebrew school and learned everything and she going to marry a Jewish  too in the synagogue. [
So they set off to go to school  and they saw the synagogue burning.
They told them what a great place it is  and in Philadelphia  there is a Sephardic synagogue  which is on the historic sites today  but it was the second synagogue in the United States.
All I know is after Pesach they took us all together in the synagogue and then they shipped us out to by the train and then we were there for a month.
In Wiesbaden and in many cities for people who perished  and have a pla a a a monument where the da where the synagogue used to stand  and things like that  all done by this group  none of whom maybe one was Jewish  but most of Interview with Eric Simon June 21  2014 103them were not.
And then I wanted to go to school   and see what happens  and somebody said  ﬁYour s -- your school is burning.ﬂ Well  it wa s synagogue that was burnt  but the school was in the synagogue.
Was one time I remember I went out with a Jewish girl -- no -- yeah  it was in the Jewish community center.
There was an order out that all the...uh...Jewish males between the age of 14 and 18 have to register at the police department and...uh...that...uh....that all of was ch ange because they establish a Jewish community center where...like we have here in America  that you have a synagogue  you have a president and a vice president and so on and so forth  and they established that for the community.
At this point so many of the young people had left that we were moved out of the building where the retarded children were to entirely a building belonging to the Jewish community next to the burned-out synagogue.
In that synagogue  you know  people who came back to town -- it was also my family  my town.
I remember him to take me with himself to the synagogue.
And in Florida  there is a big synagogue and you dont just -- there -- youre not welcome  as a -- as a snowbird  w-we are snowbirds.
Then it came in July 1943 that we were called -- ac tually our parents  the heads of families were called to a -- a synagogue named Beth Saul in Salonika with instructions  and instead of instructions  they were taken to the railroad st ation and we were told to follow them and join them there.
She was  well  ma -- we found a synagogue in Alexandria  where we still belong  or I still belong.
It was a small town where a German family  a German family  was a small synagogue  they hid it from the nazis all these years and protected the Torah  the scrolls  the holy books in the basement.
I go to synagogue twice a year on new year  Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
A. Yes  I went to a Jewish school before  to a Hebrew school.
On holidays  they had special place  because in the Jewish persons...with the German Jews  many people who don't go to the whole year.
Well  that I didn't mind  you know  that I  see I will go for the form  I still  I'll go  I go to synagogue now and I attend on the high holidays and I bitch throughout the entire thing  but it's  but I am  it's an ethnic identification.
Every Shabbat we went to synagogue and we observed you know the kosher thing very much so because both my parents come from religious homes.
And it was a small community and the Jewish community was small  but large enough to provide us with a wonderful synagogue.
At that point the Jews were in -- in good standing with the margraff and they asked for a synagogue and he -- that was in 1745 -- 300 -- 500 -- 400 years ago and he gave them his own architect and helped USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 77 them build this beautiful synagogue  here it is .
Everybody had to appear in the morning in the synagogue yard.
And then left us enough money to take public transportation to the place of concentration  which was a synagogue that wasn't run down during Kristallnacht because it was between two houses b ut it was demolished on the inside.
Obviously he must have been praying in the synagogue and he was running and there was a crowd running after him and he was like one of those you know  in the classic books that I was reading.

But I met him at 14  we -- he belong ed to a youth group called USY  United Synagogue Youth  and I belonged to that youth group.
So the schools that you attended  were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?
And then Saturday morning  I went with her to the Synagogue  you say special prayers  you survived this horrible thing  and I was very surprised to see so many people going to Synagogues.
The following day  the holiday that I mentioned  May the 24th  Jews again congregate in  or try to congregate in -- at the central synagogue  but they find it locked because some of the Jewish leadership decided that it will be too dangerous to allow a large crowd to assemble because the Fascist authorities immediately will try to disperse it by force.
This is where I say if we as Jews invite people into the synagogue  not with any missionary ideas at all but they should know wh at are we doing there  and what does it mean to us and if we at the same time pay interest in what are they doing in their churches or their mosques and what does it mean to them  that is the way I try to point out is important in a relationship to find these ideas that even when th ey think they are nice people but they are crazy  there is very soon some mystery coming around.
Now  while you were still living in your home  were you able to continue observing  you know  holidays and did -- wer -- were you able to go to synagogue any more?
I mean they were not 1 Palestine 2 really religious but they would go to the synagogue because they felt as a Jew you needed to stay together.

Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23  2017 37 There was a synagogue  a very active synagogue.
Right after a week or so they burned our wonderful synagogue which ever ybody was proud of.
Then  after three weeks  it was a rumor that in the Jewish center of the city  there was a Jewish center  a small streets  with big buildings in a yard  maybe with four buildings  not the rich people  were Jewish peop -- it the Jewish center.
When I went into the Synagogue with my grandson and I had to cantor and I knew all this by heart still  because I was brought up that way  I said  who are you praying to?
Well  I guess going to synagogue was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent.
Uh my father being Jewish uh we were raised uh more or less...my mother  of course  converted to Judaism and uh so therefore we were raised in uh Jewish spirits.
But in 37  things became too uncomfortable  and I went to the Jewish school.
So we got from them an achievement award and of course from the Jewish Theological Seminary  because Ive worked for them the last 30 years  through the synagogue raised also raised money.
And when we went through that door  we were in the Theresienstadt synagogue.
Uh we...in Berlin the head of the Jewish community was called to the Gestapo and he was told that (clearing throat)...excuse me...that for a thousand people uh apartments sh ould be made available uh and uh the uh the people should uh should assemble in a synagogue uh and not be accommodated at another place.
Well I can  first of all my impression is that there are other Holocaust museums.
And the synagogue was brought back into order in a very short time.
I wanted to go in Hebrew and then I -- i-it was not a lot of English to know that  you know  in the school  in the Hebrew school  cause I want to teach in Hebrew.
So we went to the synagogue and during one hour we had money for a taxi.
And I was in the main synagogue  and I was a city cantor  not a chief cantor.
According to Jewish customs  on S aturday you walk into the synagogue.
N one of my family saw anything  I was the only one  thanks to the fact -- and then Jews driven out of the synagogue  with the -- And you saw that? --
I practice Judaism  I by -- I am a member of a synagogue and all that  but thats about all.
Every other Jewish male in the little town that we lived in  ran to the synagogue.
This was a time when I already knew I was Jewish and they were Jewish.
What did you think of the Jewish -- or the German people at that time?
Were you brought up Jewi sh  going to th e synagogue?
So after the synagogue  we went to him and he bought us  or he had in his store bread and butter and cheese and milk and eggs  whatever we needed.
The -- the He brew congregat -- you know  the Reform synagogue  actually.
I think th eres a certain I think theres a certain warmth to synagogue  and a certain coldne ss to church.
But nobody was there and nobody prayed in the synagogue anyhow; everybody had their prayers in home in  you know  and gathered in private homes or in the quarters of different organizations that they had  like small little clubs.
One we re a family by the name of Schlesinger  father and two sons  running to the synagogue to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning synagogue  the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burne d the synagogue.
Then they came again and they said no school  no Jews are allowed to go to school; no Jews are allowed to congregate; no Jews are allowed to go to the synagogue; no Jews are allowed to have communications of any kind with one another.
And were -- how many Jewish families were in your village?
They didnt say what  he said  we have orders to come to arrest wip th every synagogue has been burned down.
But we provided them first of all  we took them to a synagogue  and we made them comfortable there  and there  little by little  we spread them out to different family houses.
On my way to the school  I saw the fire engines standing in front of a building where the orthodox Jewish community was housed.
I went to school in Amsterdam  Jewish school  and es -- had special studies  Jewish studies in either synagogue  with people.
And as I remember all the time [indecipherable] synagogue  and the celebrations of the holidays and -- but the children not.
You can go  you know  what the Russians did with the synagogue?
And we lived in what was know n as a Jewish neighborhood  which encompassed sort of six  seven streets in Antwer p. We went to school  Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner  Saturday we went to synagogue  but Saturday afternoon so metimes we snuck off to the movies.
In -- In -- Through your synagogue  or -- Well  as I said  I -- In -- When I say connected  whatever they run  you know  for -- for the Holocaust  lets say memorial or Holocaust Remembrance Day or something  I mean  we go.
My grandfather was also a shamus  which is a sexton in the -- in the synagogue in Split  and he lived right next door  which was provided by the synagogue for him.
But  before the synagogue was burning  I was there just  I remember.
End of Tape 3 33 Tape 4 05:57:33 [Technical conversation} 06:00:01 Let's back up into the synagogue  you knew Lisa wasn't there and you're still looking for a place to hide  and it's filling up.
My father was Jewish  my mother was Catholic  but neither of them really practiced their religion.
But I understand that the synagogue has changed hands several times.
I was...uh...I think walking home at the time and...it was a nd it was the place where our shul was  the little synagogue.
And we moved to another apartment that was owned by a Jewish attorney in a not-so-nice area  but acceptable area  and all I remember of that apartment is that it had a tiny little ort hodox synagogue in the backyard.
We went to a small synagogue  Rabbi Moshe Weiss   and he had lost much of his ow n family and certainly we were very close with him and we talked with him.
Since maybe 1960  when in the in the 60s  when my kids were Bar Mitzvahed  and Ive been a member ever since  and paying my dues  and supporting the synagogue  but Im not religious.
But it was a Jewish school with Jewish children and Jewish teachers?
On that main street  you also had the Jewish synagogue which for a town of that size  which was about 15 000 population  was a fairly magnificent synagogue both inside and outside.
Well  Jewish life in our town...we had a nice...quite a big synagogue.
But I said  the Jewish community in my city  it was very small.
I was sitting on a stool  and I can see my father going to the front door  and I remember that he was wearing dark pants and a white shirt  which he didn't wear unless he went to synagogue in the mornings or the afternoons.
So in 1944  June of 1944  there was a message into the ghetto that every male between the age of 18 and 50 must assemble in the synagogue yard  and to bring extra clothing with them because they would be shipped out for the east.
So... Were you...uh...was your family very involved in the Jewish community?
And then I had the Bar Mitzvah when I was 13  in in the congrega in the synagogue where my father  you know  was active  and we had some relatives.
What's really interesting  he loved to go to synagogue with my husband.
I suspect there were as many people who were not Jewish in the synagogue as there were  a lot of friends  and my father had all of his friends from the mill that he worked with every day.
You know  I don't go much to synagogue or things like that  but my feelings are so deep now  I feel that I've been so honor ed to talk about what happened to me because I have nightmares  still have nightmares  you know  of what happened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who  you know  died with a husband and two small children  Carla and Needa ; they were only five and three years old.
But afterwards  in the next morning  I was told  I dont know by whom  maybe -- maybe by my parents  maybe my friends  that synagogue has been bombed.
So the men were in the synagogue that went up in flames?
There were a lot of churches  there was never a Synagogue here.
They -- they invited us for Friday night Shabbas and Saturday and we nt to the synagogue  and -- but we also helped the people  the local people ce lebrate Easter.
And there was a beautiful synagogue and there was a large Jewish community.
You know we always like for instance   when my children were small I  when I went to synagogue  I Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 54 November 29  2012 always walked and it wasnt around the corner and it was in honor of my mother because when we went to our little synagogue  we had to go through woods and fields and meadows and we always walked you know.
We didn't live far from synagogue and  uh  there was no Sunday school because most of the things we had in school.
N-Next around the corner the from the building  from the synagogue  there is a a there was a Jewish store by the go non-Jew took it over.
For those of you who don't know anything about synagogue life  you need to understand the synagogue where he was the cantor had a male choir of 40 voices.
I did know that i -- used to go to the synagogue in the morning  routine  that stopped.
So I remember we had a Hebrew teacher coming to the house  teaching us Hebrew and religion.
He went every day to the synagogue  but he said its nonsense what th ey are saying there.
We had a school  we had a synagogue  we had business going on  and I am sure this was psychologically very helpful and helped people survive.
Not a major synagogu e  but a significant synagogue in town.
Then they destroyed the synagogue  and why to hell they needed an excuse  they needed excuses for nothing  they said because the Jews destroyed the monument of Kosciusko  so th e Poles dynamited in revenge the synagogue.
From the outside  our school was right next to the synagogue.
Interview with Blanche Hall October 15  2010 30When he went out of the synagogue  was a policeman there  and he came and he said they went to school togeth er.
My father would say a Shabbat with wine and there were as I recall occasional  I dont know how frequent  visits to the synagogue.
And on this particular Friday evening  uniformed members of brown shirts  black shirts  call it whatever you want  uniformed Nazis  came into the front door of our synagogue  and th reatened threatened the congregation  threatened our rabbi  and our rabbi was magnificent in defending us verbally  and ultimately the Nazis retreated.
This was in Poland and its the first experience I remember having in a synagogue  other than in Kowal  when we went back to Kowal  Im trying to remember if I visited th -- the synagogue there with writing -- because the Germans often used the synagogues as round-up places and -- and thered be writing on the wall from the -- but then we wound up  after Lodz we wound up in East Berlin  my mother and I  and -- How did you get there  by train?
And so I told my mother and my father  and they say  you know  we're giving our help to the synagogue  and these people probably are exaggerating.
I wanted to go in Hebrew and then I -- i-it was not a lot of English to know that  you know  in the school  in the Hebrew school  cause I want to teach in Hebrew.
Now  some time in 42  youre able to go to a Jewish community synagogue school.
And the -- the synagogue had metal roof and I could hear banging on top th -- from the shrapnels were hitting it and it was noisy.
So  I said if you want to do it it's very tough  but if you want to  and he take me and anyways we accomplished it and he is -- my pupil is reading the Torah every shabat in Suffolk Synagogue.
And they brought the in the  in the synagogue and there they were killed.
We had to walk so school  and one day we walked to schoolthe school was near the synagogue in Aachen  that was Kristallnacht.
But anyway  in -- in Philadelphia  there is a synagogue where George Washington had visited there  yeah  so they talked to us about history  you know  and that  ﬁYou will be welcome there ﬂ and all that.
So I told them yes  Je-Jewish beside that  we did participated.
I feel most comfortable in te rms of synagogue attendance I am most comfortable in an orthodox environment  to the point even orthodox or even Chasidic environment.
Theyre making copies -- I made copies  and I came back to -- to the same synagogue  and I said  ﬁYou didn t know?
Uh the liberal Jewish community really grew after the war because uh most of the survivors had that kind of a tendency and he led the liberal movement and actually the uh liberal Jewish synagogue in in uh in Amsterdam is built with the whole Holocaust theme of  the theme of rising from the ashes  and uh that movement is the one that uh led after he finished his rabbinical studies.
