I could not still say I was Jewish because of what happened.
And my brother was just getting ready to go to the synagogue for the Minyan  you know  to say Kaddish for my father.
Well  I grew up in a family that was -- my mother and father were non-observant Jews.
And from that home I was also  for the first time taking in -- taken into a synagogue.
Crystal Night they broke into the synagogue  and where there was one room in there  schoolroom  which they used before for Hebrew school  was that got to be our classroom  and of course with the everybody having been arrested and being sent to Dachau   there was no more school  and that was it  they Is that what happened afterwards is that not only was the building broken into  but those who were involved were sent to Dachau ?

Yes  we observed the holidays  and I re member one of my favorite ones was Sukkot  and we walked through the synagogue  an d there was one man who was a butcher who always gave us sausages for our collection  and that was a particular ly grand day  and we really enjoyed that.
And lets see– yeah  Daddy then  said Opa was safe– he was  lets see  a teacher in synagogue h ousing.
My mother was  she always went to -- always went to synagogue on the high holidays  and she always fasted on Yom Kippur  that was very important to her  and she -- somehow she carri ed that through to  you know  very late in life  in New York.

In the synagogue  during the day  I'm still lo oking around to see if I can find Lisa  and I was looking at other places  maybe I can find a place to hide.

And a cantor in the city of Budapest  in the synagogue that held 3500 seats with a choir of 40 people  was a major position  and he wanted that position.

They're small houses  and so we had Rusisha shul  Russian shul  and a Poylissha shul  a Polish synagogue.
There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old  and I had a chance to be with her together with our other friends  and this was quite a happy time for me that I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in the temple  in the synagogue and to study from morning til night.
And we didnt get organized -- we used to -- I used to go to their -- to the -- to the Sephardic synagogue every Friday.
But the synagogue  I became the soloist in the synagogue in Sochaczew.

I went to -- I would go to the Protestant elementary school in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a cheder  to a -- a Hebrew school which was in a buildi ng adjacent to the big synagogue in The Hague.

The synagogue at the time had been burned and they were desperate what can be done.
I feel comfortable to bring Jewishness and religion into my house and through my family I have been a member of a synagogue all through the years being in America  even at times it was hard financially to do so.
The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be going to synagogue  so the area was depleted.
And you answer  and hes talking about the Jewish community coming back  and the synagogue opening  as you tell him.
And I went to check up on that ten years later  and I came to the customs house and I said to the concierge  I want to visit the synagogue.
And would you say you were a prominent Jewish family in the community?

Most westernized Jews were r eally once a year  one day or two days Jews  so called and that is theyd go to synagogue on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
There was like -- they called it later a ghetto  Jewish ghetto  but that was where all the Jew then lived in this area.
And the school was right next door to a beautiful synagogue  and we could see that the roof of the synagogue was burnt out.
I mean  that was after all the  the things th at we went through  there was a real Jewish holiday which was celebrated.
And so I was Bar Mitzvah  and my brother was Bar Mitzvah.
And th e same was here in our synagogue  when they make.
And were you in Sa-Sanok when the synagogue there was destroyed?
So your school was Jewish   where you went to school?
And then steps back for one moment and she sa ys  ﬁI want you to know  we are living on a holy ground here.ﬂ So she admitted that to herself  that this used to be a synagogue and to her  her apartment building is -- has been erected on holy ground  you know.

But not in matter of going to a synagogue or anything like that.
And they said that all the people from Denmark  all the refugees who are here in the synagogue  should immediately come out to the bus and go back to camp.
I dont know if my father had been– I think hed actually  he must have been a teacher in that school along with be ing at the synagogue.
Jewish school  religious Jewish school where they had all the Rabbis?
They saw that they can't do it and and it was also the order the first thing to burn the synagogue  the corn and the wheat.
But they were not in a Jewish home in a sense that I'm not religious at all.
So there was no particular training  there was no Sunday school as we call it  or Hebrew school.

Women did not go to the synagogue as much as we see here.
One is that  since this is being placed in the place where the synagogue was  and your father was the rabbi of the synagogue  it would be very important for the people USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 60 coming back  to have the son of their rabbi be present.

But I  when I went to see my sist er in 1959  and I walked the streets of Sahd  and  and went into the kibbutz  and went in  went into a synagogue in Jerusalem  I came back and I started to study.
The synagogue was supported  and we would often go to Saturday morning services  certainly every holiday  etcetera.
I remember when I was around 20 years old  sometimes I was drawn to go to synagogue.
Although I didn't know Hebrew to pray  but now I educated myself.
There was later  a Jewish synagogue  beautiful  built 800 years ago by German Jews in that city  and Hitler used to come to Wroclaw and had 76 speeches in a big hall  which is still there.
And ever since that time -- there are other museums in different countries that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the Washington Holocaust Museum.
You said your -- the synagogue that you belonged to was bombed.
But the main part of the library will be a Jewish synagogue with everything like a Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14  1997 135normal synagogue.
So I went to the synagogue and to the shows  to the theaters I used to love to go.
There was shattered glass and but  and I think Was your synagogue destroyed  the synagogue you had gone to  was that destroyed?
The men usually went to synagogue  took their sons  taught them Hebrew.
Then he went  they went to the synagogue  this was 803 West 180th Street  right across from th e George Washington Bridge.
I met my brother and this is...we gonna arrange and  you know  so any way Sunday I came out and I picked up the dead people and they came and marched in  went out to the cemetery and then when we were finished  we took the guards and we gave them water to drink a nd gave them to eat and the...uh...we took the 10 people in the synagogue  in the main s ynagogue and...uh...the people had cooked up some soup  potatoes  and they bought clothing.
There was a very large community  Jewish community  and very active.
They -- they were meeting and the little building and -- it -- it -- they were living on shoestring  but my husband volunteered to work on an architectural search committee and before he knew it he was the h-head of the building committee and before he knew it  he built a synagogue and I got involved with children  with the education committee  with the richman commit -- education enrichment has always been my -- my thing.
That is were you...you must have been heavily...your family was heavily involved in that synagogue?
I used to go to synagogue  but I really never was up-to-date with the religion.
17 our kitchen  there was not far of the original synagogue.
A man came to the door and said to him  \ Don't go to the synagogue.\
Whether I run to the synagogue to pray and think that the salvation will come from God?
In fact  I had a very interesting -- got a very interesting letter from the Holocaust Museum last week  forwarding a letter that they received from Gleiwitz that in -- the local organization in Gleiwitz has -- I forgot the exact name  something for international relations  is going to dedicate a memorial to the Jewish community  at the site of the synagogue.
It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a  to Hebrew school and then all of a sudden I was going to a Jewish school.
What happened was that the Nazis came in the back of the Jewish community center..was the orthodox synagogue of Breslau.

And he says to me   oh youre such a handsome guy  he said  come over  we dont need to stay with these people here -- he was driving -- he said  Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 78Ill take you down here to this -- something going on  people from Washington came here  like the womens Zionist organi zation  into a synagogue and Ill take you down  maybe youll meet somebody nice.
Do you remember approximately wh at year the synagogue was burned?
They all went to synagogue  of course  in their best clothes and at synagogue  if -- if you didnt say ﬁGood Shabbasﬂ to somebody  he was insulted with you for th e whole week.
However  I came back to Budapest because 3 days after this...uh...Saturday when I performed services  the President of that congregation  I should have been elected to be the cantor of the Dukes Place Synagogue.
It was about ten in the morning  the synagogue wa s empty  and every hour the synagogue started being filled up.
So in the ghetto there was a synagogue that one day the Germans ordered... OK.
In the beginning we -- were together with the Bukara Jews  you know  Bukara Jews  they used to have collective farms over there  they used to go to synagogue over there in b -- with the Bukara Jews  but later I dont -- I cant say that I remember.
Only w hen I go to synagogue  then I know is holiday.
I went to Prague  theres a gorgeous  gorgeous synagogue  which called USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 63 the Portuguese synagogue  which is gorgeous.
I want you to know that I too celebrated my 75 th birthday in that synagogue and was called to the Torah.
And here our son  in Orthodox synagogue conducting services  and I was very much impressed by it.
W ell actually I tried to raise them you know but when I was a professor at the University of Connecticut I met   there was a synagogue there and I would go there with them but somehow it didnt work out.
And a man came to the synagogue and I heard you the story of Oradour  and about th e church.
He set up a museum in what used to be the synagogue.
And were -- how many Jewish families were in your village?
And then I found out that they tried to burn down our synagogue.
Uh...My father was...uh...taking care of the synagogue and   meaning riches.
And theres no one moment that you can think of where where the f There was one theres a synagogue that the Germans that the Germans did not that they left it  for historic reasons.
And after that wed go back to synagogue for the afternoon service  a -- which was at about one oclock  and about two oclock was the main meal  and in the evening at the end of the -- of the holiday  or Saturday  we would again go to synagogue and participated whats called the Havdalah service.
The Jews were located like in a--I would say  a ghetto.
And one of my fi rst memories as I went to shul with my mother  to the synagogue and they called up the children to bless the children  and I remember all the adults around  everybody was crying  the tear crying  and I couldnt figure out what theyre crying.
No  I thought you were going to synagogue somewhere in West Virginia.
Today its a very large synagogue  at that time it was a small shul  very Orthod ox and we went to Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10  2001 63Sunday school  and we and Hebrew scho ol and like every go od American boy we hated it.
And -- but then  you know  they went to the synagogue and actually went to the synagogue  and evidently they got all our names  and they never kept their promise because on October 16th  that's - you know  they came in each house.
We took them to the synagogue  we took them to Sunday school  we took them to Hebrew school  and that was about the best we could do.
Then when the war broke out in 1939  when the Germans came in the first thing what they did  they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and put into the synagogue and they had to take out all the  you know  and everything the...and everything and put on the sidewalk and burn themﬂ. Only Jewish people have to do this.
But for some reason they had promised the Germans they would hand over all the Jews so they didn't want to give us exit permits.
Had a huge wall-sized photograph of the inside of the synagogue where my father was the  where my dad was involved.
And for me is -- the synagogue still is the nicest synagogue in the world.
However  wi faced with the very sh harsh information  he then the rabbi then changed his mind  and at a certain sermon evening in the synagogue in Copenhagen   word came out and spread like like i-i-instantly.
I -- I see -- at least I seem to recollect that the people we were with were all Jewish.
They will go to church  all of them  lets say Christmas  and high holi -- Jewish high holidays all go to temple  to synagogue.
There was one synagogue  I remember  and in that synagogue  they had brought in blankets and clothes and some food packages I think  Im not sure.
So while you -- there were schools  Jewish schools  what they had it connected together.
And I think they had some non-Jewish people iin the choir.
And I remember in Ancona going to the synagogue for high holidays.
Told him  \ How can we be without synagogue  without a school?
Did you become more religious because of your experience during the war  or less religious or the same?
So in this time when we cleaned out the attic from the synagogue  there was full of old books.
Pick a day in the year  one day in the year  light a candle  go to the synagogue  and say kaddish.
So I was told however that the new synagogue was created in a home  which was built like a usual home  a dwelling  but in -- its used as a synagogue and was taken there.
We went to a Jewish elementary school and a Jewish gymnasium.
And -- yes  because th -- there was a -- a synagogue in the -- in the -- A2: Backyard.
And did you go to synagogue  did you Oh yes  oh yes.
The only for instance  Yom Kippur wed go for the children so they  wed be out of the synagogue and play and so on and lunch came and say oh let them eat something.
And we kept  mother kept a kosher home and I re member sitting upstairs with the women and the men were downstairs in our synagogue.
And the oth -- there was another synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes  and I was getting a little too old for that.
I myself -- our s on more would go -- like to go to synagogue  to pray.
so we went  and we were collected in a yard of a synagogue on the outer boroughs; and we stayed there for a day and a half  and then we were put on  on the cattle wagons; and we were traveling for  for I think it was six or seven days.
And that was the only time we did go to the synagogue and we -- well  thats it.
But the first brutality I saw on the high holidays - I liked to run from one shul  from one synagogue or one temple to the other temple to listen to the cantor singing  and as I was going in the street on the   most of our synagogues had open doors to the street  and Germans came in and they happened to be Wehrmacht.
And they brought they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will they will get sick to the Germans  and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue.
The only thing is  is being inside the synagogue is empt y and the echo in the synagogue you could hear real well.
She didn't care whether it was a church  a synagogue or a mosque  just a place to thank God for her survival.
I remember the day when the when our synagogue was destroyed and when the Germans pulled out the torahs on the street in front of the building and burned it...uh we youngsters were observing this and wanted to know what the Germans were doing.
At that time uh when the Germans came   of course  they went to the Jewish Kultusgemeinde --the religious and cultural community --and wanted the name[s] of the Jews.
And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fiancee in a synagogue.
And but we woul d have we the synagogue was too far to walk  so we would have to drive there.
Was this -- was your school a Jewish school  or both Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty?
As I said  the city of Kiel  at my request created finally  a memorial to the Jews which basically I have to say that all of these efforts  throughout  that wh ats happened in Kiel has centered basically on my family  because the museum in Kiel is center -- as I said  of -- of memorial and photos and so forth  which ha-has my -- my cousins  my family in it.
Was your family  your mothers side of the family very Jewish?
Can you tell us I'd like to get a sense of what it was like in the synagogue as you were being rounded up.
And the morning of Rosh Hashanah  the Jewish New Y ear  he arrived.
I don't care what's  you kno w  they're outside going to synagogue or serving  what the faith will be  and that's very important.
You know  when I went back in the military to Germany I was the first Jew that many Germans had ever met  or had any contact with whatsoever  you know.
And I dont know if were jumping ahead  but after Interview with Brigitte Freidin March 12  2001 7Kristallnacht  when -- I -- I -- I dont know ho w I ended up at the downtown school anyway  which was the synagogue  the big synagogue  but the Nazis were there with -- with -- with the dogs and had -- were setting fire to the books that were inside  I guess the schoolrooms and the library from -- from the synagogue.
What did they expect   I sat all day long and was in the in the synagogue [indecipherable] closed doors  what closed windows.
He loved to go to synagogue  to the brotherhood and all of that.
Now it was very strange; there was a building in front  you went through a courtyard and then came the synagogue.
A landesrabbiner is a rabbi not only of one synagogue  but a while district of synagogu es.
At first the transit camp  in fact  was one of the synagogues until the military  yeah  that synagogue  by the way  had been only lightly damaged during Kristallnacht and had been repaired afterwards.
The synagogue I went to  the women had to sit upstairs  separated from their men  so I was raised in a strict  Orthodox home.
And the only thing  we took them once in a synagogue  once in a -- in -- in a church.
But in our synagogue  the women sit upstairs and the men sit downstairs.
And so we had a little trouble finding  trying to orient the map to show Mother where we used to live and the synagogue we used to live in  where it was.
I -- The -- We had a synagogue  Orthodox of course  and the rabbi had gone to Russia on a visit and got caught duri ng the war  so we didnt even have a rabbi.
And I then went to a Jewish private school  attached to the synagogue  but it was foreign to me  you know?
So he was 30 -- 38  and -- and so somehow  he arrived to -- to invite us to the synagogue  and we went regularly to the synagogue  and we observed -- we really observed everything  even I think -- even the -- the day of Gedarea [indecipherable] thing -- thing of less importance.

Oh yeah  and I had a Bar-Mitzvah in Cologne  and do you know who my rabbi was?
Now  there live more Jewish people  not many  but more Jewish people here and theres a synagogue and so -- no -- and therell be more.

I dont remember about Jewish holidays  if we observe or not.
Were you living wa -- was the synagogue where you were staying -- Not very far apart  yes  yeah  yeah.
After one woman had a little baby there in the synagogue  they took her also.
So I stayed 15 months  you know and by the way  I used to go the first time  after 22 years to go to a shul  to a synagogue  because in Czechoslovakia   first of all  we to under communism it was very dangerous to show that you are religious   or you going secondly  there was no Jews  so I didnt have the opportunity to go.

And how many of them– there was a family  there was actually a family living upstairs above us in the synagogue  in this building  like it was just an apartment building  there may have been some offices downstairs  but it was perpendicular to the Temple itself  and then there was this courtyard.
But I -- I realize that there -- there is a life other than -- away from the Holocaust  but as I said  I -- I go to a synagogue and -- and I picture them burning down the synagogue or things like that.
I want to go back just for a moment  becau se some of the reading I had done  I had seen something about actually this is not during the war but back to 1933  something about there being an earthquake on the island of Kos and actually the synagogue being destroyed.

In the adjoining town the synagogue was destroyed  Jewish businesses were ruined.
Oh  we went to the Jewish Community Center  for example  you met them there.
When I came here  I tried to go maybe to a service once or twice  but I co uldnt face it  and besides  I completely turned against religion  because my parent s were -- my father  my mother wasnt as religious as my father  but my father was extremely religious and I fel -- felt that with all the praying that my father did and all the beliefs that  and this ha ppened  I just couldnt face going to the synagogue  I just didnt feel comfortable.

You see  su in in some way my my father was not too much involved in it  by being employed by the a main synagogue.

Because since I left  this synagogue going down  you know  they close it  they gu they folded.
And he took me to the place where the synagogue was  which I had a little trouble remembering and  well  there it was.
Again  I didn't live in the Jewish -- in the real Jewish area  but the th ings that I have heard -- and I saw it myself -- where they used to grab the real religious one and cut the peahsin  cut the beard  make them lick their boots to a shine  beat them to a  to a  to a point where they were unconscious.
