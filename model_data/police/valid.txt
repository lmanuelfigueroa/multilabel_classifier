Any kind of excuse and -- and the Ukrainian nationalists -- not all Ukrainians  but the Ukrainian nationalists were encouraged  of course  by the Germans and they became very willing collaborators and police and everything and thousands of Jews were immediately ki lled  and -- and by I think was July 15th  we had to wear armbands.
It was my brother and one of my cousins and some more and they brought them into the police and they beat him up so badly and we found out what is going on in Raddan.
>> Bill Benson: As terrible as the conditions were in the ghetto  as you've described  t here became far worse when the Nazis began deporting Jews from the ghetto to the Chelmno killing center in January of 1942  as you were turning 7.
When they returned home in 1944  police were sent to arrest the Garihs  but agreed to say instead that the family was not home if the family would leave immediately.
Treblinka became the killing field of the Jews from the ghettos of the towns and cities in the districts of Warsaw and Radom.
That when the Brownshirts were marching on Berlin in 1932  that the Berlin police and the Berlin National Guard was all mobilized with everything to give them the appropriate reception.
And at the moment  my father  being in some way involved -- he was in connection to the -- this military movement in Poland  and he entered Polish police.
And in Antwerp with the assistance of the Antwerp police they went to all the apartments where Jews lived and picked up whole families  children  old people  sick people  and took them away.
And here we...I  myself and another uh fellow  we were arrested; two survived and two escaped--but two of us were arrested  because we just  uh  ran into the uh...uh...set-up  you know  by the...by the police.
And he paled  I could see the blood was running down his face and i mmediately he reaches out for the telephone  I assume to call the military police  an d I jumped through the window  it was a ground floor.
So instead of working in an employ ment office  I work in a police station.
Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the Russians are raping the women and killing the children  taking away the cows.
One of the first things that happened was any Jew that owned any kind of a business at the time in Austria  if his employees wanted to get rid of him and take ove r the business  all they had to do was go down to the secret police  the Gestapo   and tell them get the Jew out of there.
Friday  the police came and told me that I have no longer a son.
After two weeks we were taken off the ship  the 13 of us  and we were taken to the police station and everyone was being interviewed by a police officer.
Not every gro up had a police dog  German Shepherd  or had a lot of guards.
Now  in the place where I was working  you could see a small window in the warehouse  you could see a small little lake and past the lake you could see the hills of Ciepelowo where they were killing the Jews.
The house we lived in was also occupied by a high ranking person from the ghetto police.
And one day the police came  as expected  and they arrested my father.
And he they arrested him and brought him in in the from upper  down toward toward in direction to this o to this you know  I told you  gendarmerie and for police  etcetera  the direction  but they need to go next to my window  y ou know.
It was a piece of cardboard  five centimeters on two point five centimeters on which it was written free and the stamp of the police.
He was sent to the local police station  our part of town  told to empty his pockets and what came out among other things was orders for reserve lieutenant Arnstein to report for either a physical exam or I dont remember those detail.
We ll  we -- now we went home and we thought well  will the police come today or tomorrow?
They we lived in Rotterdam  they came down and and the Dutch Marines held the Maas bridges for three days  didnt surrender them to the Germans  and I as a German citizen  having a German passport  which incidentally was on the in the at the American consulate in Rotterdam  we I was Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16  2001 52the Dutch police came  since I was registered as a German citizen livi ng with my uncle in Holland.
Something about book burning and taking away the rights of the Jews and putting them in ghettos and I suppose it was I dont remember it was that time or afterwards  but they mentioned about the killing of Jews.
If those letters were sent to a German authority  or a French police authority  they just tore them up.
I...I arrived five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the window from the fifth floor and you asked me how I  how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at th e same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene.
How to...now they call them...a police sergeant  yes  in charge of this neighborhood  district.
Maybe it was all the people on the truck  the police and the SS  nu  5 persons or 6 persons.
So there was police  SS   on the top of the train.
What do I do  what do I do by killing him  what do I establish in that  so then you kind of put it behind.
Thats the drivers license  I had the made up drivers license like the name I had  so I also changed the drivers lice nse  all of them  and then its maybe a little one of the -- the last I had  I had it renewed in 1945  so I never -- I shouldnt tell that to the police because I never had an exam.
And my husband  after awh ile they used to get some German marks from the German government   like from the state where we were  Bavarian state  they used to get some German marks  because they sort of were on a pilung of a police department  or whatever they called it  after awhile.
As I go on the other side to clear  to look for Germans or police who were either wounded or whatever it is  I come and near me I see another girl from the Rachen  which she was also with us all the time  Rasha Baskin is her name.
There was the 101st  the 82nd and the British 36th Airborne  so you can see that the idea of jumping behind the lines and killing Hi tler was a long way from potential fruition.
I was  I got dressed  they took us to a police station in the neighborhood where we were.
He described how the Germans filled up a park with Jews and how the Germans practiced dive bombing  killing the Jews.
The chief of police in our litt le town took it upon himself not to send anybody to the concentration camp that had been an offi cer in the German army.
Theres a train waiting and I ge I lost my friend and his fa mily in that process  because everything has to run and schnell and soldiers there  police there  and I end up in a compartment and I tell the people once were all seated  that when the train leaves the station  I will jump from the train.
[
There were many things like that of course  for the police.
At a very early stage of 1933  of course they came and -- the police and the storm troopers came into our hous e  and they went through my fathers library  but they werent -- werent enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious background.
And  at that point  I get back to the camp  and by that point  my staff and the DP  the DP police are  have a cordon and are getting them back.
And after eleven months I had a run-in with my captain  police captain  and he told me  \ You don't make arrests in this place  you stay out of that place  and leave these people alone.\
Not -- well  they saw the beginnings of it all when people disappeared and people just didnt make it ba ck from the police stations or they were snatched out of their beds.
That police force  the Danish police force in Sweden  if uh the war had dragged on  if the occupation had dragged on  the plan was that the police force should go in to Denmark as a military unit.
I think each group had about one or two police dogs  German Shepherds  and they were pretty vicious.
They were shot from this Polish police and from the German.
So the police went out to Krakow  and they found these girls  and they brought them back.
who was from Poland   and she found out that this is Ronniker  and she says to her daughter  on your knees and start killing.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 28 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: DL: The Jewish polices was um--um the same as any police force.
So in that way  many of the Jews that were spared from hangings and killings and beatings were simply spared by Oskar Schindler appearing in this killing camp.
And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the taxi with...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say  \ What's wrong?
Not in crimes  in the that the poet Matuzevicius   who had was in the from gymnasium Bir  two or three years earlier than me   and some of his friends and so I understood from Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 249 Michael that he has that he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the shooting of the Jews  he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home their home belongings Okay  their their items  their assets  yeah.
And he went in and one of the police noticed him is moving -- a moving object and he gave him straight to his stomach  a bullet.
Tito is to me a -- a remarkable man  the way he took on the Nazis  but he also let his people suffer because it was because of the odd -- killing of some odd German soldier  the Germans were ha nging hundreds and hundreds of innocent Serb civilians.
And from one day to another  she said  with tears in her eyes  Ô¨ÅMy father forbade me to play with you any 5 longer  because you are Jewish  and he belongs to a certain German organization  and would be a danger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl.Ô¨Ç That was my very first -- and  I had to give you all these things you get from everybody  because of course  you met it everywhere  from your greengro cer -- and you met the other  too  people who stood up for you  and perhaps a most outstanding one was we ha d a super in our house  and he denounced my mother to the Secret Police  and denounced me  too  because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend  which was against the Nuremberg laws.
I said  Ô¨ÅWhat are they doing to you?Ô¨Ç He said  Ô¨ÅThey're killing me day by day.
There was police trouble  my mother went to governor [indecipherable] he later became president of of Poland in London  and he told me well  its probably a [indecipherable] I dont know how what you say [indecipherable] that at police station we consider very suspicious that they are pro-Bolshevik   you know  but we cannot do anything to them  we have to prove it  you know.
My aunt's husband was also part of the underground  and actually was really defending Belgian people and killing Nazis.
So they took us to the station in Prague  they took us to the Police Station  so called.
I was an exceptional...uh...person as far as the Hungarians concerned  with...with their law; because while I was in that--it was not a city  a small town--I would be playing for the...uh... police  giving a concert as a youngster.
I didn't see any council  but the Jewish police  I mean  this is the organized transport as I said  and groups of young boys to go to work that required to do some work for whatever the Germans wanted us to do.
And I see the Germans screaming and killing people  and that I'll never forget I guess for as long as I'll live.
For instance  when I came to America  on the first or second day  I asked when we have to go to the police to register.
Not so much I -- even from the Germans  like from the Polacks that the pol -- the police that helped them out.
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: My mother  well  probably both my parents felt that as French citizens  she would have a better hope of survival because the occupation forces and also the French police  unfortunately  arrested foreign Jews first.
We come to the door on the shop  was already German police and the same   the Jewish men s tailors  meisters.
Its a big sabotag e [indecipherable] and all the -- to -- young kids  they said they worked with -- for a ye -- they worked for police  they worked  you know  from 98 the ghetto they went out to work to the police  railroad police  those who carried the prisoners and thing  or my people are [indeci pherable] to the camps  or those prison -- those have a police force  they have a police force and they worked for them.
We couldnt do that because thats the one thing  you know  they -- they kept a whole ghetto  a whole community responsible for one act of sabotage  or one act of killing or doing something against them.
And I have to state here that the Hungarian police department  the Jundermaren  they were worse than the Germans.
W-Was there a time that the Jewish police came for your mothers furs or your fur collar?
02:09:44 And when I was up here at the at the Smithsonian conference  the people at the Justice Department  and the head of that office is Neil Scher 2  uh pointed out to me that the diary which had been found in the home of Mrs. Brossert when the original police raid occurred at the time in June of 1985 when Mrs. Brossert led people to the cemetery 3 in Embu for the exhumation  that this diary was taken away and was examined by hand-writing specialists from the two countries  I presume  but that there was quite unanimous agreement by these specialists that this hand-writing in the diary was the hand-writing of Josef Mengele  because that could be compared with samples of his hand-writing that was available in the SS files  which had been guarded in safe-keeping by the Office of Special Investigation at the Justice Department  so we had an authenticated diary which hand-writing experts agreed about that.
And the laws of France  to the shame of France   right  went to adopt German anti-Semitic laws and gave to the -- to the Germans the right to dictate to the Vichy government what the French police  the French states and the French functionary would do to the Jews  particularly the refugee -- refugee Jews.
But this is an ex ample  a child comes u p. And then there were constantly killings  they were killing  murders.
Only the police or certain -- it was illegal  no guns.
So instead of having the Russian -- the Russian police  or Polish police -- you know  you had German police  but -- No different.
You know  it is because he cannot go and tell the police  and others.
He asked for a a note from the police station that they kept him overnight  because he had only a short duration he could come and get me.
I can remember when the Germ ans--I could neve r distinguish the difference between the Germans or the gendarme  the police  whenever they appeared  I would go on the corner of the fireplace and try to make myself as small as I could.
There was three kilometers from that little place was a  a  a railroad station where I used to come to town and from town  and they asked all of us to come into town  and we predicted unpleasantry right then and then  because we heard already news that the Germans are killing and doing things and my father didn't want it to believe at that time.
In Germany at that time  and I believe even today still  every person has to be registered with the police at his or he r place of residence and a person can only have one place of residence.
Uh God was good to them once again  and uh one of the uh officers inside th is barrack  inside this police station  recognized my parents fr om when we were interned in .
Because th e  uh  the day bef-uh  before I was  came another Jewish family living upstairs  and I thought when th ey find out that I was caught  that perhaps they have a chance to get away  and that was happened  and  uh  they uh  somehow got the note that I was  that the German took us  of  of the police  and  uh  see they had time to get run away.
And she found  through a whole long story that I cant go into now  but she found a police officer called Oskam  was his last name  O-s-k-a-m  who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer  came from USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 5 a completely Nazi family  and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the underground  and was hiding about 30 Jewish men  women and children  in the little village not too far from Utrecht.
In that town  there was the police station  the police department  the police chief  the police in France -- or what you might call the gendarmes.
Got in connection with this police and he said he can find out.
Do you know of any other examples of police helping or the Judenrst helping the underground organizations?
So one afternoon  my uncle got a telephone call from the police chief of Breslau.
The police was Jewish  but they working at the time for... So they drag a ll of us (laughing) to jail.
And after this my dad was appointed director of police for the Saar province.
You are not killing others--which is not a pleasant task either--but you can be the victim.
How were these people selected to be in positions of authority whether it was the police or the factory?
A nd actually that night  after we were caught  when I walked back because I said  Ô¨ÅI'm going to come back to the house Ô¨Ç and that 13 Durand  I hadn't met Durand yet  but I had r un into Sudrier  the mayor and he says  Ô¨ÅWhere have you been?Ô¨Ç And I said  Ô¨ÅOh  we were told that maybe they're going to deport us and so he says  Ô¨ÅYou see this is all British propaganda Ô¨Ç I said  Ô¨ÅI know because I was at the policier 18 last and they freed us Ô¨Ç he says  Ô¨ÅYou see?Ô¨Ç But then that's when he probably called the police and they doubled the thing and that's when Durand  the neighbor  the ex-convict told us about it.
So and then we and I knew from the time when we came back from when I came back from America  special then in the months after new year  February  March  we were watching  again by the secret police.
They looked like normal soldiers but being at my grandparents house when we were sleeping there we  at night we heard a lot of you know robbing and killing and people screaming you know.
What did they tell your fa ther at the police station?
But I got him messed up in such a way that the police took me off and they twisted my hand in back of me and they held me by my belt and by my hand in the back.
It just happened the chief of police  again a refugee  was a gradanier  Serbian gradanier from Belgrade  he was a royal guard  about six foot five  he becomes chief of police.
This was later  from the French police  when they ask I said that I'm a Francophile who has paid for his sympathy to the French prisoners with time in a concentration camp and so on .
Kill people what you dont know  you have no idea whom you are killing  why you are killing?
We followe d them right acr oss the railway station  we see criminal polic-eye   the police!
So while we were at the Salvation Army  we went to this to the police to the you know  and my mother said we have friends at this camp.
Then the police would have to come out  put some on ambush or come searching to catch the partisans.
I got like...I was looking for somebody like stay the SS  stay the police  what they hear  in this time.
They knew about the incident about the killing and they thought I was okay  I was doing a good job and eventually they told me  quite soon  Lallier  you too will have to come to Canada  we need guys like you.
Mushkat was a member of Papas higher police  and he was in charge of orphans  orphanage  taking care of them  schooling  feeding  everythi ng that was necessary to do for orphans.
And I thought  I didn't know the underground was already that strong  and I uh  didn't want to go in  in or out if the Ger-the police give me little notice here.
Some of the leadership or most of the leadership was in favor of trying to enlist the help of sympathetic Bulgarians and the Church and the courts rather than engage in demonstrations and clashes with the police.
From the year that we came to Yugoslavia till we left  he was always a persona non grata for some reason or another  because they on ly gave him six months of staying time and th en he had to go to the police and sign up again six more months  and that went on from 1922 to 1942; for 20 years.
We were sitting in the morning and and killing the lice - the shirts were infested with it.
And he was always dreaming that the Ukrainians were killing him; that they were successful; they butchering.
The husband  big guy  look at the co -- position Im in  Im -- Im -- Im -- Im like under the gun with the police.
Yet  they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from house to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections.
And the Germans  with the help of the Ukrainian police  and Lithuanian police  used to come in and take them away.
The highway we'll go  we'll get running in with the people taking to the fortress where th ey're killing Jews.
Thats what we  but we were not intent to killing individuals because we knew that there would be great repercussions you know to the Polish c  civilian population.
Well  she was shrieking and she came storming out to the police station protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason whatsoever  but obviously it did not do any good.
Go to the matzos -- they are -- they were baking matzos  so only the police and the firemens need to go to the matzos.
Located at Politz ( Pol: Police)  near Stettin (Pol: Szczecin)  in Pomerania.
Somebody came up to us and said the police was looking for you  but they were looking for you at Down the street.
and they were well known there  and by that time they must have had some remorse  you know  the police department and they treated th em rather well  you -- if you know what I mean.
So we started off a police department  and a employment  like bureau to get people jobs  and sanitary  and -- and like -- and a cafeteria so people eat there.
So we were supposed to watch for that  and if we -- when we catch a guy that is selling this candy  we were supposed to bring them to the real polic e  the men police.
One day I was caught by the  the alien secret police and after that I was afraid to go out so it there was no sense to go to work.
And we call them the black maria  which were car used by the police to pick up Jewish people  or anti-Fascist.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 14 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: because the inner life of the ghetto was really around by the Jewish ghetto police  rather than the Germans.
This is far as my know--knowledge and my--my--uh my personal uh--uh to do with--with the police.
And the one who tried to arrest me showed up and he whipped me very nicely  making clear that you shouldn't escape from a German police officer.
Then what happened was my parents got word through the apprentice whose parents' house we were at  that the chief of police had come to my father's shop and told my father's partner that he would like to speak to Gruber and him.
Something else that I -- I me-m eant to mention is that -- is that living in the si -- in constant danger and not knowing exactly when the police would come to take us away and what would happen after that  we thought it was a good idea to prepare ourselves and get some poison.
And one Ukraine man  what I say he was in police  he take him at home.
Uh so when they came with this force attacked...the force consisted of Germans  lots of troops...Russian  the Ukrainian police  my brother was standing guard and when he saw it was too late already .
Do you know of the different ways that the police helped the Underground or --------- maybe helped the Underground?
And and the hotel used to be also raided by the French police by the French police.
9 And if the police -- the French police had been smart  they would have said  oh  German Jew  and they would  they could  they should have shipped her directly to a camp in the South of France where they put all German Jews and they didn't.
Maybe he asking me the question or another man  so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working in cooperation with the -- with the underground.
If you go this way  they're killing all the Jews and taking away everything you've got.
He wore a uniform when he was working for the Lithuanian government  on the border police.
