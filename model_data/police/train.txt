The troops were chasing the Germans or the inmates had captured the Germ ans and were busy beating them or killing them  and you know people were dying all ar ound.

That's one thing it was  there was every sign of it  you know  like there was military establishment  so we put  we put in our rooms and bunk beds you know and uh so you start up police department an employment office  everything was kind of temporarily  and a hospital  of course was a hospital there because it was a military establishment previous to when we arrived.
I suspect some Jewish agency from Palestine that did that and the car took me from Aleppo to the Palestine border  stopped there  went to the police station  they asked me a few questions  then the car took me to Haifa  where a friend of mine was waiting for me  Mr. Horowitz  and... What do you think about the responsibility of the organizers of this voyage  the people who really organized the trip?
I guess I hadnt changed really  either  because I wasnt really in a killing camp.
And we found this Jewish police and the government [indecipherable] and some people were there.

01:15:36 Well  also during that time  as I had mentioned to you before  during the night many times the  the SS2 or the police not the Dutch police but the German patrol  police or whatever their designation was came to various homes  looked for Jews  wanted to see their ID papers  wanted to see whether they had special permits to stay away from being sent for relocation in the east  and these special stamps were sometimes that you had a you did quote  unquote  \ a very important work\  or that you had the possibility of getting a visa to get out of Holland via Portugal or that maybe you had instead of four Jewish grandparents you had only three Jewish grandparents.
The Au strian police was like -- was Hitler supporters  theres no question about it.

They were using often primitive implements to kill people  not to speak of the fact that people were starving  exposed to the elements and just hanging  killing with knives  throwing people in the river next door.
Because I see it  whether it's in Israel  whether it's all over  you see  there are always people who are ve ry self-centered and they want ju st what they want and they do whatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people  hurting other people or harming or killing other people.
I wanted to go to the dentist  you know  but somehow the police  they said to my father  don't go in the ghetto because there is going to be a .
So  they induced a fever in me and I'm always asked  how do you do that and they took some French bread and made balls out of it  like meatballs and soaked them in vinegar and I had to swallow about eight or nine of these vinegar soaked bread balls and sure enough within a half an hour or forty-five minutes  I was in bed with a high fever and when the police came  they took my temperature and they verified and certified that yes  he is not fit to be transported.

She said if there's a police or anything  they might hear the name and they might come and take us away.
Not prisoners nobody  nobody dared to  to fight with the German because they were killing.
And then the women started to beg and to pray  say  Ô¨ÅWe were at the police  please allow us to go home.
Ô¨Ç Sure enough when I got home the lady told me tomorrow report to the police station  take all of your stuff along.
So I have a friend who got a job in Washington  a psychologist working for the police depa rtment  and sh-shes my best friend actually  and she said to me  Ill find you a job.

I remember once I was up in the Borz sony mountains in Hungary in a self-defense camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a creek  not deeper  I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches  and guess who is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something  not to save his own skin  but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were released.
I didn't know how the feeling of killing  but just listening to it I agreed to be the victim.
I might meet with the local mayor or police chief or whoever  \ Who's Daisy around here?\
Catholic Church  they were harboring him  he had already at this time to protest???????and he was amnestied by President Pompidoul at this time as you remember President Mitterand also had said in different cases no more trials against French Collaborators  of French High Officials in order not to embarrass the Civil Peace in France  that was the explanation given  not to divide the French population pro and anti Vichy and so we started at this time and ha was arrested and even though when arrested in the South part of France and the Police from Paris came over because the Police of the Cote DAzur did not want yo act  there was information going around   because the Police told us the KLARSFELD GANG will come and kidnap him  so the Police in Paris  so our fame  but the most important I think is the trial when my son defended most of the associated plaintiffs.
So we surrounded the police station one night and we disarmed the policemen.
When they returned home in 1944  police were sent to arrest the Garihs but agreed to say instead that the family was not home if the family would leave immediately.
It was nothing that was sure and was and  and was and was  I mean the whole country was like that  the whol e country was under  under police  I  I don't know what how you can  I can't even  how can I describe it?
But the...uh..timing was that the end of November the...uh...the German police rounded up all Polish citizens and it was very easy to distinguish a...uh..person because...uh...Germany was a dictatorship country and you had to register with the Police 3 regularly.
I had a terrible nervous digestion at that point  and even the police dog could not stand it.
So  from your point of view  there really wasn't that much activity between the Council and the police -- ------ the Council or the people.
Lets go back to lets go back to Fera Ferraba   is that where you were arrested by this NKVD oh no  by the police  for stealing.
And so she did that and then my father Anita Frank 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 said many times that during the war  when in effect the  the police would come and when in effect they were told to pro duce papers that they couldnt produce  and when in effect these threats were made of transporting us  of  of interrogating us on the train because they notified my parents this might happen  that my father said she  he would just be in despair and my moth er just would support him and encourage him and say  Ô¨ÅNo  lets  lets go and see what we can do and lets contact Frompinksteron but be careful about it Ô¨Ç and she just  she just  she just is the one who  who persevered.
He was in Poland  chief of police of the Jewish people.
A third one came to me and he immediately pulled out a police badge and said  \ Well  we are from the Secret Police and you are going to lead us to where your friend is.\
The police chief  Ramsey thought that all the police should go up  and the CIA.
This man made us first go to the border police and be searched.
I don't think -- I don't think it was in -- it wa s rumors was coming around that the Jewish police knew where children hiding places were   and they reported it to the Gestapo  and -- because to save their own skin that there  that's all they had.
So  its another phase of what the secret police did  you know  its it was the financial secret police  lets put it this way.
And then af ter awhile  he was a rather ambitious -- was in the army and then he joined the police force  and he made a name for himself  because he apprehended one of the most ferocious criminals at the time who had chopped up children and so.
But then the thing was that it was obvious that my father  we would all have to go because the police came to check on us  our tourist visas were finished so they said if you can find another place  another country that will have you we dont mind.
And  eh  we were in and out because there were certain days when he said  Look  I have a feeling that tonight the police will come.
If I would believe in God  would still be a believer  I must also believe in the same God who witnesses killing of little children.
When I got to Auschwitz  they had all kinds of ways of killing people.
When you mention th e men being rounded up and you and your mother and brother were rounded up  was this by the Hungaria n Police or Army or do you know?
She says  we dont call no fire department and police fo r somebody to go home .
I would have police bring that person to the office and I would interrogate them and write it down and then talk to them again and ask them if they were willing to sign whatever they told me.
But sometimes we had the chance to and -- and -- and there were reports finally  main ly from BBC  the Britis h radio  that the Nazis were killing  at that time it wa s said  hundreds of thousands of Jews  and that -- while it filled us with fear  it -- the number  hundreds of thousands   was so huge that it staggered our imagination.
Like this  put on a machine gun  and zzzzz  you know  killing e it wa for us  definitely they were not afraid to do it.
But we -- we would go work in the fields on Sunday  and we a -- they always used to light us up  you know  the police  but no-nothing ever happened.
So  yes  we did have police and we did have a Judenrot  but they were a part of the Jewish community of the Ghetto  which was not true in other Ghettos.
Post office  police office  a-and to me the police seemed to be chief of police seemed to be much bigger shot than my father.
It was high up in mountains...was nice  and  uh  it was a good feeling to be away from those killing places and from the chimney.
And police looked at it and said  Ô¨ÅGo on.Ô¨Ç You know  there was no problem.
So they called the police and the police saw that we had legitimate passes  so the police said what do you want  they have legitimate passes because we got the passes.
Like I saying  they were killing already but somehow we made it through the things.
But these police was very instrumental in in many cases  in many after we were already established in the ghetto  we had a most of the people had already a regular I mean  some regular job  work  you know  the job was because nobody paid for the job.
On September 15th at one o'clock in the morning  the police came to our house and they told me to get dressed.
Some some of the police guys were bad  some of the neighbors were questionable  but there were an awful lot of good people.
And  the Jewish police  the Jewish administration we blamed for some errors they did.
What happened is the Germans  Latvians  Ukrainians with the assistance of the Jewish police  rounded all inhabitants of the ghetto into the marketplace.
They find something that was his father  grandfather  or the grandda -- somebody  you know  was comf -- arrive to the police -- Poland from the Germany.
And neither do the Swiss police or any other I know of.
So this is suspicious  how you survived  right  the Germans had the order of killing Jews whenever they found them and children too  so here I tell the real story  I must tell you  I never learn how to lie  I' m very bad at it  so how did it happen and I had to tell them the truth  that the German cam e into the hiding  dragged the parents  killed Edwarda Rorat 32 February 25  1996 Page 32 them and looked at me  thought I was pretty and they didn't kill me  so that sounds too naive and too ridiculous  they didn't believe it  right ?
Because killing children was something he could have ever imagined that anyone can do.
The police saying at first they had to have a working permit  and to get a working permit was hard.
And I had some encounters with the ghetto police when I was there briefly.
63 So it was the Jewish Judenrat  and the Jewish militia  the Jewish police  that implemented that order.
No  because the German give order po -- Polish policeman  take me to prisoner -- to police station how you call it?
The Polish police recognized me immediately and they approached me  and they said you are Jewish.
Also were in the leading place uh they also killed  as a matter of fact  they took one  La--Levine then  he was the chief of the police he forces uh.
And then they had to pay -- to payback  and they paid back by killing.
