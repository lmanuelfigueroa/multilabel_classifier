When the police was around the ghetto and he was worried  frightened}.

By the way  once we went through this experience  every place we went  we moved  we were told the next place they were going to killing us.
This was  for example  you know  as I was going to meet Michal  lets say  and we always waited until the last moment before th e police time–to get home.

We decided the dog is not as -- hes ferocious  but makes a lot of noise  and their dogs -- we have here the police department  who wi ll also attack some body  but not for the throat  like these dogs were trained for us.
They were there by the killing and they were there by them digging and burning the Jews...the people up.
And right away they oh yes  I forgot to mention  that the same day  a day before  they called the Germans  the German Obersturmfuhrer called up the the head of the council  and told him that there is going to come in the some German some German supervisors are going to come in  because there might be a change of guard  and they want the police should be neatly dressed  their boots properly shining  their uniforms  whatever they were  the armbands  they should be all in Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 82 order  because they are going to make a check on the police also.

And after three years  they were -- came out  and imagine  for killing 12 people who escaped from Treblinka  they got three years.

Tell me  what is the things Well   they been went to the farms  and they been killing people  you know  thats what thats what they did  you know?
And then  about a week later  my husb and was an engineer  he had a friend from college  but he was a Nazi of ficial  and he had to me said  ye ah he said  I wa nt to meet you next to the police station  so my husband said  I'm not going to the police station.
They were -- All the killing  actually  was done by them.
I was in the first killing  and these soldiers saved my life  and I sit in the prison.
And I went out to the police station  and police chief  whose name I cant remember  he took me in his arm  and he cried.
So she decided they were Jews and she went to police.
is you talk about killing  blowing things up  with a smile on your face.
I came home -- sure enough  I just got the certificate and I just came home and the land lady told me the police were just here  you should come and get your stuff and go tomorrow to the police station.

We are trying to take away from German hands the strong practice of killing and executing by obeying.
Previously they had organized only police battalions which were used in some fairly low level capacity fighting guerillas be-behind the front lines  so -- but these were going to be combat 46 divisions of the Waffen SS.
So I went back to the Police station  and I tell them I am not...I want to go back to Germany.
They didnt have yet -- they didnt have yet the -- the -- the -- those camps  you know  the mass -- the mass -- mass killing.
BUt since the Lithuanians start killing the people -- no matter whatever they found -- they killed them.
And she walked to the nearest police station and denounced him and said  he has 28 Jews in the house.
So there was often a backup  because the killing went on day and night   but the trains kept coming day and night.
Did you have a good or bad impression of the Jewish police in the ghetto?
So uh mother made up a story as to where he was  and uh the police did everything they do to to calm her down they said don't worry about it uh  we don't even like to do this job but we have to do it  and they said if there is anything particular you'd like to do before we start our work  that's fine.
And he found me there when he came home and of course I had left the a partment  left and hid in the stairwell and the police found me there and took me to the hospital and it was after that that I was taken to the hospital and got shock treatments but they were not effective.
They were prepared  they were organized  the Germans  the killing squads with their organize.
And then I went to the police station  which wasn't too far.
So she has I told her later she had enough guts even to go to the police  first of all.
I recollect that the guys there at the wore a long  black rain coat  and they had a kind of plaque that on their neck  and it turned to be the military German military police.
A nd we went to the front gate  aft -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 37 Lets stay with the -- the killing a little bit  just because its such a -- I know -- a terrible experience to -- first of all  you were not chosen to do that  but who was it that told you to?
Barracks with the same bank -- th -- the bunkbeds like you see in -- in -- in Auschwitz  and we had Ukrainian police -- there were three SS men  and the rest were Ukrainian police  and they took us to work every morning  and we had to go  and march and sing  and -- Sing?
The Jews from Rhineland were deported into the south of France and promptly picked up by the French whatever -- police or militia or whatever and put into these camps.
The reason what happene d before  why the situations created such was that there was no laws against harassing or killing Jews.
But I was chief of police for six days so theres a limit to what you can accomplish.
So we will go the u -- the United States government will push names for instance  of concentration camp guards before they might push the names of a -- an obscure police unit in an area that were not sure that there was persecution  at least Holzman type persecution.
Because the next day  as I walked out  when the Russians were there already  I walked out and I saw a lot of them killed  police lying on the ground.

And they let out rumors more and more they were killing.
The round-up was conducted by the French police at the bequest of the Germans  of the German authorities.
But after he had shot this man  he gave himself up and the next morning I was staying at the rooming house where during those semester months and got a call from the police to ask me to come over there to the police headquarters in Berne.
We knew about concentration camps  but we didnt know about killing camps until fairly late.
Yeah  we find out when it start in Germany in 1939  we knew already that he's killing  that he's doing things  but we couldn't believe  why you should come to us to do this  why?
And then  were not a hundred percen t sure if the story is true  but I was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son  and my father was the family doctor  and they say that my father saved the childs life.
I go further  another place  I went to the police all I went to the police there  I showed up  I told them Im from the communist party  also a member  and they gave me f ood.
We shouldn't drink wi ne that it was...and it was something that incredible and then I went imme diately to the site of the ghetto to see what is about my hiding  my crates  five crates whether with my uh entries of the diary and the and the documentation and I found out that part of the big building  the block C  block C in in the roof of which...in...not in the r oof  in the cellar of which two meters below the below the surface that it was entirely in ruins and you cannot get...there is no access  so I uh said I'll come and take shovels and then...but when I came home I was arrested by the   the the Soviet...the Soviet secret police and they took me in there a nd they asked that I should give them the diary  so I said what ar e you talking about  a diary?
Not very much cause we were always pretty active  but we did meet some -- some here and there  particularly when we we re moving through some area that had been cleaned out completely a l -- a lot earlier  like when we went to Paris  for instance  and we -- we were in Paris and we were -- actually we were -- stayed at Le Bourget Airdrome  th-the old name  and we had leave to go out into Paris  if you wanted to  Interview with John Bucur August 18  2003 31but you -- you had to go in -- in pairs or threes or fours because there were German snipers in -- living in houses and living with the French that were killing off our soldiers when they were gone.
7 Oh  from the police we were brought to Summab ar  because they didn 't want us  because we didn't have a visa  so that I guess the Jewi sh community were doing that  that we were intoneered in Summabar and they gave us the food  or th e money what we need at that time  in order to live.
Now  was it more humane that the Jewish police did it?
There was killing in camp for the kapos that -- the poor and they were cooked in the kitchen.
Best was much earlier  Best was one of the evil spirits of the police department of the emerging Nazi party even before the two powers divides into three.
And they  with all those lists  helped the Belgium police to arrest  you know  the -- the Jewish families.
Immediately all the ghetto was surrounded by machine  you know  from the Gestapo and military and police and whatever you say.
There was very little friction amongst the various groups of the population  and it wasn't until the Nazi Party started the activities when very violent demonstrations occurred  and the Communists on one side and the Nazis on the other side were shooting each other and killing each other during these demonstrations.
It stayed that way for awhile  and after that they sold it  or they -- it was handed over to the German police.
During the daytime  the Ukrainian police was looking for people there  because from the ghetto  displaced  and they came to the corns and they said  They were here.
Polish -- No  not a Pole -- German police and German soldier  I think.
That he told me  call the [indecipherable] immediately  call the police  call whoever you can do  you will come tomorrow.
He was like a me ister  like a sergeant with the German police.
And the chief of police was very nice to us  very sympathetic.
And did you have opinions then about the male Jewish police?
A lot of them were mixed  and they took us in and they told us that we had to be very quiet and it was a basement where they put us and sometimes we did chores for them and they gave us some food and they really didn't know how long we could stay because they were constantly being watched by neighbors  you know  and sometimes they could tell them stories so they could explain what was going on but most of the time they didn't see any of the police  any of the German police and we stayed there for several months and slowly they tried to explain to us that things are getting very bad and they are threatened they would kill them if they would find out how many Jews they had.
An d you know  and they let us they 9 they told us  this is the end  theyre gonna going to keep killing until all the Jews are gone  he says.
The rapes and the killing that is done and was done  and is done today  right  against iinnocent people  you know  in different parts of the world I wont name now  but -- but weve had several genocides and one or two are going on right now.
And one of the things that I rememb er my father commenting about some of the Jewish police -- I didnt see it myself  but commenting  that actually they would  in rounding up old people  those 50 are the priorities  getting the old and the sick and get ri -- getting rid of them.
But all the casualties we had were due to bravery; they were really fighting and they really wanted to see and show the police over there that somebody has got to be accountable for the way they did in that massacre against the Jews so well.
In the meantime they obliged us  all the Jewish people  to go every day  every morning  in the police and give our presence to say we are here...to be ready to pick us up any time they wanted.
Q. Were you ever aware of the gu ards or the police  either German or even the prisoner guards  taking advantage of all these beautiful women?
The witness ta lks  the prosecutor or police interrogator summarizes it  types it up  and the witness is -- is -- reads it and then either signs to it or makes whatever changes the witness deems are a-appropriate and accurate.
That's why when the Ukrainians went on the rampage  and they were killing and beating and massacring Je-- Jews  they didn't come into that area.
So in a way  this friend of mine whose name happened to be Frankfurter  by killing this Gustov  saved my life actually.
I was sent  I think  we had very good connections with the Polish police force.
And then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand  you know  the suppression  the police state  the apparatus  and on the other hand the German resistance  which we call the other Germany  and in the midst were also some people  but you know  this tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one.
A lot of police  looking for for Jews and for black marketeers so imagine - it was so dangerous for me.
Well they were in the building and the mounted police arrived.

So he look at the police chief; but without the glasses  he just like that.
And it is in this regard that the issue I just alluded to  that is to say where I differ with many in this  the concept of a worldwide killing program.
A Kapo was chosen  the Jewish inmate wa s chosen by the Germans to be the police force actually.
Because if they take take them to Rzeszow [indecipherable] where is military and the Gestapo  and German police and so on  is impossible.
S: Well they  the local police would come  and they would arrest them.
Some of them were bad but I can not recollect any atrocities having been committed by the ghetto police in Kovno.
And you saw less police than you see when you go downtown in Washington.
I see  so in the in th e daytime you would observe After the police hours  at night  wi you know  daytime  sure  we were doing this something by hearts  you know  watching and sitting on the curb of the sidewalk  you know  watching Just like that.
Sometimes they weren't there so we started marching so fast  and the police stood by the guard...the gate.
Then they...uh...the police  the German Gestapo and the SS came into the...to the court yard and start screaming we should get out.
I remember a child once attacking me  sa ying Im Jewish and I 57 opened my big mouth and I said  Im going to call the police  you know  I threatened him.
All the people that I saw going   and  and imagining what's going to happen  but once a big shot was supposed to come to Sobib or   usually they brought them  even Himmler was in Sobib or   to show them how efficient  and how perfect they had killing  and how good  and they brought a transport so they took me to clean up the  the quarters  the living quarters of the SS  of some of the SS people  which the windows face the railroad track.
For instance  I remember -- I always carry some documentation with me because I never knew when the police would stop me and ask me for documentation  because it was normal there.
And And then and then sooner or later  we found out that they were killing the Jews.
They st -- shared this -- our -- because they want to participate in our escape  and one of the friends of the friends was a confidant of the -- of the ed -- Polish secret police.
I met British fellows  and there was American Red Cross and American police  and they used to give me ma gazines  and I used to sell magazines to Indian storekeepers  you know  and they I always get money  I could rent a bicycle for myself  and I used to go and eat over there.
and for instance there were the killing of the Jews in -- in Kiev  which was -- that time I -- I dont recall  I cannot say that my father and mo ther knew nothing  but I am inclined to believe they didnt learn about such things.
But we found out soon that it was just -- it wasn't ignorance  it was just complete disregard and unwillingness on the part of the rest of the world  that they should want to do something to stop this killing and these murders.
It was surrounded by a very tall wooden fence which was guarded continuously by both German and Polish police.
And they said well  just go to th e police  dont worry about it.
And we were on that farm about seven months before all of a sudden  a number of differe nt French police types started to show up.
What was going on with the Jewish council and the Jewish police?
The police -- the French police I'm talking about -- was finding these very easy targets  because here was a group of Jewish children.
He came and by that time I developed a friendship with a Blockaltester  66 who was a Polish young boy  who was killing people right and left  to survive.
The customer  my customers that went into the German police and they said th eyre not able to go in to fit because they are afraid of typhus.
And then from then we were transferred by wagon  by by foot  wagon  sometimes by train  and so...so long we we arrived to Poland  by the border by Poland wherever you had  and you know  taking with you from Hungary  when we arrived at the border  the ...that mean the the the police  the border police of the Hungarian  says to us  you know  and they took it away from...everything what we had.
He told me that my brother started to fight the police back and they didn't shoot him  but they beat him to death on the outside of the apartment.
They knew  because we were reported by the SS to the local police  th ere are two escaped prisoners.
Many times we were told by the  by the police  by the Jewish police  ﬁExpect something.ﬂ They were quite regular  because to get from 150 to 20 or 15 when I left the ghetto  that's a lot -- 135  130 000 people.
Could very well be  if they would not have -- if the Jewish police would not have cooperated with them  that could very well be.
And initially the Bureau reports turned up a lot of other examples of police brutality.
Of course  we were killing them off  and taking them prisoners  and sending them back making sure they didn't get across.
I can tell you we even didn't enter the yard of the police because we were pushed inside by this mob.
In the second farm  again there was the police coming around and there we were hidden in a closet behind old clothes with a row of shoes in front of us and we were standing in there totally quiet.
The point of this was -- after we did the killing  we have to get rid of all the evidence.
And we left   we went to a police station in the American sector -- unbelievable  is -- isnt it?
Easier to -- police to -- to talk to the guard than us individually.
The reason why we know  it is her daughter who was put in a camp of children and what happened is  it's one instance where the  where a bishop or a cardinal in Lyon--I think Gerlier--t here's a Catholic  there's called a Catholic organizations  they took a number of people  dressed them as police people and came in the camp and kidnapped all the children and pl aced them with families.
Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 18 You had no idea that all those horri ble things were happening throughout Europe concentration camps There was there was no radio inform ation about whats was going on in Europe other than people who had radios and then had war stories  but they never said anything about the killing of Jews.
We knew that the Nazis were very nasty people  but when the killing really started  when the Final Solution started in 1942  I dont think we  as individuals  I dont remember  but I dont think I knew this.
I remember being horrified when they -- the nats -- the young Nazis came and took my father an -- the men  my father  my uncle and my grandfather to the police station  and I -- to beat them up  I think is too -- too strong a word  but they 68 certainly smacked my father and broke his glasses.
I have her death certificate issued by the Czech government but they are not willing to admit that she committed suicide because of the torture by the communist police.
And she so she said that he just he said the order he gave order to the police department that they are actually owners of this place  that they should they should be absolutely accepted to this  and the others  they should leave  you know.
And the NKVD was approaching The secret police were coming  yeah.
15 have been shoes that were taken from other Jews in various parts of the world where the Germans were killing people  must have been re-stitched or refinished for...so I remember the grown-ups marching away and somehow uh my mo ther contrived to not have to take that kind of a job but to have a job in the infirmary.
Was it a secret police  you know  because they use a lot of secret police without -- no uniforms.
If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing  let him work in a hospital.
It was the police officer and Fred Kaplan and I. And I said to him  \ Now we are looking for someone on whom you did a root canal on his upper first molar on December the 6th  1978  and got two thousand cruzieros  and you had a second appointment and got a thousand cruzieros \  and he said \ Well  you're welcom to go through these charts.\
He was a partisan and he used to come to our town by the ghetto and talk to some of the people  the young ones  not the old ones and tell them that there's going to be a killing and let them come.
So it was like two days  I went to the school  and when I came up  there was the Jewish police  and there was the SS that time.
He he was very friendly with the chief of police from from Berlin   and they used to go hunting together  and I was with them  always.
60 -- what happened  the -- the ca -- the police came in  the Gestapo came in and what did they say to you?
The way I think it worked  I vaguely remember now  if a Jew owned a store  a business  and his competitor I'd say  or anyone  would say I would like to have it  I would like to own it  could merely go to the police and say I want to buy that from that Jew  and the price was set  and that was it.
As I said the police were still there and we knew the elderly peo ple knew that this is what it is.
And the police took one look at me and said  \ Let her go.\
Truck by truck  and the German military police was standing directing the traffic.
I think killing anybody -- I -- I am against capital punishment  I am.
And when there was enough  they did bomb in October of 1944 two of the crematories  which stopped a lot of the killing but  unfortunately  those girls were hung in front of everyone.
negotiated with the German police  with the with with the gau gaulfuhrer from the city  the chief the police like here  you know  that he was the top  he was give given gold pieces.
21 Uh  I do understand  uh  that he was in this column being taken away and that the Germans were killing the prisoners as fast as they could while they were taking them back away from our line.
You know like  I would have never wanted to run into a police official person  who was in charge of making us go to the ghetto.
So I we didnt do the arresting ourselves  we charged the German police with that.
We or iginally and we now started to tell the people  \ Get your passports.ﬂ The Battar ime started to ge t their passports and th e word soon spread that you can go with the Betar with the Paragon which they were soon called  because on the door of the office of my lawyers was written  Dr. Willy Perle  tran sport and people came in 17 and one day shortly after apparently a neighbor ha d reported some suspici ous looking men or Jews meeting there and the police came and raided us.
I when the Russians came back  just what I did all the other times  whenever after the first killing of  we all went back to the same place to see who survived.
A2: They gave the police  and this is how they let him go.
However  this time he came with an armed police officer and two Iron Guard soldiers  also armed.
Police was fi you know  how do you call it  fired or whatever.
Because it true to take people just like this  killing them  gassing them for no reason at all?
The Hungarians were acting in killing them  as well as the SS.
So I told him that the Partis ans  the Polish Partisans killed...is killing Jews when they see a survivor.
And I went to some of the basic sources  theres a lengthy Nuremberg document which was written by the commander of the security police  in SD in the Baltic States  the former Einsatzgruppen chief  Walter Stahlecker  which was a lengthy report of about  oh  250 pages dealing with the German occupation of the Baltic States and the operations of the police  in particular the auxiliary police.
The other thing that stands out in my mind  I remember when we...we stayed in the house where we lived in...uh...there was one room and we had to share with about nine families in this room  and there was hardly any kind of room  and this one person who was...uh...with the...uh... with the Jewish police and...uh...he gave  evidently  my name to be taken instead of his child...uh...and...uh... two other children and I happened not to be in the house when they came to take me  and they took his child instead of me  and he came back and he started throwing things and hitting me and screaming at my mother and that I was supposed to go instead of his daughter.
They cames frequently to the camp and whenever they came  they came to the police office -- offices and walked around and talked to various people.
We should turn around and more or less be like a -- like a secret police  and denounce our fr -- our Greek friends.
So they called the police that par- ticular day--that was in a--that was the day of the uh--I think was in March 1944.
And th at -- oh yes  killing all kinds of partisan  burning the villages  117 and then seeing this guy killing seven unarmed  ha lf starved people in their tattered rags  could only have meant that the guy had suffered dementia   which is legally excusable  they put a guy like that in a nuthouse  right?
After they left from this   I saw the Polish...the Polish pe ople taking apart from the...from the truck  the things and taking for themselves  putting in the pockets and laughing and the Polish police.
I think even for a Latvian  this was a crime a-and I sa -- just looked here in the archives at some of the reports from Latvian police and so on.
03:50:23 Namur was a priest  a very  very good man  a very fine man  and have trouble with the police because they doesn't want to let us be there.
In May  they were deported to the Auschwitz -Birkenau killing center where Marty and other family members were chosen for slave labor.
I was told to report to the police station the next morning  and they beat me up before they put me into jail  but I was bleeding.
Maybe they were mare money more times  but twice we knew exactly because w-we  like I mentioned  in our closets we recognized  we knew  because w-we knew we heard that they are doing this kind of work  the secret police  so we exactly on purpose  we put certain things in our closets that we could then recognize that something someone was there.
21 Verpflegungsamt you could already see the fire  you could hear the shooting and the killing was going on  and before the evening came they put the ghetto on fire  because they couldn't find anybody.
The Jewish people started thinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police  or whoever was communist or something  they didnt want to take chances.
I mean he got taken in and they took  brought him to the police where he should have reported that he wasn't working anymore you know.
There will be fresh air and farms and the people put signs on it and they mobilized all the Jewish police including all the people who worked for the health department  including my mother  and they had to go and collect the children.
The camp command the commandant of the camp was a police commissar of the neighborhood in which I had lived in Strasbourg.
And again  this wasnt just a German a German there with the the the the Ukraine police with their shooting.
So Ra oul said to him in not simple words that  \ If you don't call off the killing immediately  I as a diplomat will be sure that you will be the first one hanged before your office.\
Interview with Helena Knapczyk May 10  2013 36 Mosty Wielkie   they have a biggest school for police school  in Poland .
In the beginning the Danish poleesh -- police would have pick you up and probably put you in the jail for a week or two.
Q. What was the general attitude towards th e police and the Jewish council.
I remember the 3 500 Poles  we had a Polish police force of young Poles who kind of ran the place  who looked after the security of the place.
There was several people in the police force who were good musicians and then and they-- SB: Ran out.
I dont know what I would have done if I had been you  but I-I dont know  but I can see you -- that you werent a contributing cause to that killing.
I have we havent seen the I I dont remember seeing a single car  except the one which police had tried to catch [indecipherable] What about from to Warsaw ?
And my best friend  Captain Psheckfass  who was a police commander there  he negated my application.
Yeah I mean the first kind of expe rience was getting a visa from the United States and getting an exit permit from the German politsi  from the police.
We had to go to wh at we called police  you know the man in the police station to register as Jews.
So he borrowed some money from a few people and he paid them off  the police.
12 Ferdinand aus der Funten  the commander of the German Security Police  who oversaw most of the Jewish Council's activities.
And one day he was arrested in the ghetto for killing his mother and keeping her body in his place  and using his -- her ration cards to get bread.
I would pick up at the bottom of the bridge in the police station fr om Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics so many people died  so many people committed suic ide  so many were deported.
One way it was easier for me  because according to my assumed things  and false papers  because I was born supposedly in Vilna  I was safer  because if I was caught na -- in -- in this period  first thing they checked with the parish and police.
I mean  people from outside whom we didnt know  who werent quite as well-educated as we would have liked them to have been  but happen to have been in the Partisans  and therefore they were assuming positions of the Chief of Police  et cetera  et cetera  but we were very good friends of theirs.
And and we started going to work  and sometimes playing  you know  and and those little boys  the they they were mischievous  you know  so so they th ey started killing turtles.
That  ladies and gentlemen  was the one where they decided on the final solution  which is a code word of killing.
But Im not aware that my parents or my fath er  or my grandfather had to report on a regular basis to the police.
We are spies  and they took us to a so-called Kommandantura where the Russian police was.
But after Pearl Harbor  the Japanese took over all Shanghai and they all... There was a police station there  and they got..took over...and there was a man with the name of Ghoya.
He came back with the Russians to Budapest and became a high positioned police officer  who was trying to find and did find th-the Nazis who -- the Hungarian Nazis who were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 16 responsible for most of the atrocities that took place.
And then  very soon  since we did not wear the yellow patch  of course we -- I th -- I think we may have been stopped by the police and we told th em that we are half Jews  and they said  oh if -- if -- if you had -- if thats your excuse  you have to have it -- you have to go and clear that with the German SD  the Sicherheitsdienst.
I didnt think that there was a lot of killing going on  certainly it was no Hilton  but I wa s totally unaware of the death camps.
Hugo Osteria had been a policeman -- political policeman for the Ovra  th e secret police of Mussolini  or the Fascists  throughout that period.
And  finally there was like on this limited place  like almost half a m illion Jews living in terrible conditions  living on a  on a nutrition base which was below the subsistence level  attacked by dirt and hunger and soon the other killing factor was typhus which was rampant in the  German  in the Warsaw ghetto.
Not only on account of the Jews  there was a lot of  you know  especially in the Middle East  they killing people off in Africa.
He said  the ra re Germans were killing  Lithuanians were k illing also there  the those Jews  you know  and he he told him particularly he the ch the killing of the babies for him you was was was the thing  I mean  he just couldnt he said  after that  I mean  he he just resigned from from the se rvice  and he doesnt want even to see.
The Jewi sh police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that we re Jewish police in my city.
Personally  I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by killing the people who represent it.
It was an order emanating from Germany but done by the French police.
So we -- they took away our passports and they said you cannot proceed because you are communists and we cannot let you in  and they took away our passports and arrested us and kept us in the -- in the police station in Jimbolia  and they -- it was 24 hours  after 24 hours they decided that we have to leave Romania.
They make like a corridor  they stay the Ge rmans  the police with like ---.
We had to leave my sister whats after me there  so she could open in the morning the business  so the police didnt know we left.
And the wording of the speech was  and that I think is a matter of record  ﬁM others and fathers  give me your children so that the rest of us may live and survive.ﬂ There were outcries  maybe a stone or two were thrown  but police was present.
And all through that time maybe once a month I had this dream of I'm staying in the hole and the German   I look up  standing with a gun  and my father next  and I said \ He's killing me\  and I wake up.
After the war  we find out the tragedy  but during the war  we didnt know the magnitude of building factories and killing people  they didnt know.
We should worry that people would work uh on the in the ghetto in proper way or just a small...it was a...it was not the police  but something sim ilar.
Q. How did you feel about the Jewish police and the Jewish council in Lodz Ghetto?
who signed the agreements which allowed the French police to be after us an d without those agreements the Germans would have been unable to arrest five Jews in France.
It was terrible way because we were going only really walking  running  and during the day time the planes  they are going low on the way and was killing people  he refuge  the refuge -- no  the refugees.
And those were the French police which in many cases were much nice than  you know  any...anyone else.
I had purchased from the chief of police an I.D. card identifying me being born in Marseilles.
One day I was arrested  I said...I told you  by the Legionary police.
02:12:17 So in uh...they asked me if I could  if I could ask the Brazilian federal police to track down the doctors and dentists to whom references were made in the diary and I did that and the police was very cooperative and they uh did find a number of these people  some of whom uh remembered having treated someone like Josef Mengele uh but of course had no x-rays to to go by it.
But  when we got to the slaughterhouse  where they did the killing  the mass killing  a-and my mother spoke to this SS person  asking him if they kill Ukrainians  too.
We couldnt go back because a lot of killing was going Poland.
But this was a -- a murderer  he was killing millions of people  and experimenting on -- on childre n  I mean  he -- he deserved what he got.
So the police officer at that point told us we had four hours to vacate the farm because he has orders to take us to the -- to relocate us to a different area.
If a cop comes and says ﬁYou go down and appear at the police station tomorrow morning at 8:00 o'clock ﬂ don't go.
>> Edna Friedberg: The mobile killing squads Sam is referencing conducted mass sho oting operations.
Naturally to live under the Communist regime is far away from being pleasant  however  we thought maybe we are better off under the Communists than the Nazis because there was not such a thing as a mass killing.
When she was back in London one day  the police came to the door and asked her if -- gave her some name.
And there used to be Jewish police  you know about that?
The police was still I mean they hated the Germans  but they didn't  you know they didn't fight them because there was still Danish police stay still stayed for few years.
And one day when the ger -- the Lithuanian and Ukrainian police came and took away all the kids from school.
Now at this time uh starting in the summer of 1938  all Jews who who were holding a German passport had stamped...and irrespective of the Nazi laws  we were still considered German nationals...all 18 German passports had printed a J into their pa ssports  and when people came back  especially after the November events  to Germany they we re taken immediately into custody and shipped into a camp  in a concentration camp  so in orde r to protect our escorts  the uh Ministry of the Interior  the Nazi Ministry of the Interior  gave everyone who who was an escort  they call it protection letter which he could use for the border police to say and it said that so and so  in my case Norbert Israel Wolheim  you know that's my name  was was is is traveling in German interests and should be and so uh we had the first transport under those conditions ready in January.
After that  once the police knew where the Jewish people lived  it was picking them up  sending them to transit camps.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 9 I came to the restaurant  and the police was -- its ow -- its owl -- the police -- it was -- they wouldnt -- they were dress not in uni forms  they were just dressed like people dress on the street  they were detectives.
So anyway I don't remember what I took with me or how  but I remember I had to go back to the police station in Utrecht.
A Jewish police was established  my husbands brother volunteered for it because you first thought you woul d save Jews  later he was involved in a ll kinds  I assume of horrible things  although he didnt witness them.
That they going to do some damages and theyre going to do some killing.
Q. And the Jewish police who are guarding the Ghetto  would let people come and go?
And it happened that even Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14  1997 104children went to the police and told to the police that something for own own parents or something.
The one who was killing Jews and I was  really a nightmare to think about.
That they we re called to the police and I got a telegram from our frie nds that they called them to th e police and they never let them out and ﬁYou disappear.
So--and all of a sudden I see and there was a group to the left and they were sur- rounded by Lithuanian police and they were there  so in a corner  I saw one for whom I had worked after the commander  I worked for somebody else in that same outfit.
But and thats what you had just had to have  from the local German police permit  to board a train to Vienna .
He's a very quiet -- he was very quiet  meek man  and apparently got a special medal for killing Germans  which is impossible to imagine.
And of course what had happened was that during the night  a police car or ambulance had been in the area.
He didn't break anything  but my parents were even afraid to go to the police and report it  report it to anyone because it would only have meant problems for us.
Had you thought about killing yourself before your friend showed you the razor  and why at that point were you considering it?
Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing were nominal Christians.
Maybe on the floor  but Do you remember much about the day in which the Hungarian police liquidated the the ghetto?
After -- as we approached the prison we could see there were similar processions coming from ot her side streets  always escorted by Latvian police  and were admitted int -- into the prison yard.
The only thing bot hers me why we were obliged every day to go to the police office and say that we are here.
And so what you see in movies sometimes  or in theaters  or read in books  death became ugly  even though you had nothing to do with the killing; but under the condition we lived in  the-the Theresienstadt city was a city which had about 4 000 inhabitants  not counting the mi litary.
One in particular told us  my mother wanted to buy some milk  buy  because she had money at the time  and the woman shut the door in our faces and said she didn't have any  and we continued walking and then she in turn went to the police station and told on us  that there was a mother and a child  probably Jewish.
The British police and the British army...of course  they immediately surrounded...closed the roads.
So they told us right away in -- Italian police in Ljubljana  they say hey  you guys  you got it made.
And later on  in experience  every town was a different way of killing.
He was closing a nd when somebody of the police and there was a very veteran Zionist man over the age of se venty.
And I thought to myself  ﬁIf th is had been last year  they would have been killing me  and now theyre taking care of my cold.ﬂ I never told them about the Jewishness or anything.
They knocked at every door  every Jewish door  the Judenrat  the Jewish police  had to show them which is a Jewish home.
I: And the services your father conducted in your room.. did the police ever try to interfere with that?
You know  Hungar y was kind of a strange part of that Nazi area because the Hungarians  the Hungarian government ha s always been in the hands of the aristocracy  Hungarian aristocr acy  and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murderin g Jews.
We couldn't tell them that if the police come down and arrest one of them  that you go down to the police station and bail them out and use a good argument  but these were people who learned on the job -- although coming with I had a two and a half month course at the University of Maryland and everything from cooking to social work  to 13 warehousing -- I remember one of the questions that they gave in the test was  \ If you are in and you get a cable that in four days there will be landing in thirty-seven tons of such  such  such procure warehousing and setup procedures for distribution.
What other functions did the Jewish Council and the Jewish police serve?
There was the SS surrounding us and the...the big police dogs were with them all the time and all the guns.
If you caught on the street from...let's say from 6:00 on  you would be imprison and beaten up by the police.
And the lady  the peasant lady who had taken me in  obviously thought there was something strange about me and she alerted the police that I had come .
The Communis t Police was and the border guards we re really closing everything very tightly.
He says  \ Get back to your headquarters and tell them that the Germans called off the killing.\
He said  well  if you are stuck for anything for something to do  I am taking up my post as inspector general of the Palestine police  and I therell always be a job for you.
I was standing on the road and it didn't take long before the police came along and tried to chase me away.
One of those numbers is a police department number from the federal police.
So here they were killing people  and here they sent her a postcard  which maybe she would have lived for the hope that he survived.
The education in the information age is to beware of the abrogation of civil liberties  of the use of computers in the police system -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 95 Mm-hm. --
And in the morning  they the police came to Interview with Fred Firnbacher September 16  2010 15arrest my father  to put him under protective custody  and three days later he was in Dachau .
In other words  I think this Awerbuch home accepted chil dren whether they were orphans or not  because it was felt that in this orphanage they had some kind of a refuge from what was happening on the streets of Berlin to Jews who were being beaten and trampled on and kicked upon  and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there.
The police chief  the Latvian police chief himself  who was in a good position to know that my mother was the biological child of her parents  because he had lived next door to them  again decided not to lift a finger against us.
At that time it was only police  44 there was not yet concentration camps  that we kn ew.
All of this happened with the help of the official Hungarian police force and gendarmerie.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 >> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: And there was a lot of police.
And we  we asking same thing -- we sended papers to the Romanian  to the police department there--that we want to leave Romania for a passport.
I wanted six people to support me  because you never know whats behind it  and what members when they go -- be by -- by myself  because y -- they never suspect you  youre short  nobody thinks youre with the police.
She said  'But I know they are shooting over their heads because they are just trying to make us believe that they are killing them but they are just scaring us.
And I started telling them  \ There's not going to be any killing.
I was in the main police headquarters  I had already been caned for fleeing the scene earlier.
I went back to that police  and at that time I was getting  every month  some sort of ration from the Jewish committee.
I could I I the change that took place on his face  his whole attitude  he he totally panicked  because this he had told me before that  take good care of this typewriter  that this germ you know  the German police is looking military police is looking for that type.
Was there any personal conflict with the concept of using a gun and killing someone?
Said...the police chief said  \ What are you making eyes at me?\
And then when they found us  they arrested us and took us to the police station.
Our people were shielded from the German economy  that is  German police  the German criminal justice system did not apply to them.
So they let us go  the reason why is because there were a lot of influential Jews in th -- with the police together.
And then  later on  I was in the Warsaw fire brigade  and the Germans respected the Polish firemen  because they needed it  during the allied bombing of Warsaw  the Polish firemen were very important  and the Polish blu blue police  some of them were [indecipherable]   some of them were members of the underground.
Luckily the police took pity on the little girl and she...he said to the mother  I'm not sure 27 she is  but I'll let her stay in your place.
I see  so the -- the -- the soldiers who came to arrest your father  the policeman who came to tell him to go to the s -- No  I didnt -- I -- I didnt say police come.
Here comes the police agai n  to get him to the doctor.
And duri ng that period of time  many people were called to the police stations and never returned.
He couldn't call the police or anything like this  because the Nazis were in power.
Was there a change in the police chief  a change in the mayor I dont I I there must have been.
He say  I know theyre all killing  I know [indecipherable] .
I just  just that  this society is so violent and you see it  you see these 12 year old killi ng each other and killing others.
They surrounded them with barbed wire  and had Jewish police with helpers staying there 30 at the gate  where you going in and going out from the ghetto  stayi ng there and helping the Germans who getting already there -- you sa y to German soldier and just stay the Jewish with young men  and all day long stand by the gate to help each other how to not to run in any troubles.
And those camps were not in the system of the German camps  you know  the barracks were well organized German style  were simply improvised  the same way like the -- 71 you know  the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in the pogrom  which I already told you  was a very artisanal killing.
Such expressions as killing and death had become commonplace concepts for him and he used them with great naturalness  bitter experience hardened him.
It was a semi military organization that they have people who are suppo sed to be prisoner of war apply to go to the police directed from the   occupati on .
Shoo – to shoot with a gun was an easy killing Š which I saw quite a few of ‚em.
I knew her sisters boyf riend was a bigshot in the -- in the Jewish police there  and he will get her out.
In this case  not -- my father was a owner of this home  so in some way again  this police -- because the -- the police shoo the duties  yes?
Two police officers  one knew me  because I had made a name as a swimmer  come to the door.
SB: And the Jewish police  what did you think of them.
And how many times I was beated up from the police.
They took him to the station  and the chief of th e police said to him \ I don't know hi m. I never met him.
>> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: So there was no way of calling anybody  like the police or 911.
It was forbidden so we were always chased by the state police.
In all this time  I mean it sounds that its it it was almost an not necessarily an ending  but a constant stream of insecurity for your parents  of registering with the police  not knowing whether or not their their residents permit would be Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 88 extended.
Anyone that was a Jew...doctors  professors  and uh professional people  business people  you know...anyone that was a Jew was in prison at that time  and I was in prison about eight  eight weeks that time and thanks to Pela's intervention  they released me because Pela made...she met thr ough some one and told this policeman that one of the policemen from the station gave her a name of a police officer who was of German descent  so called deutcsh (p h) that she could  you know  somehow get me out.
you did mention someth ing about the son of the German police chief.
Three or four would come in  usually these were Allied flyer type cases or atrocities of killing of hostages in different towns.
This night we got orders to surround the ghetto with the German police and to take you away.ﬂ And I didn't know to kill on the spot  but to take you way.
But he was released and the police -- for their pains  the local militia almost got executed by the Soviet general.
And then transports came  they locked these gates so that you shouldn't see wants going on  or shouldn't tell those people where they are being taken because if two  three hundred people come and they find out and they started to fight  you couldn't do the killing job properly and  well.
I said  \ Now  if we made a deal  tell me why did you tell the police to shoot me.ﬂ So he said  \ Yesterday  you went for milk.ﬂ I said  \ Yes.ﬂ \ And you had an argument with this woman.ﬂ I said  \ Yes.ﬂ \ And you threatened a woman  said 'You are a communist and when the Russians will come in  you will be the first one to shoot her.
Obviously  everything changed with the advent of Hitler and I have memories that there were the emergency police running around the city in their car -- in their automobiles because they were always demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.
When I came home  I was arrested  I told you that before  I was arrested  a Jewish police let me out.
There are documents which prove that they knew exactly when a German unit would say  arrest 100 Jews in Paris  who was the leader of the group  how many men he had under his command  where did he stop on his way to -- to Auschwitz  or there were killing grounds even in -- in Minsk.
So when I find out  here the Ak is killing us and Fascick is my friend and he's the commandant  the best thing would be to go to him to see if he wouldn't take me in with my group.
And by that time I had confirmed my first f eeling that I experienced while I was looking at the killing.
I was the only Jew  I was the youngest  I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then  and lets see  the men would go out at night and raid police stations  and -- and ci -city halls  and -- and break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards  and -- and official German stamps  and -- and weapons.
For ex ample  the then chief of police  Evert  he -- I mean  in the German occupation  he personally issued or gave orders  and faked id -- identity cards were issued to Jews.
And a key hooker to that was dealing with the instrument  the legal police instrument of schut zhaft  or protective detention is the loose translation.
I came to the gate where there was no police on this side of that gate...ghetto gate.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 28 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: of June 6  1944  the French police  the German police were still searching where ever they could.
I'm going back to Algier s. That first night in the hotel we were having dinner and the desk clerk came in and said  there's a gentleman here who wants to speak with you  and I thought right away maybe the police are here because of the way we came in without visas.
In my old country  if you went to visit somebody for more than 48 hours  you had to report it to the police.
So what he actually did actually  he was asking the Gestapo that to release me from Buchenwald which I didnt know before that  that the criminal police had a case against me  so they need me there.
In those days we're talking about 1933  and he didn't talk about killing  but he talked about eliminating them from the economic  the scientific  the arts  wherever Jews were  they are to be eliminated from the German life.
The police sa id  \ I have to bring in a body.
Some were lucky enough and some of them were rejected by the police army or custom.
They were marching  and they were killing  and the -- they -- they -- they are burning now synagogues.
By Spring or Summer in 43  I was taken to the common law police  severely beaten  and when I came back to the office  nobody said much  but I found out that I had been denounced for having a radio.
So  he was one of the policemen whose father was the head of the police.
And I also remember this event  because I made a mistake of going to 9 These were the Jewish auxiliary police.
But there was police outside  and there were about 100 people there.
But they were not shot sort of randomly like you saw in the film Schindler's List  that was not  they were always shipped for orderly killing.
What [indecipherable] they prob ably didnt know -- you know  those local police  whatever.
And when I came to the police station  the police station was opened but the policemen had joined the chaotic crowd that was leaving.
But here I want to come to a point where its highly unusual that  in my mind  thinking that somebody who so the head o -- head of the ghetto police would be able to keep his wife and daughter outside the ghetto.
It means the navy blue granna -- the navy blue police  because they had navy blue uniforms  but this was the police from before the war  and they didnt behave so hundred percent like the Polish people desired.
Simply was killed in the ghetto itsel f. All the shooting and all the killing was done inside the ghetto.
The Polish police recognized that she is Jewish and the mother writes a letter to Kashia...what did you do to me?
I -- I like good movies  and I dont like those sex and killing  and thats not mine kind.
So they did not know what it was for  they figure it was for pain killing and they brought a cassette for injections  I mean syringes and morphine ampules and said how much did you get  he said  not enough even for one person  to kill one person.
Now  Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9  2001 63he made the study -- he made the study about -- about killing of -- so there is a town  Jedwabne  a small town near Warsaw.
I  yeah  in that  so the years went by from '35 to '38 and by 1938  I must have been about in 10th grade and in October  1938  the German police arre sted all Jews who had Polish passports  overnight  without any prior warning  in fact  they came in the early morning hours.
Then when he was here  the police took him and give him over to the SA.
And went into the restaurant  which had– and they called the  the restaurant owners called the police and the local police came and arrested them off the bus.
Only along the wall that we see the Port Brama-entrance with Polish and German police.
But also  he didn't know that my mother told me this  when we were  you know  it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said  just remember  if God forbid we should get separated you see  never thinking that whats going to happen  that its going to be this mass killing  but just separated.
Today of course  I'm not very proud of this  because now I know that the more language s you speak  you know  the more lives you have  but those days  this was a political statement  they couldn't believe it  they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my s ubjects and so there was tremendous animosity toward me from the police  from the Party secretary and all the others.
And the Germans dress my mother and my father as German soldiers and put them on the train to evacuate that  because they started killing all the [indecipherable] over there already  and especially the bourgeois  you know.
There was battalion police battalion   there was terrible [indecipherable] can figure out what it was.
Did you find out about the Nazis killing so many Jews in concentration camps and death camps?
Th-They were so -- so content with that -- wi-with the run of the mill  that that was not -- not enough  I would say  diligence on their part  for which I am very happy  although they were still brutal in killing.
And furthermore  the final solution had not yet started  because there certain ly wasnt -- th-the systematic large scale killing of Jews only started with the attack on Russia.
They were -- they used underarm holsters for the secret police.
We know that from the criminal police that my daughter and niece researched about 10 years ago  15 years ago   that she took an overdose of pills.
Of course it was not unusual in those days  whenever you were in a foreign country you were always subject to police checks  and you always had to register with the police wherever you were.
She a dress shop and she disappeared  so after a to the police  I say well  I'm looking for another job.
He had some connection  the her boss had some connection w ith the police.
On -- on what charges was he taken  or when was he taken -- It was -- people were lined up  the -- a police order comes on a bullhorn that everybody between 25 and 45  lets say  line up.
On the way to the police station my father asked what would he have done if he hadn't been home.
For a week  they walked around the ghetto and they was killing people on sight.
And they said  \ German policeman -- police received yesterday a note  a telephone  that today will leave ghetto some two rich Jews.
And not because theyre killing each other [indecipherable] for centuries [indecipherable] the tribal wars.
So we didnt know  is this a new method of killing us?
We didn't know much what was going on but he knew somebody told him maybe from the police or something that they're going to arrest all the German men.
So before I went to the police department  I saw a neighbor of ours on the other side who had a furniture business.
Again  the rumors were they are not letting us know what what this is all about and the next morning the Jewish police...they were kind of Jewish police is really...that's what they were called but they more like like couriers and and and uh people who help keep order...anyway a Jewish policeman came to our house and returned mine and my brother's paper and they had a stamp put from the German Gestapo.
But wed had these Jewish -- non-Danish Jews  but together with quite a lot of refugees  came also Danish police people.
When she got back  she went to the...Polish police at that time  and she told them the story.
And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a police station  he told me that the Germans had just left Buchenwald  a concentration camp that was based in Germany in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life.
The camps that your cousin we re in were more like detention camps than [indecipherable] what we think of -- They were concentration camps  but they were not -- they were not killing camps of any kind.
And then we had to go to another person  a -- a Nazi at a -- at a table where the name  like Ursula Pawel was twice now -- Jewish community the -- the SS  and then the secret police  a third one  were given a sign  which were put on around our neck  which I dont recall whether it had a number  that I cant recall  but it had my name on it.
I was next to them because the home of the former Chief of Police  whom I had helped search  and the Jewish school were very close to each other so after having helped the one partisan in his job  I was already free to go  and went naturally to the Jewish school.

The communists created their own laws  the secret police had free hand and  of course  I began to become very disappointed in that.
And uh so then the time came for some people to leave to be released  and uh uh  as we know it was the unoccupied zone of France  and uh but the Germans did have some control because Germans did come there with the French  the Vichy police  or Vichy government officials  uh and uh  made sure that uh certain people are kept in there  but by that I mean probably German communists w ho were so-called enemies of the German state.

I every six months we had to report to the police.

Warren Marcus: For example  his family got sent to Treblinka  one of the killing centers.

It was an area probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police.
No  its not -- that had nothing to do with the Russians killing the soldiers.
Carola  when did you find out after you had come to Auschwitz that there were gas chambers and they were killing people?
And the German border police came and send us back again.
And one of the thing that must be said about the stupidity is  and for the first time  the SS and the Gestapo brought torture  not as an isolated incident  as the Ovra had used  or the police had used [indecipherable] any time  any place  anywhere  that is a systematic system of interrogation.
There were Germans controlling the gate on the one side  the second side  the Jewish police were controlling  and Germans were lazy and so they didn't search people.
But as I said  Dad was let out of the local police lockup  before those people were sent from there to a nearby concentration camp.
And I would ca ll the police and they would USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 88say I have to -- they cannot do anything unle ss they are there.
But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came.

Very efficient way of killing people without bullets  without gas  without anything.
I dont think it was ever used  and aside from the police force there was a Sonder force  that meant special police with special orders  with more difficult tasks which larger  with larger food allotmen ts  and some of these men were decent  and some were brutal.
But if you dont investigate who it was that was doing the killing  or the process in some way -- Yeah. --
And even the police -- by the way  they didn't have a policeman like here.
And one of those policemen was telling us there was jewish people involved in that police station.
I didnt have the keys to the house to get in  so I ran to Benzburg   which the police didnt let me in  the Jewish militia.
I was shaking  11 Ivan Bagrianov 12 Kosta Muraviev 19 shaking more  more violently than the man himself who knew that he will be shot almost the same day  and I think he was  by the partisans  summarily without any–. But you couldn't blame them knowing what the local police had done against partisans  bombing entire houses with the people in them when they would get word that the partisans were hiding and this again  we eyewitnesses to that.
After World War II  during the World War II  the personal police in the states he didn't belong to any party.
And night time is a big fire  and they're killing people there.
And then a lot of them run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police.
The lucky thing was that th e pol -- women police was disbanded in a week from that occurrence  so we didnt have to do anything.
And all the police  the jails  the library  all the federal institutions and city institutions were in this one building.
And then at one of these places I had a small house I had hired  or my friend  as a matter of fact  in -- small house in the gas station  you know  slow -- very near the -- the headquarters of 59 the police  and -- and then the -- I didnt know a thing  I came in from -- Id been in the woods  I think had the little weekend  which I had in the middle of the week.
And the reason why I hang out the flag  because in Poland  if I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 150 didnt hang out the flag  the police came  gave me a fine.
This sort of mankind making this giant killing machine  you -- i -- i -- i -- course  you said it before  its unbelievable  but -- I be honest  I mean from the beginning we didnt know it  actually  what had happened.
We came back to this prison    it was no t a prison  was a school and the street s to the school were closed  were closed by police  you couldn 't get in  but we sa id we want to get in  we have orders  so they let us in  we came by a taxi and as we came there  they were loading Jews on buses.
So anyway I had to go to Police station and get...uh  they interviewed me because he them I am the manager of the kitchen.
But I wasn't sure where I was  and I -- in my little broken English  I spoke to the police officer.
What scared us perhaps was the th-the police  cause they were so unmoving and so they had their now  how can I describe them best?
We we didnt conceive that they something like that  that they would do  start killing the people all  you know  without any discrimination  nothing.
This was during the Korean War  but this was a police action rather than a war so some of the provisions for citizenship didn't apply and I had to be in the United States for two years  for five years so in March of '53 I was discharged from the army and became a citizen.
And then when I when we got to Berlin we had to say  we are now in Berlin  we come from Gouda   etcetera  records  you know  transfer every and everything with stamps and so we had to go to the city police in Berlin and s-state that we were there for one week  we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were goi ng after one week we would go y ou know  continue on to Lisbon  we were in transit.
My...my legs and my arm in chains  and it took eight guards du mobile...guard du mobile is the French police and gendarmes...to guard me  after they chased me down  after I was already down to nothing from lack of food and lack of sleep and and and I had no more tears left to cry.
And in this case it was a police woman  with a gun and the truck wouldnt stop  when she was directing it so she proceeded to shoot and the  in some Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 23 obscure way the bullet when right through a whole row of people sitting on these seats and there was a pharmac y in our building.
I started with the killing of six million Jews and end with the killing and maiming of more than 50 million people   men  women  and children.
And I was on parole for two months  which meant that I had to report to a police station every other day.
So  we had to police ea ch others  nobody should disappear.
AR: He was scared just put it on everyplace because we were scared of the ghetto police.
Report ed to the police  got it stamped and then added the three.
They sent him back to be the chief of the police  and he was a very fine  gentle gentleman th at we had no problem  or picking on the Jewish people or anything like that.
On the other hand  th-the German secur ity police was a rather special organization.
But one day the police came and closed the university down because the government didn't like this social upheaval.
The Gestapo  police  SS -- according to the diary of the minister of [Indiscernible]  the propaganda  he said  well  let's not have unrest right now.
And I don't know who really knew what was on the other side of the border  but I never knew that they were really killing the people there like they did  and uh it was every time uh as the the years went by  as the months went by  it was tighter and tighter.
And we didnt know why  but three of them escaped from the ship in the Rio de Janeiro   and they were caught on the beach by the Brazilian police  and they were brought back.

Now the two basic ways in which remains can be identified are fingerprints  which of course don't exist when only bones remain  and dental x-rays  but in order to use dental x-rays to identify remains  you not only have to have x-rays taken from the skull of the remains but you have to have x-rays 1Menachem Russek  an Israeli police superintende nt charged by the Israeli government with the task of tracking war criminals.
And I ha -- I didnt need for that a -- a document of -- of the police  that I can come -- come through.
So then  he told us  he said  ﬁGet all together in one place  that it should look like a big rock.ﬂ He himself  I shall never forget  got down on the ground  and lay down and he said  ﬁThey are coming.ﬂ It means the German police -- I dont k now who it was.
And nothing was wrong with the documents  but they insisted I go with them to the police station.
And they'll never can reach there  because here was already flying the Germans airplanes dropping them over the walking people and killing people in the street.
This was a -- a crime that  you know  deserved killing by the German soldiers.
However many refugees turned up and lived because they had rented a house next to the police station.
If thats the case that nobody knew from the Germans that you had any connection whatsoever to the head of the ghetto police  how was it that you had permission to go in and out of the ghetto?
And they supposed to be en kinda cute  s-so one of the musicians followed them home  a nd broke in in their rooms  and they sscream  and people call the police.
So they were open prey to all kinds of enemies: our local enemies  the partisans which they couldn't protect themselves from  and against the Germans and the police when they would attack and they would normally  you know what I mean  pick their spots as of their probably spies them where they were located and that's what it would be.
And we were surrounded for quite a big perimeter all the way around and afterwards our fight was not so much killing Germans as it was to work our way through a retreat  where we could go to a retreat in smaller groups through the bigger forest.
Well  you know I will tell you later another story where the si killing of the Jews.
Well  a man came came to the door  to the house door  and told my parents we had to come to the police  all three of us.
No  only as as I said uh only thing is was when that police commissi oner called us in.
I -- I went to the police headquarters  and I told -- told them I want to le galize my name. [
What are ideologies of political systems and economic systems and how do they  how do you make them work  and the fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently  there was based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of  of  of racial theories  the  the  the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how  how horrible it is and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so efficiently run.
Was screaming  this man the SS man was screaming  of course; and they were killing him with knives.
You got to go to a special what he is -- is killing.
My father tried to hide  but the police came and said  look  it's a small town.
And thats how and nobody nobody told the police  or the or the whatever they had  NKVD  or whatever they had in those days  that I was alive  that [indecipherable] his mother must have hated him  or whatever there wa s  you know  they were scared for their own lives  so thats why they helped this man.
Okay  you were going to tell me another way that you used to try to keep your sister from killing herself.
But I saw it in connection with the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador or the killing of the Jesuits.
Yes  great big bags of sugar and whenever the police came to look around and so forth  I was  it was my duty to be in bed.
He's in the secret police and we came to France on a so-called business assignment and my father has been spying on the French for several years and I go to school in the French school which is why I also speak French fluently and my French school mates don't know that I'm spying on them.
Can you imagine that they took the all Jews and the Polish chief of the police with the family and they killed them too.
My knees were killing me because I wasn't used to it.
The 50 they allowed the Vichy French police allowed 50 Excuse me  excus e me 50 [break] I survive.
They didnt have an opening there  but they di d have an opening for a scribe in the Jewish police  the militia  and as they booked the scribe s  it was a totally benevolent non-malignant type of an institution  because there was no reason for it.
49 Were they hated in th e ghetto  the Jewish police?
But it was every morning  almost every morning  the chief of police  Rozenblat or something  would brin g eggs.
In exchange  my uncle the police officer who was shot  his little boy was also given out to somebody.
But I was there about two days  all of a sudden  that -- the police came up and took the bedsheets home [indecipherable].
The Germans went back into the trains  and the ghetto police explained to us mostly in Polish  and hardly anybody spoke Polish that we had to walk 43 into the ghetto.
Somehow we made each -- h-he made us understand that he w -- that hes hiding from the -- from the police  and the -- as they ca me through we made like he was one of us so he wouldnt be bothered  yeah  so I remember that  yeah.
The unfortunate th ing was that the 30 000 strong gendarme in Hungary -- >> Bill Benson: That's the Hungarian police force.
Are you -- you had mentioned the -- the O.D.  the -- those were the Jewish police.
Becoming interested in areas such as the auxiliary police  and Poland  and the Trawniki trained guards that might not have come across my radar screen as serious inte rests had I not been at OSI.
And they took us actually to a police station and we were interrogated there separately.
But we left it at such that people were had -- had to take their radios to -- Police. --
Theres some murders  but theres no -- the Einsatzgruppen come with the attack on Russia in 1941  and the -- the killing centers start in 41 and 42  and the major killings are f -- 1942.
We lived in the barracks that the police inspector -- oh yeah  they also didnt need all the poli ce inspectors any more because it was only 24 people  right?
So  what did you do in Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 18 We have our old Jewish police  that pick up young man  and say you are going to be in in the ghetto  you will make ordn ung here.
They were making huge raids  uh  I got to go back in uh  July  1943  there were 2 000 men involved  Germans  -------  gendarmes  Polish Police  and regular army soldiers .
The precinct police wore green uniforms and those silly helmets  but they were separate.
And the Hungarian police were on the trains and took off people  many people  just by looking at them  just by not liking their face  their voice.
There was police  and there was German police and Polish police and you could not even streetcars and everything got stuck at a certain point because you could not get through because of the flame and because of the shooting and because of what was going on.
They could come in and announce that they would respect all the passes because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the ghetto government  like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the police; maybe they were working for the hospital; they would be all exempt.
And in the meanwhile  they were killing you  because th our bodies couldnt take the food.
If the police called  the guy would say ﬁYes  they are here  these people ﬂ but you had a weakness--they had an accomplice.
And one time I came home and I saw the Dutch police all over the place  watching -- in our house.
Well  I didn't know that you hold it to the light that you can see the J  so I came there and I and when the police came.
I went to the police station long before there was a line.
We kept on hearing -- you go upstairs  you'll find out they had what they called Einzatsgruppen  killing squads.
The Communist Police was and the border guards were really closing everything very tightly.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 8 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: intact  I believe  we had an inkling that the ghetto police is not going to be touched.
My official name was then Kutrzeba  which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupatio n. When the time came to register at the Polish DP camp  I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites  I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I. s that I met were just great and friendly people  and I felt that I should revert back to my original na me.
when -- when they -- so did you hear rumors that the Germans were killing -- I dont remember.
Yes  they were just Belgium police or Be lgium hoodlums  not necessarily in any kind of official capacity.
Yes  I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956  November  I started to walk toward the border with a cousin of mine who just graduated from high school and was always in political trouble with the police for his outspoken attitude  so  he followed  he came with me  and we then crossed the border after  I think about six  seven days or so.
I...I arrived five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the window from the fifth floor and you asked me how I  how could I prevent them from taking th em away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene.
It was...in the police station was where the police slept  and there was the jail.
And by  I think August  the the Ukraine police found out  and they were just two or three police  and they came into the forest and start shooting i ndiscriminately.
I -- you -- you know that theyre killing Jews in Auschwitz.
And when the Swiss police got you in Geneva and took you someplace  were you f -- was that a frightening situation  or they were not mean to you?
In case you don't know what kosher means  that means -- it's a ritual killing.
To the police  to the burgomasters  to the officials in the civil registry  I think the Jewish council that is being blamed in all over the place  had very little to do with whatever there was.
I think when they were killing the people  they thought they doing some kind of a heraic heroic work.
So Father had to go to the police  and was there.
They started killing each other there in Sobibor because they start fighting.
What kind of confrontations do you reme mber having  either when the Germans had occupied  or the police along the way?
And so I worked  a nd I must always...every week I must give a report to the Gendarmerie state police station th at I am here where I was.
And before she had finished the sentence  the police was there and told us that we are arrested.
Well  I think that sometimes the police [indecipherable] almost like entertain me.
They came maybe...uh...20  30 or 40 person...  nu  ...police  to catch us  to kill us.
But he couldn't have gone to the police when he would have been blackmailed?
And then  after the Germans come  he become the commandant of that police station there.
And I dont mean to say all of them  because a lot of po lice... we did have a neighbor  across from our apartment  who was from the police.
Oh  and that place  it was under -- the police [indecipherable] was standing under the -- it was a so called gerdarmes?
In spite of all this  in spite of these rumors  I decided to do it b ecause it became obvious to me that I will sooner or later be scooped up by the Jewish police and handed over to the Germans and sent away  and I didn't want that to happen because I knew what happened to scooped up Jews.
I was never in the 9th Fort until--until March 1944  when they arrested me with the Jewish Police.
Immediately the Gestapo came to the Juden and they gave  and at that time the president of Juden was Goldstein  and he gave an order to line up uh the Jewish orderlings   means the Jewish police  and every ten was singled out to step out and he was hanged  but he needed the rope to hang them  so he said first that the Juden  the president should decide which ones will step out.
I said ﬁno  nice ﬂ and I show him a sign that they are not killing us  you know  just shower and disinfect so we are nice and clean.
And she said Bergen -Belsen  thats wh ere they were killing them.

Cause if you got very loose stomach  which was a killing thing  three days you are done if you had enough bread and charred it and ate it  it would stop it.

And when they taking the Volksdeutsche and putting against the wall and killing them  the Polacks.
It was a house in a corner and  and this particular corner they assembled  the Romanian police assembled Jews  Jewish people whom they collected from several houses.
I said  \ Young lady \  I said  \ If you need me I have to take it over all packages\  because the police would arrest her.
And its -- Lieutenant Calley is clearly a reflection of how difficult it is for a nation to police itself while its in the heat of the fray.
And about three weeks later  the police called my mother in Berlin and asked  do you know where your husband is?
When Jean and I came back from– yeah  then the indictments went to the Supreme Court  when there was an issue about  after the confession  when there was an indictment  there was a legal issue about whether these indictments stated a claim under federa l law  because they also involved private conspirators along with some police officers.
I dont know  after that  whe-when they were killing  apparently they felt like big heroes  you know.
And I -- and -- and now  a couple of months ago they started to do the police.
And I used to come back to the hotel in which I lived under police protection  and one of the very nice Swedish boys at the desk asked me  ﬁWhy?ﬂ Because apparently the only other women who came back to the hotel under police protection where the prostitutes.
It was before on the -- he was different but killing anyway.
So there was a Jewish police  there was a Jewish this everything not everything  of course  but within certain so my sister was working for that Jewish organization  call it the Jewish government.
We were arrested by the police at th e border  trying to cross  and were put in prison.
See  it's not my combat experience where I question Army orders or anything  I feel proud to 30 slaughter (Yiddish) 31 They are killing Jews in Wolfratshausen (Yiddish) 30 have been a combat soldier.
Yes  yes  the the police blew policemen that were protecting people from getting off the streetcar  or getting on the st reetcar  because streetcar didnt stop in that segment  you know  it was going from the Towarowa Street  which was the lets say two blocks to Wronia   and then about four blocks to elazna .
It was killing of Jews on the east -- eastern part of the world was called pogrom when the Russians killed the Jews  Ukrainians killed the Jews.
And of course I understand the the Ordnungsdienst   or the yi Jewish police  they wanted to stay alive  so I mean  this whole idea was that everybody who was in this situation had to wanted to survive  and the will to survive makes you do things that I dont know what I Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 156would do if it was I who had to decide  wh o had to fight for my life  and f and make a prolong it for one or two or thr ee days.
Oh  that's like a child what -- who don't police  the cops.
I ask her where are the police is ov er here  and they told me the police  you have to go over here two miles is the po lice  or three miles.
I sa id uh the police made a mistake and he said well  the German police is not known for easily making mi stakes  and my reaction was to tell  well the police is not the same police you are knowing from the old days.
But he was caught by one of the German policemen  not SS  German police that policed us.
You know  the regulations that were put in place by the German occupation started with something fairly simple  and that was something that may seem simple  the banning of killing animals for kosher meat  and the ritual slaughter of ani mals  if you will.
Uh the the change not in the feeling of security but the change in the family life came in - it must have been mid or the fall perhaps of 1944 when my dad uh joined the uh Danish uh Brigade as it was called  the the uh the Danish military police force that was built up in Sweden towards the end of the 2nd World War.
So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of that of the provincial police forces  who were involved.
02:20:53 The idea  the German idea was to involve the Je ws in the process of extermination and they succeeded  and the Jewish police were participating because they were the one who were 34 rounding up the people to send them to the death camps.
Were the Germans in the ghetto  or were only the people -- the Jewish police in the ghetto?
I think it was 1942  and one day they told her that there are some informers te lling the police that she is Jewish and that my brot her is a Jew  and they told them if they did not go away in a few hour s  they will be taken to the police.
As we were walking toward the railroad station  the police stopped my father and they took him in.
Just as a word  I came across in my notes  reference to the chief of police  allegations with regard to him and the black market came to me and I let it go.

And did your father have difficulties in when he had to go through bureaucra bureaucracy  pay for it  go through the German police and so on  but wer did they know what they were giving up  or they didnt care?

So Bertle called the police in a Norwich   had them come around to the Harrisons and tell them they had to take me to London the next day to leave.
But this is military police  you know  they directed already  you know it– brought ‚em in.

As a matter of fact  my former teacher (Bronson  who was in the police)  he was one of those.
And then he went back to and he did go over  but he went back to Marseilles  and from then on  in his police record  it said in Marseilles that he crossed the border illegally.
All we were wondering where the police or where are the Polish partisans we already knew were in that area.
It was early in the morning  about ten o'clock  and he had a list of names and calling them out alphabetically  and then putting them in groups  taking them behind the  the  the gate and there surrounded  they were surrounded right away by police  by Ukrainian police who were collaborators with the Germans and the Germans and they were taken away.
They surrounded...inside maybe 6...6 police looking  looking  \ Where is Olga Katzinova?
So the Germans and the police did not ensue in a fight for more than about an hour in all  put together.
I fell asleep  needless to say  and by later on by morning -- that was the wooded area  so we didn't worry about because we knew it was clear because it was clear as far as Germans were concerned  the police.
We have a old police car which was smoking and making a lot of noise and some old motorcycles.
We had to report to the police station with our number to make sure that we didn't escape.
When the war broke out in 39  my father came home Saturday they used to he came home from the killing house  he used to kill the the Saturday night  in the evening [indecipherable] he came home a Saturday evening  and he says  we in the war.
And the fact I remember when I came to the States and found out that most everybody every man is circumcised  and that you didn't have to have an identification card  and you didn't have to report to the police  that was the first time I remember relaxing.
Because you [indecipherable] Yes  as long as he was trying to get away from the police  that -- we probably thought that it was a good thing for us to -- to help him.
The questions would be asked on the following day in the evening when  after having witnessed and/or heard the killing and pointed at Viel through the testimony of at least two of us  we decided getting back to Leitmeritz  to the high school for girls where we were stationed with the preliminary station of the officers school  when we decided to send a delegation to the commanding officer  and not demanding  asking for an explanation.
She was holding hands because scared and she said Mom  Daddy  are they killing people here?
And then there Interview with Danguole Gabis December 10  2015 38 was the chief of police.
And when the police would come  he could hear horses coming  he would run to the middle of the street and point them out.
I started with a brother and a brother-in-law to the main police office to get this ticket.
I went to the police commander and I demanded that the water be returned.
Gene ral Lucius Clay came into the camp and I started to look and he liked the job th at I did  and there was a chief of police  which he didn't want to be anymore the chief of the poli ce.
I didnt mention yet that there was a -- the gendarmes was -- were watching outside  and inside was a ghetto police  established by the Council of Elders and they looked like -- under the cap and the -- and the yellow armband identifying them as a police.
We never knew whether the shots is killing inmates or the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Uh the following day we uh heard  uh my mother had a phone call from my dad that he was going back to Denmark with the police force because they had been ready.
And then we would have a look out for the police.
But the police surrounded them  you know  they want to talk.
And you know this small houses  so he keeps us in the house for two hours or three hours till they took away everybody for killing.
And there were a lot of acts of violence and we tried to follow up on it and to report it to the police.
Went up and they were killing all the Jews  beating on them and killing.
We discovered later that the Gestapo and the Ukrainian police -- [Technical conversation] 04:17:38 We were talking about you heard the German boots.
My grandfat her was sent on to Mauthausen  one of the killing camps and of course was killed on arrival.
And he said that when they entered this room in this this office room  Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 69 my father was standing with a pistol at his head  pretending that hes now killing himself.
These were Jewish people who were  kind of a ghetto police  came to our place  and they had a lis t  and I was on that list  and they were going to take me to a labor camp in Germany.

Well  unfortunately  uh  uh the  the smell was the was most was  was the burning of those bodies and uh  and then it was the people that which had dysentery and it was an awful way to uh  it certainly was  I had to smell  and uh  we had um  we  we watched an  a lot of those people die  and  and they would be  and this happened many were beaten to death just for that alone because  because they could not keep their uh their bowels and  and they had no way of uh of going to  to  to a bathroom  and uh and then they that's the musi c that was playing which was a mockery  uh  in a  in a place where they were killing daily  they had this band of music consisting of uh prisoners that were forced to play music as they marched to work and from work  and bringing back uh bodies uh killed while working because uh  uh  uh they  they were beaten to death.
Let's say after four months he went and established himself there and got to know the police.
I mean  this idea of killing going to heaven when you kill an enemy?
See [i ndecipherable] Im a realist  I will die having my positive belief that the recognition -- that we all have the same -- we all share in the same red blood  will put an end to the killing because it [i ndecipherable] recognize since is our blood as well as yours  shedding it is not just sinful  it makes absolutely no sense  solves no problems.
And then decided they were going to take us to the next town where there was a police station  to arraign us.
the second da -- after that second say when you saw the killing -- 131 Yeah. --
I see it stay in my mind what the Germans or th e police would --.
And...uh...since...since my brother was...he was a very handsome fello w and quite a personality I would say...uh... He had no difficulty with the German borde r police and there were some SR SS men there.
A. It was the native police  what do they ca ll them?

So I went back to the accountant for a second time and told him the me ssage of my father and he became then at first just unfriendly  but wh en I kept persisting  he pointed to the telephone and said if I don't leave him alone   you know  he has one phone call to make to the police and then I can explain to them that he owes me money.
And shortly thereafter  I was transferred to the corps of military police of the Jewish Brigade. (
His name was Hermannn  and I would like you to remember that name  Hermannn  and I worked there in the offices before I started to travel  but I had filed an application to be able to travel and for that purpose I needed to be relieved of having to report to police stations every other day.
And they were not only fighting with the Polish police  they were fighting between the partisans  too.
>> George Pick: I don't know if I can make a very good analogy  like the sheriff versus t he police  but much worse.
And my father was accompanied by policemen  regular police  German police.
At the police station they took me in their t op floor of the police station where you have the  it's like a prison  you know  with the bars.
But the police were pretty active in there to try to find things.
What I found out is that th e British had broken the older police code of the Germans as early as 1939.
But just before we boarded the train  and the police comes and Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 218 asks for our papers.
And he and the office of the local police or militia  as they were called.
Once in awhile you heard  you know  there was a killing.
I could...three crates alright and then the next morning I had to hide it because if the...they used to come back every day  the secret police  and they wanted this   so Pnina had a very good friend of her husband  the town engineer of Kovno  a Lithuanian who were very nice fellow  so his wife was very good uh in best relations with Pnina  so she...Pnina tells her excuse me  I have here Hebrew writings and the the...might be...the Germans might come   so could you hide it for me for a few days  uh so she said no  no problem and she took it.
And we came there and we found the police station was full of people and he came  it was after midnight  he says  ﬁOh  I've got one more of them ﬂ and that's when the person asked me  ﬁWhere...ﬂ-the policeman-- ﬁWhere do they live?ﬂ He says ﬁThat's why I caught them.
Lu ckily  Jewish police who were standing would not allow them to go.
And in my section -- this killing happened in my section on the second day.
Uh  I knew what the first --------------  that the  the Polish ----------police  I know what the ----------- was but I have forgotten it.
Were the Jewish police in the ghetto good or were they not good?
Yeah  and by radio all the time And by radio  oh that killing  killing  killing and killing.
I was about four or five times there on the police  asking questions  a who ho-how many relatives I have in America  where I have relatives  what I am doing  what I my corresponding is  with whom I am corresponding and so on.
So when does 25 that become really clear to you  that there was something called a Holocaust  and th-the Nazis were exterminating people  killing people?
We were both sent but we were sent as members to th is commissions  from the secret police.
But it was a biggest school  police school in Mosty Wielkie   they have huge buildings for this that school  and thats what the Mosty Wielkie   if you say that if you been policeman  then you knew where is the Mosty Wielkie .
Most of the non-Jews were coming from jails  from police stations and then transferred into system of . [
31 They were killing them over there too  and where were we going.
And Ive -- Ive -- Ive been asked to lecture about five times now in the fo rmer Soviet Union  and this last trip  which was the first week of May  I -- I didnt feel this so much this time  but the other trips  I certainly felt -- actually  I was very apprehensive before this trip  I was very apprehensive before this trip  but then once I left  i-it was -- it was okay  but the other trips  I dont know  more funny things happened  and yo u see police people with machine guns.
In the meantime in the police  I met a a girl from Black Forest and she was married and her husband born in the United States.
L: They had fig trees So the French police left and L: Remember they had fig trees?
As a matter of fact  we had one Jewish refugee that we took with us  and he served as a KP  a kitchen police.
I did go back and cuz they wouldn't let us uh close to the fence  of the small ghetto  so I was uh standing th--th--that was the--the--the Jewish--the ghetto police who kept us about 10 meters away from the fence and what I saw crowds of people walking up the hill and the first--the first hundred meters or so  the road they were walking was very close to the fence of the large ghetto and they were walking right by and then it turned away from it.
Well  at -- what happened when they took us there  the -- on a train to Salzburg  and when we went through the station  th rough the train station  the police  you know  we were all transport by police to -- one were in front  on the side  on -- they had the -- the -- the -- the army guns [indecipherable] we were heavy  were -- I dont know  murderers or th -- something  you know.
I I we you know  we di we we didnt know about the camps a you know  l-looking at it from wh at we n-now know at that time  you couldnt even imagine th-these killing camps existed  or So you didnt know  but you also didnt think the worst things No  I didnt no  I didnt think the worst.
So when they started to liquidate before they started liquidate all our furnitures  and everything  so my wifes mother went to the police.
Its genocide on a -- not on a such massive scale as the hol -- a-as the Holocaust  but its still -- the -- the reason for the killing is not what you did  its who you are.
He was not just making statements  he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was  I just  I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anym ore  not after what happened  just   you know  in the last few years and my boy scout commander  and at that time I was still ki nd of hanging on w ith the boy scout movement  my boy scout commande r was now a member of the ne w Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor ca mp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the orga nizers.
Just go to the police station  what is the fifth house after this street or something.
We also had in New York  copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports  which were on microfilm at the ti me  and I reviewed those and gathered the material that were relevant to Latvian auxiliary police killings of Je ws and others in Latvia in the summer of 1941  and I put it together in a basic historical essay that I would write as a college paper at that time.
And didn't notice in the big excitement that slowly wh ispering  \ Hungarian police officer.\
She had  having been kicked out of the prison  she had rushed over -- well  she had previously  she had ru-rushed over to the German police  managed to see some -- somebodys -- some official  I dont know how high ranking he was  if he was not the top man  and said look whats happened  my -- my sons are half Jews  theyre not supposed to be arrested  and they have been t-taken and can you get them out.
Take this to the police and we had a car to take and we called  and we use to write all the people in the ghetto  their names and all kinds of things like that.
He said to them  if we of the Jewish agency were to issue an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the DP camps of Germany should march out of those camps  march across borders to ports in southern Italy  would you follow such a command  knowing that you would be ordered by the American military to return to your camps  that you would be shot at by perhaps by Italian border police  that it might cost you your lives?
She gives guided tours here  either to the American police or -- am I right?
I figured if I get to the main railroad station  I'd be a dead duck because there's police and Gestapo and all this.
We can provide you clot hing  but we cannot have contact with the with the Italian police or with the Italian government... Did you...no  no...I'm going to have cut you.
So this -- and this is sometimes left -- sometimes when I think about people here having so mu -- so mu -- rifles  and they causing here death  I still sometimes think a -- but if Jews had rifles during -- in 1939  many more Germans would have paid with their life  or Ukrainians for -- for killing 39 them.
>> Margit Meissner: Well  a few weeks before France fell  the French police decided to evacua te non -wanted foreigners from the Paris region because they were afraid of spies.
And must be more -- di -- I think supposed to be either from Jewish na -- from ghetto th rough the Judenrat through the na -- Polish German police  and aft -- after there  you receive the -- the paper cross the street.
If somebody  let's say from the family member  said to somebody  and the somebody was re porting to police  they came  we are gone.
He tried Hungarian  I could have answered of course  German  English  but I just smiled so he took me into the police station and I scribbled down the phone number of the Swedish embassy.
What -- what -- Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 13 They took us to where police station and put us in the -- in the toilets for the whole night.
So my sister went to the police and had the police come to the Harrisons'.
Middle Age torture  which I had read about  it i -- was history  and now they came into open with the Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized  or reorganized Norwegian police.
That was a word which may be strange to you  gendarmerie  well in the town  there were police  in the rural areas they called them gendarmerie and they had different uniforms and different customs and that's what they were called and again  it was tradition in Europe  all the way maybe  entire 01:40: central and eastern Europe and even western Europe and even in France there were rural police and there were in-town police and they were different.
Did you hear rumors about what the Nazi s were doing  that they were killing people?
She got a notice that she should come to the police station in two days with whatever she could carry on her back  in a knapsack   two blankets and three days' worth of food  and she was going to be deported.
The ghetto police there had a different mission than all the ghetto police in all of Europe.
Uh there were a number of miserable things...some uh executions and killing and beating and hunger and misery.
So we stayed in the big city and the rumors were that we found out later that was true that the Poles were killing the Jews after the liberation just like the Germans were killing them during th e war  the pogroms.
The felt free--the uh--they felt so free to do what they--what they want to do because that's was the first of the post of the uh General Ye--Yeager  from the S.S. that he stops in Lithuania for the killing the Jews was easy because due the collaboration of the local people.
It was no idea of killing them immediately  they wanted the Jews to work  and because they couldnt send all these people now to one spot.
He was commandants -- chief of police daughter  so everybody knew.
So so Interview with Danguole Gabis December 10  2015 128 Saugumo policija   security police  well  I did not know that was the German position.
He said there were many  said they were running  they had nothing  they said th-they even printed a stamp that th-th-the police at the border Interview with Thea Rips January 20  2004 40stamped a -- cards  you know  identity cards.
The ghetto police had to go with them in al l actions.
Nu  in this time the...the police and the German SS come and this way after the truck and come and begin to shot after me to kill me.
But in the -- she was interrogated by the Gestapo or by the Lithuanian police  I dont know.
I slept in that house -- in that bo arding house for one night  and the next morning I heard 9 on the radio all aliens have to report to the police.
And a funny thing happened at night  somebody knock on the door  there was American military police.
Well  their elite force was to killing the Jews in these here special groups  which they were doing in Byelorussia and Ukraine and killing them on the spot.
And they let know to the police Polish police  which was 6 working very close with Gestapo  and th-the Germans came  killed almost everybody immediately.
They got the city police to show where the other people lived.
This is much smaller and whats happening here  when you open the television  they start the killing.
But it didnt take too long  and the Hungarian police came to the ghetto and they came to pressure and question the people where did they hide things.
Okay  my brother  my brother and sister  when the Gestapo and the French police came to pick us up  we actually  my uncle actually made a deal with the Gestapos.
At that ti...at the railroad station was a lot of police.
And I had to go to the very same police that had wanted to arrest me and -- and shoot me a f -- a few years earlier.
I didnt believe that they were killing the peopl e. But later on  very soon  I knew they were right.
Uh the the only thing we could do was again that the Jewish uh community went into action and established interestingly enough call it cooperation of the police and the Gestapo and some relief uh uh and work at the uh railway stati on where these transports came through and I participated also in that work uh uh because especially bene...came to help the younger people  the contact between the youth movement members wa s still there irrespectiv e of their ideological 11 orientation  Zionists  non-Zionists.
So they brought some kind of punishment  a company of Ukrainian all kinds of real butchers and they started killing people on the street.
We decided if that's going if he already told us this  it's not going to take very long  or he himself can call the police Right. --
The next bus is at 11 oclock  you will be on it  back to your home  and then you will report to the police  which is what we agree [indecipherable] here.ﬂ And he did like this -- your problem.
I remember because I was living in a hotel with another Viennese who was also Jewish and we were called to the police and held there the whole day.
If somebody breaks the law and doing something wrong--like  uh  stealing or even sometimes killing somebody.
If not there are revolutions and killing each other and one will figure out how to make a gas chamber  to gas the other.
She said that killing an animal  as the kosher slaughter was  takes too much time for the animal to be dead; therefore  we were doing an inhumane thing to the animal.
And so we asked the Brazilian police to find the Dr. Gama also because that might be a person who would have these dental x-rays because you have to take x-rays to do a root canal.
So guys in there--friends of mine--said  \ Hey  join the police force.\
So actually  before I got the letter  and it was a certain stamp  a letter stamp on the envelope  so actually they  under the secret police  maybe in Prague already  or in Liberec   they actually read all the letters what I received.
My wife says  \ God  you're killing yourself  you're killing yourself  schleppi ng there all the time \  you know  flyi ng back and forth.
We slept in a building where -- si -- there was -- the building was  I think  six or seven story  I dont remembe r  but up to the third floor  there was Gestapo po -- railroad police  above the regular apartments.
And if you are not calling off the killing within 5 minutes  I as a Swedish diplomat tell you  you will be the first one hanging before your office as soon as the Russians reach us here in midtown.\
It is complete extermination and killing  and so there is for the first time a confirmation even from Poland that this extermination is happening there.
So even though he was being deported  he has to go to the police station and tell them?
Because they did send out the police and the Commandant and ev erything  they send them to Siberia.
So we were -- we were free  but then  couple days later we got a summons to go to the police and we as -- were to turn in our passes.
So  we are caught now with a population only one difference was  I'm an experienced person in people would have no idea what killing means or destruction means.
I was afraid of Germans  I was afraid of Ukrainian police  and I was afraid of the youngst -- young people that might spot me and really take me to Germans  so -- because we were not allowed to walk after dark.
She started to cry  and there was Ukrainian police  and she told him that her sister is working in the apartment for Gestapo and and was his name  and he should notify me  who can talk that I can do something for her.
They were hanging...after a a week  they removed them  and you know  they couldn't find the commandant  uh a Jew to be a commandant of the police.
One was to throw ourselves at the mercy of the immigration officer the next morni ng and say sorry  but that would mean that uh he had to obey his rules and regulations and had eventually had to send him back and if he would have been...if they would send him back that wa s the end of him because they would take him back into a concentration camp immediately  a nd there was the other group  and I was one of them  who said well  the only thing is effectivel y is to say it was a mistake made by the German police  and they entered the the date that they made up...that they changed the...the the date they put in was was wrong  but we had to tell the boy that this was it  and made him our ally  so uh he realized that and we said listen  you are not born in this year.
I mean I -- I just recently  when I woke up earlier in the morning than I-I should have probably  I thought of that incident with that civilian police guy who stopped me on the subway a nd where I ask myself the question  what if my assessment was wrong and my lingering arou nd there would have caused him -- he could have  any time while I was at that newspaper ki osk  pretending to look at newspapers  he could have tapped on my shoulder and said  ﬁWhy don't you come along  I want to ask you some more questions.ﬂ And then  that would have been the end of me.
02:15:37 So then Neil Scher asked me if I could take this a little further  given that I was a dentist and I was down there and and go a little bit further with this Dr. Gama to see whether he might remember something  or maybe looking at his charts we could discover some evidence  so I went back and with the agreement and cooperation of the Brazilian federal police  uh I went to see Dr. Gama  who in fact was uh very cooperative  and he told me that uh he didn't think that he had anything to do with Mengele because for one thing he didn't do any root canals  but that he referred his root canal patients to another specialist whose name was totally different  but in any event he went to see his specialist friend and he retrieved from him all of the charts of patients that he had referred to him in 1978 and 1979 for root canals  and he brought me the charts to look at and there were thirty-five  forty of these  so I went through those uh very quickly to se...and it was obvious that none of these uh remotely resembled anything that could have been Mengele.
The Germans could always go inside to the police  but the restriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go inside the ghetto.
So  indeed  we then tried to follow them but our trip was very eventful because we always tried to avoid the police that were searching the trail .
And we spent the whole night looking for Germans  individual Germans that we could catch and disarm  without killing them  because for every German  there were 20 to a hundred Poles  innocent civilians  shot on the same place.
TP: Oh  this they--they killed all the top officers--the top officers: the captains  the lieuten- ants  you know in a police force.
Your uncle when he returned from Dachau  you said earlier that he didnt speak much about what had happened in Siauliai in the time that he was the ghetto police chief -- Right. --
But deep down I heard that the German...the biggest mistake  we were talking in the army  that they're killing prisoners  Russian prisoners  in that time already that the Russians knew that the Germans are killing thousands of Russians and you have to fight not for...we're not fighting against Russia.
This  this police  I mean this solider was apologi zing to this  to this officer.
So  in 1968 when I came here  it took me a lot of work  because I couldnt get the visa to America before I get the permission  a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit.
And we were able to remain in France only by police authority and permits  which had to be renewed every 30 days.
On the 10th of May  1943  a Gestapo man was sitting in the office of the Jewish police station and registering a family that came before us.
Was at one time asked for my papers  which then were still my real papers  not phony papers -- by the police and after that they left me alone.
we were under the supervision of the The police  yeah  yeah.
There were 3 000 German officers and men who were engaged for at least a period of two years in doing nothing else but killing Jews and others who were perceived to be enemies of the Reich.
So I was afraid to start making a commotion because there were Jewish police  there were German Police  there were Polish police.
They also had the criminal police    this was German police.

They asked me to find evidence about this case  and I wasnt quite sure what they wanted me to do either  so I did -- what I did know how to do was go to then -- go to the published records  the Nuremberg trial records  and put together  I think it was about a 10 or a 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian auxiliary police in -- in -- under German occupation in 1941.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044 26 We didnt  because we didnt  but my husband went and en listed with this police force there  the displaced camp police force.

And anyway  the father still had close contacts to high police officials and had learned  therefore  of this action against  for the arrest of Jewish men and in those days  also  everybody was paranoiac  partly with justification  that the Gestapo was listening on telephone calls  so therefore  the son who my father actual ly knew the son better than the father  who had  I think  done legal cases together with him  and the son did not say anything over the phone  just told my father to see him in his office on an important matter.
Id never want counselling for nothing Ive done  and Ive been with the police  Ive been helping undertakers  but Ive never wanted counselling  and Ive scraped them off the floor [DL] And this was in your civilian role after the war? [

We'll say that there was a mistake of the German police  and  and  and uh that they had made a mistake  a nd ---------  but that means that the boy had to be convinced that he really was one year younger.
While I was in line a friend of mine who was a Jewish policeman said  and I want you to know that in our police force which consisted out of 200 people  they were very very fine  intelligent men  not like in some other ghettos  and he says to me  Look  I dont know  I dont know  but he says to me  he doesnt know exactly what is happening  but  try to pull always back  dont try to go ahead.
That hes young  hes energetic  hes good looking and the German would like him  and he speak s good German and they have a business in K. He looked at her  she was a good looki ng woman and one day the police came and they took out this Pashik and they saw that he --.

One of them is a police court  and one is a -- another kind of court  a civil court  and both of them are judgments ordering the name change of my parents and myself from the last name of Weber  which was our name  to Lakritz.
And  so my we were together  and my we were hiding in three different places  one was I dont want RG-50.030*0584 25to talk so much one was on a roof and it was diagonally from a police station  and it was in the city where we used to live  so people knew us.
So  anyway  the 124 thing was that having that paper  I'm sure sa ved my life  because I was then frequently controlled  particularly by military police.
When I arrived in there in the morning  the whole orphanage was gone  although I tried to join them and I was chased away by police that said  \ You're not Jewish  get lost.\
There was some talk that this resettlement for work  which was taken out -----------------into other areas to do...hard labor  but nobody really knew up to that point that there was going to be killing people.
In any country you have to have a police  so its better to have the police -- Polish police than German police  yes.
you know) There was a hatred of those people who were instrumental in killing us  whether it was Hermann Goering or Ribbentrop of whoever it was.
Not only were the storm troopers there  but there were two policemen there from my police station  which was right on the corner  just around the corner from where my house was.
And the Kempeitai 4--which was the Japanese 4 Actually  these were the Japanese secret police.
But he said  ﬁThats not that kind police force ﬂ he said  ﬁWe just watch warehouses.
SB: And um when you got arrested with the other police  they took the  they took your shoe laces and glasses.
So what about is it possible then  that if you had to proofread  and layout  could did were there articles that were anti-Semitic in Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 193 Not not not nei neither in   nor   and and I believe same for all all other regional newspapers after the a year after th -the the killing of the Jews  you could really try to find with the various you need a strong light to find anti-Semitic article in any of those papers.
So but like I mentioned before  we knew that after years and many times the police were watching us specially.
I walked over to one man and he was religious  religious Jews were they called it  and I recognized that he's Jewish and all of a sudden I look at the rest of the people and all of a sudden I knew they were Jewish  because the guy who was the head  a little guy next to him  he asked me in German   so I told me slowly   means a killing place in German.
But from what I understand  this was the only camp that was discovered by the Germans  and that had the name of Katyn  but then afterwards  in 1990  when Perestroika started  Gorbachev brought the letters showing that there were the camps of Starobilsk  which was in Ukraine  and Ostashkov   which was little bit north of Smolensk  where more of a police Polish police  the pre-war Polish police was there  there were about 6 000 people.
So that was a situation where perhaps th e Germans were going to surrender or leave and they just emptied out the camps by killing people?
So my sister took my mother along with her  to stay with her in Chust; and she was going to hide there  because there my  my brother-in-law was a  a dentist and he also had  you know  was friendly with the police.
And he told me that my fr iend should get such a document and should go -- should tell the police that she has lost it  that her hus -- her bag with the document fell into the water -- in the [indecipherable].
I mean you could see the groups of Jews who were under  mostly under the escort of the police going to work and of course they were trying to get food and they were getting food  potatoes and bread and all that.
As soon as he got in  I saw them  either the police or the Gestapo and they grabbed him.
This means that if he say intact  not killing everybody  this means that he must have known the alternative to leaving intact.
Not beesh -- not -- nothing special  aso nots -- nothing special  but that -- very soon  after they got power  there was -- the first order 28 came  that all Jews had to bring to the police  th eir radio and typewriters.
And I was there overnight  and the next day a group came  and the police  and started to interrogate us.
But he said nobody told me and uh so he took him to the police station.
How many of them participated in killing the Jews and what kind of monuments do you have to memorize the Jews?
The police was assigning to each wagon  you know  a person in charge  and I say my father was the most e ducated person in that place and he was a really respectable-looking man  but they took the Italian worker who was drunk and uneducated and put him in charge because  he said it openly  ﬁI'm not going to put any Jew in charge of a wagon.ﬂ So that was the thing.
But  you know  the system was such that the police always knew who was living where.
And here I'm put to a dilemma  some officers be that they served in the police  be that they worked in the KGB with me  taking it for a total shock as if to say how dare you do a thing like that?
Whoever couldn't walk that fast  they got rid of him by killing.
And we got to the village  and there was a detachment of military police.
But these are the people that the governments  like United States  Soviet u or ru former Soviet Union  anyone who has power should go to these people and say  enough killing.
I was  you know  assigned  working with the -- with the -- we call that the internal police -- with the Russian internal police.
And the deeper they were  the more  the main police used to go with them.
Every di-di-di - at five oclock  I think  my mo ther was taking our di-di -- undress us and killing those lices  and put -- lice  and put the dress up.
Yes  a wa -- so k  the radio has been confiscated by the police  because we were supposed to listen to the -- to the BBC   and -- and -- which we did.
In fact  every Friday evening I walked to three buildings for the Germans  which was a police state.
The police station looked to us  and said you are free now but you don't have the right to move from city to the city.
I am standing on the steps of this train as the police are looking at me and asking me what happened to the money.
This was the police and they asked me immediately what is my name.
So a personal experience was helping a young partisan while he was holding the gun pointed at the local Chief of Police and I went through his pockets and searched him bodily  him and his wife and his young daughter.
For I guess for the German elite  whoever  the Gestapo  or 19 Saulk Dessler  head of the Vilnius ghettos Jewish police.
Because -- because there were the -- the customers who came in  there were a lot of secret police guys that came in to pick up holsters  there were -- and -- and -- and they saw me working  you know  and all that.
No  I didnt expect him to come back  because they called a meeting to all the wives of Polish citizens and my mother was sick in bed  I think this was sometime in ‚39  that was already after Crystal Night  and we were told to be at the police station  that there is gonna be a meeting and we have to be there  if we not gonna be there  then they were gonna arrest us.
For the other side  outer side  there was a German's and the Lithuanian's police.
Q. But all these  the committee and the police were all Jewish?
What kinds of police matters were being looked into in Wild-Wildeflecken?
So when I was screaming I opened up the door from the police  the other room.
A little note I am at the police station  get me out.
The real plan was to massacre us on for the 16th of January  there was a massacre in plan  500 SS  a couple of hundred Hungarian police.
So I uh I cleaned the police barracks the uh and I served as a messenger boy which proved to be of uh crucial importance when uh the uh when uh uh making these selections to again uh to pick out uh those unable to work whether it was children or elderly or or those that uh became ill and so on.
A. No  the husband Q. Did you see a lot of this   people killing themselves?
And they didnt know where to go  they didnt have an address or anything  so they saw one light  lit up  so they went into that building to find out about a hotel and the building was the criminal polizer  the poli ce  the German police  nothing but .
Because after the war  I found out that he became a police chief in a certain city which I can't recall it.
And I was the first one with the police who were -- also [indecipherable]  who was named with a badge by the police as a honorary chief of police of Falls Church  and which was very nice  and the city of Falls Church [indecipherable] 50 years  then we became independent from the county.
And then a decision was taken  it was a 26 very important decision  that no Jew could be arrested by German police.
I know from facts because of police when we captured them and they told us.
The ne xt day my father was arrested and taken to the police station.
Now  were these people guarded by Germans or were they guarded by  like  Polish police?
It tu rned out that this was another ploy: it was said that the walls would form checkpoints where the police could check passer-by's identification  but in reality it was announced that the neighborhood was closed  and that people who were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David had to go there.
An-And then I tri -- I tried to get -- the-they wanted a certain document  which sort of -- many -- in Germany when you moved  and thi -- it went for anybody  if you moved from one city or town to another one  you had to get permission by police.
All the other ones  there was a group altogether of about ten partisans and they heard the news that Germans and the police and Fritz  which I had mentioned his name before  who was the head of the Gestapo at this time.
And the next morning I hear footsteps coming up  and I peep through that thing to that crack and I see two gendarmes  not Milice  local gendarmes from the police  come up with Anny and I hear them ask her  \ Who has the key to that lock?\
But you didnt want to do anything that was -- I didnt want to do any killing.
Because 18 of them run away  and I know exactly how many because the police  when the Belorussian police have been the ones that killed them  and they been complaining that 18 didnt show off  you know  that somebody must tell them tell them  you know.
If youve seen pict ures of the ghetto gate  there is one police -- little booth where the policemen stood and saluted my father.
We didn't know that the Germa ns were killing so many people.
ha-have all talked about how after the war  the Germans were gone  but many of the Poles were still attacking and killing Jews  there were pogroms.
03:21:04 Because a democratic society has to have a system where  without killing  you make choices.
I went  to this family  and the moment that I came into this family's house  the police came.
As...uh...as we were in the ghetto...you know  the ghetto had own police department  fire department  had a Jewish community committee and...uh...they had an order for...the Germans also wanted the ghetto...ghetto to...to exist beca use the hierarchy for the Germans didn't want to go to the Russian front.
And why and how is this so why were the Belarusian police also terrible?
They went through Jewish houses  killing everybody--old  young  babies in the cribs.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 32 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: doing the killing  they were burning the houses and we saw house after house  bodies of Papa  Momma  and children burned and smoke.
There was  until the end of the war  there wa s not even one Jew in Greece who knew anything about the Holocaust or about the fact that th e Germans were killing Jews.
Now  let me ask you something  that circumstance of jumping the two guards and killing them  you have been in a situation of being brutalized now  for a couple of years.
Across kitty corner from that building there  there was Vacha   there was a very strong German point that the guardsmen were the Feldpolizei; that was the military police  you know Okay.
Where in some of the things that Ive writ -- Ive read  its written that some of the police came back rather well-to-do.
The Ninth Fort was established later on by Germans in collaborations with Lithuanians as a major killing spot for Jews.
During the experiences that you describe and well pick that up but you raised the point  other people killing Germans  can you recall your own experiences killing Germans?
After witnessing all that and becoming complete ly immune to any perception of morality  how come I knew when Viel was doing the killing  that it was wrong?
But on a short -term basis it was better because nobody was hunting Jews and killing them on the street.
I stayed in at night  I put a German police in front of the entrance  and I didnt let anybody come in without knowing who they are.
And that sa ved them the life because the priest succeeded to come to the place and stopped th e killing in the name of Christ.
He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NKVD  secret -- secret police farm.
Nice pictures  but wi -- an average looking man like me  I have a nose  I have eyes  and a mouth  ears  thats -- you cannot pick up a man -- I think you can talk to the police here  its impossible to pick up a average looking man from a picture.
But like this it was a killing machine  it was a everything was going automatically like like today the computers with push button  everything was going there.
We came back to Bucharest  we were supposed to go to our families when we came to Bucharest  but we were arrested immediately at the -- at the station in Bucharest  and taken to the police statio n sec -- security and stayed there for a week or 10 days.
And then at my home town I ha d a German Shepherd  from the bord er police.
They didnt know who the Polish army is still th ere or the police  they had no idea.
And somebody called the police  and my husband came in  and from th is time he was coming every day.
I understand he went to the police and he said -- I dont know the details   that he had stolen -- I guess what they -- what -- what the underground did -- is -- you know  farmers had to turn in their quotas whether it was wheat  eggs  butter.
So we ha -- and I were -- and they establish a staff  and I was picked up  in the staff I was picked out -- I was made that I am the head of the military police  because my background in Poland  so lo -- and I was very happy  and we worked and wer -- and then it was -- he tried to get the permission from the American government  and they refused him.
We had all been arrested by the police  a banker and a baker and a rabbi and a Rosenberg.
But on the way back I thought well if they look through our rooms and if the police had wanted to hide their guns  then they might have put some into our rooms and if these Italian soldiers find them then the friendship will be off.
I can still pick out certain words  but if there was something that was purported to be a police document for instance  depending on the letterhead  you could get a se -- an immediate sense of whether this was a genuine document or not   and be in a position to advise the attorney  look  we need to have a recess  we need to fax this back to the office  we need to get somebody 65 to look at it and translate it  to -- to take those steps  if necessary  to get the contents of the document available to the prosecution team.
Now my parents had learned already from the previous experience that certainly the police followed the registration lists when they went to pick up the Jews.
