Lithuanians helped but I wouldnt say that -- that it was done without  absolutely without Nazi encouraging.

Uh but Hungary put up very stiff resistance because the Hun...uh the Hungarian Nazi uh government was one of uh Hitler's firmest allies.
But 21 the next morning he said  ﬁI am not a favorite of the Nazi  they may search here  Im going to take you somewhere else.ﬂ He took the three men to a nunnery.
But basically  at the beginning  the British and the Americans were the only ones who were able to do anything and it was a British-American effort  basically aimed at trying to identify German influence which one could equate with Nazi influen ce at the time  and to try to get rid of that  not only at the 6 present time  but for  to prevent any recurren ce of it.
He started  \ Where did you stay  and what color wa s the drapes  and what color was here  and how far from there and how far from...\  I sa id  \ Listen  if I would put on a uniform on you  I saw you someplace as a Nazi.
And came three; two of th em Arrow Cross uniform  and then other one  a streetcar conductor with his streetcar uniform  and but with the Nazi armband.

So this is kind of looking at what I used from them  and I have part of this cover of the book with with big photographs and Nazi s-standard Na-Nazi kind of Flag.
First of all  the government became a pro -Nazi government from one day to the next.
And also  not myself  I -- I wanted to make sure one thing  Im not marrying to a big N azi family  in respect to my parents  not that she would have had any guilt in this  her father  if he would have been a Nazi  but that would be a very odd thing.

In fact  I remember distinctly they brought Nazi soldiers in  but boy it must have been the bottom of the heap because they looked -- looked more like kids  13 - 14 - 15 years old  a Nazi soldier and they made them help clean up and take care of the bodies and stuff like that.
And the book got a triple A  or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating  and so I had an early interest USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 3 in the Nazi regime  way back in 1933 and ‚34.

Because you see  more than 50 years may have passed since those years of Nazi occupation in Poland   but the events and the feelings stay with us and somehow I feel that this is my way of doing something  because then I was not able to do anything.

So this Nazi man said  \ Just for having said that  we must dissolve you because you are against everything which the Nazi government represents.ﬂ Then...so I heard this from my father  and then I know that in 1934  the Nazis sent a school inspector into our private school which they had asked the children to sing the national anthem which they couldn't.

So -- But he -- he had it -- he was more on the philosophic part of a ger  where he really f -- make us even more to dislike the Nazi philosophy.
Well  they they had they had the allies put out a an order at the end of the war  they they had first of all  they had an automatic arrest category  that meant if a German  a Nazi was more than something in the Nazi movement  it required that if you found him  that you arrest him.

I mean  how and when did Nazi rule begin to impact your everyday life?
Well  it was hidden somewhere in the house  and uh we were very lucky that when there was  the Nazi are in the house that they didn't find it; and they didn't find me either.
Did any of them have Nazi membership that they deni ed  or was this simply not covered?

I never -- never -- So they thought you were a German?
This was one of the first trials of of Nazi trials.
Unfortunately the beautiful German I.D. with the eagle  I -- was-was one of the things that I tore up after the wa r. I was afraid that the -- the Czechs might decide that I had a stronger connection with Nazi Germany than -- than was safe to have.

World War II began  of course  with Germany and Russia invading Poland until September 1939.
There were already signs of anti-semitism and then when Hitler came to power  as I said  in 1934 most of the men had joined the Nazi party.

My mother was so afraid at the time of the Nazi soldiers coming to the home  the SS coming to our home.
But the following morning my parents and their guests listened to the 4 radio and they heard that the port city of Rotterdam  the largest port in Europe  had been bombed and destroyed by Nazi invaders.

I think I made a mistake  it should not be calle d Nazi school  but German school.
The memory of your father being taken away  was that the earliest memory that you now know had to do with the Nazi occupation?
So you had  on one level  you were this perfect specimen  as you said  healthy  incredibly strong   perfect German   everything to be a perfect Nazi  on the other hand  you have this questioning spirit  so you didn't quite fit in.
Some of the children in the neighborhood joined the Hitlerjugend  the Hitler Youth.
And my mother asked me what had happened  I sa id there was a Nazi soldier and I was afraid he was going to arrest me  so I ran home.
Then  each apartment building was assigned a Nazi party  sort of representative for that building and the man who was the representative in our bu ilding  for example  made it a point  whenever we crossed paths  see  in the house entrance  in the elevator or wherever  to ostensibly sort of look in a very hostile way and ignoring us  not greeting us.
And then...so in my radio sermons  as I told you enlighten by the French government  I consoled the Polish people already occupied by Nazi Germany that Nazism really must collapse because it is not only anti-Jewish system  but anti-Christian and human system.

Had you heard any more about Hitler while you were in Paris?
We had to have one of the Nazi big shots supervise the whole thing.
But I cant remember that there was any talk about -- about race  and racial ideology or so -- th-that would play a big role  and I remember it in the later war years  we had then a specific Nazi teacher  who came with a brown uniform  and so we had a [indecipherable] start  you know.
But  the Nazi authorities recognized the importance of his work  they installed a laboratory in the prison where he was held and he had to work on his projects.
This Nazi officer came to the door and said -- I was alone.
And then that we had to line up in rows of 8 I believe and march in front of this Nazi who sat on his chair.
And by October  the Hungarian far right Nazi Party  the Arrow Cross  took over the government.
And then I left and then I -- I decided with the Nazi time  and I say it in these words  something wonderful had broken with the end of the war.
ﬁI was never a member of the Nazi Party.ﬂ Thats what he said.
So but lets stop with the lets go back a little bit to the time he was a guard of of Nazi criminals  is that what Yes.
Then -- this I very seldom used  because you see in the signature th-that is from the ge neral -- Nazi general Martinsen who was the most -- thats my handwriting  but on the we -- left side  you see its signed by Martinsen  he was one of the worst men we had in Norway.
And we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that generation of young scholars who were interested in the Nazi regime  and interested in the organizations of the Nazi regime  and also fascin ated with the personnel files of the individuals  fascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate -- what made these people tick  and how did they operate as individuals and as an organization.
And I remember we arrived at the bridge on the river  and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor.
My mother used to be close friends with her  but when the time came  during the Nazi regime  they they were afraid to ta even talk to us.
The Nazi supervisors were very aware of someth ing going on in camp  and due to the fact that there were speci al work details where they employed only Christian Poles who were political prisoners  they were afraid th at by leaving them on their own  that they would establish a contact with the underground activities  I mean  those who were with the underground  and theres going to be an uprising.
And how was the ba how was the takeover  the the battles against the Nazi forces progressing?
Nazi power in Germany and Austria took a more ominous turn in late 1938 with Kristallnacht or the Night of Broken Glass  and you were born just a few months later in March 1939  just before World Wa r II broke out.
There was never in in Mexico   despite some people who were try to make make it up  there was never a a real Nazi movement in Mexico   look like like Argentina   Bolivia   and other places.
02:28:35 I couldn't believe it  that something like this st ill existed under Nazi occupation.

But interestingly she was also born just about the same time that the infamous Berlin Olympics were held which Adolph Hitler turned into an instrument of Nazi propaganda.
Could you all of a sudden start speaking German  and -- Yeah  I was not -- As a matter of fact  I would find eventually  people who would say things like  ﬁYou know Walter  the only mistake that Hitler made  he didnt kill all of them.ﬂ Thats what you would hear.
Did you hear rumors about what the Nazi s were doing  that they were killing people?
But not only our family  but look  why they sit in Poland waiting on this Nazi to come?
Then in the years '37  '38  uh when Hitler felt that his power was growing and that also the uh German army got got stronger  uh and uh the the Nazi Party probably came to the conclusion that there should be more radical solutions as far as the Jews are concerned and they could then slowly feel that uh they tried to exclude Jews more effectively from all ways of life and and especially in '38 I remember uh department stores  retail business and so on were...went more and more into the hands of non-Jews.

ﬂ One day this German Nazi came with the stick and the Polish miners already drilled  put in dynamite.
Yes  I remember standing on the platform in in Berlin  on the Hauptbahnhof   and that and the the the Nazi offici al calling out the list of names.
Yeah  they used to come to school in their Dutch Nazi uniform.
Well  there there were Nazi submarines all across the Atlantic   and the navigators on those ships had to we ave their way across to try to avoi -void them.

And he was a German  but he also was a Polish guy  because he spoke German and Polish.
So then  now  before that we already had contact with the underground  and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the barracks of the national labor social - NSDRP  I dont know what the - thats the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement.
A nd  and he said to me  this was a Nazi teacher  \ What do you think about it?\
Im not sure exactly why that was so because at the times he was a Jew and it was getting difficult to do business in Germany  obviously  during the Nazi period in particular.
I mean  they would never have done that if they had been extreme Nazi people.
And I have to tell you  I almost fell off my chair  because nobody had ever said they were a Nazi  you know?
Interview with George Pick November 13  1997 26 Well  I have seen a lot of propaganda leaflets  and they have  all over the city they had these these big propaganda photographs and about the war effort and how the these people look in SS uniform  how did the Hungarian uniform look and how did this Hungarian Nazi uniform l ook.

The undeniable facts are the holocaust  the Nazi extermination and their collaborators.

So this other classmate of mine  her parents were hearing  and she was free from it  because her father was a member of the Nazi party.
Uh we stayed in that town uh we that we left the family and went and stayed with a woman whose husband had been a a Nazi  and so he was imprisoned and she was forced to take us.
The German Nazi type civilians  plus a whole bunch of Jews  too.
In -- i-in Nazi Germany  they in fact  destroyed all of the antique -- Nazi -- much more easily than they could in Italy  and I think it may have to do something -- but again  Im not a historian  Im a re -- an ordinary woman.
On November 9 and 10  1938  a violent anti -Jewish Pogrom  known as Kristallnacht or Night of the Broken Glass instigated by Nazi party officials and Nazi Storm Troopers took place .
On the other hand  my father alwa ys considered himself lucky that he was exempted because at each stage of the Nazi development of their antisemitic policies  the Jews always were under the illusion that this is the way  okay  the Nazis want to do business and that's  but we can live with it and that's the way it's going to remain.

When you say you saw the Swedish Red Cross  where were the Nazi guards?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 There was one German.
We started digging into the antecedents of Alfred Rosenberg  it was the ideologue of the Nazi party  whose villa in 1937 was not good enough for him.
So they were - it could be a little -- for us it was very important that it was a g -- not good relations between the Germans and the Nazi Norwegians.
Meanwhile  she spoke very well  German  less well French  and she read and she -- she -- she -- she was a -- an accepta -- I think an acceptable person  was -- very probably she didnt understand anything from the world  but -- and I dont -- I dont know  seeing her example  how we could imagine th-the n -- n-n-north and east  south and west  the Nazi regime  or German occupation alre -- already has been made  and Hungary will remain independent.
I had lived 12 years and six of tho -- 12 years in Nazi regime and six of those in war and every night you were taken to prison if you had a little light shining through.
And the thing we have to do with the specific style of Nazi politics -- its very difficult  especially for a European say  Americans are better  to understand this regime  which doesnt have any institutionalized governmental board  or some representation.
Well  my dear friend  where was the rest of the world  of the Nazi world  that wasnt tried?
In Auschwitz  I kept clean  very clean because we were able to shower as much as we knew that the same showers were giving gas to the people  but we were a little bit privileged because we worked in the kitchen  and the German people are very clea n  so they would order us to go every so often and shower in the showers  and we knew that we were going to be showered  so we were not scared  although you never knew what  what they had  kind of tricks they had up their sleeve  but we risked it.
For example  whenever I was asked for an ID  before I did anything like showing my ID  I would in this military demeanor click my heels  I had special heels fo r that with sort of iron or steel plates to provide the impressive military click that German soldiers had  I would stretch out my right arm  say a snappy Heil Hitl er  and then I would show my  and such silly little things would make just the right impr ession and would dispel any  in most cases at least  any suspicion that I could be anything but a convinced and truthful Nazi.
What happened to the Nazi guards  to the Nazi officers who ran thes e over a hundred concentration camps and death camps?
But were you feeling conflicted being in -- in what is a Nazi group?
She said  before the Nazi occupation  ﬁWhy don't you girls sometimes come a nd visit me?
I found out our government paid even some Nazi collaborators in Europe  right after the war.
We had been approached by different journalists  during that time he was Secretary General of the United Nations  and they asked us about files against Kurt Waldheim  but you kn ow he was not a big spot in the Nazi career  so in our field we had no information about K.W.  we sent the journalists to Wiesenthal  he had documentation  he is in Vienna  will know about his Nazi past which certainly would be in Vienna and Wiesenthal should know  then the people came back to us saying that Wiesenthal said he is a pure man he has nothing against him.
And -- but he wasnt a Nazi  but he took advantage of the Nuremberg laws.
And then I remember in -- in this state of arrest by the German  whether they were soldier  Gestapo  I dont know.
Nobody was a Nazi  they were just absolutely the finest  he was a doctor  they were just the finest  upstanding people that you could possibly imagine.
And so I always try to judge the person by what duties he perform or she p erform within the Nazi organization  because some of them really  they were just pushed in there and they had nothing to do with  other than being nominally party members. [
I did a little research on my own and found out that in schools nothing was -- at that time  not hing was being taught at all about the Nazi er They did -- they do now.
Uh sin ce we had our own Jewish values  I would say  it didn't affect us what the Nazi were were we re were teaching and preaching  uh but on the other hand we were no doubt concerned what will what will happen in political terms.
I remember one incident Nazi came and give the order to make a picture frame.
We were aware of the fact that we were with this German Lieutenant uh and this German sergeant who looked every inch the typical Nazi Army officer and under officer.
World War II began with the invasion of Poland by first Germany then Russia in September 1939.
We were in Germany a few ye-years ago  my husband was testifying against some Nazi people from the camp.
So my sister and I were really wanted which helped us during the Nazi time.
In the hospital I had a patient  a Nazi industrialer  he was a private patient -- End of Tape Four  Side A Beginning Tape Four  Side B -- but I found out  when you dont talk  people dont ask much.
Yes  they didnt didnt want me to say the word Nazi.
So  during this period of time  things are going on in Germany  the Nazi party was -- Yes  yes.
So here you have it  you know  the beginning of the rise of the Nazis really just a few h undred miles away actually almost pretty much -- almost the middle of the Nazi era.
I knew that the Nazi system was coming to an end and I resented the fa ct that I wasn't going to be there to see it.
It had been turned into the Nazi office building and downstairs  they had the collection agency.
And under that act  one of the small side provisions was that no one had been a member of the Nazi party in Germany could come to America.
And of course  with clean up and this was particularly  these things all might seem to be petty  but at that time  the nerves of all or most Jews at least  were so frayed already by years of oppression and innumerable Nazi anti-Jewish measures  th at it never took much for people to fly into a rage and to  that was really actually a ve ry tragic outcome of that  but that's what happened in many families  it happene d in ours.
I dont know who else had the authority  except f-for hi for Eichmann  once you are in in the headquarters of the Nazi government.
And she says no  you could never go there because thats all this Nazi cra cream goes to that restaurant  they would immediately recognize a s-stranger.
There was very little friction amongst the various groups of the population  and it wasn't until the Nazi Party started the activities when very violent demonstrations occurred  and the Communists on one side and the Nazis on the other side were shooting each other and killing each other during these demonstrations.
And it was terribly embarrassing for the Nazi hierarchy who gathered every da y in the Olympic stadium.
And he lived in one of these big villas  and was -- he had been a member of the Nazi party  with the golden bird.
BREAK police chiefs and let him see his brothe r in jail who was later on transported to Dachau and uh so knowing that my father had the Iron Cross and he had it too  my father always wore it in miniature uh form on his uh suit  particularly during the Nazi era  because he wanted to show that he was as good a citizen as anybody else  he did his duty for his country and so on and so.
First the Nazi took over  now the commie take it over.
Edna Friedberg: If I could just add  one of the other things you notice if you look at Nazi racial policy is how inconsistent it often is.
In one of his speeches he said this would be the test of Germany's morality and their readine ss to be rejoined with the family of nations what they did for the Nazi victims.
In the hospital I had a patient  a Nazi industrialer  he was a private patient because he came to Brandenborg  because in Berlin were so ma ny bombs.
Ive got your name from such and such person  would you be willing to give us a testimony agains against a former Nazi.
And that was  that was very good because I didn't live through all my  all my past life again  that was always very painful and I hate those people who was asking all the time about how was in the Nazi camp because I was living through again those emotions.
And then I was in had trouble with the Nazi party leader  because I took the position that for security purposes  we had to choo treat the local population well.
As a matter of fact  in that prison my only negative thoughts were about the Hlinka guards  because the only Nazi with whom I had something to do was Cunza who I already realized from his...what he said that he saving our lives.
