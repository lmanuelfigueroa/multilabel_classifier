And one night  as we were standing in line to be count-counted  that was the final count  and Kapo  which means head pr isoner  and we're going to be fair from now on  they were as a Kapo  came to our line  and he was picking prisoners for what they call a Zonder commando.
And the kapo says sure  and all on paper it looks enough  but by the time everybody stea ls  the prisoners dont get anything  or hardly anything.

Bulok was a local commander who had mostly Gentiles  or the other Russians  not so much of the Soviets  true Soviets  who remained in the area that didn't go into the prisoners of war.
So anyway  you think that getting into these boxcars only 50 of us would be a little more spacious  whereas compared to 88  but it wasn't  because the guards decided to divide  well they didn't decide it  but it worked out that that was the arrangement  the guards were in the middle  they had one-third of the car to the two guards and one third to 25 prisoners and the other third to 25 prisoners  so you can figure out the  and we were sitting again  all pulled up on our haunches and as it was getting dark at night  we started finally inching out our legs to see if the guards will react or if they're going to let us stretch out a little bit and they did let us stretch out and as soon as it was daylight  started yelling and  get back  get back and so we had to pull back and again crowd into each other's stomachs and against each other and just sit there and sit and sit and on late Saturday night  somewhere on Saturday  we arrived again 04:05 someplace and train stopped and next morning they opened the gates and now SS men  wild looking SS get into the boxcars  the Marine Soldaten are going away and these are young  vicious looking ones  with submachine guns on the shoulder  not rifles like the Marine Soldaten had  these are armed for close shooting and making a massacre of anything if there's any trouble and I knew what those kind of weapons were  that's all  maybe somebody else didn't  but I knew what they could do.
They liked me and they felt that they could use me for purposes because they did have a lot of German prisoners and I could help them in interpreting some of their cases.
That was in March of 1940  and they sent us back to the place  to Pole  because they figured for the Jewish prisoners of war still has some more privileges than a Jew in Poland and they wanted to get rid of the Jews.

>> Bill Benson: I wish we had a lot more time.
We were marched to the train station and we were called 'political prisoners' because we wanted to escape the Germans.
Were the other prisoners still in the barn at that time?
The black triangles  which the murderers wore  were given to the murderers and to the prisoners of crimes.
I don't know  I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before that time and that we saw some.
So these rational questions  you may ask them in retrospect  but not so much at the time  and you look left and 39 right  you see people being creative  I know some prisoners who were chewing bread and let the bread dry and made little chess figures because they were more eager in playing chess than anything else.
Did you see other prisoners  as you were marching  from other camps?
There were a couple of former Russian prisoners of war  Jewish.
From there the International Red Cross would send them to Amer ican prisoners of war in Germany.
It was  the normal soldiers had been partly from Russian prisoners who run away.

He admitted walking and USHMM Archives  RG-50.549.02*0007 53marching prisoners from and to slave labor.
Also prisoners of war  or Well  some were I dont know how they ended up there.
Everett Arnold and the Bruderhof in Germany  when they heard in 1928 about that there were...that none of the Hutterian brothers had done military service in the world war; that they had been persecuted economically and with hate and in the United States for not being anti-German in the first world war  many of them were taken prisoners and two of them were taken to Alcatraz and later on to Fort Levinsworth  and they died from exposure because of the treatment they got from the American milita ry.
Again we were marched back and forth and carrying stuff back and forth and beatings and and there were...they had some...at that time they had some non-Jewish prisoners.
At this point  we had....because of Dachau 3B  we knew that what the Germans were doing...that they were taking prisoners out the back gate.
And then we were separated and I went into block number one  the older  not old but some political prisoners were.
But there were two ways there was interrogating prisoners of war or civilians.
When they took off my gloves and coat  I assumed that they were going to I was a prisoner  I was their prisoner  I was going to go to a barracks someplace  and Id have shelter.
But we had...we had to wal k  we had to walk  and... Which was very difficult; because not only that many prisoners couldn't stand it any mo re and died on the road and were shot  but many SS men did the same  too.
And then a lot of men in the striped suits  they who were walking  you know  they were prisoners of the thing.
Once you sat  like the same thing uh in Auschwitz  except in Au sch----------going to in Auschwitz  it was a little more  uh even if you didn't have uh no food and no water  but at least there was some more room that we could move a little bit better  but here there was no way  and the worst was that if you tried to move  then a bickering among uh prisoners themselves because they were trying and were shoving and pushing and  and  and  and were hitting uh with  with the elbows among prisoners.
However  it really worked to our advantage very well  because we found ourselves behind the h-haystacks and then a Pole came -- a man came over and he spoke Polish very well and he ask who we were and we said we detached ourselves  we were prisoners.
And also they worked in a in a in a building where...where they were making numbers for for prisoners.
First  after unfortunate uprising in Warsaw th e first prisoners arrived from Wa rsaw directly to Flossenburg.
Well the same happens with uh  the prisoners who had responsible jobs.
And did any of the Jewish prisoners ask you to take messages back?
We had given them uh little containers where they  you know  uh field kits and uh what the physicians were fighting the prisoners was that they took very small portions at first uh and I remember one scene where a medical officer  a captain whom I had seen because at one time I also had to interrogate prisoners in the field hospital where they were being treated  and uh I had seen him before and met him there again at uh Buchenwald and I had seen him at his  in the field hospital and he was one of those spit-and polish officers  despite the fact that he was a physician  but he was running that field hospital.
So many women assigned to one bunk  just plain  bare bunks and another one of those prisoners ruling the barrack  and she was -- her title was the Blockova .
During the processing of the female prisoners  a woman grabbed Schillingers revolver  killed him and injured another SS officer.
They didn't lie that they were on the -- right next to Moscow  that they took millions and millions of Russian prisoners.
But the guards  if there were guards  which I cant think -- you know  they were really German SS.
And then I was sent to Intelligence Training Schools and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of war.
When I saw them  well  they were prisoners who hadnt been fed who worked for the German war machine and given  not even  minimal rations.
So they spread out and the overcrowded camp was decrowded and the prisoners  the Polish and the Russians were separated out right away from the camp and sent into a different camp in town  which used to be before  a civilian camp and so on and so forth and the ones who were in the hospital  got hospital food  which was to me  was better than the yellow pea soup and on one occasion  I was always roaming around looking or scrounging or something and I saw a cart on which was used to haul the containers  the food containers and it was  the people were pulling it to the hospital and it had on it the hospital food.
Frankly  it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow  and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the cellar into this common cells and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated.
When the eastern front approached  they would evacuate camps and push the prisoners in  killing most along the way.
There were cases where they would uh  the guards would take a large group of prisoners into the fields quite a distance from the camp at night during the cold weather and hose them down  after they were called upon to remove their clothing  and left there all night and the guards would return and most of them were gone or dead by morning.
The biggest number of prisoners stayed in Epirus  which is in northwest Greece and later made to free big communities  th e community of Ioannina  or Ar ta and Preveza  which community were in good condition until March 1944.
But the people in Mauthausen -- by the way  political prisoners.
As I'm trying to get a sense of how all of the prisoners related to each other  the  you mostly related to this one girl?
So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the German male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz.
And as I approached the camp  and there were the freight trains outside of the gate  and as I came to the camp headquarters there were a lot of prisoners.
That was very important to me  knowing that there had been a person who actually took care of him  having a chance to thank her for the care that she provided to him and to other Jewish prisoners who were there.
They gave us pants and a yellow star on the back and front and so prisoners a special  they can recognize them in this way and so on.
And you talk to prisoners of war -- we did -- we talked to a man like Mr. McCain  who was in prison with the Vietnamese  or you talk anybody who was in prison  and they survived.
We found a bakery and we got some people who were prisoners in the camp to do the baking.
We had about 12 or 14 women there who were supposed to do the cooking for the prisoners  and he made them lie on the floor  and he walked over them so he wouldn't get his boots dirty.
I understand that the dentist somehow got some testimony of various prisoners.
All of a sudden  we were enci rcled by Germans  by SS  and Jewish police  too  and they caught me.
And when we were brought to Auschwitz in July 1944  within three weeks there were a lot of Christian Poles who were brought from Warsaw to Auschwitz  and as a matter of fact  that was the first time when in there were a lot of Christian Poles in Birkenau  because up until that time they were mostly political prisoners  and they were placed  the men in particular  in Auschwitz.
Some people who really didn't care stepped forward  others were being singled out in this commotion by prisoners who were not Jewish  and in the midst of that confusion and shouting and and and fear accompanied by by shouts and beatings  eh  there was a  we heard the cannon fire  eh  eh  artillery cannon fire in in some place close by and all of us looked in the direction of the sound from which the sound came down the corridor the railroad track cut through the forest  and in the the distance we should  we could see a tank.
I am political prisoners  I can be not With them  right.
I thought  I fell a couple of times  but the dog  you cannot see as well  but the dog went after the other prisoners  and I don't know to th is date - I never found out the story - but only Mike and I made it.
And -- till one day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from Minsk.
R: A little over a year– I: There was also another artist that was on that same transpor t and he has drawn account after account of what happened that night and you can see in his black and white drawings the pitch black of night and the entrance into Auschwitz the spilling out of the prisoners from the cattle cars and its a very clear image of what they actually went through.
When we  uh  were liberated  but they didn't let  uh  all  uh  prisoners out.
And at the tail end we got out of Warsaw  there were 3 600 prisoners there.
Now whether that was true or not we didnt know but from everything we heard about the Russians then it most likely was but I met some Russians once inside the camp and I dont know what they were doing there and they obviously were (coughs) prisoners but they seemed to be able to wonder around where they liked  the same as a lot of the women Russians.
However  there also  since the factory where most of the German prisoners worked  and the other prisoners  I don't know which one of the prisoners they kept work in the ammunition factory  they smuggled in a lot of arms  the Germans.
So I decided  sick or not sick  I have to go next day to work...you see  because we used to march  and they guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners  and I'll find out what happened.
I mean  they -- they just di dnt care for him  especially Go ering  who was the one that filed charges against him  and brought him before the c ourt  the Nazi court  which is -- Walter Buch  who was another one of our prisoners that I didnt mention.
They were Russian prisoners who were captured by the Germans and placed in the camp  also in Brasov.
Well  we lived... You see  they had those w ooden houses that their prisoners lived.
Also  it will probably seem pathetic  because those two people who helped me the most  spent time in a concentration camp also  or else a prisoners of war camp and those two people  Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski  who was a camp commander -- police commander in Ashafenberg and also worked in a policer in Wildeflecken  was very sympathetic and very helpful.
SWB: Can you tell me about any interaction with individual prisoners that you might have had  did they smile?
Not long  three days perhaps  and then they formed from the prisoners there  groups and sent them to various places  some probably to Auschwitz which we didn't know.
Yeah  it was not prisoners  it was it was a torture.
And the window was open and we saw prisoners from camps  marching.
Did you understand that many of them who were there  many of the prisoners were Jewish people?
And anyway  there was  in addition to the number of liters  they always gave some extra for the chiefs in the barracks  so they would have more food than the peons or ordinary prisoners  but it was not enough for them  the extra what was being shipped to them  they used to  first of all  as soon as the containers arrived  the block chief went in with the ladle and got from the bottom of it  where the good stuff settled and gave one for myself  one for you  one for the clerk and one for the Kapo and one for this and take them inside.
A red triangle indicated that we were political prisoners  and these  these numbers and the triangles we later on had to sew on our jackets on the left hand side of the jacket  the triangle first  and underneath the number and on the right hand side of the trouser leg.
In the main -- in the main camp of Auschwitz .
But not where the prisoners -- there was no prisoners  but where the guards must have slept  you know  and that was first time in years of so white sheets  you know  and -- and of cour -- Lets take a little break -- Sorry. --
I'm sure that he helped for them maybe they are still alive  these three prisoners  maybe not.
Will you tell us about some of the other prisoners whom you captured?
I saw how the Slovak sonderkommando  Slovak prisoners  uh buried...uh took...digged out these open graves.
And of course w -- being prisoners they changed their attitudes very much  were not so fanatical any more.
Finally  we got uh many of those prisoners were running around in the in the farms and so on.
In the -- in each barracks there were -- there were a few barracks.
We already knew other prisoners and other prisoners knew us and that was the only advantage that we had.
But the funny part was that you read in my book too that the bus drivers for this Norwegian Red Cross were all German war prisoners and they still had the swastika besides it.
In that particular concentration camp  there were all kind of people  the Polocks  the Germans  there were Russian prisoners  and some Jews.
And the prisoner told me -- and he held it up for me to take a picture of -- he told me when the prisoners would first come into the camp  they would be lined up.
But you  you understand  when you  when you say that  you we re working for the prisoners?
break] Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 133 the Germans were were leading some prisoners along the road  from one place to another because they were  lets say  taken to do do some work somewhere.
The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in  but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.
Every day they had to sign by the police  by the gendarme   and they were prisoners there.
They probably suspected that they produced those leaflets and hung them there.
They knew that we were prisoners  that we were prisoners--prisoners is too fancy a name because we were not prisoners  slaves.
Now his photos from Auschwitz  now usually the Germans didnt make mug shots from prisoners.
35 Delousing (German) 36 Cyclone B (German) 37 Special commando (German); term used for Jewish prisoners selected to work in the gas chambers and crematoria.
And I was hired by the legal system to supervise all activities of the political Scandinavian prisoners.
The ma most of the prisoners were either French or British  Polish.
You see  we were packing that -- th-that stuff that was hanging there from the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 67 political prisoners.
And they  the medics would come in and they would load these prisoners onto  two and a half ton trucks  by the dozens.
The-They and suddenly everybody knew about it  the prisoners knew about it and they ran for water.
He gave it to the German officials and they caught us and thats when I was in prison.
And eh eh the the Germans had the the prisoners stay eh eh eh that camp where we were with 25 000 prisoners.
And the other people in your barrack  were they all Jewish prisoners?
I cannot expect  accept some body like Jane Fonda  who went to North Vietnam  you know  with North Viet namese troops and there was prisoners of war in the Hanoi Hilton and stuff.
Did they treat you well  they were fellow prisoners  did they abuse you -- They werent -- they werent very awful to us  but certainly they were not good.
And we were there for about four or five days  because we were liberated by the Russians  I mean  this area was liberated by the Russians.
Well  apparently Keitel or Jodl told some of the other prisoners that I had asked them for an autograph.
Now these Russians turned out to be former inmates of the camp.
Now  there were  of course  some prisoners who did survive because of their brutality.
These inmates of ours wanted to know from the Russians what we should do with them.
This time I was finished and the peoples  you know  because it was -- already people was prisoners in Auschwitz and this I always say  ﬁDon't think you go some place to work.
The prisoner -- I think the capacity of the prison was around 800 prisoners but there were approximately over 2000 or even more.
Then when the war broke out...the Russians  when they went in  so they took us from this camp and they sent us a camp a few miles away from from there because they brought in the Russian war uh PL... No.
There were brothels in Auschwitz   and I believe that some prisoners  kapos   were also allowed to go to the brothels from time to time.
And then by next morning  again  as I remember it very well  about 10 the doors were opened and the prisoners were saying to other prisoners that the locomotive didn't show up and therefore therefore there was some doubt about us being transported to some new destination.
And then they they worked in the fields  and she said sometimes the peasants from the area would leave packages of food in the fields for them  for the prisoners  because they knew they were starving.
And we simply still dressed in the...in the dresses  you know  of prisoners of concentration camp  you know.
Was that something that the newer prisoners maybe wouldnt have kn own how to do or that you kind of eventually learned?
The Germans were not nice  and we weren't going to take any prisoners either.
Not very much  I got in touch with only one policeman  and I remember that when I told those people hiding in the parish hall that there was one guy and the other guy  former prisoners  they said he was helping the Nazis and they called it a   the one who tortured people to get secrets out of him  but he was a prisoner himself.
They were really wonderful friends with with with with uh with a sense of solidarity and as I told you  when I came to that BBC show  this man  was his name  they said this is your life and they brought me over as one of the of the witnesses to to give evidence what...what he had done and how he done it and and uh uh to repeat this again  I hope that this story of the British prisoners of war in Auschwitz will be told one day  because it deserves to be told.
I have no idea and I cant remember  but Im sure there were quite a few barracks with quite a few people in them.
What is it -- what -- what is it about the structure of Auschwitz that you th -- the women -- the womens camp  that you think most ordi nary prisoners who went through -- Yeah?
And I understand that some of the prisoners  not all prisoners were Jewish.
On April 24  no April 23  there was an airplane   a bombing and many prisoners escaped.
And certainly when we interviewed prisoners of war  we did not use the kind of threats or you know  s intimidation f-for I think many good reasons.
