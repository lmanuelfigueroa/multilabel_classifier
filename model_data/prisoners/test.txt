But being marked with an special red stripe  the -- even the male -- male prisoners  who some of them  the officials had no stripe th -- on upper clothing  they had the dark blue jackets  yeah  at wintertime  or some of them had -- yeah  dark blue jackets  they had the red stripes in the center of their jacket  so to be recognized as an inmate.

My brother in law still had a watch  so he asked one of the these men  in those striped uniforms  please tell me what's going on here  so he  they were not allowed to say anything because these were uh  they were prisoners  they already uh for years  but then my brother in law gave him the watch  so he told him in Jewish  and my mother was standi ng next to my brother in law  and I was also standing next to my brother in law  but my sist er  as soon as the train opened and the child was crying  so she went down quickly from the train to get some air  so my uh  this man uh told my brother in law  \ If you have children  then give away the children either to elderly people or people with because people with children are going to be killed the same day.
We thought that they were put to work burning the bodies of prisoners who were killed or died in the camp  since every day there were heaps of dead bodies in front of each barrack.
Well he scoured the countryside and found only one set of Hebrew print in Munich  and that had been pre-empted by an organization of the uh  organization of the Jewish liberated political prisoners.
Because the Russians have all these mixed children from prisoners  have all taking away.
But certainly  its only from a German viewpoint  the average German viewpoints only -- its necessary to -- to connect that with the question of the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war  or the murder of Slav people  and Gypsies  and others.
The prisoners were walking around in groups and talking  but I couldn't understand why there was no American soldiers or anybody who would guard the gates or anything.
Uh years ago  BBC London brought me over to uh to London  because they had a show  \ This is Your Life \  of one of the prisoners who interesting enough had been a member of the British army  had survived Dunkirk  had had been had been had been taken prisoner at Dunkirk  had been I don't know in how many prisoner of war camps  had tried to to escape and unfortunately could never make it  and he was a daredevil.
Now  did you also sing in the barracks  you and the other prisoners?
They took like 100 000 soldiers and officers  only like prisoners of war.
Did they seem like criminal -- Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians  they open the jails you know  the [indecipherable] they were vicious guys  killers.
One th ing the Russians  they paid back for people  what they knew were bad.
And they just got the guards out of the building  right  so one day  the they let the prisoners out of the out of the camp  out of they cut the wire  and so on  or the gates  and let them out.
>> Bill Benson: I wish that we had a lot more time because Bob obviously told us only a little bit about what happened over the course of all of those years  but then Bob ends up in the United States Army and eventually he goes back to Germany and he ends up interrogating German prisoners of war and ex -former Nazis ; a lot to be said about that as he worked for our intelligence service for a good number of years after that.
They were from the from apparently also  they were former Russian prisoners.
In the morning they opened the door and you would have to get your big bowl  your sanitary bowl so to speak  and walk down the row and empty it  rinse it out and then you were allowed to do your business so that was the time you were able to exchange some words with fellow prisoners  although there was always the guys that shut up  but what are you here for  what's new and  but that did not teach you much.
The reason for that information being uh forthcoming was that the troops in the north were over beginning to get very close to and were beginning to overrun uh the concentration camps in their area  so before that occurred in some instances  prisoners were moved from places like Auschwitz uh to places like uh Dachau  which were further...we were further from that concentration camp than they were from their's  so this begins to give you a picture of how the information began to filter through and uh uh be become...we began to develop our own needs because of the information we were getting.
Because they knew where -- ba -- mainly non-Jewish prisoners  because they were coming through an police station  or through another jail  or through -- or sentenced by an judge to -- to receive the beating  yeah.
But we already had enough Pole  old-time prisoners so to speak.
The Germans had demanded that an American pe -- ma -- officer come over and look at an area where th eres a prisoner of war camp so they wouldnt shoot and kill our own prisoners.
Later on I found out that what had happened is that the SS troopers who were running the camp fled from the camp on April 11th  and the underground which was in existence in Buchenwald  in and about Buchenwald  took over the camp with the help of the prisoners and started straightening out the camp before the American soldiers even arrived  which was a day or two later.
The French prisoners were a little bit better shape beca use most of them had only been there nine months.
I always admired the J ewish prisoners who were with me  that those people who firmly believed in their God and prayed.
The order was to evacuate the prisoners  but noboby knew where.

3 Clogs (Danish) 4 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor commando of prisoners.
I says  with the fellows  I said  you mean to tell me  we were prisoners  and were gonna eat  and theyre charging us money for that?
Then I looked at it  all pictures  the commandant and the -- how the prisoners was working in a quarry and this and this  then in the middle I saw the pretty good size picture there  and there was a bunch of prisoners  and there was a kapo  an d -- and -- and they was receiving the soup.
Then they started to gather all the prisoners into the main camp in Dachau  although we were probably no more than twenty  thirty miles to Dachau  everything wass bombed  and I wa s in transit for about four or five days.
It's like the country of  it was named by the Nazis and the prisoners  the Polish prisoners named it Canada Kommando and the reason they named it Canada  because the final solution  of course I knew nothing about final solution in those days.
The southern wing was converted into cells where the prisoners  before they went for interrogation  were taken.
And the only other people around there are other prisoners just like yourself?
I was  we had four prisoners in one bunk  lying head to foot and there was nothing to do all day  so nothing else  talk about food and talking about stupid things at home and I wa nted out of there and Americans finally processed us  the hospital unit on eighth of May  two days after the liberation  that's when they came in  that's when they swarmed into the hospital compound  in came the photographers and in came the hospital units  which later I found out was called a field hospital and they had pictures take  they were taking pictures of themselves with us and any way  they set up showers  portable showers and they showered us  they got us out of the bed and set up fires.
I described in one of my letters a scene of an SS man trying to escape being murdered by the prisoners who were chasing him  and he wanted me to take him prisoner.
And than k God my school English and the English which I had brushed brushed up with the Br itish prisoners of war was good enough to tell him  uh said sir...and he must have been...later was explained to be somebody with a Texas accent  because I didn't...I had certain difficulties understanding...between his accen t and my accent  it was not so easy  but anyhow I said  sir  we are we are we are your friends.
You rubbed  you rubbed and dry  only to look likeŠon the road  we met Russian prisoners of war  alone.

And he also said that that time that they were not getting out  that these were people that -- I dont think they had gas chambers then  but these were really prisoners -- not all Jews.
They all perished with one exception  my Uncle David  my father's brother who was in the [Yugoslav] Army during the mobilization and the Germans captured them and they shipped them someplace wherever they had their Army prisoners and I guess he passed as a non-Jew and that's how when the war ended when some of them were repatriated  he was still alive.
>> Bill Benson: What was it like for you with your other fellow inmates and the other prisoners at Auschwitz.
Interesting enough  uh some of the prisoners we re Polish uh criminals.
Miranda was a pretty nasty place to have a lot of Civil War prisoners.
And as I say  I thought this was just a prison camp  where -- where prisoners were kept.
Bu t I would say that this time  at the banquet  the prime minister of [indecipherable] looked at we five guys that were there  and he sa when he started talking  he said  I want to thank you for freeing the German people from the tyranny of the Nazi political regime  because he said  we were prisoners and didnt realize it as well as these people here at Buchenwald 25 were.
The German prisoners that were across from us were prisoners from before the war.
so they brought nannies and some of the prisoners that were in prison in Auschwitz   they were helping to take care of the kids.
And the and then you have thousands upon thousand s of former prisoners  who they were Correct.
And evidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers to jump to jump into the camp  to prevent the Germans from murdering the prisoners of war before they are liberated.
In other words  I do remember hearing stories that...that first day the soldiers were so angry  and in other words  they had so much empathy for the...for the prisoners after what they saw  that they permitted it  but after that the Germans were protected.
The partisans executed the 78 wounded  and the 14 prisoners for a total of 242 German dead.
Yes  we were alright there just because we were prisoners of war  it didnt make everything bad.
And then they were fed terrific by those Dutch guys  and Philips makes radios  there was no TV yet  so the Germans couldnt constantly watch  so thos e prisoners who worked there  they loved it  they got food from the Dutch  and if any of the German was gone  they put the BBC on  so they heard all the latest news.
We had Soviets and citizens there and Soviet prisoners of war and so on.
What had happened was a huge trench was dug  usually by prisoners themselves  and people were shot and buried but some were buried alive  so kind of move d  the ground moved.
I was not in char -- in charge to interrogate prisoners.
Did you learn something about their fate while you were in Auschwitz?
Every camp had a square where all the prisoners would gather.
To interrogate prisoners of war you kind of have to have a little bit of a psychological background -- the -- from the technique of it.
They want ed to visit the prisoners from time to time.
Did any of the prisoners come up and try to talk to you?
So they put me really to a transport on a bag...baggage...luggage...these ...uh ...trans ...uh ... carriage and I had to give the prisoners always cigarettes that they should carry me.
I also worked in a psychiatric hospital where they had German prisoners.
Cripples from between France and Germany for instance  crippled prisoners of war who were no more able to go to war.
One of the things that I wanted to ask you about was going back to Herz's testimony about slave labor  about the use of concentration camp prisoners.
And when in the morning  at 6 o'clock there was nobody in the office  yes  so we took and there was also a hospital in this  which the prisoners were brought in the hospital because they beat the prisoners and they were not in a stage to be interrogated so a prison hospital.
But Schacter immediately took his Czech Jews  and started to study ﬁMarri age of Figaro ﬂ for the same purpose  to pep up that -- those Ge rman prisoners.
Why -- why w ould there be a group of privileged prisoners from which there would never be a selection or a gassing?
We moved quickly and other points of interest were only days later when I had a group of six prisoners in front of me.
But those were prisoners who worked in the Germ-in Germany as forced laborers from all occupied countries.
And uh the German advise to the German to hide their last men  so so and also uh uh were of us  the   like Polish and all other prisoners  because afraid of uh we do the revenge  so uh come April 12th  we we spot American tank and uh tank go by...one  two  three.
But obviously  the American Army knew long time before what was happening to prisoners.
And the living prisoners looked worse than t he dead ones.
At this time  because I was over there  one from the oldest prisoners  inmates  and you know  youre always have been already prefare -- pre -- you know  prepared  actually -- more privileged than a regular person  you know  they know it.
And at any time  they would suddenly just point to one of the prisoners and command the dogs to attack that prisoner and tear him apart viciously.
I was wondering if you  were you there when the French women prisoners were coming in?
My mother and some of the Jewish prisoners were more subtle with sabotage.
We arrived in a place called Birnbaumel where they had a thousand prisoners in a forest in umbrella-like paper-thin wood structures with no floor.
The Germans  when they come in  they were scared of us.
The men probably had been taken prisoner with the French Army.
But what they had done  they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners had taken some wire  some electric wire and us ed them as belts on their pants because we didn't have any belts.
The barracks were any -- not much to -- to brag about  they were  I think  some old  leftover army barracks ove r there.
Many  many decades after Ebensee  like around 1978  when I lived in the Washington area  I found out that the Ebensee  the Mauthausen register of prisoners is in the 55 national archives and I went to look at it and it's in numerical order  so I'd no problem finding my entry on it  we all know our prisoner numbers  mine happened to be 68 308 and when I came upon it  it was just kind of earth shaking or whatever  I don't know  very upsetting and it was like  later on I got a copy of a page for a friend on which his name was and he says to me that it was like a page out of hell and I think those words are about as apt as you can find and the ones who perished or were killed are crossed out with a line  with red ink and those who died after a certain date are no longer crossed out because the book was kept only up to perhaps the last week in April  1945  so anybody died the last week of April or the beginning of May  it seems that he's still alive  but he isn't.
In the columns  as they were captured and taken back to behind the lines during the Bulge  the SS troopers who--most of them could speak English- began ordering the prisoners to expose their dog tags.
And I was again in this...in this uh...and I came to Auschwitz.
They shrank together  but they  they prohibit  should prohibit the contact between these prisoners  they would that the prisoners should go back to the  the tracks and they should not make contact with these charity men with these kettles.
And then he realized that there must be German prisoners of war on there.
But there were about later on I found there were about  probably about 50 000 prisoners there  you know [indecipherable] 78 000  but they were dying off so fast  and I later fi learned after the war that from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months .
But deep down I heard that the German...the biggest mistake  we were talking in the army  that they're killing prisoners  Russian prisoners  in that time already that the Russians knew that the Germans are killing thousands of Russians and you have to fight not for...we're not fighting against Russia.
Well  I -- I had to take advantage of that because all the other prisoners kind of looked upon ov -- Schwartz as almost a father confessor.
And my mother told me one day -- every morning there would be a line -up of all the prisoners and she said one day a very high Nazi official came to visit the prisoners and address the prisoners and that was a man by the name of Himmler  Heimlich Himmler  Hitler's second in command.
Were you mixed with prisoners who had -- who were already there  or were you kept together as a group from your transport?
And of course there were someth -- you know  were peop -- jewi -- some of the prisoners who were in the office in work  they spoke for them and told them that they were marvelous and whatever else.
And the prisoners want to only for them  and good boots.
I suppose some of these people had a record or a record came where they actually They werent in prisons.
you know) The people who are condemned to-to death and then you find that more of 100 of them have been proven innocent  andand the notion that there are 2 million (you know) prisoners in prison in this country  is just staggering.
They said there was a transport with soldiers with prisoners of war going back to Holland  if I wanted to go to Holland.
He went out the 40 back door as a corpse  was turned over to the Russians who picked him up on an exchange of prisoners.
And I found out that from Prague they're sending a bus for some of the people from Prague who were there  prisoners  to bring them back to Prague.
Did you get to know the other y-young prisoners your age?
They ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 announced -- the Germans announced that they wanted to exchange German prisoners  German prisoners -- the British locked up Germans in Palestine.
And the prisoners made a thing like a carnival in town  they ransacked the stores  they stole bicycles  they just walked on  they thought it belongs to them.
In 19 grad got my da my masters degree in divinity and it was in 1940  first war had already started in Europe  and my father had headed up the war war prisoners aid of the YMCA   which was approved in the Geneva Convention  that international Red Cross took care of the physical problems of the prisoners on ev-every country  and the YMCA took care of their Interview with Tracy Strong June 11  2009 6spiritual and intellectual problems  physical problems.
None were sent back but the ones who could prove they were political prisoners  they left for political reasons  that their lives were endangered  they received extra help from the Americans.
And did you get to talk to any of the prisoners who had been there before?
Whenever prisoners got to the point where they couldn't work enough to earn their keep of black coffee and no cream  no sugar  no fats of any kind  and black bread down through the grams that they were be ing fed -- it sort of strains me to try to reconstruct these things.
When they were pointing a finger at one of the prisoners  s -- and say Juda  which means in German language Jew  the German Shepherd was traine d to jump at this Juda  you know  and to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 20 tear him apart.
Of course  it got better with me  I was one of the fortunate ones for this reason  because I was a Kanada worker  I was also in a better physical shape than the other prisoners were.
The other thing that was different about that camp...in in that camp for the first time I encountered uh women prisoners  Jewish women prisoners.
You came to a spot there  and there were wheelbarrows  wheelbarrows galore  and prisoners galore as well.
And lucky were us that we understood German  if you didn't then you were readily kicked or pushed and  you know  the scene was that there were turrets with guards and the guns were pointing towards the prisoners.
And  you know -- Was there anybody  in addition to that old guard  was there anyb ody who behaved in a more humane way towards the prisoners amongs t the guards or the  you know  the army or even the SS or were they all pretty brutal?
Yeah I guess they were prisoners of war  or just French prisoners.
It was because someone killed a couple of Germans -- soldiers.
And the handle was only about that big  and strips of leather about that big and they wo uld just whip the prisoners with it.
They put him in the prison with all the other German prisoners.
As soon as they opened the doors  prisoners in striped uniforms came on to the train and they started to  to yell that we should all leave everything and go down we all must get out  leave everything in the train.
We find out from the other prisoners who came a little after us  that the Russians are already very close to pole they are in Poland now.
They gave us a little bit -- they called it coffee.
Well the Hungarians tried to do the same thing except they were not successful 12 and the Czechs intercepted them  captured them and imprisoned them and held them and tortured them and who knows what they did to them  but once the Vienna Arbitrage came and the Hungarians took over  they had to turn them loose  they had to release all these prisoners  but they continued their activities even during a time of war  there were organizations which let's say -- one day our town was  I don't know what to call it  raided or something.
Instead we had  it was a revolution in the crematorium  The prisoners  sunderkommando  killed themselves but also they killed all of the German soldiers who happened to be there th is time by blowing up the building.
12 All the prisoners had a little sort of li ke a cup  like a metal cup and this cup was used for everything from getting the soup ra tions to getting any water if you could find some and also in the cattle cars on th is particular journey they were on for several days at a time there was no room to go to the bathroom.
I mean  you were Polish  were there also Jewish prisoners  were there Austrian German prisoners  what was [indecipherable] Oh yes  that was about 17 - 18 different nationalities in that concentration camp.
A lot of the...there were a lot of Poles  there weren't only Jews...there were some Poles  political prisoners.
The ratio was so  one prisoner  one guard; two prisoners  one guard; but three prisoners  two guards and so on.
But I never knew th ere was such a thing of Effektenkammer   where Christian Polish women were employed and they were in charge of the belongings of political prisoners that were brought.
He was in the Russian army and then they took him to the Polish army.
And this is lunchtime  and they were pushing it down by the administration compound buildings where the prisoners would come up and got a bowl of soup or so.
The levels were occupied by different  they were Russian prisoners  French prisone rs  and we were on the top and there was a rail going up and one of the privileged prisoners controlled the brakes  that is he let the full lorries go down to the valley and brought an empty one up and we had to fill each lorry with  what  12 lorries a day or we would get no food  and we -- the rail for the lorries then from the brake station were then two of the different niches where the prisoners worked  so I had this and another one had this and so on.
And I myself always ate the bread and I never saved it for the morning because many times  13 prisoners who did save  their bread was stolen and then they didn't have anything.
Well-fed; which appalled me at the time  because of the comparison of all these prisoners being so horribly starved.
All the blocks was full with prisoners and locked up  never can coming out.
But that was the difference of the Polish male  and the older Ge rman male  of prisoners  and the women  yeah.
There were an couple of -- of Norwegian prisoners in the camp  males.
People were on the trucks open trucks  with prisoners being taken to the gas chamber.
It was a prison  and from that prison people went out of there.
Because many people  many prisoners  who couldn't walk anymore  really couldn't walk anymore  sat down at the side or fell down to the side of the road and they were shot.
One or two of the prisoners then insisted on taking myself and another buddy for a tour of the barracks where they were -- where they slept in these boxes that the pictures all show.
And they took about 18 or so prisoners  and took they were we were in forest  walking through forest took them on sight  and shoot them there.
Interview with Jacques Ribons 127 So in other words  the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the townspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening?
And then  uh  I detailed one man to take them back as prisoners and turn them over to...to our company headquarters.
So anyway they are bringing us as prisoners of war and I said  \ Bessi tell him  tell him.\
Every once in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some of them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold.
Either some of these people are killed by the dog  but we didn't see anybody a nd we inquired a little bit about it later on after our liberation  but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped.
That was a tremendous...tremendous uh...give us a spirit...tremendous spiritual uplift  and I could feel it and then I I thought how could I come into contact and luckily when I was transferred back to that fellow   uh British uh prisoners of war were working in the neighborhood and under very  very careful circumstances and all because they had to be careful.
So  I mean  were prisoners allowed to keep photographs -- like a camera with them?
And fortunately  none of them got sick  but yours truly  I sampled every meal of food that was served in that camp to make sure that what they were getting was good because I had supervisors in the kitchen  but the prisoners in the camp were doing the cooking.
If a hundred prisoners  or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of time  a short period of time  two or thr ee hundred prisoners would come in from Auschwitz immediately  which wasn't very far away.
They were like from the outside you saw passenger uh train un you know  railroad wagon  but inside it was the bars  specially designed for prisoners.
But there was a group of prisoners who was actually working on plans for this device  as the Germans called apparatus.
The other political prisoners  in the other part of the camp?
And even political prisoners who were against the regime of Hitler.
So the the first thing  for about a week or two weeks  I was making numbers for for prisoners.
And then the pe -- other people were sent in -- prisoners.
First they search ed us and took everything out from us  you know  because now we are legal prisoners.
But the first time into us  in September 1943  it came from Theresienstadt a transport of Czech prisoners.
And then so  we identified us  and then we come -- the commander came  first lieutenant  and Lieutenant Hovlent is still alive today  a very nice  religious man  who ga ve permission then to -- that we stay with them  that we didnt know where to go  and maybe sh ow them where some other prisoners would be hidden  or lib erated.
One German man  a beautiful human being  even though they didnt have much to eat  he gave us two heflling  the two prisoners  the two jailbirds  food every morning.
The prisoners broke into those warehouses and everybody was carrying all kinds of clothing.
Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 20 Did you remember seeing those prisoners?
Maybe a lot of Germans  well they didnt like to do it either  but they had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner  you know?
And as far as brutality  the brutality was the beaters  the prisoners themselves  who were there to do the beating and again there was one incident which  once I was in a fairly decent work detail  I mean  everything was chance and luck and if you tried to get into that again  sometimes you get pulled out of it and what --?
And as you probably know  the the many of the officers and and a and a -- leading classes  like judges and teachers and things  they were they were arrested by the thousands by the Soviet s. And and then the Polish officer corps  at at least they know about 20 000 that were killed in Katyn   which was several times where they decided to liquidate the Polish military prisoners of war  which was against  you know  the Geneva Conference  of course.
There were so many prisoners  so many  the Germans had more prisoners than they could really handle  they had more prisoners.
But we did succeed in one instance where we freed two prisoners.
There is a detail of women that is to be sent to a place where they sort clothes th at is left behind by political prisoners  not Jews  not Jews.
Now  there were a lot of Polish political prisoners who are in the underground or whoever.
But in the case of the [ind ecipherable]  what they did was they acted as if they were prisoners of the Italians who were going to be judged in an Italian court in Athens.
My prisoners knew that I expected them to let me know.
In the night time  they put the prisoners  of course  into these barns and they posted guards outside.
I rememb er a group of prisoners–they may have been Russian prisoners or Polish  I dont reme mber.
Bu t then  the kind of situations that people do in the thing  for instance  I was stationed in Dachau that time  and we had took a barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners  and we dro got a couple veterinarians and a couple farm boys   and we had a veterinary clinic  because some of us had to go out of town for a coup le of weeks  so we left the dogs there.
And when we came in the kitchen  there were in every camp kitchen forty kettles of uh steam kettles  where it was cooked  the food for all these prisoners  and uh  they asked we should repair these kettles  and by the time we learned how to  in the beginning we didn't know nothing  but later we knew how to handle it  to repair and we always get some food for this repairing  from the SS men  from the accessory men  that they were  couldn't handle it and they needed it and so.
Interview with Arie Letzter May 22  2016 73 Did you know you wer I mean  you it sounds like you were prisoners.
Then they take me to this  to the great prison cell th at was about twenty  thirty prisoners  and they told me they they had some of them also ha d similar experience.
He was a professional psychiatrist  whose job it was to test these prisoners  you get their IQ  their personality quirks  their state of mind.
Q. If you go back to the prison  did you have contact with other homo sexual prisoners.
But you were taken care of by your friend by your fellow prisoners?
So  and then yeah  they killed so many Jews  a nd they took prisoners  and they burned the synagogues  and that is when really we were aware of the danger of the Nazi [indecipherable] So it was 1938 when you became -- 38.
Because in the train when my brother-in-law -- when those prisoners came on -- on the train to chase us out and tell us to leave everything  one prisoner -- my brother-in-law still had a watch and he gave it t-to this prisoner and he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 91 told him  ﬁTell me what's going on here.ﬂ And my mother was standing next to my brotherin-law and me.
The idea was that German prisoners would talk best if you talked to them within ten minutes of their capture 'cause they were psychologically still traumatized.
BB] Only in the distance... [DL] ...only in the distance [BB] He took  he pulled up in his car  stood up in the car and thats all we knew  and then this interpreter came down and told me what he was saying  and he was apologising for us  cause he said the Italians morale is very low cause theyve got no prisoners  so hes handing over all the prisoners he had there to the Italians.
It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the barracks.
Now  I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were allowed out of that camp that we were going to come to.
And also in the hospital -- the doctors and nurses were also inmates.
There were people coming from all directions  different time  prisoners a lot of British soldiers were there.
We -- we -- we used to get Red Cross parcels that were sent during the war for the American prisoners of wa r. And there were mountains of those.
And as...and he probably --as I say there's no certainty --ended when one of those three big ships that were loaded with prisoners and sank in February of '45 in the Baltics  in the North Sea.
Now  we had cut through and cut them off and...uh ...the men  as I can remember at this particular column  they uh... the men were coming down out of the woods and seeing and hearing the Germans shooting the prisoners.
Other prisoners who were also killed and then when these people came they had to line up and they had to jump in to the grave  but not just anyway you wanted it  no one had to lay this way and the other one this way.
Captain Budrogy informed me that all prisoners of war  for more than 30 days  are returned to the United States .
Did you see a lot of Jewish prisoners being very mean to other Jewish prisoners?
Well  what can one do but  you know  without any trace of where our loved ones ar e. And it was not until I think beginning of August  of 45  that first on the radio -- at the time of news  they didnt have the things as bulletins  at the time of news  it would be an extended time that they took to recite names  because as news be-began to trickle down  and come down from Europe of prisoners from the -- the concentration camps  some -- in some cases the Greeks themselves  political prisoners who were in Dachau  then there was also news from contingents of Greeks that had gone  some of them forcibl y  some of them voluntarily  to work in German factories.
JOHN HOLMES: We got it from our battalion commander  or one of our officers  cause I can't recall whether it was a major or a captain that said  do not give them anything to e- the word was passed all the way down the line  do not feed these prisoners  under any circumstances.
Well  there were some un some German prisoners there yet  but not many  they were gone  they knew where to go.
Because we didn't want to subject our people and the rest of the prisoners in the camp to any unnecessary disease  plus the fact that we brought in  known in military terms as  a delousing unit.
But  soon after that  when the war we were liberated by the Russians.
There was the occasional political prisoner there was the -- mostly they were criminal .
Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8  2010 14 But they were all prisoners of war.
People died during the war and that includes 3 and a half million battle hardened soviet prisoners of war who died in the hands of the Germans.
The prisoners  they must go and take off all their uh .
But we used the same -- I guess youd call it the same three tiered bunks  for the inmates  except there was only one in each bunk instead of three or four.
So they took us from there  from Auschwitz  in another camp.
36 [speaks foreign language here] I: All women at the time when saw this traumatic situation and knew that the one of the prisoners saw her sister with her child  were very quie t and it was  for them there was a funeral. [
She was allowed the Polish prisoners somehow I think were allowed to have two times a year packages mailed from home.
ﬁLife is wonderful  it begins tomorrow.ﬂ 59 No  this was -- this was -- a French prisoners said to me.
Many prisoners  they would write with their blood about the life incamp.
people  the ones that were directing the other prisoners  were telling us (?)
Just a year or two ago there was a trial of a man in Germany  also quite elderly  referred to in the presence of bookkeeper of Auschwitz  he helped to process valuables that were confiscated from prisoners.
Do you remember  did you hear about what happened when the crematoria was blown up by the prisoners?
And then  they decided  all the Jewish prisoners of war to send back to Poland.
Did you see -- for example  there was a quarry there where a lot of prisoners were f -- Yeah  when we went to work  there was a long s -- line of steps or whatever in the quarry and many mornings when wed go  na turally  to have breakfast and whatever and then go to work  the Russians or the Germans had put a whole mess of stones in front  so they had to be removed before th e nurses could walk up to get to the camp.
Who ra -- Im now trying to remember  I dont know whether you remember who raised the question of the fact that he never -- theres no evidence that he be at a prisoner  or that he was actually having much to do with prisoners at all.
The Russian prisoners of war were marched -- that's what she told me  to the town and even when some of the non-Jewish -- well  the Jewish population couldn't but the non -Jewish population would offer them water  they would hit them with the rifle butts and would n ot let them accept the water.
We -- we managed to take too  50 000 prisoners  including the top brass  right down to the last  here and in other parts around the town.
The terrible thing  maybe  to add to that  I should say  was that then the SS would send some of us prisoners to go and pick up the dead bodies and cart them away.
I also you know there  there were prisoners who for instance were stealing from other prisoners you know bread you know which was punishable.
SS men beginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb  namely in concentration camp garb scream ing  ﬁOut  out with you dirty Jews  out!ﬂ And  beating us  beating us like crazy  and then we had to run from which wasnt very far  maybe fifty or sixty yards to the camp from the railroad track.
After a few days of that existence Americans then started making arrangements to ship the various liberated prisoners to their homes.
But I would stop and start a conversation at the time  and during that time they would mention some of the things that happened to the prisoners such as that when they were strapped  there wasn't only -- not strapped but when they were hit with these blows with this -- it was about a two-inch round bat if you'd call it.
Oh -- ah -- oh  what happened was  since I knew -- yes  we saw German prisoners of war  and -- and si -- w-we were either guarding them or seeing them being guarded by the British.
I was [indecipherable] Bastogne speaking to prisoners when they were shooting -- when the German bombs were bombing Bastogne.
The brigade was in Holland and I found guarding these German prisoners when they were clearing the mines not a very interesting occupati on  a boring and I thought it would be nice to get to Germany.
It was prisoners  not like pink or no -- the differences of color when I was sent as a writer I received green.
Some were -- they were taken to the bunker and then either starved to death or some of them were shot against the wall  you know  the death wall.
They loaded this with the sand then they told the prisoners to lie down next to this.
And also that right here in the bookstore  a book called \ The Prisoners of Breendonk \  which is in Belgium.
Interview with Norman Coulson October 4  2013 84But these prisoners  the poor souls  they didnt know where they were from.
So when you were deported on the buses from Auschwitz to Ravensbruck  were those buses  were the people on the bus mostly non-Jewish prisoners?
And in Ukraine was an office of the Jo int  and they were giving to Jewish prisoners some onion.
When I -- came my turn  and the instructor asked me  well  somebody said we kill them  and it -- it happened actually  that they got so upset about it during combat  that wh en they found this -- this really happened that they got killed  with their hands bound behind their back  that our troops went wild  and they took no Chinese prisoners  they shot them.
Well  we were always looking for interesting prisoners  so when the city of Treya was about to fall  I was sent  as I often was  to go there and find out how mili to write a report on the how a military government functioned after the first de day or two.
Well  of course when they came to us oh  well  I know that there was there was supposed to be a p I knew there we re political prisoners and I already know about Auschwitz and all that.
And uh there was one gap - uh there's a new book  just came out - it's being reviewed and this book uh uh on World War II says the gap  had Montgomery acted faster would have been closed and the war might have stopped right then and there or at least in the war in the west  and uh had we uh were unable to close it but we took 10 thousands of prisoners near Falaise and Argentan and so we had to do uh we had to do uh work very quickly with the prisoners and had no time except pick out some that by uh vir...by the testimony of their of their paybooks were important.
He was the commander of one thousand prisoners who were maurers  uh learning how to lay the br icks uh and to make it work for building the huge  uh  for the building of this huge crematorium for creamatory which were at that time in building  had not been built. (
More than a million prisoners of war came back and had to re-adjust to life.
With the result that ea ch one of the five of us would have only a certain number of prisoners under their jurisdiction and they wouldnt get to know anything about any of the others.
They didnt they they might have said some things about maybe certain one s that they were they were mishandled by  but but they ne th ey are there was wasnt much there were there really wasnt much discussion about the prisoners.
Give a man a gun  teach him to hate  give him prisoners and a free hand with them and the best man will become a rascal  if not a complete monster at one time or another.
I saw one of the leaflets  but they started shooting at people that picked up the leaflets  so there were but there were still a few prisoners got ahold of leaflets.
And you would go overseas and be assigned to a division  or -- or a regiment  or even an army group  or an ar my  as interrogator and when those units advanced and took prisoners  the IPW team in terrogated them.
And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers  and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed.
They were eating -- some fugitive from the front come into and got wrong way and come into the camp  the SS was scared and put into us they have horses and then at night the prisoners killed the horse and they tried to eat him up.
All the Germans  they put them in camps  arrested as war prisoners.
You know  in the early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi.
Then after a while  the people of the camp  we got them to go out to cut wood  the young people by telling them all sorts of lies about how they were going to learn how to use power saws  which they'll use in Palestine  God knows if they had trees there or not  and uh we promised them an extra reward of cigarettes  which we got out of the Red Cross packages for prisoners of war  which we had quite a bit.
So -- Were those the barracks that they had been living in previously?
When this killing was over  and they were... The French prisoners  presently  they were excepted.
And  you know  still  we were so starved that some of the prisoners tried to grab that decomposed food and eat  and these guys that was guarding us  they were wearing arm bands of surrender but they still were shooting at the prisoners trying to grab a hold of this and quite a few people were shot close to liberation that way.
When we got in -- in -- into the blocks  you know  and we met other prisoners.
Germans  they so do the prisoners was to us was you were Jews.
But he would just take it out on the prisoners because they were losing the war.
In one case  I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape.
More arrests and more ar rests and more arrests and before you knew it  these friends were taken prisoners and th ese friends were taken prisoners.
A day or two before there were these food riots and somesometimes the Nazis from outside the camp this German officer would see the riots so they would shoot at the prisoners  sometimes.
As a matter of fact we came to the point when interrogations of prisoners were -- was not even necessary any more.
Because we were more witnesses to their uh machine  you know  death machine  than any other prisoners  because we were the one who were picking up dead bodies and  and took them and bur ned them on their order.
They although the information that we gained from units that worked with us  either on the side of us  on either side of us or we we get information from prisoners that we uh take from the opposing units  from the Germans or  German units  or we get them from civilians that we uh run into in the areas that we are beginning to occupy  so uh these are all sources of information.
And they needed me there because they had a lot of German prisoners  and I had to work as an interrogat -- as a interpreter and I had to go around with nurses and doctors  had to make the rounds when they saw the patients.
Were you aware of other prisoners trying to get stuff or being able to kind of manipulate the situation?
When I was in Klettendorf  I had prisoners of war...Russian prisoners.
And had any of the prisoners identified them - Yes. --
And where were the other people from besides Auschwitz and - Mostly from Poland  they're mostly Polish people.
I think he -- he was a -- a -- a lieutenant who was cate -- ca me from the prisoners of war c-camp  and he -- I -- he wanted me to meet with   I refused because wi -- all the time Eleanor didnt know my real name  because I told her my name was Kaliw ater  because I knew that the communist underground force  there were n-Nazi spies in there  and they told me that the-they -- 50 they ha -- they witness enough destructions of Jews  Im -- I think its was a -- w-was a -- that just the first mass destructions of Jewish -- Jews in Poland.
Although I read later on that they suppos edly played upon arrival for the -- for the arriving prisoners to -- still to give them a -- an impression that theyre coming somewhere to a spa where the orchestra plays fo r them.
In that children's block there were not only Jewish children uh but also uh uh Polish and from uh Russian uh war uh prisoners of war  some of them uh even younger than me.
The officer told the prisoners and two German guards that they should sit on this donkey.
If there were kapos  or blockeltestes  or other prisoners  who were treating other people badly.
M-Most likely  they wanted to do something to -- to get rid of all this per -- concentration camp prisoners  but the British took it into their hands on -- on May third.
But  he had a bleeding hand  he had a thin cotton uniform  the concentration camp uniform  and no shoes because his feet were so big and  of course  all the clothes of all the prisoners were taken and they were given like wooden shoes and nothing would fit him so he was barefoot.
That brings back the story that when the prisoners -- when the SS troopers left  the underground took over  as I said  and they cleaned up a lot of the things.
And they would really did not issue 22 permits for...for allowing people to go out  because there was a situation that they were afraid that the prisoners  those who would venture into the village  would kill Germans.
Ruben  me  and two Russian prisoners went out to the barbed wire and people line up behind me.
What happened was actually one of prisoners who ask himself to be allowed to go to the latrina...you know  you call it.
It was run by some 54 sisters  the M.D.s were a couple of Italian prisoners of war  and I checked in and stayed there for three weeks  and was discharged more or less cu red.
Medical experiments and some of the pris oners  some  there was one block where they kept the prisoners who had gone over the edge.
And getting us away from the fronts  you know  and we ended up down at Moosburg   which was pretty crowded  had lots of prisoners there  you know.
That was the last boxcar they unloade d. There were more dead than alive and when the American army came two days later  they found the entire train  say the first five boxcars  boxcars full of dead prisoners.
She said were going to get out of Siberia with these papers because we were not prisoners like many other Jewish people were taken to Siberia  but we went ourselves.
No  no  no  no  were -- oh  you -- no  Im sorry  when we -- when we met them  we were in civil uniforms  thats correct  but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no hair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were  by a -- sort of a center of the head  the street  that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it  there were a little bit of hair  so it was recognizable as a street or a mark to be a prisoner.
They were able to handle 4 000 prisoners and one of them came by and gave my father a beating and he had a walking stick  which was diameter this thick and he just used that for beating.
The officers were the officers of reserves  so there were  you know  lawyers  doctors  professional officers and all kind of intelligentsia that was part of that 200-some 20 prisoners of wa r that these Russians captured.
And they were just rec overing from the execution of all the prisoners that tried to escape for Th e Great Escape when they executed -- because The Great Escape took part -- some of it started in the barracks that I was in.
The prisoners of war was over 2 500  so you can imagine what the situation was like.
And on the left is a barbed-wire fence where the people when they were brought in from the trains and the train tracks and everything were back in the camp  they were put in these cages for a while until they were given where they're supposed to go.
Do you have any sense of how many people were there?
There was a great divide between the Czech prisoners and us  but once in awhile they s -- they had pity on us.
The Palietsch later on fell in love with a Jewish woman  and he was put into that Bunker where he used to lock lot of prisoners.
They tore off their insignia and they also ha d prisoners come from other camps  they brought them down  but they themselves tore off all thei r insignia on their clothes.
What has happened  when the British came in the 15th of April the tank went through  waved the flag  everybody say hooray and they went out and we are still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking.
But at that moment when I was there  the Russian soldiers were there  prisoner  also sneaked out and we went to the forest.
Then we had some English soldiers taking care of a bunch of German prisoners of war who were in a nearby camp.
And instead of allowing the remainder of the prisoners in Auschwitz to be liberated  the Germans had another diabolical idea to empty the camp and force the prisoners on a Death March deeper away from the front and into German y. I had no idea what was rationale was there except that it had one result  it diminished our number by a huge -- in a very big way because it was wintertime and we were marched out on the highway  in the snow  and the outdoors.
And understand that there were quite a few factories where they put the prisoners in the bottom and made the enem y -- somehow made the enemy know that there were prisoners so they wouldn't bomb the fa ctory and kill their own people.
Pause - drinking water) Uh  at one point in Auschwitz uh that after I had met this kapo and uh as I mentioned uh if not for the food and occasionally a piece of clothing - she had a uh coat commandeered for me uh because uh when people arrived at Auschwitz they were uh  their clothes with the outer belongings they may have still had with them  was taken away and uh we were given that uh pajama type uh prisoner's garb uh striped prisoner's garb.
Yeah  that's right  but the prisoners of war being protected by the Geneva Convention objected to have Jews in their camp so they Canadians ha d to build another camp right next door to it.
And because of the packages which I have received from my family as other prisoners do  I was strong enough just to take again my office of Director of Polish Catholic Mission and function there and liberate the priest who helped...suffered for me with great  really willingness to do whatever he was able to do.
It was one of the camps that they had in Italy for Jews and other political prisoners  whatever  and then a few days later  they moved us  also  and they sent us to a very small town near Rome called Atessa.
And we had to look at them as if they were clothed  smile at them and  of course  we didn't speak German   they didn't speak English but  you know  the --probably some handling wh ich--you know  all that -- as if nothing had happened  and we were told that these were political prisoners; that some of the best minds in Germany were probably there  but they were not politically correct  and yet what grabbed my attention was that these men didn't seem to be aware --of course they were aware they didn't have clothes on  but they didn't seem somehow to acknowledge that.
Instead of having a large group of four thousand prisoners  or three thousand five hundred together in one group  if there is a mass escape  they cannot kill ever ybody.
Well  we were getting coffee from that big -- what do you call it -- pot  and they were giving the prisoners coffee.
And therefore  they did employ outside people from the Polish workers  and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the outside  and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from outside.
The more prisoners the more guards and the ratio was mostly one prisoner for two.
They were either prisoners or they were in hiding or they were in the Resistance in th e fields somewhere outside of Paris.
Sure enough a couple of days later he comes up with a whole tray with a little steak and other things and I almost died because all these  our poor prisoners  got only water and you know the regular food and here I had a steak  but I guess mothers will be mothers even in prison.
But only days before the Russians came to Gdansk  they were told they're going to be exchanged with German prisoners who are -- who were captured in Sweden  there in Sweden.
Women used to every day go out and pull the steamroller and I had  later on I made a friend whom I got away from there because somehow prisoners did ha ve some influence on what could happen to prisoners and I got her aw ay.
These prisoners were from eastern country: Hungry  Poland  Romania  Ukraine  a number of them we re from Holland  a few from France.
You know  people  the prisoners  were stuck in a cattle car  150 prisoners.
Later on  uh  they brought about 15 000 Russian prisoners of war.
Now my answer and her answer combined is that wh en the barrack was assigned for the administrative  administrative work details  to work and to be housed there  it was very a negl ected one  the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that ba rrack  which was Block four  a wooden barrack.
I know because -- and I know they make with the Russians ladies  the prisoners.
So many times  unfortunately  we prisoners got also the bullets flying from the airplanes.
And Waffen -- and SS guards coming out and prisoners -- and prisoner of war coming out .
When we came to werk A  often  we have to they assembled us on a big assembly place  and we had to watch executions of prisoners by hanging or by shooting.
If the prisoners were coming back in the camp later in the afternoon  most of them would go out of the camp  walk around and come back.
on one side and women and children on the other side   did they take you did you get any prisoners clothes  or No  not there.
However  there were a lot of Germans  like prisoners  sentenced 15  20 years for murder  robbery  rape  whatever.
How were you able to communicate to prisoners in other parts of the camp  in the upper camp  for example?
And fortunately they were not treated nearly as badly as the Russian prisoners of war.
I went every day to the -- there was a office of political prisoners  which we were considered by that time  political prisoners  and they published every day a new list whom they found in some hospitals  or in Germany  survivors.
Okay  so in in addition to the Ukrainians who had been deported  was there like a regular were there regular Russians who werent prisoners of any kind  who Thats right  thats right.
One block was a bunker where all prisoners who tried to escape and they were caught  they we re put there.
We went to all concentration camps  to -- like for instance  in Auschwitz   we were in Auschwitz maybe two weeks after Auschwitz was liberated.
They all they run away and there were thousands of prisoners.
Did any of the prisoners try to speak to you  or say anything to you?
However  after a little time elapsed and the Russians pilfered and imprisoned all the -- all the members there that were leaders in the town   and my father and some other people also thought about it twice and tried to come back  quickly kind of on -- under the cover of a sheet or a frozen river  tried to cross back  and by then the Russians sealed the border and they caught them all  put them in prison  and said they were spies.
The only thing that was different about this barracks was the condition of the prisoners.
And they pack us on train  which was like -- it was not regular train  it was these freight wagons  parked one next to another  we climbed there  they took us to the railroad station  they set camp in [indecipherable].
Do you And and we landed in Amiens in in th one of the flights that I recall  and and it was kind of interesting  there was also German prisoners were stationed the same place.
So I was taken to the railroad station  we took a train  and at that time  I don't know how it is today  at that time  if you go let's say from Washington to California  you would not go non-stop  you would maybe go from Washington to maybe North Carolina and stay there a couple of days  three days in a prison and then join other prisoners and form another group that goes and you eventually come to California.
What we found out is that the women at that job  thats still Auschwitz property  except this is a sort of a separate unit - that the women  political prisoners  were somehow involved in the Polish underground or they were in cahoots or whatever  so they were shipped out.
That is to say  I have received the regular food as other prisoners  but only with the privilege to leave for the Priminate twice a month.
And this was the beginning of the torture  because at the end of the corridor were the torture chambers  and we could hear the cries of the prisoners being tortured.
23 While you were in Cherbourg  did you also run into some prisoners of war there?
We got about 400  brought them up  and we housed them  took care of them; classed them as German prisoners of war.
Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees  I mean not refugees  but prisoners from way back.
We were on one side  tetrush prisoners of the administration created a cordon on the other side.
In 1942  the Polish they organized the Polish army in Russia.
We did trust him and we had to change our plans  and then apparently  apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape  and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldnt go in a different way  and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the camp.
How many prisoners were there tota l  what the cells looked like?
We could not uh  there was not trains  the trains were all packed up because all the Russians  and the prisoners were going back  back to Russia  all the German prisoners were going back to Russia t oo.
The many  many other prisoners from Libau  from Riga  from German Jews that I met subsequently  Czech Jews  so on and so forth were all there  and I stayed for a good number of weeks.
And when the Hungarians came  they became the big majority in the camp and Hungarian replaced Yiddish as the tongue of the prisoners.
We -- there were some maps that I tr anslated for him once and -- and were in -- in -- well  I wasnt -- my -- my -- my German didnt come in that -- all that han-handy  because -- cause at that time there were German -- Germans infiltrated our lines  dressed -- took uniforms from prisoners -- English speaking German sold iers infiltrated our lin es  and we went out on patrol.
Can you talk about the choices of the guards and the SS  did they have choices?
And subsequently  because they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners  they housed us underneath the office  so that we would not be mixed with the population of the camp  however big or small it was  for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice  or whatever  we would be clean to serve them.
The rails of that part of Bavaria were clogged with trains full of prisoners being dragged towards the Reichs last redoubt.
And some prisoners what came from Dachau  they always remarked  uh  this was a golden food--what they were getting in Dachau-compared with ours.
So our summer travail -- travails in -- in Luxembourg was primarily to get to know the prisoners  their character  their personalities  which would help the prosecutors in developing their approach when they tried them  and also fo r historical purposes.
A unique little story was some days later  when we were approaching a beautiful  mid -evil town  Bumberg   where I had four prisoners in front of me.
So I took him to a P.W. cage as it was called  just an enclosure for prisoners  and I turned the general over to those people and that's the last I saw of him; except later on I heard he was highly incensed because they wouldn't permit him to talk to our general.
I rather suspect that most of these cans cam e from the French personnel and the Spanish–\ ] Anthony: Prisoners?
And they were preparing a transport and the transport was over a thousand prisoners.
The two prisoners were Russian soldiers  looking for mushrooms under the snow.
They all shipped them to the war prisoners to  to Russia or they  they used them first for labor  for  for  for laborers  you know  for whatever reason it is.
Now these people have been in this place already 6 months to 3 years or prior to that because what we found out much later these were inmates that were taken from Russia  from Poland  from Germany...Jews...political prisoners who did not agree with the German's philosophy  and these people were there and they were doing this labor.
These guys would sort of have a few whispers as they walked by because they werent allowed to talk to each other but the Polish prisoners who were there for years because the Poles had to go to the camps before -- would tell them about -- they would say things like  make believe youre healthy because that way you would be steered toward  what was it  the right as opposed to the left or whatever it was  whatever their options were.
And then we went -- during the night  more had surrendered  and we had captured a total of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German  300 prisoners.
Whether it was spilled during the way by other prisoners carrying it or it was available.
And Hindale was the one who was collecting money from me to support his family  and to support other families  and the other of the imprisoned political prisoners  Jewish or non-Jewish.
We found out later on from the grapevine  through the grapevine  people working the railroads - you know from the prisoners  other prisoners  that the train came back with the luggage of those  of those from those people on that transport.
And so not too far from my home was a factory -- paper machine factory  and in th e basement of the factory were French prisoners of war.
Because in all the Krankenbaus  all the  all the sick bays  where ever they put prisoners  there never doctors.
Birkenau  Birkenau  [spe aks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] Did you have meetings in Bl ock four about the organization  ab out how things were working  I mean how was there communication inside the block about the  since this was the  this is the organization of the camp prisoners  did they have meetings so that they made decisions together  how? [
And they took prisoners  a lot of prisoners in one time  every night what was going on.
So  atrocities in the world are not a dampener  or not a way to tell people  ﬁLets go into mass education and prevent this from happen ing again.ﬂ No  no  there are many  many prisoners or leaders who said  ﬁLets keep people as stupid as possible  because its so much easier to govern them.
In my case [indecipherable] was Italian s-soldiers  war prisoners  who did the bombing.
In excha--in uh  we  prisoners  we were working on drawing maps of the defenses of the Auschwitz  of the position of the uh  uh guards and the machine guns becau-which the underground wanted from us.
These were German prisoners  but they had given them special rations to be and they were all big guys  and theyd give them a big board or a club  like a baseball bat  and they were to keep us ot her prisoners in line  to obey orders you Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 40know.
So it was punishable by death and it was punishable by death  by the prisoners themselves you know it was  they took him to work.
The rest of the buildings were all wooden and that housed the prisoners of the camp.
Well th en Andrews wrote a message to be delivered to them  and I -- of course I translated that and read the message to the prisoners and -- which we told them it -- you have no choice.
We had no lights  no power  no water  no sewage  no sanitation of any kind  and that is exactly what we found and we had to get that cleared up fast because of the health of the prisoners of the camp.
It sounds like your father and your uncl e found it difficult to trust other prisoners.
Here again  these prisoners were just like the ones back at Hadamar--in a terrible  terrible shape.
And so I say I I I was lucky that I I...we worked mostly uh mainly lists had to be prepared...I don't know what  and we were typing but then don't forget it was near Berlin  so air raid warnings came almost every night so when air raid warn ings came  we couldn't work so at least caught up somehow with my sleep and there I recovered slowly somehow and was assigned to a to a barrack where where I could at least find also a cl ean place and this this kind of worked and uh tried to establish some some some contacts uh uh especially w ith the wonderful people from Denmark who were also uh uh kept as prisoners there and Norway.
When you say Russian uniforms  what is it -- what -- Russian uniform from -- The ar -- -- their prisoners of war.

One of the prisoners had connections with the people  because everywhere I worked were prisoners  everywhere.
Im sure there we re Greeks and Italians and -- What else did you see inside the camp besides the prisoners?
And we had to march the group they marched every group they let them hang there for about a whole shift and every group from every tunnel section had to go march thru so you hanged from the hanging prisoners would touch your head and made you look watch you that you look up and see what we do with people who do sabotage.
And he sold his services to the prisoners for anything that he can get out of them.
It sounds like you had contact with people  prisoners from a lot of different surroundings  is that true?
But at no time had we encountered brutality  uh where people had been subjected to such uh inhumane treatment  where people were dying  where people indeed were being killed  as prisoners  as we did at Buchenwald and some of these other concentration camps.
And so we found out that there was a prisoner of war camp where they had a lot of prisoners who were capable of doing special things.
So Russian prisoners were there   cut the barbed wire and we went and I went with them.
Well  I was delighted obvio usly  that they were prisoners of war and we were being guarded.
And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the workshop SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a clerk in the office there  and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners  glassers are going to work in this spot and he signed this SS man  forged his name.
So there still were prisoners from the concentration camp years Yeah.
And political prisoners were treated differently from Jews or Serbs or Roma in that they actually had some kind of a trial and they were given a sentence.
One of my one of my American friends was supposed to collect food for the prisoners over there  which was a farce.
So you know  I guess they must have hit some prisoners.
But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the prisoners.
Everybody had to leave and they searched the rooms  you know  and dow nstairs they said they just picked up people and -- and -- and I saw women  children  disabled people  its not -- something is not right  and this was the reason it made me jump -- jumped off the lo rry  and you know  and -- and we found out later  you know  we never had all those people again  so we knew that they were -- where they were taken I dont know  but they were certainly -- at that time th ere was no Auschwitz yet -- you know  I mean there was Auschwitz because Auschw itz was built much earlier  but it wasnt built for Jews  it was built for Polish prisoners of wa r  you know  and certainly Birkenau wasnt in existence.
Because the most significant thing politically about the difference between Nuremberg and what we're doing now  or tryi ng to do now  is the fact that we had won a war and these people were our prisoners  these defendants were.

Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 174 something else  because she know that and some prisoners  like myself  get they eat whatever  they got it and they were hungry  they eat too much  and they went they died.
And on the way to Auschwitz  we were joined by a lot of Polish prisoners.
So then -- and they all thought that I was so stupid  so then the guards came in and they had to say hundred sev -- 185 prisoners  eight in bed  and so many.

He exhorted all the prisoners to keep working for the s uccess of the German R eich and that as long as they kept working  nothing bad would ever happen to them.
So the guards would realize this  and then they would intermingle with the prisoners?
He was then sent on to Mauthausen   another terrible concentration camp where Jews were forced to carry -- these other prisoners forced to carry these huge blocks up a ramp where many of them would be tripped and then fall down and be killed.
There was only a few hundred left of those war prisoners.
So lets go back to Oberlangen  where you are  you know  youre youre there with about 2 000 other women  prisoners of war  and its now like the winter of 1945  the war is coming to an end.

He drove to the Landviersaf  he left over there two cabins  and he drove to the Noybough  to that unfinished camp near the station where uh  one  uh  that prisoner who was supposed to be a guard and I  we uh  uh waited for him  he dressed already in the prisoners uniform  and when they arrived  two of them  you know  we jump on  and we had a uh  uh  uh we had a guard  an SS man  and us 3 prisoners   and we started toward the gate  main gate near the architect office at the point near  at the road  uh  toward Auschwitz  near the Sower River.
The prisoners in there began yelling out  calling out to the men: \ Don't do it!
The wooden bunks were about two or three tiers high  and I was with my mother on one middle one and across from us were German prisoners.
And at that point  they called all the Italian officers and told them  ﬁYour king a nd the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice  so what are you going to do?ﬂ And at that point  the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners.
But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition  and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months  which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the factories to work or to the -- they had a stone mine there that they were digging from.
We had a lot of historic war cri -- war department commissioned historians who wanted to interrogate these prisoners.
But that week of window save d us  because then we put in different category of person  because we had Central American passports  and they treated that a little separate  and the Palestin e visa part  they also had some benefit for awhile  because they wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you  and it put us into a different classification of detainee  and then we were in this new category  and we were put into different grouping.

And did then also after some days  the possibility to approach the other prisoners also sick and console and strengthen them.
He spoke a little bit German and I didn't speak much English  but he was very friendly and we were not sup pose to fraternize  or they weren' t suppose to fraternize with the prisoners  so we were just holding hands and goi ng for a walk.
I understand that he was in the group  there were orders given apparently to not let any of the prisoners -- most of the camps fall into -- be liberated.
Immediately  the Germans started...uh  the SS trooper started going down  uh  the prisoners  looking at their dog tags.
And we when there just to build this concentration camp  and we start to work there and we make the wire and the barracks  because every time when the camp was ready  they was coming always new prisoners from all the countries.

I have seen people arrive and be there for two  three weeks and then unless they were really hustling and competing  if they were trying to be some how accommodating of all the others who but all the other prisoners who by that time were very aggressive and would try to steal your bread or steal your soup just to survive  not out of villainy   or they wouldn't make it.
One there was no the block  the chief block and they have to get the prisoners first in the second  so it was to the -- so we have to go out from one door and down  and Mengele was there and we pass by him and he look at you  and the chief on the block  you have -- a card -- you don't have no names.
And other prisoners are asked  another truck comes and asked to take these bodies with hands and legs.
He was with us in the camps -- not in the camps  he was with us in Starachowice camps  up to the point where  on the eve of being shipped to Auschwitz  he broke out with the other prisoners  most of whom did not make it.

I couldnt say say when when I f when I get the Germans prisoners.
And that's how a lot of our prisoners  all throughout the other camps too.

They are going  transports like ours  marching from other camps and on one  they were carrying these little carriages  the prisoners  they were the -- the -- all the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 8 packages and everything  what they took with themselve  the kapos and the SS  they were pulling it.
We were not permitted to get out  it was November  but we sa w across the our train a train with Russian prisoners  in open cattle cars  and we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one bread in each car and these peopl e were starved to death   woul d start fighting and the minute they would start fighting  then SS said mutiny and would take their machine guns and Brrrrrrr.
Q. Did you say that the criminal prisoners and the political prisoners were the same?

Those people  we found out were kapos  other prisoners  but that's what they had to do.
So she did have her share of participation in the operation of that camp and in furthering the operation of the camp to the extent that there was this common de sign to subject these prisoners to that type of punishment and that type of misconduct of st arvation.
And the prisoners  the other wome n who were with you  did you treat each other well at that time as well?
And I was standing there; and there was prisoners in front of me.
So we were informed by other prisoners  ﬁthose are your families.
All these stripy clothes prisoners in there  and dogs and they herd us into this camp  and it was Buchenwald concentration camp.
That's why  when people  you know  even our own people that were there  that were in charge  were brutal and -- and were -- and -- and were beating and -- and doing all horrible things  that prisoners themselves  to other prisoners  I only could understand after -- after those blankets and after this that -- that how I had changed also.

Any of the scenes that I am relating to you was all given to the 3rd Army Commission who was up there and made a complete inspection of the camp and questioned all of the...not all of them  but a lot of the prisoners.
Were there barracks  where did they stay  that kind of thing?
And I was   because I guess we were considered prisoners.
I knew only that the prisoners said we have run the water.
But they said to the Germans  we need Dutch people -- we need pe ople to work here  we need laborers to do the work  why dont you send some busloads of those prisoners every day?
And these people did all kind of jobs  interrogation of prisoners during wa during the fighting.

So what the prisoners would do is they would -- the ones that werent standing near the side -- they would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it.
And then  I never had evidence that the Germans  right after the war  which was prisoners of war which I met  I never had evidence that they are the one who committed the crime against innocent people.

So they gave him Turkish pris oners and German prisoners and Austrian prisoners from the first World War  and they used to work in the factory helping to smoke the fish.
They would get prisoners of theirs from the from the barracks to come in and do all this work in the crematory.
And  oh  so this way  but as they prisoners  they were all treated equally.
The second day I came in  they put us in a line up  all the Polish prisoners and they asked  ﬁJuden raustreten2.ﬂ \ Jews report.ﬂ I was hesitating for a minute  I admit and two friends of mine  Pollacks  they were standing in my side both of them and they pushed me out and they said  \ Here is a Jew.ﬂ Must have been nice friends.

Instead of having just airmen  prisoners from the Allies--that would be the Canadians  English  and the Americans--they now held a lot of Jews that had been taken away from the master camp at Dachau and Dachau  uh  No.
But I think of big importance was that from the Danish Red Cross there was sent this gift passes every month and many of the Danish uh concentration camp prisoners they survived because of this.
This was this was Soviet Germans  not German prisoners of war.
There was some officers come and we find out they was from Auschwitz  Oswiecem  and they pick up so many prisoners and happen  you know  they pick me up too.
They would put us by the gate and the prisoners were come in and said  ﬁMan  look at the bunch of Jewish barons.

The warehouses were full of well  they were not full  but there was bread in the warehouses and the prisoners were didn't get anything so we rioted to get in.
I never forget a first attempt  my first attempt to interrogate prisoners and then to report the results of my interrogation to the general in charge of our regiment  who had been accustomed to the battle wise master sergeant  who had furnished him information through many campaigns  from Africa or Sicily up to   and here he now turns to the brand new chickenshit second lieutenant  he says well Lieutenant what did you learn?
So those people were taken prisoners  or were they were always they started as our enemies  fighting us.
And he might have been one of the earliest prisoners that actually helped at Birkenau.
Irwin said the SS found it more convenient to steal things  than to beat prisoners.
The DP camp was in Maastricht and there of course we had had a business and my mother knew people from the earlier days and even though the the conditions in the DP camp were very ba d and we were treated more like prisoners  locked in and so on  nevertheless we had these connections and they came to see us and my mother was able immediately to notify our family in America and in Palestine of the fact that we were alive and to and to ask for their help  and the communications that I  that my mother wrote uh in those days and in the weeks following that she wrote to my family in America and in Palestine  those letters with all her recollections are in my possession and many of the documents that uh uh we have from from the tim es we were being returned after the war are in my possession  and uh the uh eventually uh the Dutch people took care of their of the Dutch citizens who were brought back to Holland.
And eh and those all eh eh eh eh a lot a lot of German Gestapo were caught eh eh denounced by prisoners and caught by the MP immediately and arrested.
48 Hospital (German) 49 SS go away  prisoners stay (German) 43 concentration  if it was a work camp.
And the fear of the Germans  the German prisoners  was always ominous.
My friends  we got one room with beds  with these cots that the soldiers used to sleep on.
I dont -- and I also learned from other prisoners  and I really didnt believe it  that they were doing experiments on people  and I didnt believe that either.
And that time came an order  you know  we c-caught so many prisoners  we still were in the woods.
They yo-you walk into the houses  hey  they were prisoners there  so why they were glad to get out.
and also with the S-Shoah Foundation  you tell the story of being on the ship  it was a ship where they had taken thousands of prisoners  the Germans had put thousands of prisoners on these ships.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 23 >> Bill Benson: So the Russians were relatively decent to you?
It all depended how the demand for - for -- for prisoners was in the camp.
And in the stables  helping us  were Russians  Russian prisoners of war.
We had to carry metal rods that were very long  I remember  and they were a part -- I would say at least 20 -- 25 prisoners to one rod -- to wa -- thats how long they were.
121 And the German prisoner  I took him then to th e city hall  where they had an officer that was interrogating prisoners.
They showed us the courtyard where the prisoners were torn apart by dogs and they showed us the barracks.
Th ey laid down their arms a nd went over to the Germans as prisoners of war.
And one remarkable th ing over there was that when \ Antreten \  when everybody lines up and some guys came--t hey were wearing German uniforms  but they were prisoners.
And there were so many  about eight different trains  all with prisoners from all over Germany.
Trains came and went all the time  not only with prisoners  but also soldiers.
The 79 Japanese Army was still there  most of them were prisoners.
Before coming to this man  the governor  we make on our hands numbers like we were prisoners of Auschwitz or other places.
So they had the servi ce; and they always told to the prisoners  in their language  \ Out of the wagons  and you should go left.
In Buchenwald  it had had a lot of German political prisoners.
They Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 111 wouldn't take them as prisoners.
They were guards who were prisoners of the United States army.
who were ordinary prisoners  when they talk about roll call  they never talk about short roll calls.
So the conversation about what was happening I got after I left the crematorium and was back on the road and talked to some of the prisoners about it.
Now  most of Mauthausen  by the way  most of the people were considered political prisoners .And by the way  they had people from all over the world.
So they marched us off to several camps in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 an area where the clothing and belongings that came out of the many  many trains and the cloth ing and belongings that came out of the crematoriums were brought here for storage and for the women  the prisoners  to work with  to separate and to categorize and to get ready for shipment back to Germany.
We were about ten people in the cell and on the way to the showers one day in 14 the basement we met Jews that were prisoners of that prison there  political prison - Jews were considered - as Jews they were not political.
I always think that in this respect we were favored  if you compare us USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 57with the prisoners in Russian camps.
The able bodied prisoners in Auschwitz were evacuated to deep into the German Reich and they were marched.
And I was at least one of those  and I use to interrogate prisoners who were of interest.
But since this was already so late  they took me there and two of the prisoners amongst us  the Jewish group  were doctors.
I think it was before the SS decided to put the regime to work in the war industry and they took the ability in Austria  the industry facility  needed prisoners.
And  and this uh place  we could talk a little more free with other prisoners.
What did you say and what did the Je wish prisoners say to you?
And they got off the cattle cars and they saw these Polish Jews who were inmates or prisoners  I dont know what to call them with the unifo rms  with the stripes.
They knew  because we were reported by the SS to the local police  th ere are two escaped prisoners.
No  no  they were they were wi I would get [indecipherable] we brought we brought 4 000 German prisoners in to live in the camp after all the other people left.
So when they sent they brought me guard brought me on second floor  and put me in some opened some door  and there were three or four prisoners  and they were criminals  you know  for crimes  various crimes.
Were there peop -- were the peopl e who you worked with  was it all Jews  were there political prisoners in th -- Where?
But  at some point  did you see Yes  at some point in Egypt   when I saw maybe it wasnt he was a prisoner of war  because me a lot of Germans were taken prisoners  you know  in the Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 143 Allemagne campa Alleman Allema gne campaign  and Montgomery was fighting  you know  in Africa.
So from Plaszow  after five days  we were sent to the salt mines in Wieliczka  but th ey did not put us to work but it was the worst camp  I think because everything was dirt  you know from the salt and from the prisoners who worked there  never made it more than four to six weeks  they told us.
So the ge-ge --the German wor -- prisoners did have to do th at  thank God of that.
Did any of the prisoners  either the ones that spoke to you or the ones that you just observed  did any of them stand out in your mind?
And my sisters to this day tell me  and I know it for a fact  I never would 3 Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners.
Do you remember men prisoners coming into the camp and working?
A pretty high ransom if I remember  I dont remember the exact amount–I know we couldnt pay it as a family  but the town got together and they paid a ransom and all the prisoners got free.
And they took the guards with the SS and the Hungarians as prisoners.
And apparently  there was a prisoner of war camp nearby  and they wanted to bring these prisoners over to talk to me  the Germans.
Now  at that time they had a lot of prisoners from Hungary especially.
They were killed by German inmates who were in charge there  as kapos  and so on.
So they took us to a place  a concentration camp  a subcamp of Auschwitz.
But over here on this you know  the northern part  the idea was that the British didn't know that they there were concentration camp prisoners on these ships and since Germany was always going to try to  to win the war  they were still trying to  to push  push troops up north through Denmark  etceteras  so they figured there are ships going this troops whatever  so they just bombed the ships.
But in the meantime the Germans sent in more prisoners from Terezin to day to be at th at familial camp to fill it up and then what we didnt know was the invasion of Europe  you know in 1944 when British and went to Dunkirk and the Canadians and so on  they started invading Europe.
And that became a big story because the first time that a brigade had taken prisoners and it was a big item in the newspapers and pictures and my cousins  my uncle and I have two cousins there who were children of my uncle and my aunt in Jerusalem.
We have some prisoners who escape from Auschwitz  and Had you met any of the prisoners who escaped?
And the SS  who after 42 day s of service went for 18 days on furloughs  and dragged every time anything they could get and ordered in the 8 Other accounts indicate that Barry was used by SS Oberscharfuhrer Paul Groth to attack the prisoners.
And we marching and some of the older prisoners  uh  older German guards  as we were marching we had  there was a wagon always behind to pick up the bodies.
I dont even know what there th and when that and prisoners of war  they brought that.
But now  the prisoners from the first barracks were following me and my men.
Did anybody come up to you  of these of the prisoners?
And they came in as prisoners  but they were better off.
Suddenly we looked out of the window and they say  I was with a Polish young priest  Polish ex-soldiers in civilian clothes  we were together--Jewish prisoners were there very few--from the whole 35 000 prisoners there in Bergen Belsen  there must have been 200 of us left from all over.
There must have been about twenty to thirty thousand prisoners and I was put in the barracks  but when my brother came home  he was talking about the prison life and the people who are with.
The director of that ca mp    and he was showing the prisoners  they -- they were dressed like -- like prisoners with wood en shoes and so forth.
Did you provide any medical assistance to any of the prisoners?
And actually  we were hit by the Americans but thank God for that because the Germans ran away  you know  and we could kind of -- I mean some of the people got killed because you know when they don't know where to stop.
So he was going there  Wiland   the kappo was going with us to this Polish uh clerks  these Polish prisoners who make the detail  who ma ke the decision where you should work  yes  and he told  look  these all five  I need workers  specialists  they will  uh will take care for my  for my claim which they have some uh .
02:00:17 Uh  we had hung up uh these uh big containers of water and prisoners were clustering around them because they of course didn't have even an abundance of water during the time of captivity.
I remember when they talked about the Malach-Ha-Mawies when we got to talk to some other prisoners.
One suitcase for each person and we would be exchanged for German prisoners.
Every morning they all the prisoners were in mass formation  like six oclock or 5:30 in Interview with Fred Lorber December 2  2011 40the morning  standing out there  you know   by barracks  and they would count them off and make sure that nobody escaped  which was a which was a lot of bull  but they kept this discipline in this thing.
And then they had other buildings where  lik e the prisoners stayed in  inside of that gate.
As uh as a rather neglected but uh byline we told to ferret out war criminals and uh those uh guilty of uh genocide and and so forth and uh the first inklings we got of what really had happened were when we did extract such information from prisoners.
The muse um was supposed to uh  revealed to a would be commission that uh created like activities of prisoners have a uh  could be  could be uh uh exercise right in the museum eh where there was a sort of a like a studio  art studio.
And that is just a -- a big obelisk and -- and names of all the countries that were represented by -- by pro -- prisoners and how many from -- from which country.
When I left those barracks  I went up to the administration building  which was closer to the front of the camp itself  Buchenwald  and then talked to several of the prisoners there and one in particular who had a specimen bowl that we usually use in labs -- glass specimen bowl that was about -- oh  I'd say about ten inches high and about four inches wide.
And then this nurse  and one doctor who was also They were prisoners too?
I tried to do it by groups because  see  in Hamburg I had 800 prisoners.
It had I think  all together a little over 20 000 prisoners.
Well  unfortunately  uh  uh the  the smell was the was most was  was the burning of those bodies and uh  and then it was the people that which had dysentery and it was an awful way to uh  it certainly was  I had to smell  and uh  we had um  we  we watched an  a lot of those people die  and  and they would be  and this happened many were beaten to death just for that alone because  because they could not keep their uh their bowels and  and they had no way of uh of going to  to  to a bathroom  and uh and then they that's the musi c that was playing which was a mockery  uh  in a  in a place where they were killing daily  they had this band of music consisting of uh prisoners that were forced to play music as they marched to work and from work  and bringing back uh bodies uh killed while working because uh  uh  uh they  they were beaten to death.
And  and look it  not only was limited you know to the German pris oners because there were German criminal prisoners.
The column wa s a long column of the prisoners from the camp on the Czech border.
Nazis called it Mexico because when they brought the Russian prisoners there  they didn't have any clothes  so they put blankets on them.
You said you spoke to a couple of the prisoners there in Romanian .
This is wh at they told us [indecipherable] other prisoners  you know  older.
Until we understood what  so we were going ther e and in the middle of the road the Germans were already like this  prisoners  with the tanks with all the machinery and we couldn't walk no more.
So -- so -- so in con -- so tha -- all th-the -- the -- the b -- the manage -- the big shots from the uprise  who were not killed  who were not taken as prisoners   they moved the whole headquarters from the uprise to Krakow.
They had one camp [indecipherable] Denmark for political prisoners  that wasnt too bad  actually  I understand.
04:10:22 Maybe they were treated better than we were   because prisoners of war  that is  but the Germans didn't care very much about the Geneva convention  that they should be treated like human beings.
>> Henry Kahn: Prisoners of war which were kept separate by a stupid little tent.
See  if only one of them had said something -- one of the prisoners -- they would have had some.
And so they get this get those Ukrainians lock in one of the cells  get all these prisoners out.
That was the Air Force's fault  and I said  \ Oh  we heard from your prisoners.
And when  when this mud was put on maybe 50 meters long and about 3 meters high  and they in running they were going and there must be loaded the full cart  all the prisoners loaded their cart  and they were going on this  on this road which were  the purpose of this was that there were gardens  and uh fields  and they make the fields should bring this very fruitful  uh fruitful mud of Elbe yes  they 9 should be more fruitful their gardens and their fields.
Well  as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through  were driven through the town and the treatment of them.
There was no garbage heap  but the package room  where the non-Jewish prisoners re -- would receive packages from home  were opened before they were supplied to th e -- to the owner  and they have taken out all the vitamins.
They selected not only th they asked not only the international Red Cross  but th eir own prisoners of war that they had captured Yes.
One day...it must have been spring of '43 when the leaves were turning green and and uh weather was turning turn turning nice  when two young men and they must have been nineteen or twenty  young prisoners  escaped.
And opposite of the prisoners workers  the up building off the camp were many private firms which were contracted by the SS  and these private firms had so-called civil workers. (
So some of the prisoners of war that signed the agreement that they would like to work for the you know   as civilians  they were there.
Officially  I was the supervisor of these two pastors who visited the prisoners.
The reason I'm asking you this is because I und erstood that in certain camps  if the Germans were still there when they were liberated  a lot of the prisoners retaliated.
I says  as of right now  you are all prisoners of war.
Had a prisoner  this we were about we were in Germany at the time.
There were trenches  long trenches  and I saw that nurses  nurses  you could only  whether they were German or  or even prisoners  had white uniforms  with a nice hood  and a red cross on it.
Seems like it was num -- number -- barrack number nine  and the -- the politic al prisoners that were there were the -- they were the -- whats 17 the right word for that  they were the -- they were in command of the barracks.
This is a picture of a man  one of the prisoners  holding up a specimen bottle that has three strips of tattoo  the skin that was cut off the bodies of the prisoners that gave their life for that practically.
I was told later on they were hoping to exchange us for German war prisoners.
Did you see the ghe -- the Warsaw ghetto burning  did you hear -- Oh yes  absolutely -- -- the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto? --
Then there was another lower level down around on the quarry level and  uh  there's now a third graveyard up on the top where the  uh  the old barracks used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of the camp.
And they came and arrested me and put me in jail; in ghetto.
And they were just looking at the prisoners and just shake their hands  so there must have been Jewish prisoners too.
And we had a couple guys from our place  it was a couple guards in our place that had the job in courtroom  you know  stood behind the prisoners.
So the Germans were -- SE: In 1944 we got freed.
So it was a s -- fantastic movement in the -- in the -- in the town  to -- to -- to escape  not -- not only the -- not prisoners  but normal civilians.
And not one of the prisoners is going to stay alive.
And there I heard for the first time  one of the first prisoners who told me about it told me abou t the gassing in the vans.
And they shipped out many prisoners from the hospital to a hospital in Bad Ischl  which was a nearby town and they took over an SS hospital there already  a military hospital.
But after  what Hitler did to the I call it to the prisoners  and not many prisoners run away to deep Russia  and they told them  look  th-the Germans burn them [indecipherable] they put a a a little h you know  hole  and you put naft and oil and they burn them.
And today there are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there  for the normal amount of prisoners was four thousand  but there were three additional thousand that came to replenish.
And they b ecome prisoners  and -- so I -- I didnt have any problem with that  or -- I dont know if anybody else had  after MacArthur  who most people feel had the right type of occupation in Japan  for Japan.
The Italians applauded the American prisoners that were paraded by the Germans in Rome.
These old-time prisoners were pretty innovative of what they did and where they hid the stuff.
I'm sure there were a lot more interesting people who were also prisoners like Yoe-Thomas and others.
You were stripped of everything you owned  and -- and thrown in with other prisoners.
And the -- we -- you know  we had a chance to practice first hand -- I was going to -- -- with real German prisoners.
The othe r prisoners  some of the prisoners  and Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26  2013 51through  like I say  Ben Sharf  and and Dutch  we found out that the other prisoners say the only way youll ever leave this place is up the pipe  and that was the crematorium chimney there  you know.
And so but the people who were leaving the potatoes or the rutabags knew that she would come and pick them up so they always left some extra  and thats how she cooked the soup for to add it to the prisoners  because the guy said the kapo said  well  she wants us to work.
And the third time he still went down the line just looking at prisoners which he sort of wanted to kill and passed me agai n. Three times I was to be taken to be shot to death  and all three times I was passed by.
But we were strong and we were able to survive it  although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit  by other prisoners - they had to do this  the SS didn't do this  just counted and stood by - but my guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes.
There were French resistance prisoners  from the French resistance who were made to...they were being made to walk all day long in leg chains and and there were random hangings.
By comparison  when the prisoners were moved from Luxembourg to Nuremberg  they were put into a Franconian state prison  and this is one of the cells in that Franconia state prison  where th ey spent their time all during the course of the Nuremberg trials  both before and during the trials  until they were sentenced to death  or moved to prison in Berlin.
And of course  the guards moved in amo ng the prisoners.
And I had maybe 10 of my prisoners of war prisoners.
They drove me to the prison  prison Pawiak in Warsaw  and then approximately  already ten people from other prisoners  and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single cell in the basement and there was no -- it was only a small bulb.
So Im not sure how you might be able to an swer this if you werent really seeing other men prisoners  but Im interested in the differences between how women and men were treated in Auschwitz.
I would estimate at that time that among the 4 to 6 thousand prisoners there must have been a few hundred Jews  maybe 4 hundred Jews.
There were a few battalions of th of of prisoners  and deserters  and they were given a opportunity to get in the fight of Berlin  and get amnesty for the life I mean  if they if they survive.
Who were most of the prisoners at Gusen  do you remember?
In Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps  all buildings where prisoners  Haftlings  were housed  were known as blocks.
What sort of a reputation did he have with most prisoners  do you remember?
And I shared the same bunkbed with her  there 65 were three -- they were three story high -- stories high  and we had the top bunkbed.
Every day  this was in '44 just before the war ended  they had some American and English prisoners and they would parade them and the Americans would go with the V sign and the Italians applauded.
Over and over again  the other prisoners keep telling me this.
They had no common sense  and they were in fact  I wouldnt be surprised if those were released prisoners  because the Russian I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia  or people that were politically ar rested or other some reason other arrest.
26 Did you get to know some of th ese prisoners better than others?
And after that  they took me back down to the same cell  and shortly after  four other prisoners  they brought Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 69four prisoners.
There were already Polish prisoners there or Jewish prisoners there and first when we came we were put in a barrack or call it...uh...to... to...where...where you...where you live and where you sleep  and that was like made out of a few boards and the wind was blowing in.
Because it because we would also affect the Americans being fi-fighting  and their prisoners  by the Japanese  and they would be severely tortured.
The Nazis realized that the allies were approaching so they were taking some of the prisoners out and making them march towards Germany.
Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer  and they were of different color for different days and again  one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the printing office and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors.
And they e xplained to us that the French Foreign Legion was composed of mainly escaped prisoners  murder ers  killers  thieves that fled their country and found a home in the Fre nch F oreign -- well  they put us on the next train back to Luxembourg.
I have the raw material.ﬂ So that was one of my biggest deeds  in my opinion  what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners. '
There was also a memorial there for the the prisoners who the Germans were holding  who they were marching from Flossenburg to Dachau .
The camp had originally been established for Spanish prisoners and had been emptied after the Spanish Civil War.
When I arrived  I inquired how how the former prisoners were being dealt w ith  and I quickly discovered that Jews had succeeded to be in a special barracks  even though originally  the Americans had decided that prison the people liberated  Poles would go into a barrack and Yugoslavs and Germans  pris inmates  and then they discovered that the Jews didnt want to be with the Poles and didnt want to be with the Yugoslavs  and they simply refused.
And were you allowed to interact with the prisoners at all  or you were strictly guarding from the outside?
And he found out that there are sh -- pris-prisoners -- concen-concentration camp prisoners on these ships and by eight oclock in the morning  the British got the mes-message that dont bomb these ships because they are innocent survivors of -- of the concentration camps and the British supposedly said  ﬁIts too late.ﬂ And at 2:30 they bombed the ships.
We give it to to to the other haftli ngs  meaning uh the prisoners  and they were very happy.
So the next time the planes made a pass  they just passed and they didn't do anything  so they knew that this is prisoners of war.
Were were there aside from the people who could not move  who were dying  was it still full of prisoners  or of people  or had they left?
I knew hundreds of Germans -- civilians and prisoners of war.
>> Bill Benson: You were sent to Auschwitz in 1944  as you just described.
But there were others  so I'm now reading about of course and since then have found out  that were far worse than Buchenwald  insofar as the uh  terrible deaths were being uh inflicted upon the prisoners.
So thats really what the war crimes trials were all about  you know  just actually it was just a ha it was really a farce when you really think about it  because they just wanted to get rid of these people that were guards there  of the of the inmates  th-the pri the prisoners.
Because there was a factory th ere  they would try to get the prisoners who were young enough on one side and they would go to work in the factory.
Our job is to get home  not tra try not to be taken prisoners of war  but get home  because we will be needed.
And we came to this little camp in Colmar wh ich was a small camp  also prisoners.
If you visit the exhibit upstairs  you will see an exhibit of these huge boulders that the prisoners were forced to carry in that camp where they would very often be tripped.
Lot of prisoners we nt  with this description  that  uh  his or hers return  is uh  is uh  not unwelcome.
Matter of fact  in my office I had a big map of Europe and one of the prisoners  who also was a clerk in one of the -- oh  yeah.
Well  what I know now  is that we were taken to Auschwitz.
And then somebody will usually say  \ Well  we are in Auschwitz.
The prisoners were in the bunks--as many as they could get in them  all laying across the bunks.
In the three years that I interrogated people  I never touched a German prisoner  even when I interrogated a concentration camp guard that you wanted to rip apart with your hands  we never touched them  and I don't think any of the other interrogators ever touched German prisoners.
Because they was afraid that there were most of the prisoners are sick.
Was very near to his place  and he -- they got in some bread to the prisoners ther e. So he -- thats how he started  and later on all the couriers came to him and we met there.
It says theres this is what it says  in October 1944  youre sent with six other prisoners to Ora   to act as an interpreter.
They were sitting hand in hand and crying  and then I heard their story from the other prisoners.
You know  they were Russian prisoners and they shoot the heck out of them.
The eeriness became more intense for me when I juxtaposed this silence of the grave against my recollections of the teeming scores of thousands of prisoners  who at any time between 1942 and 1945  occupied these grounds  not to mention the millions who never set foot inside the barbed wire confines but walked  or were trucked  on the nearby road from the railroad ramp to the gas chambers.
Uh at what point did you start encountering your first prisoners of uh  that is concentration camp victims and indeed your first camp?
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo March 1  2010 19 You know  you find some prisoners of war.
He was taken to a prisoners camp in an officers prisoner of war camp.
Then I came to this reception room   office  the SS men  and some prisoners and they took me there and they asked me for th e card and then they asked me wherefore you have this black uh  this black spots.
Then they moved on b ack basically  we go to the we would see again a again also we came across a number in Bavaria of allied prisoners  British  who were out of ba sent to work on farm s  huh.
People were very upset with her and it seems that she was killed by prisoners at liberation.
who were prisoners themselves  to go to the site of the mass graves Yes.
I worked there from April of 1944 until November when the size of the crew operating the fa cility was drastically reduced and the surplus sent back to Camp D. Birkenau was no longer the destination of incoming transports nor of prisoners transferred from other camps.
Whatever happens with them  th ey just got them and that's it  as prisoners.
We found out that he was alive  so this was a -- th -- actually the Russians kept him two years after the war was over as a prisoner  and they accused him of being a German  so they kept him with the German prisoners.
When the British came in  they took some of the SS men who didn't manage to escape and put them in a barrack and they surrounded them.
That's where Jews were forced to -- Jews and other prisoners were forced to carry these boulders  46 pounds  up a ramp in a quarry  and very often were tripped so they would fall back into the quarry.
Then   when they came  they unloaded this -- some of the prisoners -- other prisoners stripped them.
I don't know how they got attached to them  I mean  but they let them have the French the German prisoners  so Did you see the crematoria at Buchenwald?
But at that moment when I was there  the Russian soldiers were there  prisoner  also sneaked out and we went to the forest.
They came went into they were then taken prisoners of war or they just retreated?
42 Now  do you remember your reactions toward some of the prisoners who were treated better?
They looked like prisoners with an L on the back  the striped clothes with on the back.
And I said to sar -- to my sister  I says -- and then I even slept with her in the same bed because I was afraid some of these Russian prisoners were going to  you know  rape her or do something.
What information did your fat My father was telling me how they   he participated in the death march so there were hundreds of prisoners organized in groups and they were  with guards  they were chased by foot from Auschwitz camp to many  ma ny miles along the streets and roads to the railroad station which had connection with Austria.

Those who had striped clotheses  there was -- there were under -- underpants  not very -- very sexy ones  but there were underpants  and some ki nd of an undershirt  and the others  the Jewish prisoners  who wore dresses  or whatever  they -- they were allowed to -- to wear an -- sweaters  under the dress.
What about the rest of the prisoners there  who were they?
So --  but I would say anybody who survived for a long time was trusted  and thats how  for instance  we could arranged our escape from the camp because we knew all the prisoners and we trusted them and when they trusted us  and we more or less knew who the informers were.

You know  they couldn't communicate with us any different way  so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were  they had time out in the morning to make their beds and to empty their sinks and so you know they kept us in the cells  but when they were  when the regular prisoners were in their cells during the day  then they kept us  we could go out in the hallways.

The living conditions in the ghetto were a hundred times better than the prisoners of war.

They sent it political prisoners at that time and he fit that bill.
There were  like one of the prisoners in Auschwitz I camp who did the injections you know killing  was a Polish prisoner who did this.
We use to march--go by everyday a prisoner of war camp or Russian prisoners were there.
Captain von Brum we started to utilize these people  and the first time that they showed they were attacked by the prisoners and therefore again we had to take some very positive action and explain to these people that they were there to help us to help them.
But of course  you know the ar my came in  cleared  and there were people who knew how to orga nize things  who had the So that meant the these were the last prisoners who didnt make it  who were killed in that camp?
And here  uh  uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men would normally be detailed to go into the camps  unchain the people who were chained and so on  and release the prisoners.
So during this small distance they still had a chance to wound few prisoners with their bayonet.
I have his picture with his wife and his son  that had been invited to come back to Weimar as one of the former prisoners.
SWB: When you came into the camp  can you tell me roughly how many Americans there were and then how many prisoners there were I mean  just a sense of the  of what it was like.
Dont forget  it was 43  so the tide of the war had already turned against Germany  and it Interview with Gert Silver March 30  2006 31didnt take very long for fellow prisoners to tell us where we were  and I asked what [indecipherable] wheres my mother  wheres my si ster.
So the German guards  the SS guards always stood far enough away so they wouldn't get hit  but they di dn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be safe from the blasting  so many people were killed.
And I had to face the wall  and stood there for a long time  and out of the cells I heard all voices  and they said  ﬁWhat is the news from the outside world  what is the news from the outside world?ﬂ But I didnt know if these were Gestapo guys who wanted to check  so I -- I feel always guilty  because if they were real prisoners  I thought I should have told  but I didnt want to take the chance.
And it was three weeks  as long the war lasted  I was a soldier  till they caught me  and  as a prisoner of war  and all the Jewish prisoners of wa--all the prisoners of war  they sent to Ger many  to work there.
So  some of the prisoners that you had guarded were being hung as you were leaving?
Well  the -- when -- when we evacuated they gi ve it to -- to the Germans -- to the Germans prisoners  they give it  the -- the weapons to -- to -- they -- they -- they were German.
So the Russians -- the Russian prisoners had more guts  more strength.
I remember one gave me a little piece of wood and he had written down  when will the French prisoners of war be liberated?
I mean  how -- did your -- di d the treatment of -- of -- They used -- they used to bring food once a day through the other Jews that was prisoners in the camp.
I know that some prisoners did know people who were in the kitchen  I -- I didnt.
Maybe a lot of Germans  well they didnt like to do it either  but they had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner  you know?
After they build up that concentration camp  I believe the first prisoners come from Czechoslovakia.
I said Im a French citizen and we are all prisoners here and we cant do anything and we are not against you at all.
And what about but the life in ot her words  there were no other violent events that you can The viol now  there were such a there were many Soviet prisoners  soldiers  masses  in Kretinga.
I guess Mauthausen and some of them were much larger and had a lot more  you know  prisoners than we did  but at that time we had no idea of that  no.
And having the political prisoners meant it would be better in some way  was that true?
And he told us that he has no power to do anything  but he will leave our cell door open-- unlocked--as a symbol that we are not really prisoners.
I think I need– Well  the other thing thats been so difficult w ith legal services has been the restrictions that Congress has placed on us in more recent years  which prevent us from filing Class Actions or challenging Welfare Reforms  accepting attorney f ees  not being able to represent prisoners.
They threw a can of bloodwurst-- meat into the masses thousands of people got killed because amongst them was main ly the Russian prisoners who were a little stronger than us.
One of the things that stands out in my mind is uh Russian prisoners of war that were driven through the town and they were in just terrible condition  uh without shoes  without proper clothing  hungry  looking dilapidated and drawn and went begging  of course  for food and water and if somebody attempted to give them...or couldn't hand it to them  throw toward them  uh anything  any food and if they caught it or even if they didn't  the Germans beat them and even shot several people if they lunged toward the crowd to receive some food  they shot them  and that was I think the first awareness of the brutality of those people.
A. We got incorporated into the camp as prisoners of the camp.
I was al so afraid that if I go there and there are some prisoners because they said they are from Studtkoff.
Some kapos who were ca lled Oberkapo  you know  had even thousands of prisoners under them  you know.
But at the time they told us to dismount  we didn't know what we were going to run into  and you never do  but we were able to cap -- to relieve the -- liberate these British flyers  and turn the German prisoners we had over to them  and they took care of it  and -- What happened as your division approached Ma uthausen  or how many +?
Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19  1993 39 Oh yeah  before we before we yeah  he the th-the commanding officer told us that were going to liquidate the camp next da y. The next day came  they asked all those prisoners w ho cannot walk will go by tr uck  about a hundred of them  moved out  they marched them straight to the slaughterhouse  and we while we were standing in role call  they were we could hear the machine guns going that killed them all.
There was only in one part of the room there was a pile of straw and next to it were few blankets and in the night the straw was spread over the whole floor of the room and we had to lie there  one next to another in many rows  and we had the blankets one blanket maybe for three prisoners.
When they brought me from that political prison from Budapest to Auschwitz they gave me a special number  193229  William Loew 5 without any prefixes and that was a number that was assigned basically to all those   all people  prisoners that need to be preserved for a later time to extract certain information.
There were some prisoners who were in good shape not good shape  but they were better shape.
And so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned  became one of them  especially picked out bully types  came by and he said how come youre only filling the wheelbarrow half way because you get mo re productive if you fill it fully so one of the prisoners explained that we cant because we cant push it up the plank that way.
Well this a this is I dont know exactly  but it was at least one year  or something  because later they they declare amnesty  if you remember  it was amnesty for prisoners.
They didnt take --they had connections in the camp but they were prisoners  you know what I mean?
Once we went to the camp  we were just again an ordinary prisoner  except that we were already old prisoners.
That was a camp for -- I don't know -- political prisoners or criminals.
They could have done it there.ﬂ Some people said  \ No  they couldn't done it there.ﬂ Because there was...I don't know  there was a thousand  80 000  God knows how many thousand of...of prisoners were in Dachau.
Did they seem like criminal -- Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians  they open the jails you know  the [indecipherable] they were vicious guys  killers.
So that was another job for him to do  and I went in there  and I was together with French prisoners there.
So some of the Jews  in great numbers  escaped to Russia and stayed throughout the war.
Some of them were beaten up by others  by the prisoners.
And and then they captured about hundred 200 Germans  prisoners w ho surrendered to the from the from another part of the town.
Maybe a lot of Germans  well they didnt like to do it either  but they had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner  you know?
They start taking out people they had more room to release the prisoners.
And I think one case I heard that a SS tried to make contact with the prisoners   that he was a good guy  that they should say so in case the Americans come.
Did any of the prisoners though  that they had mistreated  stay around to give testimony  or were they gone?
And this is something we found out in the hospital when the post was done on some of these prisoners that we even received back from our own men that were captured only for two and a half months.
And one such train was a prison train  with -- guarded by soldiers  with -- with bars in the little windows  and right away the rumors spread that this train was a prison train for the followers of General Vlasov  and General Vlasov was a -- a traitor to the war effort because he -- even though he was originally a very heroic general  he surrendered to Germans and he promised them to fight on th eir side  along -- and he recruited lot of former prisoners of war  maybe mostly Ukra inians.
The non-Jews were allowed to get parcels  and the German prisoners for sure.
Had a prisoner  this we were about we were in Germany at the time.
Were all of the prisoners fo reign nationals in this group?
And where were the other people from besides Auschwitz and - Mostly from Poland  they're mostly Polish people.

And they kept the market at as a prisoners war camp.
We had like two women from the prisoners that were like inside administering the camp  from inside.
80 Canada commando (German); term used to refer to commando of prisoners assigned to work in the camps warehouse of looted goods.
But  lucky for me there were again strong people in the car particularly there were a lot of uh German prisoners uh from .
Uh  I still didn't know that they were prison  Jewish prisoners.
So  th-the first months  thats -- that was the first very  very disorienting -- What was the relationship between th-the prisoners?
And on occasions he would snatch prisoners out from the upper bunk.
I read in this other survivors memoir that in the town there were depa rtment stores  and that some of the prisoners -- the women from Salz wedel  from the camp  were going into the town.
First of all  the more they were interrogate d  the more important they were  because if -- if you had a lot of interrogations  in the eyes of the other prisoners  the enemy considered you a decision maker  you were obviously one of the to p men.
But you know  Powell never made it home  you know what happened to the -- to the -- to the Soviet prisoners.
We had a feeling unlike the prisoners who were sent by Stalin to Siberia  who had no hopes that Stalinism would ever end  we had a great hope that the war will end and Nazi Germany will be defeated and we had a feeling that the others  our friends  people fight for us.
But my understanding was that at the time we got there there were about 17 000 prisoners in the camp and that they were dyi ng at the rate of about 300 a day.
Every Sunday we used to get a loaf of bread  maybe because they gave it to the French prisoners they probably got it also from the they got food.
The number didn't make any difference because the p olitical prisoners had numbers also.
We had to come to the main road and on the main road as we were maybe some 50 or 40 yards away  there were always roving patrols would check  you know  the SS and the prisoners who worked outside the big chain of guards and as we were approaching this road on the bicycle was an SS man  a Sergeant SS man on the bicycle and he was looking in our direction  and he was unable to make up his mind whether to stop and check us out or whether to go on.
Now  in order to have again access to all those people  they surrounded first old age homes  nursing homes  hospitals  some orphanages  or whatever  you know  they got children in  and also prisoners.
So a lot of the n ew prisoners of Mauthausen were Hungarian.
And when I ask about interesting prisoners  he said  well ba you better talk to I have the name now  but I dont remember just now what the name is.
And he said -- he didnt even lift his eyes to mine  he went on writing  and he said  there now in that position  ﬁDo you have -- could you -- do you think you -- next time you come you have some more bread  or anyt hing to eat?ﬂ And I -- I went speechless  and he said  ﬁYou know  I have many prisoners here who dont have relatives.ﬂ That was Oberscharfuhrer Knuth.
Administration building  and barracks and then in the middle  see and the ones that we had built  there was  we had masonry walls and there was a section where the masonry were held in front with barbed wire  and it was loaded with electricity and I remember one guard  obviously didn't like one of the prisoners  took his head  we wore square hats  threw it away to the fence  or in the fence   go and pick it up and the prisoner refused.
They were French  they were Belgians  they Were you slave labor  or were you treated as prisoners of war?
There were all German -- I m ean the guards -- after the  after the -- You were still with the guards.
We thought it was God's will that on Yom Kippur at least  you know  sending us something  darkness that we can rest  and one of  one of the prisoners started to chanting the -----------------  and honestly  I can hear it  I can hear it now  like  then the other one got into  and then another one.
So I guess  the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners  whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners  I don't know  but I know there were Germans.
So that the Kapos were hated by the prisoners who wore the red triangles.
But it was basically when I went back in 95 that I heard some of the stories of the extraordinary stories of the prisoners.
And I think I remember by the end I was there they brought twelve thousand Russian war prisoners to Auschwitz and as war prisoners  it was winter time  December  they was twenty four hours naked and a very cold night and snow even.
laughs) They were all prisoners and they had some kind of work to do.
Within days of -- I mean  I -- we were the last of the prisoners to Auschwitz.
So  this is the only one who really was demoted  and uh later on and he spent uh time in  in bunker  but he was such an ugly uh fellow anyway  you know  he was such a  he  such a killer  that it really work for a good for a lot of prisoners.
And then we were flirting with the Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 59British prisoners and sending and receiving letters and then there were some German women who were corresponding with the [indecipherable] so we oh  we did them favors too  and all this and well  anyhow Did you realize how dangerous that was?
22ﬂ ﬁYou interpreter.ﬂ I dont know how he got that German word  I knew what it was  but ﬁYou dolmetscher.ﬂ When new prisoners came  I would get up on that barrel and I would shout  ﬁHis Excellency  Commander so and so says this and says that and says that.
Children of...probably of parents that once were from Galicia and lived in Vienna and the children are born there and they were prisoners there.
Uh  what there were among the other prisoners were some uh criminals with all kinds of records.
The criminals also had black and I think that the political prisoners did keep a lot together.
And I had with me what I could put on a baggage carrier.
We were in Siberia on the Mongolian border in the Tigress in the forest as prisoners.
You can find escapees from -- prprisoners  Russian prisoners  [indecipherable] you know  they went in in the woods.
In addition to that they also did a lot of shooting of Polish political prisoners in the ghetto in our camp and we had to burn the corpses.
We found out later they were kapos and the y were other prisoners except they had to ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 do this job.
So at one point when the allies were pushing the Germans back to Germany -- actually  at one point the Germans put the Iron Guard inmates on a train bound for Germany where they were going to send them to a camp.
He told my grandfather that the political prisoners were let out to make room for more Jews because the Nazis were going to burn the ghetto soon.
No  we werent prisoners  I dont know how to distinguish them to the to the Refugees?
You know  maybe 10  20 prisoners washed in the same water.
So you know  so the second selection  it was more cynical  because with the second selection  plenty of -- of Polish prisoners arrived  Polish Jews from Polish ghettos  and they knew that -- the food was so bad that they all remained small  very small.
We are not dressed in any uh  uh  uh uniform  uni  prisoner's uniform at that time because there were none.
It was when he might have been in the first group  you know  in the the there were close to 4 000 prisoners.
Were any of the men to your knowledge flirtatious at all with the prisoners?
I had my own bunk  and there was one above me and there were five or six bunks.
From Friday till Monday noon  about four thousand prisoners from those columns was shot and I was...that last da y I was ready to lay down and OK...shoot me because  you know  it was impossible  almost im possible.
And we had to give this to somehow let the English prisoners of war know.
We found out later on the next days because the pallbearers told us  you know  there were prisoners who had to remove the bodies and apparently  600 Russian prisoners.
And the tunne l was being built by prisoners of pronco (ph.)
We had access to the piles of clothi ng that they wanted... You know  when we got there  they said take off everything you have on and go pick somethi ng that fits you - not from the prisoners but from the Jewish property.
So  we were taken as prisoners of war to the headquarters of the Am ericans.
A lot of the prisoners - I tell you about that - too weak.
There was so much turmoil then and there was so many ethnic groups  prisoners and all.
But I do know that they were in touch with other Polish prisoners  but  of course  we never were aware of really  of what was going on.
The prisoners -- the Russian Army did not fight very much.
The Germans were just walking passed like this with 46 their hands on their heads  prisoners.
So we we were marching day an d night without food or water and some of the prisoners co collapsed.
You know  we had 10 000 prisoners there at Fort Dupont and when we were on night duty  we worked from seven pm to seven am  12 hours.
So  about  as I say  about 15% most  they went and were mixed up w ith other prisoners.
He looked in my eye and passed me up and looked in somebody elses eyes and you know anyway  he selected ten at that time  ten prisoners.
When we saw the first time prisoners   the women prisoners there.
They were really the fortunate ones  that when that ship came back  theyd bring these prisoners back  the German prisoners back.
Actually we came up to it  and it had already been liberated and the American prisoners of war were coming out of it  and of course we immediately  we'd give them anything we had.
They put their guns in a big pile and they'd hand these prisoners to the Frenchmen  you know  and the French took over and especially SSS guys.
Q. When you were working or had your appells in your barracks were you mixed with other prisoners or were you with only political prisoners?
So when eventually the train st opped  and again  my father looked out that small window on the top of the cattle car  he announced to everyone that he sees barracks  and he sees prisoners in striped uniforms  and he sees barbed wires  but lots of barracks.
So  the other prisoners kind of liked me  I was the youngest and one cleaned me up and cleaned my uniform so that nobody would get mad at me and so on.
So and this guy tell me that this operator prisoners hes the best surgeon in in Prague   capital of Czechoslovakia ; a professor of the university  and professional its a good surgeon.
No  anyhow  we had those uniforms  and when the uniforms -- when the influx of prisoners -- of newcomers  was so big that the Russian uniforms wouldnt last  then they introduced civilian clotheses of people who brought their stuff.
She  during the time of her husband  when he was commandant  used to report prisoners because they ogled her.
Yes  the prisoners had to do most of the work  but it was German supervision.
But the -- we were quite good with our prisoners because most of the ones that we took were old -- old -- old German army.
And you knew that they got capture d alive  and the next day youre on the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 108 attack -- we -- we Americans are on the attack  and we overrun the Chinese position  and you find the guys they were taken prisoners the day before shot in the head  their hands bound behind them.
And all these prisoners were trying to get to them and kill them.
At that time we did not know what was happening to them  but they were chased through certain 01:15:30 sections of town into the forest  a place called Rumbola and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large graves  mass graves  and when the people got there they were told to undress  put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile  clothing in another pile  driven to the edges of this mass grave  and machine-gunned.
I remember when others were given to rest  we turned the seams of our prisoners striped clothes from inside out  and squash ed as many lice as we could between our fingernails.
This is -- he was from the Red Cross  and he was a prince from Sweden  and his name was Bernadot  and he used to excha nge prisoners of war for pr -- for us  and they used to give one of us for a hundred prisoners of war  Germans.
Nu  I cannot do these things what its are war prisoners  what he knows how to make  nu  ...to blow up the road...road or...uh...what he was doing.
And th e guinea pigs were the prisoners  and they were dying right and left.
After it was first finished  it was quieted down  some of the prisoners started to walk around as  you know  walked around to see whats happening.
Were there barracks  where did they stay  that kind of thing?
That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training.
And I wasn't too long  I don't remember how many  but there were three beds  three beds  three beds  one the other and I learned eventually that you could buy things in the canteen if you had money and I learned that when one says  do you have any money  do you have any money  the other prisoners.
So there were  you know  there were many prisoners - and there were many informers among the prisoners  and there were not only German informers there were Polish informers.
They saved about 300 000 people that they wouldn't be taken prisoners by the Germans.
And there were a whole bunch of  there was a large room with the big windows on eac h side and these were Jewish women who were evidently in charge of preparing the prisoners.
Plus two additional guys that they told us they would be transferred to camp wh ere they have additional Jewish prisoners.
Now  whether we were told they were Russians  I have no recollection o-of the I wouldnt know Russian probably  well if I you kn ow  I could guess  but when Id heard it basically.
Almost 6 000 German people losted their life -- German prisoners losted their life there.
And so we  we were on this block and on this there block some new prisoners coming to the deportees from Belgium  I remember.
That was very hard for them to swallow as I noticed in the years that follows --these four numb years where I know for now on traveled from one prison to the other in German whenever ther e was Scandinavian prisoners.
And we heard that the Germans are there  and they killed them  and we were sitting here.
The soldiers were promised a treatment under the Hague Convention to be treated like prisoners of war  but the Germans didn't keep their word.
I was given a pause.....a stretch jacket  prisoners trousers and hat you know...laugh..and a a Russian boots  winter I mean winter boots  you know.
Well  when we  when we uh  the doors were opened and we had  we were ordered out  then  as I mentioned earlier  head prisoners called Kapos wh ich were rushing toward us  and start hitting  kicking  beating  and the SS would hit us ----------faster  and stand in line  man in one  and women and small children in the other.
No  maut -- well  as I remember Mauthausen was only where the -- there was an inf -infantry group that was in there  men  and they had the prisoners there.
Then they gave us  over our left chest  describing us  what kind of prisoners we are.
I think I told you last time  for instance  about the role the British prisoners of war played to help to strengthen our morale uh and when they came  they gave us courage.
We work -- you know  because we were in t ouch with Latvian  some of the prisoners were from Riga  and they spoke Latvian.
We were priv ileged prisoners there because we were the only  more or le -- that was mostly migrant workers  and I wa s [indecipherable] in quarantine  and the [indecipherable] was into a big room.
2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU Page 11 population nearby  I think they feared a lot  they thought  now these prisoners that are going to be let loose will come and loot them or rob or take  um  um  your revenge.
I think after the – the revolution  then all the prisoners came back Š that s right.
The order  and this I found out after the war  I didn't know this at the time  the order was to take the groups of prisoners  in group of five hundred  in different tunnels and dynamite the tunnels and bury the prisoners alive in there  so there would be no survivors.
All three daughter  no  yeah  the third  the third  uh the oldest daughter was in his house when the um  when  when the  when they were all arrested there  so the oldest daughter up to that point  she was  she was with him  and she wa s taken to Bergen-Belsen  where she found her mother  and the mother and this daughter came out  at least six months before the war was over  on a changing of prisoners of Germany and Jews.
21 Uh  I do understand  uh  that he was in this column being taken away and that the Germans were killing the prisoners as fast as they could while they were taking them back away from our line.
How would I translate leichen - as a dead  a Kommando that  this was a group of  of  of Jewish prisoners that worked with a wagon.
The rapid escalation to -- to convey to and remove prisoners from the camps.
Uh another thing is  there was even also an opera in camp  for... Not for everybody  but more or less fo r the prominents of the...of the prisoners  and the SS.
And 11  it was the bunker where they killed politisch prisoners or whatever.
The chambers were camouflaged  there were trees growing around  you know  that  that that  most of the buildings were underground  the  all those prisoners  there was areas where uh the gas chamber was uh  uh where the gassing was executed  was done primarily underground  you know  in t hose uh  uh rooms.
Uh what uh uh what also impressed me is that uh the prisoners were not able to shed  to I I think deep down inside they weren't all that sure that a new  that all that was behind them  and so they would still uh walk to that chow line in somewhat of a make-shift formation.
Look  first we got all our civilian clothes  my watch I got  and all we get  and we were still political prisoners so we didn't and then we have a code message with the resistance and so on  and and they give us also food and a special SS man came and brought us in the department of this speed train.
By the way  we had bunks  10 them in a bunk. --
One time one of the prisoners took with him a pair of phylacterites (tfillin).
So  some from the underground came there and interrogated him and they acted like they were Nazis and he said I'm Nazi too  and he showed them the papers.
There were prisoners themselves you know who behaved very  very  very badly.
Then late in August there was a big c hange  and Polish political prisoners took over.
At one time I got caught by Russian - by Russian soldiers and put together with German prisoners of war  into a train.
Did anybody ever ask you how -- any of the prisoners ever -- Yes -- -- ask you why -- how do you know German so well?
Also  ve ry vividly  I remember  prisoners the Russian soldiers and the Polish soldiers they were shot.
And they -- you know  they pretended to be patching roofs and -- and most of -- I mean it was spent trading black market goods   trading lists of prisoners to be smuggled out to the outside.
We came one day later and yet uh not much had changed because we could not  there was no way of evacuating uh the prisoners to a to another place.
And the commander  so to speak  the person in charge of the prisoners  he said  What are you doing here  in German.
And once your name was called you had to go to a different part of the yard and stand  and my name was called too and I had to go  and those prisoners whose names were not called were then taken back to the cells.
What did you f what did when wh at did you think when you first saw the prisoners  when you entered th-the the the camp?
They run away from a stalag  from a regular war prisoners camp  and they was caught by Flossenburg and they was brought to Flossenburg  and after their questioning  they was executed  those two Amer ican pilots  and theyre in a death valley in Flossenburg  they got the ledge  and American flag  and you can read on that ledge -- it is a big ledge  you know  six feet long and about 36 inches wide  about eight inches high  you know?
From there I was I was told that I have ki if I cannot go to work  some of the prisoners told me  if I go on a pa role call  to stand straight  because theyre theyre expecting a couple da ys later  that one of the days theyre expecting a health inspector.
So always when I heard that they saw some trucks from werk A  passing by werk A  you know  with prisoners from werk B  I was always  my father still alive?
And thats when we saw we met we were drive Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 223 going into   and from there were hundreds and hundreds of soldiers  some of them even had guns  because the they were  you know  already prisoners.
Were these prisoners ever in any condition so they could be talked to?
I came over to that place too  with the other prisoners and I see everybodys grabbing handsful  it from the ground its coming up water about oh  about two  three feet  its jumping up  pop-popping up.
