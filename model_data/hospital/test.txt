Because this guy was there lying  he was there for at least a week before they transported him to the military hospital  well  there was a constant flow of friends and officers coming to comfort him and bring him candy and flowers and so on and so on.
But the men were all assigned to work in the camp and the girl s were all assigned to work in the new  you know  recep tion center in the hospital.

The head of this hospital  Major [Sufik ]  a Jew from Kherson.

And he sai d  ﬁYou are not working  so you have to come to Sondrio to work for us.ﬂ And I said  ﬁWell  I have an appointment with my doctor  because I have some problem with my lungs.ﬂ And  ﬁWell  you go and see your doctor and then you come back with us.ﬂ So I went to the doctor  who was one of us  and the doctor meanwhile  had arranged for my friend  Enrico Mullisanno to arri ve  and they said  ﬁIf you have the courage to do it  we would like you to -- to do it  to go back.ﬂ Well  once they arrived back  it was clear that it was a ruse  too.
Actually  it was done  maybe you know the North Shore hospital  the surgery was done here  probably by student  I dont know.
I don't know what happened after that but I found myself in a house that they told this was a hospital.
I dont know  I was in an institution  in that camp -- no  in the state hospital  and we got very little to eat  but I realized it was still mu ch more than they had in Europe.
I was in the hospital many times with him because that he needed help there  the nurses and the sick people.

>> Bill Benson: And you went pretty quickly to a field hospital.
When that baby was born  my husband got a little nurse from  from the nursery to come with me for a week and teach me what to do with the baby.
The hospital where I was  one of them was in California.
He offered me a nurse plus my salary to go back to work  but I just couldnt do it.
And the German doctor   with our Polish helper  go through and see what happened with some sick people or something.
And they just put us all up in one bed in the hospital.
But now he went to a doctor and they find out he has leukemia in the..in the bones.
We received a letter -- a -- a telephone from her  so she said  ﬁCome to Philadelphia  a child was born today  in three days come  you can pick up the child.ﬂ When I got the cel -- telephone  about four days before  my wife went to the doctor  and he made a rabbit test  and he says that she is pregnant -- well  a few days before.
And I try to ask from the Tel Aviv office of the  the hospital that I was working was belonging to Cooper   Cooper is the health insurance company  not company  center about mostly about the clinics and hospitals  not all the hospitals because they are state hospitals  so this is a syndicated hospital  the Cooper .
In 1960  I had the first son  Stephan  who is a doctor in Chicago.
So on the basis of my German certificate  I could enroll in the Swiss University  write a thesis  take and exam and then get a doctor degree from the Swiss University.
When I saw him working  I didn't see him working him in hospital  I saw him working on the ramp when he made a selection.
Were there Later  later  much later  a few years before the war  came another doctor who mostly was doing a bortions  and working with women like a you know  like a A gynecologist?
In the very beginning  there was like a -- not really a hospital  but there was one room  and there was still one doctor in the ghetto  and somehow they obtained some medical supplies.
So I went to my friend  who was working in hospital.
An d then of course the displaces person's camp where  this is the hospital where my mother worked and this is... Is she in this picture?
In fact  I had to take him to the doctor that treated my father  because the day before he jumped on his bed and everything  and I heard him in his room praying  and he said  ﬁPlease God  if I did something wrong  bring my -- my grandf ather back as -- as a baby again.ﬂ So I took him to his doctor  to my father-in-laws docto r  and he told him  Dr. Cohen  that his grandfather was very sick  he could not survive  that  in fact  the last day he brought him a lot of joy by being there.
Hanna: The intent of the doctor was to put her out.
There was a doctor  I remember be ing treated by the doctor.
And a part of  one wing of the hospital was turned over to the Gestapo to maintain the transit camp.
You -- we knew at evening  preparing the whole business that in the morning  barrack so and so  after the transfers were made from the barrack to the hospital compound  and from the barrack to an transport waiting at the railway station  and from that barrack on transfer to I dont know where  and the same barrack receiving so a nd so many from the hospital  and receiving so and so many newcomers  must be 24  yeah?
Well  actually he was a orthopedic surgeon  but for--for--to make a living he--he was a GP because it was more difficult to get working in the hospital  even at that time.
We -- it was taking your life into your own hands if you -- if you even went to the so-called doctor  who happened to be a -- a dentist.
He was a doctor in a little town with his family like nothing happened.
So theres one le -- 54 one died immediately  and the other one  Taloxe n  he survived  but very -- hardly wounded  but then he was taken to hospital first and then to prison  and then he -- he hanged himself.
And I asked him  ﬁHerr Doctor  when was it?ﬂ And he said the -- a date  and he started to describe what happened.
If you dont have a 104  hell send you back here.
He had to go fight for with the Polish army  so  so he some we spoke with somebody  and he could start working in a hospital as nurse and they thought  we thought that he doesn't have to go in the army this way.
And they put him in a hospital and they buried the clothes.
She says to me  \ Oh  your brother-in-law is in the hospital and he is crying  he is crying  where are his daughters  where are his  where is his family?
A. Yes  he came here -- he was invited by -- there was a very famous doctor who invited him and he went to England and he got a heart attack in England and then Doctor Goodmacker  you must have heard he's the one who's making the family tree  and he took him over and he came.
But then a Jewish hospital was opened  and so they transferred me to there.
And very coincident  even the doctor what brought one of the children in the world got in contact with them not long ago; with one of the girls Š shes now 46 years old.
Some of the people were pregnant when they went to DP camps and then they brought them over to our hospital to deliver the babies.

And on Thursday night  May the ninth  I went to the hospital at Antwerpen in a suburb of Antwerpen called Berchen and the same evening they prepared me for the operation of next day  meaning cleaning my body  shaving  that sort of thing.
He was so knowledgeable about medicine that eventually when the hospital opened in our town  he was an accredited practitioner in the hospital without being a doctor.
Yes  in the -- when he had those  you know  papers  he started to work in hospital  and he -- probably he was helped by his cousin and his connections.
I went -- I remember I went to a hospital called the chil -- the -- the Rothschild Hospital.
That's how much more crowded the bunks were on top of each other whereas we only had bunks on the floor.
And they knew that in the hospital theres someth ing organized.
And we came to a town and I was with them and there was a doctor  not a doctor  it was a felcher   a doctor.
So here I am in the German field hospital with all these wounded from the f -- the front was nearby -- wounded  and I was sitting there waiting cause there were m -- there were priori ties  you know  there were people with li -- you know  all kinds of  you know  with -- with si -- major operations and all that  and I was waiting my turn.
The doctor called me who did the autopsy afterward and he said was my father a boxer.
Finally  somebody came to pick me up  and took me to Essex  and I met that Hungarian doctor who send me the six months student visa.
The parents were Po lish uh emigres who came to Czechoslovakia; and while he was in the hospital  they had to go with a transport and leaving the child in the hospital.
He established himself in the west as a doctor  he had -- yes  and he was caught in the west and they ask me what happened before.

But I made it to the Jewish hospital which existed all during the war  thats wa -- the hospital was located at the Iranischestrasse.
I know how to be a nurse and know how to give a needle.
So doctor looked and he said  \ Oh  she needs a hospital right away.ﬂ I had diphtheria.
We also had a  I had a in eh  under my care  the documents that we have stolen in our office  and in the  the uh hospital area  hospital office  especially those in hospital  these were a very uh  uh  very important documents because this was the uh uh list  list of people who were supposed to be all were already executed with original signature of a SS doctor.
He asked that Gugenheim should make an affidav it about what we told him  a nd he asked an affidavit from Sivian  and the name of the other fellow was -- wh om I met in the hospital I didn't give him.
And he was the one who was practicing doctor  but the man went to battle.
But short-lived  you know  so we ended up in the hospital.
In Moscow -- Stalin waited for her and picked her up  I got pictures where Stalin picked her up and they put her in the hospital and she survived [indecipherable].
And so  when she was released   she took all this to the chapel  to the cat -- to the -- to the cattle of -- ch-chapel that was there  on the same floor  or something  in the hospital.
And so anyway then the doctor made more money because he was able to x ray patients and we got a salary and all was well.
So  there existed opportunity as far as for a Jewish doctor  it was much more difficult to obtain a license to be a doctor as compared to Lithuanian Jew.
We literally -- after I got my aunt out of the hospital  we started walking towards somewhere.
I see  and that was your fath ers status as being a doctor?
I remember before ..evacu ation day  we had to be sick about 21 days in order to be declared notcontagious and...uh...I think that day we ; were about 17 days in the hospital and we remember himrunning back and forth trying to doctor all kinds of peoplein charge and what we remember  he signed something or 35 declared us well enough  we were not...we were not contagious anymore.
Look  I had a t -- I had a doctor once  and -- who became very famous  his name was Edgar Berman.
Really  they went out and famous professors fro m universities so this man  this Doctor Volgyessi3 who was the psychiatrist living in the house originally  he had a very large circle of friends  and so he managed to gather the ones that he could and brought them i n. And there were many ot her people  I dont know how they got there.
And we had off on Wednesday afternoons  so whatever time you had -- of course  as a nurse  I was in another city anyway  but then you would contact people connected with the same scouting organization  in thats -- particular spot.
And uh because I have so many lice uh pinches on my skin  the doctor thought that I have scabies.
But my husb and got a heart attack and we got a doctor from Los Angeles  so I was happy [indecipherable] .
They put me in that Lazarette  in that hospital with the German soldiers.
2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page 4 SWB: How did you guys protect yourselves?
The blood used to come out and I had the comparison in the hospital  was clean  and here  come here  dirt and everything.
Because there were special people  special Germans and Ukrainian helpers  that they hit them with -- with -- with some sticks  or with some rubber hoses  and the minute -- and at night  when there wa s the appelle  when they was the roll call  and when they saw somebody ha d a sign on his face  he was taken  they called it to the hospital  to be liquidated.
and a kindred spirit and cultivated  that several of them made him executor of their wills  even though he was a doctor and knew nothing about law.
And it was very small and he ran it by himself with one nurse.
The doctor  and -- and the nun [indecipherable] gave her apartment  we have an apartment and we get [indecipherable] that time was rationing  you know  we got food from the UNRRA or from -- we were already Displaced Person s  DP  no par -- you know what I mean -- Yes. --
You don't have to become a doctor or a doctor without borders.
So it was only after I was released from the hospital  and went outside  and it happened to be the hospital on the edge of town  and I was not going to go into town.
So I think we must have had a nurse with us.
Frank Liebermann: Well  that -- she went with her brother and they learned at that time that there was one doctor for every 100 people.
And then in France we sat up -- set up the hospital in Fran-France  but we didnt have any patients.
So up until that point you hadn t actually been a doctor until you–?
In one case he told me that he found an old  old lady and took her to the hospital and suddenly she got a fit of hysterics... ...anxiety? ...
Jona Dynin   he was d he was doctor of medicine.
My mother and I and some of my friends were still fortunate enough from that place 5 to go to a hospital  which contained 500 people.
And Simon came from Sachsenhausen to Prague to sort of a hospital because he could barely stand on his feet.
And then the Doctor explains that I have to press out the quick silver out of the armorgam press and press it to a piece of cloth.
It was sold to -- you know  sold by Arnold Wolff  a Jew  to Doctor such and such  Arian.
Because if you were pregnant  we had a doctor what he did what he had to do.
And on his work days he Interview with Al Jaffee May 21  2016 83came up as soon as he could  skipping dinne r and just going straight to the hospital.
And while I was in the 48 Berlin and I had an ear infection  they always kept me a little longer in the hospital because they knew that my first love was nursing.
I ran up the block  and I knew a doctor there  so I went there  and -- and that was it.
So at least until I nurse him he's not going to starve.
Ah  I was in the hospital probably a bout three weeks and I am my mouth was all bandaged up.
In the meantime  a German Jewish doctor used to come with the Red Cross band and he was giving me creams.
Henri was our doctor and then -- and they gave me that wonderful engraving 15 over there  later.
Of course Im carrying that scar around Was he a Jewish doctor?
So I...uh...called up her doctor and when I told her what happened  he said to put her into the car and take her straight to the hospital where he'll meet us.
And we have to take out the peoples what was first in the Krankenhaus48  in hospital there.
I -- and I went from town to town until I got a very old doctor and he said   you are so young.
Wh en I was liberated by the Russians  you know that -- you know I was liberated by the Russians?
So your father was the doctor not only for the Jewish community  but for everybody.
Do you think the doctor that is there today is related somehow -- Interview with Eva Desrosiers 40 No. --
My daughter -- other daughter was in the Air Force as a nurse.
In those days  you stayed in the hospital for several days  you know.
I I married when I was a student  and I was a doctor when I had children already.
And then after that  they moved me to a hospital where the Russians were  because they didnt have all the necessary things there in the ghetto.
And the doctor was a German  his name was Leah  but he was  we knew him  we knew him.
Because because the man  the injured man was an officer  they didnt take him to they took him to a a hospital  an army office in the ar in the army  yeah?
Oh  Kathy  my neighbor goes to Dr. so-and-so and this doctor  a woman doctor  told her.
Now the first action that I took which was contrary to a-a military order was that after uh  uh we were in Dachau the first six or eight weeks  the 116th evacuation hospital was ordered out  because actually this was not part of uh military procedure  bringing a military hospital into a civilian situation.
Over there was the USO...American Army...uh...so they took me the baby got 40 fever...40...102 fever  so they took me with the baby to a hospital in Frankfort and they want me the baby to live with them.
So I i-i-I I dont know  I dont think I would want to be the doctor that I should be his patient.
But in the morning  I was still alive  and when the doctor came  he said to her  oh you're still alive  now we are going to treat you.
He got all his exams made over  and he married a nurse.
Before long an ambulance appeared  took me and two other people to the hospital and I was sort of st-stitched up by th e Czechs and they werent too happy about doing this for me  it wa -- they asked where I was from  and they became a little friendlier when I said I was from Latvia  I was not German.
And  believe it or not  a German soldier had a bad car accident right in front of the hospital.
I know the German invited us when we were in Poland and some how they were even so I dont believe that they will do any harm to me  after all  I am a law-abiding person and I am professional.ﬂ So  we were standing there...as soon as the Russian left  in a few more hours  the maid of t he young doctor  there was a friend of my father came running up and said that the doctor told me to tell you there will be a program (you know what is a program) to night and since you are the most prominential in this town  you will be the first one.
A. There was a hospital in the ghetto where they liquidated the hospital.
My father got a job in the pharmacy of the Judenrat...of the Judenrat  was like a Jewish government because in the section of the ghetto there was also a Jewish hospital and they had the pharmacy.
But those of us who couldn't really walk very much  and some people were much sicker than I  we were left behind in the hospital.
My grandchildren of my daughters side -- there -- there is a doctor  as I told you  and Eddie is on the computers  they live in Conne cticut.
You cant eve -- What kind of a nurse did -- were you -- or are you?
He was in charge of the pharmacy of the hospital  and he also was in charge of the distribution of medications for the whole province.
And so he started to build up his own life as a doctor  but two years later  the -- I -- I dont know who made it  how  who decided  but the -- the four best going Hungarian doctor -- doctors from my native town  SzekervarSzekesfehervar   have been ordered to go to the army again.
But he coming every day  every day spent with me   they told me -- they took me away from the hospital for a walk  and the guy  his name is Monek  I dont remember -- his name I have because have a nice medal over there  and he thought you know what  I have one feelings that something -- nothing tasting so good for me  like a apple which bring your wife to me when I was hired.
And then he walked back and talked to the pri to this surgeon to the doctor  and came back and he brought ice pick  jar with some fluid  a scissors and paper bandages  because there was no other bandages during the war  no cotton in Europe because blockade  American and British navy you know  dont get any dont se dont they cannot bring any cotton  or coffee  for example.
50 odd years later I wrote to the hospital  if they have a trace of her and they gave me her address where she is now.
Well when you were in the hospital and you talked to God that first time  was that... Yeah  he didn't have any religion.
He had been orphaned  and went to Israel--or went to Palestine and was adopted by a family  was educated there in Tel Aviv  and he became a doctor  a medical doctor and had practiced and just retired when I first got in contact with him.
She had a nurse and a maid w ho made breakfast and lunch.
I stayed at Fort Dix for quite awhile  until we got our or -- oh yes  I guess I stayed there until we got our orders to go with the 131st evacuation hospital.
So...a doctor came in and he asked me  \ Who is sick?
I had to see her all the time [indecipherable] she let me out from the hospital.
Lets go back to the time when he was -- stil l in the very beginning  he was director of the hospital and the two child ren crawled out from the pits of Paneriai -- Yeah  yeah. --
And one of my school friend's father was a dentist and that's the dentist I visited.
13 TAPE #2 02:00:03 Okay  in the hospital  you tell me that you were befriended by Norwegians particularly Odd Nansen.
But there was a hospital there with British pilots there  and we couldn't get to it because bridges had been blown up  and we had to go across the bridges in the water  and then deploy to take them down.
There was one year that my father was very ill and I had to go back and enable him to go for check-ups and he was in and out of the hospital.
Enough that when the rounds finished  I went to the record  hospital of the patient  I made copies of certain things.
So I worked with them for awhile and unf ortunately the one doctor  the one that bought this place here  he died.
Our child got sick  she had tuberculosis of the lymph nodes  here  lymph  and that was a horrible time  she was in the hospital for six months  and then she needed to be separated still from other people.
And she was in the hospital and when she got well  she stayed on as a -- as a nurses m -- help.
It uh...she was an unusual person with a certain aura about her that I I just knew I had to get to know better  and from that evolved our relationship and I was able to visit her later  still in the hospital.
In the beginning there were books  in the beginning there was a hospital that had been established on ghetto grounds.
The nurse came out; and he say  \ Please give it to David Klebanow.\
So you work for th e memorial hospital for the Holocaust Museum?
She was between Cyla an d Frieda and I think she was fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to get to the hospital  she died right in my fathers arms  I understand.
Of course the fighting was over so being the kind of hospital we were  we didn't keep patients  therefore  we were just waiting until we got orders.
All the doctors had to report to king Vazari and explain their misdeeds during the Czech occupation and sort of show  I'm guessing  let's say what you might call show cause why you should be permitted to continue practice as a doctor  why you should be admitted to 10 be a Hungarian or something of that sort  why you should still have your license or something like that  and I don't know how many doctors from our town got called in  maybe 20 out of 50 or  I don't know  but my father was among them.
That means when there were too many people especially in the uh in the in the hospital  uh then the and the SS came to the conclusion that th ey should uh uh...that th ose who cannot or were were too long in the hospital just should be exterminated  because they they were not worth uh uh to be fed anymore and and they had become  in their opinion  a nuisan ce.

WellŠ maybe it di d but I dont– because I remember that we went with our mother to th e hospital to be– whateverŠ to be checked out and the reason I remember this I love to tell th is story the reason I remember this is because he (Rene) was such a cry-baby when it came to doc tors.
I had -- My girlfriends mother-in-law and she  they were in the hospital together.
Which they did  and just very briefly  before they left  a nurse offered  private nurse will stay with us for the weekend  before Andy goes  because Andy wanted to come home for the weekend.
So they made me  and a friend of mine carry her to a barrack where they called it like a -- they -- hospital thing.

And all of us looked at Raoul  you know  and the doctor start laughing.

Let's leave the fi rst name out because I don't really Š Doctor Kalina Š his wife's name was Helen and they had a baby girl and I lived in an apartment on one of the streets in Koıice with them.
So this -- this doctor -- I ask her whether I still have water on the lung.
And th en the mother and the doctor were sent away because the doctor did not report.
I was very sick  so the...the ...German...the Hung...the police  they brought a doctor and the doctor said that...uh...I'm not going to survive long.
45 Yeah  Gina wasnt there when the raid was in the building  but she was in the hospital.

We stayed in Vienna for  I think  two  one or two weeks  and in an American hospital  that's where the Joint somehow got an American hosp ital for the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm r ooms and it was very pleasant  the only thing we were always warned about  not to ever wander into the Soviet section.

They came in like a surprise  and they surrounded the hospital.
Uh  my parents had a son before I was born  some three years before  w ho was born healthy according to the pediatrics of the time and at the age of ten weeks died  probably from some problem that in this day 2 and age could have been handled uh very simply in any hospital.

So I went down in my jeep and met this doctor who was living in a little cabin in the woods.
I helped them very much  and eventually  when I left Pruzana  the nun and the doctor followed me and I brought them out to Poland.

You knew they were Americans  they were very  very happy to be alive and happy to see a -- an American nurse and -- and thinking of going home  because thats where they were destined for.

We stayed there and for a night and then herr doctor Drochi invited us to his apartment.
But its under control and my doctor says  ﬁIm going to make you see until you die.ﬂ Do you have any particular friends from th at group of 12?
So  he gave immediately  be cause my father gave some money to the doctor  he gave a little money to this guy  he let him in.
So thats the reason I wound up a surge -- as a surgical technician  to go to Korea  in a hospital.
And down in the military government and in the county  I had a lot of contact with Germans.
He was it was at a the at the concentra conc-concentration camp hospital  and died there.
And immediately I was taken off the work site  taken into the camp  report to SS  count one off from this work detail  they'll be coming in one short because he's coming in now and went to the  my clerk  block clerk  barracks clerk  who was a Pole who hated my guts because I always went to hospital and he hated that.

So I approached the hospital and they want to buy my practice.
And he took me to the British army hospital in Hannover  they x-rayed me and I had a concussion  of course  and other than that  I survived it.
We dont have any doctor in the family.ﬂ Did you tell the Ledermans when you wanted to become a doctor?
This hospital  by the way  in the camp was only for desperately ill people and not the people who were suffering from dysentery and dying from dysentery in the blocks in the beginning when we were in Gurs.

So they took her to an ambulance and she ﬂ .
My mother worked also as a nurse and as a matter of fact we had typhoid and she worked in the hospital where the children had typhoid.
And and this is the hospita l where my f my brother was asked by the doctor I dont know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro or Dr. Panopoulous   the earlier doctor  asked my father to sing the ma Im sorry  my brother Mykas   he was known as Mykas partisan songs.

Their schools were made into you know  they were closed by that time.
So  we moved to the larger hospital outside the city well  it still was in the city district  but in the residential area right near the beach  and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived  the Latvian doctors asked my fath er to accompany them to ﬁwelcome the Germansﬂ with roses  et ceter a  and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car  and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about.
But he calls the camp  and the doctor comes and looks me over and he sa ys nah  youre gonna be okay.
I felt such a funny feeling and I knew I was liberated and I was laying on a white sheet and I have to die now  and I felt sorry for myself and I start to cry and I remember the German doctor walked over to me  held my pulse  and he says to me: \ Weinen Sie nicht  weinen Sie nicht  Sie sind nur verhungert\ .
He used to be a doctor before the war  but here he didn't practice doctor.
So this whole scene was made by the doctor in order not to be under suspicion that he is on a high holiday...on a high holiday  Jewish high holiday freeing prisoners not to work.
Oh  yes  since he was  he was a doctor  so he was safe.
And hell be all right there because hi s nephew is a doctor and he will be very safe there.ﬂ And I called him every w eek on the phone.
That is  a krankenschwester was a kranken nurse  you know  was a woman.
So I ask the nurse again who came around to check on me  she says to me  this is Theresienstadt.
The food was not too much; but  uh  we had a nurse in the...in that  uh  barracks  was a part of barracks was the infirmary.
She was teaching and I was so good that I remember I always heard go after Aggi  everybody went after me and suddenly the doctor said she's going to die in heart failure because I was dancing four and five hours a day.
In order to the sister  you have to go through the doctor.
But -- and she was kept in the hospital until Sunday.

They remained he remained a doctor in [indecipherable] doctor  no  he went to Leeds.
But I did have it taken out  and I had to -- in those days you stayed 17 in the hospital for a week  you know  with the sandbags on the -- on the incision.
I was nobody  but the hierarchy went to the Head Nurse  and it was heaven when the Head Nurse was friendly with you  which was not the case in my case.
Actually  Russian became my first language because while I was a 2 -year -old or 3 -year -old kid in Poland  I know my parents -- even though they knew Polish but they talked with each other in Yiddish  a Jewish lang uage .
So I decide to get a job in the hospital  so I worked in the hospital as a house physician.
And I -- I went to my mother and I stayed in the hospital  because I was afraid to be alone.
So  I dont remember where the operation took place  whether it was in the field hospital because my mind went blank.
So does that mean the hospital you were in was not in Birkenau?
In a hospital  they had there a barrack from the prisoners of war  about 20 of us or 24 I don't remember.
So they went and walked from hospital to hospital  and they found him.
And the doctor called...someone called the Belgium doctor  and he examined me and he said  \ In your condition  you'll never be able to work again.ﬂ So...uh...I said  \ Alright  so I'll be going home.ﬂ At the same time  Shave Mission  the American Shave Mission of Belgium was in Brussels  and Eddie Warberg   who was also the President  then and later became President of JDC was also at Shave Mission.
He told me when I came out fro m hospital  after few days  I dont remember  or a week  he told me not to get scared when I will feel bad  because I am coming back because usually repeats  and thats what it was.
Well  we lived in an area that later became part of the ghetto.
And there were a lot of Jewish doctors that had a Jewish hospital.
Then I said I want to go to the bath  the nurse told me that its already the orders from the doctor  I cannot go no place.
And she said -- and she just was so -- s -- she was rea lly very surprised that I could do that  and then go to the hospital.
And I watched when I was in the hospital I watched out of my window was my bunk was next to the window  I watched it.
Like shes worked til five Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 67oclock and eight oclock was I took her to the hospital.
So t he minute I sign in there is a nurse and another doctor  and he was telling me : What a re you doing here?
On my way out from the hospital and I was running away  I had people coming to the Wache  to the check points  you know to the guards at the entrance  people asking for Leokadia Bukowska.
Its of my mother  who is wearing the Jewish star  and myself; I was about four and a half  walking in the streets in 1942 in July  visiting my aunt  my mothers sister-in-law  who just gave birth to twins in the hospital.
And she explained  you have to go to the hospital in two days.
My husband had been wanting to be a doctor and couldn't do it  you had to take second choice.
But the doctor  I told him for Im putting the key because he got a little hole in the right side in the lung.
And th e only way I survived was I finally cut off some toes in order to get to a hospital.
71 So just give me the chronology  do you -- you got sick and then were you taken out of the concentration camp to a separate hospital?
And my mother told me my dad was in the hospital.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 3 nurse ry schoo l. George is circled.
and took me to a hospital  and I spent there for two weeks in a hospital.
So next day I went to the hospital  and and we going to the lowest floor.
And that same doctor  he arranged th at her body was carried out and he really did a great deal.
I -- after I picked myself up from the ground  I was pr-pressing my arm against the wound  and lo and behold  among those in the forest was the French doctor.
I remember my -- my girlfriend that time  she went to -- to the -- to that Tatra mountains  there was sanitoriums  and y eah  and she married a very well-to-do doctor.
The next day  I don't know if the doctor was s eeing him or not.
They spoke...they didn't speak French  and I stayed there...you know  those were the days they kept you in the hospital for two weeks  and that's when D-Day had happened and the Allied troops came into Brussels in September and my father managed to get himsel f in jail  in a in a prison  Belgium prison  because...I don't know how he managed it but he sa id he used to go to help the the underground to fight.
According to the plan  my father had to report to some underground hospital in Brno  which is in the center of Moravia and there were just  the only men in the town were like  according to what the American called 4-F's  who were not fit for military service.
Shes telling me that she was a nurse in a hospital in Theresienstadt.
As an anesthesiologist I am equipped to do it and it was a baby with a good sucking reflex and some and I wanted to kee p...if I could have kept that baby even in my hospital  it was a hospital in Brooklyn  St. John's Street and  or St. John's Avenue  and uh it uh it may have survived.
I mean  as a nurse  I had to do that  what -- what the hospital told me to do.
And on top of that  after the war  when she went to school  she became very ill with whooping cough and pneumonia  and she had to spend several months in the hospital  several months before it all cleared up  because we were all undernourished.
And I had to go to hospital because I was living with my mother and with my sister.
And there were two kinds  one where you had to learn Latin  because every prescription was Latin and if you wanted to be a doctor or pharmacist you had to go to that gymnasium.
She worked as a nurse  apparently and then that -- so thats how I found out  cause he was one of the survivors  too.
So the major from the SS  a doctor  you could tell he was a doctor  he wears special insignia  he came and he stood in front of these trucks and said to us: Please do me a favor  do not touch any of that food  do not touch it  don't take it.
You began to tell us now  of course  about yourself before your mother went to the psychiatric hospital.
They were -- he was at that time doctor in Roch hospital in Vane.
He passed the medical examination and he became a doctor here.
My father  on the other hand  as I said remained in Auschwitz.
When we...when I came back from the hospital and Adam changed the jobs  and we saw already...this was not far from a rail road station .
Maybe he can help you because you're a doctor  he's a doctor.
They found another Jew hiding in the village who happened to be an ophthalmologist  but a medical doctor .
So he said that if she would be able to get into the hospital for a few days they would help her a lot and she would be able to come back and be all right again.
He almost became a pianist but he said if you don't know how to write music then it's no use so he became a doctor.
I have no dates to give you  I don't remember w hen I was -- they probably took me out of the hospital as soon as I wa s not contagious.
He was a physician  the son of the elder brother of my father.
Then we found out  there was a list  that my late brother  the doctor  survived and his two sons.
And Dr. Spock was in Cleveland and Dr. Spock -- actually  I consulted with him once  in my professional work and he used the same car repair dealer as we did and so my sons knew that this was the doctor who had written the book that I looked at when he was sick  so he -- he knew who Dr. Spock was.
This Russian military hospital was dissolved in 45  Septembe r. In 45 September  I was certified (??)
I was able to -- I met a friend from my high school and he was working at that particular first aid station  and he helped me to get into the hospital for my testicles to perform some surgery or something like that.
An-And -- and he -- hes happy  and he likes it  and -- and now -- we want he should be for -- he s houldnt be in that hospital  because if he will be a private doctor  he could make much more money.
This was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a relapse  and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days.
Well  this -- when my mother gave birth to my sist er  she screamed  so she was ashamed to give birth at the hou -- in the house  and this was the only hospital around  was in Bernkastel.
And we supposed to go to physician take the paper  and meantime the SS starts calling  up  everybody raus  everybody go to train and so and so  and start -- the doctor too -- doctor was arrested too  and what happened  we go to se lection place where German  one SS man suggest you go left  you go right  you know  and my wife -- my mother and my father supposed to go on one side  and we supposed to go on the other side.
So he called over this nurse and somebody come over with a stretcher and they took me up to the hospital.
Which mean either a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer or something  you know.
I cannot -- I'm not going to leave my child  I have nobody to take care of.ﬂ They said  ﬁLook  what do you want  you want ﬂ you know  the doctor spoke to me and also th-the ones from hires.
And they sended me  us there and I get a job at the hospital in the lab.
Yeah  there was always this two team units or one -- somebody was always there to work the hospital  if some of us got to go to a -- a so-called party  you know  as long as there was enough left to cover the hospital  that was okay.
And we ourselves did have supplies and we did man the hospital in Belsen  which was run  I think  by one of the nuns sisters  who was a m -- a nurse.
Interview with Jacques Ribons 66 So they used these hospital primarily for non-Jews  you know.
And from London there was arranged  they made him he became the main doctor in another city  dont tell me which city.
And when they were making rounds in the hospital  I was first the Chief resident  then the middle resident  then the Junior resident  then the Senior intern.
I told they  they  they call me  they call me in there  and question me  and I gave the name of that doctor  and then they send people there to question him  of course  and I was kept under question as long as they didn't come back.

And he was in a hospital in Los Angeles  in a Mexican  you know  there were a lot of Mexican and Spanish speaking people there.
I said  I wasnt ever aware of anything  I was in the hospital the whole time.
I think my most horrendous memories are those of Doctor Mengala and the hospital and I seemed to be a favorite candidate.
He has uni que information and methods that nobody in this hospital knows about.
There somebody if he has something  uh  sick or  uh  cold or diarrhea was taken there; and the nurse was a Jewish girl was taking care.
As I remember  in 1950's  he was in the hospital  1960's.
I just couldnt -- and finally the doctor -- I guess I got some Valium or something to calm me down and that was -- friend of my Uncle Heinz was there -- actually the brother of Ava Kempfer  his wife -- my cousins wife  was there and he wanted to take me out  you know.
I remember the first time I went out from the hospital  so I had eight rubles  I forgot to tell you  had eight rubles.
And in December  war started - Pearl Harbor - in December of 41 and quite a few of the doctors left  went in the service  and so the hospital was very short handed.
And she they took her to hospital  they gave her tubes  they fed her through the t ubes.
My father's office had an SA  Hitler Brown Shirt guard  and he lost his hospital privileges.
But yet  there were -- yo -- I told you about this doctor  the Jewish doctor  my friend that we escaped together with th -- when -- that he went to the hospital to get the job?
The - When they heard that I can speak German  their -- their -- their chief doctor -- engineer  was a German Jew  right away he took me  just because I spoke German and because I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 41 knew the -- the work  too.
When um I came out of the hospital  I had an aunt who was hiding out in the country.
I've got some really sick kids in there  and the doctor put a sign on there \ quarantined.\
And and th ere were you know  wherever you went there was something  see what were together with there were still the s s the survivors of the concentration camps were the people who were sick and they couldnt finish them off  they left them in this hospital  or took some of them inside the galleries and thats why the people from Nordhausen could not escape the bombing and be saved  because they didnt want to say what they were doing in those underground tunnels  and the all the de ad people there.
It wasn't any more just normal  because the doctor forbid me to have more children.
When you -- when you look back on your experience 50 years ago as a nurse and -- and during World War Two and especially that experience you had caring for the survivors of the concentration camp -- Mm-hm.
And I remember Betty taking me to the doctor every week.
Al-All a prisoner of war doctor  all German German doctors came in  in the although we went to the hospital there.
Looking Felix Horn 75 [Date not labeled] Page 75 if they are justly hospitalized or if they are unnecessarily staying in the hospital after they did this job with their doctor.
I dont remember if I told you that I -- from Kings County  where I was a pediatric nurse  my -- my love was psychiatry.
Now  I was probably around eight at this time  so I ran across and got hit by a car and was in the hospital.
She did te ll me about the shock it was to her to -- Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 10to -- to be in a -- in a s -- in a hospital where people had been confined -- and psychiatric hospitals at that time were quite different from the clinics we are accustomed to.
Few people committed  tried to commit suicide as I think uh the one man he  I think he cut his wrists and they  he was the only one landed because they had to take him to the hospital to to tend to him.
Very  you know ...probably everybody who has a doctor is very close to the doctor.
Uh  one of the surgeons...uh...it was similar...a hospital unit...a field hospital  and this one surgeon was Major Douglas Stone  and he was a very good surgeon and I don't know if he is living t oday or not  but his father was a very good surgeon and I seen him in the 50s.
A doctor considers his calling  if he's a good doctor  to treat ot hers and prevent suffering and pain.
And stewardesses at that time had to be nurses  so I remember I had a --had an interview set up at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis  and it was a --really looking forward to it  and then people from my hospital started going into the Services  mostly Army  and got very exciting about that time  and I decided that's wh at I wanted to do  so that's what I did.
The country doctor treated him  sent him to the hospital and of course the hospital was in the city in Liege.
I also had working with me a nurse sent by the Jewish Agency  Becky Lyons  who is still alive.
I worked in the hospital and I didn't know what to do.
First after we got out of th at school The hospital?
And she was so good in that thing  that where she was working  she had to go to the doctor every week or so  and this fellow by the dress line  he took her to the doctor  waited for her  because she was so good.
In the camp probably  officially I was presumably still registered at the camp when I was in the hospital  but let -- lets say I may have been there four or five days before I was put in the hospital  at most.
I even -- we had a cousin  she was a nurse in the Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9  2001 51hospital  and I talked her in  and she said she will go with us.
Once the Germans decided that it was a very new big building that this hospital they want to change into a factory for uniforms for the army.
He said  \ Yeah  you were the only girl  we met you after in the hospital.\
And there's my mother with a friend at the hospital and this is a girlfriend that I was so close with  this is  she got married in the displaces person's ca mp and this is her wedding.
There was a operating room that was brought in from a Jewish hospital in Prague.
But it got so bad that they were walking to camp  they were walking to the hospital and they were just defecating.
And one more was saved  because she had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a hospital.
First I worked in the German hospital and the hospital was later made into a German home for soldiers so I compared to others and I was able to bring little things to my parent.
And my father went to suture oh  my father went to the doctor to suture his wound  and my mother like almost collapsed because my brother wasnt with him.
I went to see the doctor  was a German [indecipherable] in Washing  who had been taken prisoner in Africa  by Rommel  Africa corps.
But la ter on  when she was 65  she started to work as a nurse  though she th -- the -- for the money she didnt have to do it  but just to help people.
Thats her m her husband was also a medical doctor  whom I knew when I was a girl.
She when she went to the hospital  they told her to come back tomorrow  some like that.
So he used to go to private doctor  even though  you know  uncle was a doctor  but he didnt go to him.
He established himself as a doctor and after the first accidents  the first deaths  it came out that he isnt a doctor.
So the closest I got to medicine was to marry a doctor and get a degree in Medical Technology.
Because --oh  that's when there was an opening in --went to Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis.

RL: Yeah  the doctor said six months before  he could still help her -- SL: Hm.
There was a nurse  a man  a young man from my hometown  which he recognized me.
And my sister  in the best of efforts  took me to the ships dispensary  which had a Greek doctor  who was kind of -- I -- I dont know where his training was from  but what they did to me there was cupping.
And these shoes which he gave me were lined with felt and I thought the felt would be good enough  I wouldn't have to need the rags and I wore them that way and they started rubbing against my skin and they abraded the skin and it wouldn't heal and it just kept opened and opened and wound and finally found out that there was a hospital or infirmary and I went there and I got it bandaged  the bandage was crepe paper and the cleaning was with peroxide  they just sloshed it with peroxide and I don't know if they put any ointment on it at all but they wrapped it up in the white crepe and that was it  off you go.

And this USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 47is my nurse  who was with me.ﬂ And I just went without nothing  just went and embrace him  and hug him  a nd give him a kiss.
And he got so upset that he went to see the nurse to ask  you know  whether I didn't do myself some harm  and I  I think the nurse told him that I was just craving sugar  and so  that was the.... I think I asked you everything.
His name was Rosenberg also and when he was in the hospital in Sweden a man came in  a British Army officer and said to him  ﬁAre you Hans Rosenberg?ﬂ He said yes.
Was it Mengele  was it another doctor  or you No  Mengele only supplied I see.

It took two  three months  but I got home on the hospital ship.
But we were not hungry for meat  once a week when I became an intern  we were invited to hospital cafeteria  the family.
Did they give an order they were going to set the hospital on fire.
And I reported to Whitehold Street  and there was a Viennese doctor  who said -- a Jewish Viennese doctor  who said  ﬁI now -- I realize  I see that you were in a camp and -- but  Im going to put on the paper that you are sick  that you are due for limited duty.
I went to school of medicine  became a doctor  became an ophthalmologist  professor of ophthalmology  so I coul d devote a lot to teaching.

01:10 I joined in Budapest the Zionist organizati on and we traveled around to Vienna and for a while I worked in Vienna in the hospital.
Some of them yo-you know  its its disgraceful  but when I was in the hospital just for a day or two  there was a fellow there  he was 18 years old  hed been in the army  I figured it was less than a year  and he lost a leg.
Philipp October 8   2015 52 nurse  and I showed her what the doctor did.
And I t hought that I'm going to 53 lose him so I went with him to th e hospital.
And then the pain got bad so she was getting morphine.
She said  do you think we should report to the Middlesex Hospital?
Went into the hospital at 1:10 at night  6:10 in the morning  there was that gorgeous baby.
The Mr. Majinsky  Rudolf was a -- a doctor  at the age at the time about 70.
Thirty-two pounds wa s my whole body  and they took me for this to hospital.
And my father bought his practice that -- our doctor who die.
The doctor told me to get out from the house because I could lose my mind.
The Russian found her an d took her to hospital  and she stay in hospital six months.
And one thing I wanted was to get out of the hospital as soon as I could because even after the Americans came in  I just hated those people with whom I was locked up there  it was like a  I was imprisoned with them  I was a captive audience to their stupid  endless bullshit  their endless yakking about empty things  about not hing and I just  on and on and on and on and I wanted to be away from them.
I was already by myself  and then I gave birth to my little girl all by myself with my cousin  no doctor.
So the only one available in Menora Hospital in Kansas City to see her  was him.
My brother-in-law  who was in a -- in an office  he was also doctor of law without being a lawyer.
Actually  we put her  my other aunt  into this little town's hospital.
They asked  Gestapo asked -- Dr. Elkis was a famous doctor in .
And first he worked for the Catholic service in Indianapolis  but now hes been with the Methodist Hospital now  for about 18 or 19 years  or maybe getting closer to 20.
And then we came to Auschwitz  and then we were selected.
So I went there in this dilapidated hospital  and now the Doctor Arot explained that  \ This is a drill.
I stood on attention  and I said  \ Commandant  I have an order from the doctor to keep the younger people in the camp and their performing light work  putting the garden in the  in the order  cleaning  uh the bath  the  the toilets  and so forth.\
So I was in the hospital for about a week I guess.
My mother grabs me and my sister and we walk to the hospital.
He said it was a temporary shelter or a hospital that we were going to that they are going to be taken care of.
The doctor asked me to help decide to have the operation.
I was a kid and I was mixing mostly with this doctor and another  you know  Maury Holder  politician  .
American physicians were in the Army and they needed doctors here so they wanted all the doctors in the hospital  because there was no one to serve in the hospital  there were not enough doctors.
Well  I dont remember any troops going  it might have been -- our hospital unit might have [indecipherable] I dont know  but we were all sent over the channel and we were on it overnight  cause we slept on the ship and landed in France.
And what happened  I remember the doctor  she arranged USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 12the [indecipherable] from the Judenrat  a nd it wasnt successful  and I think there was only one died.
In the meantime  things got a little better for us because my fath er got a job with the -- with the hip -- not the hospital  but the -- well  with the hospital  yeah  yeah.
So I didn't eat for ten days  and yeah  I kind of fainted  but instead of taken to the hospital  they whipped my butt  because they realized I did this not as an accident but purposely.
It says  ﬁPleveredes maxudatevair.ﬂ So then doctor -- American doctor looks and say  ﬁYou had the Pleveredes maxudatevair here.
When we -- I had to go on an inspection trip in - in France while they were setting up the hospital  getting things going  I went on an inspection trip with two or three other officers.
This was the sister– R: The sister yes  of Doctor Kalina.
And he this Hungarian lawyer arranged for him to go to the hospital and he was very  very sick.
I was very impre ssed with them  because there was a lot of medical language going back and forth between Bella  who was a nurse  and this physician.
So I  and then my husband 133 worked in the hospital and I thought of getting a job there but th en I really didn't want to work because I really was afraid that maybe that might hurt the baby and bein g in the hospital with diseases and things  so I decided to stay home.
And the  he didn't  he wasn't so frightened because he ha d next to him this good friend the doctor  Dr. Rard  who was a very prominent surgeon and he wa s sure that Dr. Rard would pull all the teeth for him.
It so happens that the case was resolved  inasmuch as an expert came from -- an expert in confessions under pers -- under duress  came from the Mordsley hospital as an independent expert  and gave evidence in this case.
And of course I had came to meet them  and then the doctor used to come for the weeke nd  and he noticed my number.
That way if you -- of my sister He lla Streicher  a brother of my -- of [indecipherable] Stre icher  was married to a Gentile li -- doctor.
He came in a little black car like a Volkswagen  and he took me to a hospital.
So  instead of taking him to the military hospital which was the other side of the city  they took him to my father's ward.
So he put him  he told you this story  he put him in the corner together with the surgeon and with the few people who were supposed to fix up the hospital  was in the vicinity  we didn't know where.
So when the Americans actually came you know yeah but on the other hand its before I went to physical therapy school  I had to make a practical in a hospital.
And he went in psychiatry  and came to New York  the New York hospital  Cornell Medical School  you know  to study psychiatry.
But I then went on to do some hospital j obs  social work jobs in hospitals.
So finally they called me one day and said  \ Well there's a place in Maine that needs a doctor.
Then just two days later  the psychiatric hospital was empty of all patients and staff and they were all arrested and sent on  first to a concentration camp in Holland.
The doctor clean me up  and they called up again the Barisivna   the doctor  shell come .
And I was with a lot of children  but there was an admi nistrator in this hospital who took me into his 23 home one day where I lived with them.
All that boiling water and soap  we didn't have soap  so we made soap ourselves  they couldn 't call the doctor because they were afraid.
Dr. -- a Swiss -- Zukli  a Swiss doctor performed an autopsy on him and found a -- a damaged brain.
They took me to the hospital but I dont remember nothing of that. [
German) 110 Municipal hospital (German) 66 cold  when I cough  little grainy stuff  I do cough out.
Then we got really  you know  scared  and we got into a trolley car  and we went to my father's hospital.
Were you in Auschwitz I after Buna  the whole rest of the time you were in Auschwitz?
You know  sometime it was  after my mother passed away here  my brother la -- li ved alone  and he became sick  he got a -- he was taken to the hospital and emergency room.
And Janko came back  got out of a ba of a hospital  came back to the barrack and he was given three days of convalescence.
They sent me to the hospital and I knew in the hospital very bad service.
Even me when I was little because my first language was Russian.
Doctor Kleinfeld  the -- the lawyer  we went to visit his family quite often.
She had to go  I don't know  to the dentist   to the doctor.
And then when the Americans marched in  I think it was April the 12th  my father went to see the commanding o fficer  told him about me and they came with the military ambulance  and took me to a German hospital which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company  and I was with them  ooh  for quite some time.
So the French doctor told them that when they take me back to the camp  take me into the French barrack.
And then -- okay  I was brought to the hospital immediately because I was with tuberculosis  staying at the hospital almost two years  in and out.
And they caught hi m once in Ashashoc a nd they beat him up so badly  they brought him in to the  then at night they put him in the hospital.
That that was closest  where there was a station  and but had the hospital  and the court.
Well  we separated in -- at the border  becau se Hannah suffered a heart attack  and we had to leave her at the hospital.
Did -- did you know this -- this doctor was named Mengele at the time  or -- No  no  not at all  didnt know.
We did of course evacuate the  those women immediately to the German field hospital  and from that point on the medics took over.
And  but then they took all the people who were sick and to the hospital and that was one of them was me.
So your father was in the hospital and your mother nursed him?
We saw already at a di stance -- there was a big hospital there and -- and the Russians  you could see were busy there  carrying equipment out.
And -- and we did hear  actually  a fair amount of bombing  although Amsterdam was not flattened the way Rotterdam wa s. There were certainly constantly air raids and sirens and planes flying overhead and some areas were bombed becau se the -- I know some part of the hospital was bombed  and I know the hospital had -- and the reason I know that  67 because after the war I became very ill  and I had to go to that hospital.
An esculap is a snake winding around -- I think was a sign of a doctor.
What sh e did do is that after the wa r  after I was already out of the hospital and now I'm goin g ahead of it.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 23 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: a bridge going to the small ghetto and we saw the small  the syn  the hospital burning  and we also saw the children  the nurses going up to the IXth Fort.
When I finished medical school and I got my certificate that I was entitled to practice medicine  I was told then right there that you won't be allowed to practice medicine in this country - and we won't - you can take your examine for the doctor  which required a thesis and another exam  but we won't give you your diploma until after you've left the country.
He -- my -- my -- his son went -- as arranged then that he lives with a nurse -- in the flat of a nurse.
Also  at that time we were all taken to a camp which was not a concentration camp  it was called Krushkupf   i t was near Warsaw  and that was a gigantic camp and that's where all the population of Warsaw was taken.
I said my friend was very  how shall I say  backward  you know  he never... So I said  \ Doctor  would you do me a big favor?\  \
And if the doctor understand this and can direct you... You know a lot of pe ople come to acupuncture and said  ﬁI hate needle.ﬂ And I said  ﬁIf I tell you  you are not going to feel it.ﬂ Okay  I can tell this until tomorrow and if I put in a needle and its painfu l  hes going to say  ﬁYou lied to me.
He was always prepared that he has to go to the hospital or something  after the heart att ack.
And they found a hospital that would take him in as a  as an intern.
And that was one reason that he wanted to become a doctor from the time USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 86he was four years of age  cause mommy wa s always sick.
And of course  the medical corps went with them  and they put the sick people in the hospital  and the others went into the barracks  but first of all  as soon as we brought them back to Hillers leben  they were so dirty and stinking and filthy that there was nothing that we could do to give them clean clothing  so we had to have them strip their clothing off  and the engineer battalion set up some shower points  and we started moving them through th e showers--the first shower that they had had in months and years.
You all that I had wanted to become a doctor  to help people  to raise a family.
I lis tened to her  and the child was born in terrible conditions because I didn't enough money to have a doctor so a midwife delivered the baby.
Now  this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army  why did you have to bring her into your offices when very few people were there?
And anyway  he was circumcised by the doctor  not by a moyl.
Yes  I recall him being ill and I recall him coughing and I recall him going to the hospital and I recall visiting him.
Somehow there was a Doctor Kilina who liked Rene alot and he took him home  back to Czechoslovakia and Rene became part of his family  kind of.
I don't have a decent doctor and I was very sick.
And I stayed in the hospital from the end of August to December and I had a variety of illnesses  double middle ear infection  I had jaundice and measles  one after the other.
So our our teachers were Dr. Rabiner Berliner from from from doctor Dr. Rabiner Berliner from a a place in germa Hannover   maybe.
I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later  as I said  to the day  I came down with it.
One sister  she couldnt walk nearly  and another sister was in the hospital  on the train station.
Her husband was a famous doctor  but even so it didn't help.

In the jail  in San Vittory  and in the confini -- conf ini are those people -- those places where people were sent  and I remember my parents  my friends saying  imagin e if youre a doctor  a lawyer  a philosopher  a sociolo -- an intellectual.
That was the last time when you had a small reunion  really  of the Munzer family  in that psychiatric hospital.
Right after they liberated him  they put him into the hospital  they had to operate.
I mean she  she was uh naive  and uh  no  no  over there  and they pointed a gun at her  and she went and so  well  people already arrested because it was 2 minutes after 8  and one boy bolted from this roll  and ran away over a bridge and back  and uh  he was shot  and a doctor who lived on the corner behind us  ran out of his house to tend to this boy.
I found out through a friend I had met in Switzerland that a hospital in Boston was looking for a resident - a similar situation where a young man had run away because he couldn't stand the responsibility of the work  or the situation  and also about an eighty bed hospital for chronic diseases.
They didnt th ink it was a very good sight for the nurses to go up and see it -- I dont know how many other nurse units went in there.
Especially I had a hard time with a doctor or else I didnt have a hard time with a doctor  but Captain Vulcanovsky said  ﬁWell  you have -- your lungs are scarred.
The guy  the doctor who was doing the job  was smiling at me  with a smiling face and looked at me.
No  it was just oo -- You just were in the hospital in the concentration camp?
But I had a very bad case of hepatitis  and was sick for seven weeks in Presbyterian Hospital in New York.
And he gave him money and he went to the Jewish hospital and told his wife about it.
When even -- when we went to Warsaw already  during the Warsaw op -- uprising  Sister Sophi a used to guard me against the -- they was -- they were underground Polish organization  and they organize hospital exactly  and [indecipherable] Jews to help him.
When I was -- I was young and right next neighbor to me was a doctor  a Jewish doctor  Dr. Goldframe .
But you might get assigned a -- someone at the hospital  and would you eventually maybe help that person hide  or -- This -- this -- this is the ward  huh?
Th-The water busted  we gotta go to the hospital She said  give me a glass of water [indecipherable] call a taxi.
We were very young and my mother became a Red Cross nurse.
I dragged myself to that clinic and they started working on me and the doctor without any anesthes ia they cleaned my wound  it was extremely painful I remember.
She I dont know why why she got that  but she needed medical attention  and she had to look for a way to get to the hospital.
You wasnt working for the Jerry  then Jerry  er um  have a blitz  and kick you all out of the hospital  and by the next morning  youre all back in again [DL] What were conditions like in the hospital? [
The way I wind in crematorium is that I was helping uh  I think it was a Kapo  I says  I cannot reme--I cannot remember exactly  they cleaned up people that were in a barrack which was for sick people like a hospital  but it was in a barrack.
So that was a  there was a rabbi in  in uh  I think it was the Grand Rabbi of Strasbourg  Abraham Deutsch  and he was the fellow th rough whose offices we always had our communication  but he was a rabbi in Limoges  but he had all this uh information and uh letters and uh instructions came through his office really  you know  and when I was in that hospital  I still made sure that I was in touch with Rabbi De utsch  that he knew what was happening to me  because I had gone to deliver some cards  and dropped right in the  well to get some information from kids in uh  in an orphanage to see what they needed to be done  and I all of the sudden had disappeared off the street  so I had to send message to Rabbi Deutsch later after a couple days  after I had uh  you know  sort of gotten out of uh anesthesia.
I heard and saw some people were united with the  right there in that hospital there was a mother and a daughter and here I was all by myself.
Eddie Strauss wrote a letter  and it said  ﬁIm so sorry  Im a hidden child from Belgium  and Im so terribly sorry I couldnt come to the conference  because I was in the USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 101 hospital  but I would like to take up contact with you.ﬂ And Carla came home with this letter  and she handed it to me  and said  ﬁListen  Im very busy  and this man writes  and he lives right nearby here  about 10 minutes away  in Yonkers.
Even th ough they didn't think th at a girl should be a doctor  they agreed to that.
Do you know if you were in a hospital at that time?
So my mother always want to become a doctor  and in th ose days she went in university and she wanted to become a doctor.
We went to the village called Tatanna  and the -- the doctor of the hospital -- I mean  we went there because my father needed some medicine  and the doctor asked me  ﬁDo yo u sing any songs?ﬂ I said  ﬁYes I do.ﬂ He says  46 would you like to come  th -- this was a monast ery and in a big room they had convalescent partisans  and I sang all the songs I -- I knew.
Could have been one or another staff meeting  meeting with different people  you know  you're supervising 20 people  you have the hospital  you're having group meetings  you're going out to look at this or that.
When I was there  I was sickand I didn't do too much.aL q O And...uh...if not for that Hungarian doctor  I wouldn't have survived th ere either.
They took me to the kitchen and a nurse washed me a nd powdered and I kept my eyes closed.
And soccer  I played soccer with them  but most of my friends were the neighbors  because on our street most of the people  it was about  in our street on the bi on the beginning of the street were the hospital in Michalovce  and after that there were the private houses.
Before the war  this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew.
She was a doctor in the Russian army  and there was a certificate for Palestine for her at the British consulate  could we help her?
AG] Yeah [DL] And how many people would you say roughly worked in that hospital  or were patients in that hospital at any one time? [
And Isaac called an ambulance -- oh no  he called the doctor  the doctor said  ﬁMy goodness ﬂ you know  ﬁwhen did that happen?
Then was a sick woman in the hospital so the sick woman  we had to take back to that village.
He went over to the first tree  broke off a branch and came over and the horse wouldn't pull and he hit him  the horse  and the horse pulled up his left f oot and hit him right in this part (point to his head) which actually  the way the doctor told me later  he busted an inside artery  you know  and he was bleeding internally.
Well the reason I tell this story is that at that time the chief medical officer for the area which had 300 000 DPs...there were only a very small number of Jews  like I don't know many thousands...4 thousand  5 thousand  where the Jewish doctor  woman doctor from Chicago a Dr. Anna Monatov .
Few days later he heard that he should be replaced by a Polish woman doctor  should be finished up because there were only 4  3 or 4 left of them in the whole city.
Instead of me saying  well  we'll go and see a doctor.
And when we arrived in the Warsaw ghetto  I don't remember exactly what happened  but once I was 17 storm troopers (German) 18 Swastika (German) 19 ethnic German (German) 23 laying on the floor  and I was in a hospital and they wash myself and they put me in a bed in the hospital.
But one day I spoke USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 49 49with a woman from Lexington  shes a doctor.
Don't forget there were also old patients out of the hospital  and people who couldn't walk.
So my mother was in charge of a hospital over there  there was not even a single doctor.
It's like  not a hospital  it's like a  a there were people  men  who wanted to be a woman  and they were operated on.
When the Italians did the armistice  they gave my file to the Germans and in end of Januar y  1944  the Germans  at four o'clock in the morning came and arre sted me  with two other Jews of Ioannina  the president of the community  Doctor Moses Kofinas(ph ) and a relative of my  .
And there sits  you know  a woman; you know  she is a widow of a doctor.
10 The man downstairs who worked for the Germans  took his car and took my mother  who was bleeding to death  and with my father and they made it to that hospital which was in the back of a chate au where there was daylight.
So I found that out later -- course I was in - in the hospital that -- that time  and in t hose days you didnt tell each other those things  16 because you would not worry  or make a person worry  because I would not have stayed in the hospital  I would have stayed home to protect.
And there was an SS man  who witn essed the whole business inside the hospital compound.
How wonderful a doctor  we have a very sick young person so my father instead of saying well  I'm not really a doctor said \ \ Hum  okay I'll try.\
So I got luck  a doctor from Holland  a very young man  he was in the army  he came in and he saw I have water a-all over my body.
This was before the advent of any kind of psychotherapeutic agents  any drugs  and she watched people who had been there confined in that hospital for many years.
So he spent uh half a year in the hospital; was operated several times  of course  to no avail.
Yeah  or -- or I think again of the doctor  who is -- Well  this is -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 53 -- the narrow escape at the transport station. --
And I cant comprehend it  because here Im in this country with wonderful technology  and it wasnt too long ago  with a different pair of glasses than these that I was accompanying a friend to the hospital and the lens fell out on the floor.
It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska where I was taking a group of Senior citizens  and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture with with me and his wife were supposed to go together.
She was hidden in the house by the doctor  I think.
So my husband came  and the doctor  and he had a -- a -- he was working  they -- a -- occupied him to be the main person to see to people that got wounded during the work  and so on.
And I remember that she had me in bed and she called  I guess  what was a doctor  and I remember having hot Š this is going to Š hot glasses Š that were heated glasses that we re like put on the body at different parts.
When I not overseas  when I was in the hospital over here  a military officer from came from Washington to interview me  but the interview was more about the war crimes commission  because I witnessed a killing of an American soldier.
So next day superintendent calls me  th at's not the one who hire me  this was different Edwarda Rorat 55 February 25  1996 Page 55 superintendent and he tells me I understand you in sulted the nurse.
It so happened that one of my friends was a patient at that hospital; because he had an attack  they took him to that hospital.
We also have not private packs but things to take for the forest  for the bases  maybe a radio  maybe other things  maybe medicaments for the small hospital that we had in the forest  maybe other things  maybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go.
You may get killed.ﬂ Cause periodically they were cleansing the hospital to the -- to the gas chambers.
The doctor was educated in Vienna  spoke German perfectly  and he came to a very ingenuous plan.
Finally I found her  and there she was on the floor laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water to her head  and she said  last night the doctor sa id to her -- he looked at her  and he said  ﬁThis woman has the crisis tonight.
That was the building  the same building  but then became a hospital and from there when they threw the people out from the windows.
On the far end  there were railroad and German police surrounding young kids  and I understand one young kid was shot in the legs and now...a day later brought him back from the hospital.
You n you know th-this is what   if you could like  Jewish people used to come from Warsaw for vacation  like that doctor.
His wife became Jewish when she married him  the doctor  and the boy was Jewish and they killed them all.
His mother came to my mothers house -- Right -- [indecipherable] to pick up some for -- his fa ther was in hospital  an d then she show me and then she told him to come  and that was it.

My music as -- as my story is  or continue go to school beca -- continue be a doctor  which is a hard school to go through  I know.

And I make my  my graduation doctor there in Bonn and then Marburg.
So 'til my parents was alive  they thought I...wherever I go  I am a a nurse.
So the German who was in charge  the staff -- staff sergeant there  grabbed one of -- grabbed a -- a car  and took me - and they asked one of the s-soldiers there to take me to the fi eld hospital  which was only about maybe a mile away  th-the German field hospital  because that finger was still hanging on it  you know  it wasnt cut off completely  just hanging  ju st by the skin.

There were no...they worked  and they...we got that hospital to get in there  and as soon as the hospital got in there...but then...the hospital was there  but then the our field hospital came in  and you know  it kind of quieted down a little bit and everybody backed off  and everybody knew what's going on then.

I was never in the SS  it was the hospital mu ch of the time.
before when I were in hospital  and uh because we were religious  it were already in the time when we went back  were and and   you know.

Because when I was in Paris  I had something wrong with me  I had something on the side that was -- and the doctor wouldnt pass me  you kn ow  I had pains over here  so I had to go to a hospital.

And then there were non -Jews and we were friendly with them and  in fact  my friends  particularly who is the medical director of the Middleham Hospital in Antwerp  he's still friends with these people that we studied together  so I think the religion was not important there.
He was in a hospital--he was uh--uh managing a hospital from the peace.
And when you said your mother found out about these Polish units being formed  and she was going to sign up to be a nurse  and she arranged that you would be in an orphanage  would that have been staying in the camp  or would that have been an orphanage of Polish children moving with the unit?
And I know  when like when I said we were in that hospital  and at the end of the journey  uh  they kept us  then we finally got out  and they had schools where we  where  taken care of and sleeping  they had restaurants there we could go to  to eat and everything.
But  who did we hire for space [indecipherable]   when I went to work for [indecipherable] right after fo 45  months afterward I which I wanted to be a doctor  and it turned out to be a [indecipherable] design  because I could do the design very well.

So sh her husband was a doctor  because they went together in school.
They wanted to take some of my toes off  and I wouldnt let them  because the doctor said theres a chance that they can heal that.
When they brought me into that bed  when I found  when I opened up my eyes and I sa w this nurse standing by me  it was like coming back from the dead.
I had -- when I was young  the doctor told me I cant have a child because of my heart c ondition  in Vienna  when I was 16.
And she– when he was born– I was maybe in my ninth month already when she got over here  and if I said to her  ﬁI want to spend more time with the kids.ﬂ She came– I got her a job to work in a hospital  but not as a nurse  as a nurses aide  because she didnt have the diploma.
Joe wanted very much to stay in New York  so I -- I said  just finally said  ﬁI am going to sign anything they want.ﬂ And -- and we left and we told them  ﬁWe sign  you can send us wherever you want.ﬂ They gave us right away a room in -- in das hotel  was a -- a very dilapidated hotel  but they had there all the refugees in -- in one place and they had a -- a -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 56 a dining room for us and we could have three meals and -- but they -- before they -- so I signed  but then they said to me  ﬁYou know  you have to go to the doctor  because you need to be examined and you have to be in perfect condition and we send you  that you're healthy.ﬂ And when I came to the doctor  the doctor gave the -- this -- t-told -- t-told -- g gave the report that I have tuberculosis and that I have to be hospitalized  it is dangerous for -- for my child and that I need to carrior test and I was positive.
Empty buildings and so on we re being furnished and all the supportive services that you have in a hospital were trying to be set up as quickly as possible to cope with the situation.
>> Bill Benson : Your mother was working in the hospital where you were taken?
A doctor who takes the Hippocratic oath to heal sick people is murdering healthy?
Okay  before we get to that  I do have some more questions to ask  I think you had a strategically more of a vantage point  especially with your father in the hospital.
Uh  I did find uh a few wounded in  in a German field hospital  and made arrangements for uh  their ev acuation  but because uh we  it was getting dark  this was late in the day  we felt we had to get b ack to our lines  and the war was not over yet either at that point.
So  to make it short  I had to put everything back into the trunk  nail them down and here they took it away into storage and I went to look for my wife and my daughter and it was not before 10 at night in the Hotel Breslin on Broadway that I heard that my daughter is in the hospital on Metropolitan Island at that 30 time  the Metropolitan Hospital  and I had 20 dollars in my pocket which went away the next day for the taxi fare to the hospital.
When did you  so in the time after the war when you were in France and you were attending school again  did you have the– how long did it take before you had the idea that you wanted to become a doctor and do you re member how that happened?
Even in 15 days  you can't go out.ﬂ And  you know  every day the doctor come and take out the dry skin.
And...uh...in order to...I know that in order to give...uh...birth  my mother had to come down...she tells how she came down to her father  the doctor  in an ox cart. (
And they had friends in Fiume  very good friends with whom they stayed when they would come and visit me because I was in the hospital there.
So uh I had a girlfriend  and she had enlisted to become a doctor.
And then there was in a hospital vividly remember they were getting off the train and they walked through the town and how they were wrapped around up to sometimes barely their noses that were sticking from the bandages arou nd.
I was almost persuaded to remain there and work there in the hospital however  I still felt that the United States were my home and I returned 1966.
And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open ramp into the nur ses quarters and close all the windows.
You know  you are all the time I was already a doctor.
My father  who was a dentist  had privilege in the hospital there and so we used to go and have our meals at the hospital.
And then some of these sections had holes in them for windows  so again it was impossible to carry the even load  one section was heavy as a ton and the other ones was just a frame of the window and as it turned out  the building was supposed  turned out to be later on  the Jewish hospital barracks.
And the question was  what do I do  how does one go to a doctor?
I took her to the hospital and she stayed there a couple of days and the pain  she was getting injections of morphine close to 275 and she needed medication and she was getting patches and the hospital didn't have it and I had to buy my own medication for that  and in the morning I went to pick up and I said to her she didn't want to eat.
And then people who were needed for   means somebody who was not so young  but was a nurse  we took her along  physicians we took along  although out of us.
This was my reaction  but the following day  I have to take all those prisoners who came in a day before to the hospital for checkups  and I let them know in the evening  there is this and this man who killed a prisoner  so the especially took care already the hospital.
Came a nurse and she took me down to the window.
Because the director of the hospital said to me  \ You are not going to wear the yellow star in the hospital.
But the papers were going up and down  up and down and one paper  on the end already  we had already ever ything done  they stopped us  because they found on my -- my -- no  wha -- the doctor found somethi ng with -- with my lung  something on my lung  just a spot.
And [indecipherable] my fathers first cousin was a - a doctor who was an officer in -- in ELAS  a medical officer.
So I was lucky and they brought me to this hospital.
He had either an ear infection  an eye infection  I dont know  and the doctor felt he should go in the hospital.
I took care of a lot of -- I worked in the hospital for quite a while.
Get into -- get -- start working in a hospital where they have food.
Uh  we had a  uh  uh  a little  uh  what they call krankenstuper  which was like a little sick room  like a room where  somebody was sick  you could go to th e nurse  who wasn't really a nurse  but she knew a little bit about nursing  and maybe she coul d do something for you.
So he did it like it because it was put on like with dots with a pen s o what they did he went back and drilled like a dentist every dot and the nurse was standing by.
But the work in Charity Hospital   you have to belong to the medical school  y ou know  its one of those things.
They were considering to cut it off but this particular doctor said to wait  not to cut it.
No  as a matter of fact  I remember  when the doctor came and she felt better  and the doctor came and he says as I said before   the doctor was a friend.
I go downstairs to where the medical checkup was  and there was a fellow who I knew who was in a mental institute who acted as a doctor.
I was working with my friend  with a Hungarian friend of mine as a maid and a nurse.
So I don't know whose idea it was  the doctor says  I call a priest.
You have no right to be a doctor or a lawyer or whatever it was.
Because I dont remember what happened  how I got  but eight days later I woke up in a beautiful white child bed in a hospital.
I left the hospital because of the on coming selec tion.
And my father was afraid that I'll be taken away from there  so he found out from a chemist that there is some kind of powder that in large amounts it make bombs  but in very  very small amounts it colors you  like  you would have like symptoms of hepatitis  you'd become all yellow and feverish  and you know places like that were terrified of having an outbreak  and he knew that if I get that  I would be taken straight to the Jewish General Hospital where he was on the staff.
Because of my grandfather's collections of a medical doctor  many farmers ow ed their lives to him.
Actually  she was a woman who was taking care for my mother b ecause my mother was very ill for one hour and a half  so she took her --.
In the small ghetto was the...the contag ious disease hospital headed by Dr. Brauns and they didn't let him in.
After she  I don't know how she came to this place  two villages  looking for a nurse who can deliver babies.
And I cr ied for three days and they -- they tried everything at that hospital.
She was his nurse I think  and he had left...forgotten to take his glasses with him  and in the letter she enclosed his glasses which she asked me to give to him and she started being extremely tearful  almost to th e point of wailing  and I said you just don't understand the American way of life.
You were in there a few months– From the hospital  I walked out to a little town called Ampfing  and I met two boys  two Jewish boys  and I started talking to them  I just came out and ﬁWhat are you doing?
I had no reason  and as a nurse  I had a real good reason to go there and help people.
So they woke up the night nurses  got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies.
I had occasion to talk him on a few  a few times that I went over to the hospital and of course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies.
And next morning  we were taken to the Russian hospital where I stood and there I was 9th of May. 9th of May 45  when it was end of the war  I was there.
But anyhow -- and when people were coming  I was greeting them  I was taking reports  and I got -- they were saying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody and -- now  this doctor wanted me to sleep with her -- she was afraid to sleep by herself -- which I did.
So we boarded a streetcar in Vienna and with the streetcar we went to the American side of Vienna and we stayed in th e Rothschild Hospital in Vienna.
Or you went to your doctor and doctors and nurses were very active in those days in hospitals in Copenhagen took in patients under other names just to hide people.
So  I went and I became a member of the  of the staff of that German hospital.
She  her health had been   she'd been seeing a doctor regularly and she was taking medication.
And I remembered the nurse said to him in German that it's okay.
And I remember so well  when we first came to the hospital  we were in Niedershonhausen  student we were 17  18 years old.
How -- how -- describe if you can how you used your job as a nurse  sometimes  apparently -- You just did it.

She was short in Bio  she was short in Chemistr y  and she went to Italy and she became a doctor veterinarian.
And took him to the hospital  a-and his wife  and they checked them up from top to bottom.
But just knowing that this American nurse  this nurse who was barely -- way under five foot tall had accompanied the US Army across Normandy  now had ended up in Ebensee  that she had taken care of my father and provided some comfort  that at least gave me some comfort that he might have died in peace.
And so he asked that someone else could treat me which the real doctor did.
One example and that gives you the utmost fear in Warsaw you had in those days  the unit in Warsaw was liberating prisoners from the hospital  also.

So they get a doctor for him out there  and I kept moving to another location.
The entire staff of the hospital came Sunday after church for instance  for a drink and a cigar.

About two years ago  actually through the museum  I met a woman who was a US Army nurse 20 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD who may well have taken care of my father when she was there with the US Army.

He didnt want to hug me before I left home to go to the hospital.
I gave my profession  I'm a pharmacist  and next day they decide to send me to go to work to the hospital.
And his main argument was that he didn't want to work in a hospital as an orderly until he could get his board certification or whatever was needed in America to become a doctor.
We had quite a big hospital there  but it was empty.
Now  I became stronger through this treatment  and I just wanted to mention here that I realize -- and I also go to a regular doctor  and I realize their contribution to medicine.
So are you in the hospital May and Ju ne  after  after the birth of Irene?
And that's something that really influenced me and probably why I became a doctor and I've tried to live up to that pledge for my life.
So  there was no reason to kill the village doctor and then be left without anybody.
So this time I thought that this friend  this doctor told me  lets stay on the outside  so in case they taking us straight  well go up there b ecause they told us  do whatever youre doing when you go insi de  because youre going for finish.

All of them got in the hospital because they couldnt stop -- they werent able to walk out from the room.
So we were starving and surviving but one summer  this was the summer of 1943  I was walking barefoot in because those shoes were so uncomfortable that I just  whenever I had the chance  I was take them off and I step on a rustic nail  and I was afraid to tell the German that was supervising him because only a Jew  or a Jewess or a Jewess girl could use  be use for them; what good otherwise we were shot from that...so when I came home  the infection started and from my big toe of my right leg to hip I had the red thing and my father knew a doctor  a surgeon in the hospital  so he went there and 10 o clock at night I had an opera tion and I wa s put in the hospital and I didnt work anym ore but I was in the hospital.

When he came back  my son was nine months old  and he was actually born in an army hospital in where was it?

Well  he  he would come and visit various Norwegians in the  in the hospital; and that's how we  we met.
Then the following morning we all marched off and the more we marched the more pain I got and then I couldnt stand it any longer and I was curled up as a ball in the grass when the doctor came along and I couldnt straighten myself out so they forced me out straight and they got two of their biggest blokes to walk beside me and they couldnt hold me up so they told my hands to the back of the horse and cart that the Germans used for and I was forced to walk that way for hours and I cant really remember much about it I suppose and in the end I seemed to be walking normally and I was allowed to go.
