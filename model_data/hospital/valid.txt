There were about just 15 to 20 people  all we good friends  and we could trust each other  the Kapos uh  uh camp uh blockeldest uh assi stants  and friends  well we assembled  and we prayed all day  and I  later on after the evening  I still ----------food  and I have witnesses  and Norbert Wollheim one of it  and there was Dr. S ilver who uh is a French doctor  a wonderful human being who knew almost everyt hing by heart  all the prayers.
When he got very  very sick already  she went away to Sokolow...that's nearer than Siedlce...to a city which she had a doctor.
It wasn't allowed  and I wanted to become a nurse  so I rather played with dolls anyhow.
And that time wasnt like today  in the small city we got one doctor and believe me his -- he didnt got a pair shoes  they were all with holes  because each of us was a doctor.
Then the doctor said  \ Well  they're coming along pretty good.ﬂ So we started butchering horses  and we feed them horse meat  bread  dehydrated vegetables.
Thats was very in Frau doctor [indecipherable]  Frau doctor [indecipherable] Yeah  yeah  it makes a difference when you come from a society where that means something.
One morning  I was standing in line to go with 37 this group that was going to the main hospital in the men's camp.
And he told to his captors  I'm a doctor  I have to take care of them.
And she was working with a nurse na nurse  servant and nurse.
That's all what I needed  having these things growing in front of me and the doctor in school said  I have to be near the sea  that's the Baltic Sea  Polish  that 's the north and there was no way I could afford to go anywhere  any place and strangely enough  this was the time I received letter from Stettin  which is near the Baltic Sea  the north  from some very distant cousin from my real parents.
And we took her to our hospital in the for -- into the forest  where we sho -- she was recuperating.

RJ] Its only once I remember when I was put in hospital.
So I was always wondering about the motto of the doctor ; first  do no harm.
I went to nursing school and I learned to be a nurse.
So the doctor came  he took the key  he opened him -- examined him  and he said to -- he said  Yankovek  dont eat up your mothers bread  because your mothers gonna die and who is gonna take care of you?
We have a frie nd in Haifa his name is Doctor Fuchs  she says  yes he delivered the mother and th e children  but he was one of the violinists during the Ghetto.

Later  in the years of the defense of Old Town  that hall will be tr ansformed into a huge hospital.
When you got better Yes  when I when I recei became better  I was in a a Hohenfels  then I was in Lohr  which was not really it was like a hospital  it was called sanatorium.
Now a doctor in Dallas  a a very  very fine  but rather sensitive.
And then he told me I was a sergeant  and I told him but as a nurse  I'm supposed to be a nurse.
And Marc was very weak and so he was in this  what they called a hospital.
Well  the daughter of the doctor  we allowed to stay in the house and she supervised with keeping it clean and so forth.
And I remember a doctor who came on his bicycle  was a Jewish man who made the rounds to all the regions  I guess  to the people he knew were in hiding  coming to check her health.
And they came to the hospital and not even knowing me or Sandy  they offered their house.
I dont believe in any doctor  or any consultation will help something like th is.
We didnt have Latin  so you couldnt become a doctor  but it cou -- you could go on t -- to any other education.
I remember him because after the war  again  he became the Red Cross doctor in Vienna.
So  I remember that when Mother got very sick and the doctor came to see her you know  we had Jewish doctors in town and they all were friends.
And from being doctor patient relationship  developed a very wonderful friendship.
So  what he did  Doctor Aaron Mayer  he put an ad in the Jewish papers but the uncle didn't read the Jewish newspapers.
And his wife immediately came and the baby  she was -- she wasnt even in the hospital a day or two.
Nevertheless  a major came to me and said  \ In the hospital  there are many Polish wounded soldiers and very few doctors.
It was a nurse of the camp  and the card said she couldn't write to us.
Say  Im a doctor so and so  that Mr. Torchio send me over  you got some people sick here.
And we went to the hospital to find out how -- you know  how he ca n get a  lets say  position in the hospital.
When I worked as a male nurse in the Jewish hospital  that was on a sq uare in the middle of the Jewish neighborhood in Amsterdam.
I was interrupted by a visit from a German doctor dressed in a military uniform. \
And he at that point he he was in the hospital because he had a accident  and she went to visit him  and the rest is history  and here I am.
So in World War I  he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good administrator  so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsba d. And there he then later settled.
For eighteen months I had them everywhere and when I say everywhere  I mean everywhere  and then one day  a local doctor  Dr Desmond Hull said  ﬁCome over to the surgery  Ron.ﬂ I knew him from school  of course.
As for the surgeons in the unit  we spent most of the time in the hospital doing surgery.
I stayed there a little while longer and then I wound up again in the field replacement hospital  where I volunteered for KP on Christmas.
And they took a bunch of at that time now  kids that were either in hiding or in concentration camp  they looked those people up  including my brother and I  and in British ambulances they drove us to this former [indecipherable] camp in Lunebur g  where we were nursed we were given complete physical examinations and we were nurse d back into health.
He worked in the field hospital in Lieges which is quite close to Brussels .
Such a good doctor  a good natured doctor you never met in your life.
03:22:01 She talked to me about going for an operati on  I said  ﬁNever.ﬂ I said  ﬁOver my dead body youre going to the hospital because I am afraid they might not give you good care.ﬂ And Michal did not tell me that she went to the hospital  but I found out that she died in the hospital after the operation.
Periodically  I was taken to the hospital because I had certain medical procedures I guess  done to meŠ likeŠ againŠ I dont remember exactly why  or what for  or the very detailed specifics.
I think three or four  five days later  my father had been successful in getting a doctor to see me and the doctor made it clear that there was no hope.
And she started making calls to have it set and found a doctor in my fathers hometown of Boyton  who agreed to meet us at the back door of a Catholic orphanage in Boyton.
And the other ones who were there had to work and there was not a good unit  but somehow he managed to get along there and eventually he got discharged and then got back home  but during that time we were home without him and again jumping things  my father  after awhile  found it  no more practicing secretly  he was  he tried to get a front man to work with  another doctor with whom he could  to whom he could take the patients across the street and sort of share and split the fee or something like that.
Theres a doctor  I saw this on 20/20 not long time ago.
There wa s one fellow  he was a doctor  he and his wife  they had one child  and as I recall somebody asked me whether -- whether he had taken off  and I said  I dont know  but Ill check him.
And do y ou know which hospital you were born in or where?
The doctor  the Jewish doctor  thought I probably had -- Typhoid?
By the way  at that point we were not allowed to use the hospital.
And since then I had nothing but pain and even after I got liberated  I went to doctors in Germany and doctor s in everywhere and I finally ended up here in Washington a place with the ear c linic where a doctor said to me  I have one choice  have the operation because its so deteriorated that its going to affect my brain and its pressing against my brain and that I dont have much to live.
And my mother turned 74 in the hospital  and the few words that came back  she she could swallow  she could eat  but she couldnt speak.
That was warm   there were -- and they had plenty of food  and they stayed there for a couple of days  three  four da ys  and then  for instance  if there was a funeral from the hospital  first was the wa gon with the body -- and there was lots of taxis  and they go from the hos pital to the cemetery  but a car  one on one  make another direction  and that way  they came out of the hospital  without being -- it was natural there was many cars.
And hospital  I won't mention no names  they want no money from me but the Director of the hospital is a physician.
At the hospital they tried to get to us to take blood or give us blood or something.
We didn't have a hospital  but we st arted immediately with schools.
The doctor got out but when I came back hours later to put in the coals for the doctor also  because he was there and I saw blood on the rail  window and scrape from the nail and the fingernails were hanging on the wood.
I forgot to tAo94(0talk about that one...in Birkenau when we got the needles.w I don't know  5  10 of us got the neelles and we were just a G (tlaying in whatthey call a hospital and the main docto r who took care of us was a French-Jewishdoctor.
I mean  the  I know they hit people  that they had to go to the hospital  and that  but I  personally  went through the whole thing pretty unscathed.
His ti -- the mayor was very -- doctor [indecipherable] lady doctor who speak -- spoke fluent German  or Russi an.
Thats where that doctor was who thought he was a Nazi.
She was put into jail and knew that in the infirmary of that jail  there was a nurse who worked with the resistance.
Somehow he--I don't know--he went to visit my... my...uh  my small hospital.
That is the day that I will never have to guess where I was  because I was in a hospital.
In the hospital all they needed was the working body  that's all they were interested.
Leah  when we stopped before  I think you had just arrived back in Czestochowa from  after you had been working in this military hospital.
I mean  I enjoy working in the hospital  I got good relationship with the people I work in  and know everybody there.
One of one of the pharmacy  one doctor  and five plain  plain families that they had nothing   but nevertheless they were brought to court and they were...and they were let's say punished by first uh if it would happen another time something else  so and so.
I was living there near Hospital  a nd every day when my children came from school  3:00  I had to leave them until 5:30  6:00 until my husband came.
Sigh) Now  one evening at 4 o'clock  the doctor comes in without his hat.
Could you tell us about the events that led up to your being in the hospital and you told me an extraordinary story before.
We should have the best reputation  but resurrection to cover this hospital.
Initially most of the afghans went to Walter Reed Army Hospital but then also were sent to other military installations including Fort Sam Hous ton in Texas  Fort Bragg  in North Carolina  and Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.
And my brother-in-law was a doctor  you know  help her when she was sick  etcetera  etcetera.
Chernigov was the name of that place and...uh...there was a woman doctor  a Jewish woman doctor and I told her that I suffer from...uh...ulcers. \
And we walked in this building and  of course  right away there were soldiers from the doctor and they start checking out the people and soon my brother  they took him right away from us  and right away from us.
The doctor that was taking care of us  he died of the typhoid.
And did you get to talk to any of the prisoners who had been there before?
