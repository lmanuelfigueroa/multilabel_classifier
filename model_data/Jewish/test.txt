We lived a more s ecular - not more - we did live a secular life; whereas the religious Jews in town lived a totally different life  as you could see it even in New York these days  I mean  you go to Williamsburg  or you go to Eastern 5 Parkway where the Lubavitch live  and you immediately see that  if you belong to a reformed synagogue as we do  it really is not th e way we lived life  and we still could feel as Jewish as they do and Im sure as d eeply identified with ﬁJewishnessﬂ but not necessarily religious ﬁJewishnessﬂ to the ex tent  because we are not observant and our home - at home in Poland - my grandmother was very religious so in order for her to come and visit  Mother had to keep a kosher home  but we were not necessarily kosher in any strict sense of the word.

This Dr. Behnker who came to the ghetto and he came to the Jewish committee and said all books should be...and we should write announcement all over th e ghetto that they should bring in certain places  concentrate...conc entration places to bring the books to be delivered to the to the Germans  and all the wagons of the ghetto were mobilized to bring the books from the various parts of the ghetto to the to be handed over to the Germans  so in the underground    we decided the very...mo st valuable books we want to to to rescue  so we mobilized the teachers whic h will accompany the wagons and take out from the wagons valuable books that they consid er of historic value and put it in a separate wagon which was accompanied and th ey would...little children...the..you know  the   the messengers  so they were not... and you see  and they...and this the wagon where they stood  took these wagons and they used to send it to...bring it to some hiding place for us.

We had quite a big well-organized group of Polish Jews  for instance  in Berlin  and and the Germans then came to the conclusion that th ey will not accept this challenge by the Polish government because then they would be burdened as they thought with stateless Jews which they couldn't deport if they wanted to to especially to Poland  so what they did was that before the uh the laws uh became valid  they uh uh uh rounded up uh Jewish families of Polish origin I might say  all over Germany and in in Berlin just th e man...in in in other cities  full families and deported them to the...deported them to the east into the no-man's land between Germany and Poland and uh this created a terrible situation.
Between that time and then the uprisi ng in the Warsaw ghetto  the Jewish  Jewish uprising  and how much youre seeing  Michal and -- And the Jewish were uprising  the Warsaw ghetto uprising   you talking?
He was terribly worried that the Nazis would torture her  Lucia  and hurt her and that Lucia would crack under the pressure and say that she  in fact  was hiding Jewish children and  in fact  Aizik was a Jew and other fact that 30-some -other Jews were hiding in a hidden bunker in the Borszczowice Forest.

We stayed there with other Jewish people and you know the Ge rman Jews they said  oh I was born in Germany  I want to die in Germany  nothing is going to happen.
We had some other people you know living in in our home as well who uh who were not Jewish and some were sympathizers and of course they wanted that  because you know  this was the part which was German speaking.
You know  some people are - he was one Jewish  he was religious.
They would shoot us like we were dogs  and uh  we had no weapons  we were weak  and you  you couldn't fight  fight an army with bare hands  but I feel that every day that we lived in concentration camp and we survived it  to me was a heroism uh by itself  because we made it and we su rvived this terrible life we had there  and by resi--by this we resisted Hitler to show him that we are here to  to stay  and he could not finish the race of the  of the Jewish people  and I feel by that  we resisted.
But everything  we had  like  they had meetings a nd they had things  and they had the  how you call  I don't know who worked there  but from the Jewish organization they had the Haganah 96 I think  and people that  from Israel worked here after the war  in Europe to bring young people over  to work  to build the country  as pioneers.
And withi -- and within gr oups where Jewish people had -- had -- had come and were in need of provision  and -- and -- and support.
Let me just before we get to that  now your father was on the Jewish council in the ghetto  is that right?
For a very long time  at least to me it seemed very long  he didn't answer me  and then his own voice betrayed his emotion  he was wearing dark glasses I couldn't see his eyes  he said  \ So am I.\  And the impact of that to be liberated not only by an American  but by a fellow Jew  um  it  it  it just  so totally uh  I mean  um  I think this is when that that feeling of such an incredible joy which fills your  your whole  whole being.
And under that falls the Kapos 53 and the Jewish elders  and even we  we got white armbands.

Was it easier to get by in a big city like Paris as a Jew?
There we met Jewish people who had been hidden and they helped us and from there we went very slowly as the Russians moved westward  we moved westward and at the end of April  at the beginning of May we were in Moravia and was back in Brun and my...the the boys we went with me went to Prague and it was the end of the war.
But I must tell you my experience with the ORT was my first experience with a Jewish organization.
And that is  did what you see with that torture and Id say defilement and cruelty to those Jewish men  did that change you?
He was the  he wasn't  obviously a Jewish person from Romania who was the appraiser for the Nazis for all the stolen goods and valuables that they stole.
Hitting Jewish businesses  because most of the downtown Lida was Jewish businesses.
What other kinds of changes happened afte r the Germans took over  for Jewish people?
But I felt all these consequences of the Nazis because my father su ffered being a Jew so this reflected on my my life  on our life  and we didn't...we weren't able to do too much.
Luckily...I remember they put me to sleep and they operated on me and a Jewish doctor .
But there were not an overabundan ce of Jewish people there.
There wa actually  there were th in Bad Nauheim   there were a lot of Jewish people came back   Germans.

They were friends which were not Jewish and which I appreciate very much because they like to play soccer with me  because I was a very good goalkeeper.
I knew  on the 23rd I have  according to the Jewish religion  \ Yahrzeit.\
And I also was the maitred for two seasons -- you must remember that this was seasonal  so when you say  well  youve worked in so many different places  the answer to that is simple  it -- these were seasonal hotels that opened up for Passover in -- generally in April  around April  closed again after Passover and reopened in June  around Memorial day and stayed open until the high holidays  the Jewish holidays  like Sukkahs and Simchas Torah and so forth and so on.
So  many people have talked about examples of anti-Semitism  being Jewish.
And its not very clear exactly what happened  but the Greek resistance that had gone grown pretty strong by then in in the cities  and they decided to to help the rabbi leave the city  sort of almost abduction  and Baruch Shidis   we learned later on was a Jewish journalist  he was instrumental in arranging for this  the removal of the rabbi from the city  so to prevent him from providing the lists  and also give a message to the Jews of Athens that theyre in danger.

I was 13 years old when the war broke out and by the time I was liberated I was  um  four-four yearsŠ three and a half years in a ghetto because I was born near the German border so the Germans arrived at the same  the first day  and schools were obsolete for Jewish children.
And of course by the -- by the time it came to 1952  or fi -- or 51 and -- and 5 2 negotiations  by that time of course  Ben Ferencz and I were involved out of the operation in Germany itself of the successor organization  78 and we worked with all these people because the American Jewish Committee and the World Jewish Congress.
I mean  he said  this was the Germans tried to misrepresent the Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1  2010 71Red Cross  that this was a a Jewish co mmunity  self-governed by the Jews to while they should not be in Germany  they could be in a community of their own  but this was just a showpiece.

So from that point of view  I had an opportunity to do things during those unus ual periods of time  which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in Haifa University  and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics.

Our governess  the people who took care of us were not Jewish.
Do any of the women that you were with -- There were a couple of Jewish sisters  they were taken out and they were beaten  and one they told me was put in a very hot bath  and then a very cold bath  and the other one came back totally deaf  they had beaten her with the leg of a table  and her drums were broken  and so -- but then  the Jewish people went right away to Westerbork  and then no one saw -- but -- So these Jewish women were with you  or they were in another part of the -- 89 No  they were in my barrack for a few days.
But  fo r the Jew  the most important was to get USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 21 back on their feet  yeah.
And that she's Jewish  and  uh  I never saw her there anyway.
But on the other hand  I had found my inner Jewish belonging  mainly as a result of the school that I went to and which gave me inner strength and to some extent compensated for that.

The second is a scholarly work about the history of 40 Jewish communities in a particular region of Hungary that he is currently writing.
So when it came to a Jewish holiday  we didnt even know.
But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish background in a small place  where everybody knew you  they were beginning to look for a move to a bigger place  where they might be more anonymous.
And thats a house where I heard a lot of Jewish language.
Did you think before going to Berlin as a Jew that maybe you shouldnt go?

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 28 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: DL: The Jewish polices was um--um the same as any police force.
As a matter of fact  Jewish police leadership was killed one time.
They went out and destroyed everything  every Jewish store  plundered it.
It was when someone when they wanted to scare you because yo u were Jewish  they brought in strangers from outside the town.
Oh  here was already a Jewish organization  because they were all Jews in the camp.
1936 uh things started to deteriorate as far as Jewish people were concerned and the Third Reich and it became le ss pleasant in the classroom.
Had you ever when you were playing with hi m had he ever said a nything about you being Jewish?
Wh en I came I was always a Jew  but not religious  until when our son was born and started to grow  I knew that I need to give him religion and the way I feel  I will not help him.
The house next to us  they fo und a partisan -- not a Jew  a partisan -- they burned the house with the people  the partisan  everybody in it.
And that Jewish people here in New York could not have it  could not find it in their hearts to believe what I was talking about  I found it indescribable.
How did that make you feel  as a Jewish young man?
Were you comfortable with them  because up to that point you said you know obviously you had only been with Jewish Most of my friends were still Jewish but I had some nonJewish .
They sent the Jewish forced laborer... they  they wore armband and the star  but they went ahead of the...of the soldiers  of the Hungarian or German soldiers  and so that if they were mined ahead of them.
We knew in Poviac which was the most wholesome prison in Warsaw that they had some Jewish families that had American --.
The orphanage was very cooperative and the orphanage was also supp orted by Jewish organizations from the outside  particularly the American Joint Di stribution Committee.
And every year when the students come and those who came from Jewish parents  they had to walk through a court on both sides anti -Semites and they would just run and be beaten.
And two Russians were started in business  because I was  at that time I think  president of the Jewish Federation  and I went to the airport to greet two im when we took at every community at that time  took it upon themselves to resettle some Russian Jews that were able to get out of Russia where there was a lot of anti-Semitism at that time in the Soviet Union .
They may be people who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much la ter  this was much later -- or they were the inmates  although very few of them went there.
Were they chosen by the Jewish community or were they chosen by the German?
He was a religious person and he wanted to know what ha why did the Jew why did they do it to Jews  he would ask me.
And later on my father chided me for it and said  si nce that will be read by a Ge rman examination commission that was a mistake that I did that  it might harm me and I said  we ll  the people know who I am  I am a Jew and they know that  that's a Jewish school  so anyway  my father was always very concerned with such things.
The other one was not historically a Jewish area and was on the other side of town.
I started to give concerts of Jewish content  of synagogue contents  let's say  in the state radio in Belgrade.
A  theyre poor  B  theyre not interested  C  they would rather have houses built there than have a Jewish cemetery  because whos here?
And they took a machine gun and they killed the Jewish people.
There was a Hebrew gymnasium in town and from now on  any Jewish boy who wanted to go to gymnasium  will go to Hebrew gymnasium.
Because the Jewish cemetery was being destroyed already  the stones  but not all of it.
That was the Jewish people who had the business in their hand  they thought.
But  of course  there's uh...now there's there's no  hardly any Jewish left in...I don't know what they're using the building for  but it was beautiful.
But she had to rush I should tell you that there were a lot of Jewish young men that ha d joined the resistance up in the mountains.
And that is  of all these betrayals that were talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government  what was left of it  betrayal by the  you know  small group of lets say refugees from tsarist Russia  who liked the idea of Russian domination  even if it was with their internal enemies before  betrayal by the Jewish community  or betrayal by Lithuanian Gentile Lithuanians  ethnic Lithuanians  who were communists themselves.
The only way -- because Peppy could read Yiddish and she pointed out very discreetly  so that other people cannot see what were looking at and she showed me that there were Jewish names and I -- I dont know what else was on it  but there were messages in Yiddish.
Because she didn't want a Jewish lady to drink coffe e in Kretinga.
And she wa -- had to tell who -- to whom she got th e food parcel and she got the food parcel to a Jewish family  because she said they didnt have anything.
The only danger was that somebody recognized her or was suspicious whethe r she is a hidden Jew.
Nobody used to come in if some a neighbor came in  or they kn ew I they knew Im Jewish.
Try to come uh I think in two weeks or one w eek or two weeks  and we'll have a meeting of our people we are trying to organize  a Jewish uh committee.
I want to ask you  before we -- because this getting married brings up the subject of -- of where you get married  which brings up the subject of identity as a religious Jew.
We had an uncle who lived in the same town who was also the teacher in the Jewish school.
Well  I hadn't seen a Jewish girl since I left in January  we weren't together  I forget my first and look at Jewish girl.
In other words  I was attached to Major Kone  who was Judge Advocate Department when he came in for the pictures and everything and I was attached to his...I was relieved....I was taking pictures...which my pictures went to the Allied Supreme Headquarters  and went to the Nurember g trial over that  and  uh  what I wanted to do...I wanted to leave a little legacy of this to remind the youngest Jewish children that it did happen because I witnessed it  and I was there.
I know you can't do anything wrong feeding the pigs  so here I was  a nice little Jewish girl who doesn't eat any pork  feeding the pigs.
And they -- they take me to another hos-hospital and then I got a hospi tal with a nice Jewish doctor from New York 61 and he says  Im going to send you home.
Never mind that the Jewish person wouldn't go 15 back to Poland at all.
But if my theory turns out to be incorrect  the Americans will say Im German and the Germans will say Im Jewish.
So  here I was 14:11:30 in a DP camp with Polish popul ation listening to a lot of anti-semitic comments  time and again  with most of them or all of them not knowing that I was also Jewish.
I pretend that I I am when I left I didnt tell her that I am Jewish.
One of the few places that had opened its doors to Jewish refugees  a thing that obviously did not occur in the United States or in most other countries.
That was a -- more like a tradition  you know  if you want to buy some thing you go in a Jewish store  you know  you buy  you know  you get good deal  you know?
Bu t I just couldnt get rid of the feeling that those were White Russians and how many of them had their hands soiled with Jewish blood  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 71 just because of hatred of unknown people  that the Nazis allowed them  get rid of your Jews.
But she said  ﬁthat's okay.ﬂ And then I thought and how this might I said  \ Can you tell me where is here a Jewish family.
Like one child asked the father  ﬁAm I a Jew too?ﬂ He was Jewish like he didn't know.
And I recall something about they decide to give the space and other space available was the Jewish community center and start to organize the first high school in the  in our town.
They asked us how the ritual is in Jewish  how we make.
>> Halina Peabody: Well  what happened -- ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 >> Susan Snyder: In the Jewish community  I should say.
I got married and my in-laws they were Jewish too  and I let them circumcise my two sons.
He says  \ Yes  we took over a Jewish house   and we a house  and we...yal  over there 8 boys and you are the first girls what they show up.\
So it was winter  and it was a very  very big storm  and -- and it was -- the voyage was terrible  it took over tw o weeks  and during that trip  the boiler broke in -- in the ship  it was a old liberty ship  and it took us over 12 - 14 days  and it was the -- everybody was very si ck  especially I was very sick that I was -- and also  the DPs  the -- the Jewish people didnt get the choice locations.
There may have been so me [indecipherable] Jews among them  there may have been Jewish Communists  Jewish Social Democrat  Jewish Trade Unionists  whatever  but they werent -- not until -- not until the burning of the synagogues in November of 1938 were there rarge -- large round-ups of Jews who were placed in concentration camps.
I -- you know  I just -- see  I never emphasized or made a big issue of being Jewish.
Until '42  in September  Succot h  this was the second day of (COUnter# 450) Succoth  they came in at night three men only to (Counter# 453) this was the outskirt of Ulan ow and they killed  in every Jewish house they killed people  together it was 33 people.
That in...we just played around in the place where one of the children lived; but later he transferred us--like Jewish scouts--in a place which they called U[Ma'adon ] U  which means U[louder ]U. And there I started to get to know with the history and what they want to try to make: that they should be in a Jewish stat e  we should have a home our own.
And then on -- after the liberation of Brussels  some of the -- the workers of my father  who were still in -- i-in touch with him  because as you know  what happened w ith this factory and many Jewish similar factory  in order for the German not to -- to take over -- you know  my father sold the -- the business to -- to them  you know  okay?
A. -- to the importance of the fight for the esta blishment of a Jewish state.
So we went and we started to get together those dead people on the wagons to take them to the Jewish cemetery.
And while he was in Amsterdam to get his visa  or permit  whatev er  he ran into a German Jewish attorney who knew the immigration laws.
Were the Jewish police in the ghetto good or were they not good?
I have a picture of it  and I provided that to the museum to show that this was a uniform which little Hungarian boys  whethe r they were Jewish or not  wore.
And we didn't look Jewish  let's put it that way... no characteristics  nothing like that.
I -- I -- I dont think thats the fault of being Jewish.
In the morning  when they open the boxcars  there came a Jewish crew that was working and the Germans and the dogs  the whole circus.
All synagogues  all Jewish business was de stroyed  windows broken  stolen merchandise.
I had  for example a very -- I have still  to this day  very clear memories of not being able to move about without wearing a jacket that had the Jewish star on it.
>> Al Munzer: So Jewish mal e children were more difficult to place.
These men were all the leaders  the Jewish leaders in the community.
Well  if you were to if this if here were standing on stage at the Rubinstein auditorium  but lets say the audience here would be these seats would be filled with people who had come from Germany   Jewish refugees  their children  their grandchildren.
So one of the key questions that I often ask somebody is  before they even get to Europe   did you meet anybody who was Jewish.
Its probably Tova  which again sounds both modern and Hebraic  Gittel is the Yiddis h. Tova is already a sign of modernity in its modern Jewish form.
And -- and ni -- in 39  Jewish refugees from Poland -- Theyre coming  yeah. --
We had found out later after the war that the guy who escaped already had gotten enough information from Jewish inmates to know where his family might have hidden something  and so he was considered a millionaire  he knows where the treasures are hidden.
So I took her on the side  and I told her  \ You know I want to tell you a story  but you have to tell...to swear me on your scout's honor that you will not tell nobody...uh ...what's the true stor y. I am a Jewish girl  and I have false identification paper and nobody's supposed to know it.\
I just found out  after the liberation  that the whole world stood idly by and watched the annihilation of the Jewish people  men  women and child  concentration camps  gas chambers  wagons with gas and no one lifted a finger or a warning  even  to the Germans  to stop the killing.
You mentione d that you thought that the Jewish population of Biaystok was maybe 30 percent  but after truly afterwards Interview with Barbara Syska October 22  2014 22you [indecipherable] half.
Well  my main objective  like I told you  was to rescue that little boy because the boy stayed in a home  in a Polish home where he was worki ng at the soldier's home and the landlady discovered him being Jewish.
He was when a Spanish man on the Jewish court was rude Dr. Elkes can appeal to Dr. Elkes and he can change it or annul it for   but he would never  never did he did he did he did he take advantage of his rights.
And believe it or not  they were connected to a man who was the court Jew to the queen.
They just jumped into the water and fought around  just jumped into the water and swam the little place intending to look for Jewish places where they could hide  but soon the took over the distribution.
But bear in mind that this was a period that the -- the coming out of -- of Jewish  young Jewish people  coming out of the O-Orthodox confines  you know  and embracing the culture and -- and the type of living that was  you know  in the process of developing.
Soon after that I was ordered to England and since I was still the only free  that is non-assigned to a division  Jewish chaplain  I was ordered to the American Military Cemetery at Brookwood in Surry  not far from London  and I was uh stationed with the American detachment uh who took care of burials at their uh quarters in the town of Wilking .
I dont know if you remember with Belvin  they didnt let the Jewish people to Palestine  we protested  and we wrote in.
A lot of Jewish of ficers were among these Polish officers and they were killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army.
They came in  it was just before the Jewish holidays  and they settled themselves to the best houses  which they occupy half of my zaydes house  my grandfathers.
This is th e JWV  Jewish center wher e the GIs met with the Jewish girls and we had our salami and coke   salami sandwich and coke.
I am a Jew  so I don't listen to you any longer.'\
These were Jewish people who were  kind of a ghetto police  came to our place  and they had a lis t  and I was on that list  and they were going to take me to a labor camp in Germany.
But there were  most of my very good friends at Duke were Jewish.
Greater Palestine  and that was can assa ssinate those Jews  and after having suffered what I have suffered  et cetera  kill a fellow Jew?
I am a little influenced maybe by the newsletters I get from the different organizations  Jewish organizations  with pictures.
We camped  from time to time we met people from Bielskyotrout  which was a Jewish group.
feelings about Jewish athletes in other countries who did participate– Well there are two trends of thoughts.
Okay  so a lot of your friends were both Jewish and non-Jewish?
So each one of our children had 10 years of Jewish education  but somewhere during that time  when they were old enough -- not when they were six year s old  or five years old  I told them about the Holocaust  and my background.
While going there to look for a place that we had to move into the ghetto  we walked into some of the abandoned houses that Jewish people leave before and the blood that we saw in the beds; beds unmade; cribs full with blood stains--in the cribs and that was right after the Germans came in.
>> Irene Weiss: And so I remember the tremendous -- the Jewish people  women  children  everyone  are shot down in the forest.
So I was sent to  what do you call that ...a trade school  which was kind of shame because there weren't any Jewish kids in trade schools.
62 I used to remind my colleagues and some of my Jewish friends  you know  who used to say every -- every good German is every dead German  you know  that type of thing.
As a Jew he could never own any land  but because he was a very good businessman  he leased forests and then they would cut them up for lumber.
You want to... and you hear you're gonna have a Jewish state  you know.
I could not understand it as of today  and I know there are very many Jewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks.
When I read and I do get and the Jewish publication and see what's going on on the campuses  what's going on in Germany.
I think the difference in some upbringing  the religious difference -- she comes from a essentia lly sectarian home  Jewish but sectarian  and I didnt.
And the leaders of the Jewish communities  you know  who were in the uh...the underground resistance movement in...in Romania.
>> Al Munzer: Yeah  especially since Jewish  male children  traditionally  the first milestone in their life is to -- is the circumcision ceremony eight days after their birth.
Because uh the young people  they had...there were this dreadful measures against Jewish people and Jewish students.
So the the where you lived  was it mainly a Jewish neighborhood?
The building which we lived  as Bill showed already  was a Jewish building.
So she told me there are no Jewish names because there is no record of it  that Jews were sent to Auschwitz.
She got it across very well  because I never forgot it and of course we are very much -- were very much -- not that we feel Jewish  we are Jewish to the core.
They felt by enrolling them in a Catholic school and having them par ticipate in all of the things that students did in the Catholic school  perhaps this was one way of protecting them and hiding their Jewish identity.
And I dont care if you are a Jew or gentile  blac k  white  yellow  whatever you are  I dont care  I dont mean you in person  the people you see.
>> Bill Benson: During the time  Fred  when you moved to the Jewish school  that was a much better time for you in school.
They definite ly had  and the older one looked like Jewish girl.
Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back  so it didnt help.
It was enough if it was great -great -great grandfather was Jewish  you were still Jewish.
And he was waiting for the train and a Hungarian Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10  2014 5 man went to the SS and said there is a Jew.
That rabbi  I dont know should I mention his name  or not mention his name   I hear him at the same times  one Sunday on the radio  where he comes out because he was the one of the creators of Outreach program  which it means to bring Jewish kids back.
But Heinz was caught and he was then sent to Westerborg as a Jew.
And this is for the Th-That is its a [speaks German] Right  the Jewish community.
Had already  you know  gotten things from the various Jewish organizations and had sort of pulled themselves together  but here was the possibility of going to the United States  so wow  great.
They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the fi rst American Jew that they had run into.
Subjects but the population in Lodz had to pay a tax to the Jewish geminder because they were hiring the rabbis were paid by the  by the geminder .
So  I ran outside looking where she is and they told me they saw her going out from the ghetto toward the Plazov camp  who was built over there on Jewish cemetery.
At each gate you had three policemen  a German  a Polish and a Jewish policeman.
And it was through the good graces of some Polish residents in the area on the Polish side discovered that there was a Jewish family in jail  that they were able to influence and release us from jail.
So but that really hurt  because in a way I knew that the reason for it because I was a Jew  but its very hard for children to accept.
And where in Turkey -- how long -- We came to Izmere in Turkey  to Izmere  and from Izmere  we go to -- from Izmere  we go directly with train to Halab  and from Halab  I told you befo re  the English troops catch us like illegal residents because it was the white book  because the English doesn't give the Jewish come to Palestine.
She got us a paper from the commandant of Belgium  Antwerp  who supposedly had a Jewish girlfriend that -- that she knew.
So you -- they had no idea that you were Jewish?
>> Al Munzer: Well  unfortunately  the husband and wife in tha t family had a fight  and the husband denounced his wife to the Germans as hiding two Jewish children  and so they took his wife and my two sisters.
Jewish people in general are not fighter  unless you go in Israel and they did what they did.
Then  the Germans took over these Jewish --- QW: Was he in Hungary still or  I m ean in Czechoslovakia still or --- No  he was in Poland and in Russia and all over the place  all over the place.
That was the night  the last night after that  no Jew was left in Kolomyja.
4 Well  you were always at risk especially  you know  on ce we start wearing the Jewish star  but -- well  fortunately  I -- I  personall y  my parents  we were never really bothered too much by that.
Since the Jewish community in Zagreb was oriented toward Austria and the German-speaking Europe  Italy was the place to go for a vacation maybe.
So for about a month the Jewish community lived in relative peace.
And he put this long knife to my neck and said  \ You see  if you were Jewish  I would cut off your head.\
In Lodz we moved in a neighborhood also -- predom -- predominantly Jewish -- Jewish. --
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 25 Not really  not but in Poland was a attitude  you just keep Jewish  you know  even you wasnt Orthodox.
What kind of rules that the Jew may not do that  the Jew may not go to the street  just at certain times and we had to use the yellow star.
Somebody from not my class but another class  called me Jude itsich  which was a Jew Jew bastard  whatever  during recess in the schoolyard.
Just because they weren't Jewish o r... Yeah  I think we were  they weren't Jewish and we had all these restrictions  you know  on going this and going that  and so it was very hard and they didn't understand any of it.
We were basically uh we were basically conditioned to to to obey the laws and the restrictions  the demands  until early in 1942 uh the ghetto was established in in and uh slowly the various uh Jewish communities both in the town and the neighborhood  the villages were compelled to leave all possessions behind and move to the ghetto  so in the spring of 1942 my family uh was required to move to the ghetto and the ghetto was in the oldest part of town.
That was an emigration department of the Jewish council  and the resettlement would take place in the ea st  where that was  we didnt know.
And I said well wasn't the interested in the final solution so called of the Jewish person to applied to be anywhere Jews were a railroad could be found even in the far East.
Did you  your brothers and sisters  go to private Jewish schools or did you go to public schools or --- by the Czechs we went to public school.
Everybody -- everybody who had the position  he -- and th-they were th -- replaced by -- by this me mber of party  that member of party  and -- and these Jewish boys who were structural engineers before  who took me with them  they left br -- just do -- just -- th ey were afraid that that were -- will be kicked out.
So and then I was going with some young peoples  unknown peoples who were always gether toge tog gether together with [indecipherable] are a Jew.
Well  the propaganda  I mean  the the radios were blaring that it was a Jewish conspiracy  that Jews left their lights on their buildings to show where the where the city was  because of course we had blackouts at at night.
Even in factory  in Jewish factory where the people they owned the factory  also Jews  they didn't want to employ Jewish people.
In addition to work h-here in FDA in the 60s  I became very involved in Jewish organizations.
Its the world at -- its that -- its the Jewish -- the Jewish world I dont know.
People started to work  some people started to work in Jewish agencies for the American government.
Its hard to lead a Jewish life because all the issues for me.
And he again f -- instead of talk ing y-y-you know  he started talking to -- I think he started initially speaking Polish  and then  when he saw that I was Jewish  he grabbed me and started to speak German to me.
And then the Swiss government and the Swedish govern ment asked the Germans  \ But how do we know if there are any Jewish people among those people? \  \

When they came in...the police came in...there was some Jewish police came with them.
On the way they passed a park or so on the way  when suddenly Polish kids started to shout  a Jewish girl  a Jewish girl.

And I remember that we organized  my father tried to organize  to have a weekly meal with somebody of the Jewish community.
And he did try to protect the Jewish po pulation especially  and fought the -- the Nazis in the city continuously.
Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2  2010 6 And in terms of secular languages  di d the Jewish community speak Hungarian or Romanian?
Its not a very either German or Austrian or even Jewish name.
So being able to now (A) to defeat them if necessary  or to withstand attacks by them  would in some ways help the Jewish people inin the Soviet Union. (
Jewish people lived there probably for longer than many other places  because in Bendzin there was a castle  which was built by King Casimir.
Peoria was a small town  with very pretty -- with a very affluent Jewish population.
They can only eat this special food which American communities  Jewish communities are sending for our people here.ﬂ \ This is not for resale?\
Of course he was talking about Isaac and Abraham and Isaac and the sacrifice that didnt take place but I think every Jew feels that and so you worry that your children and then it extends even to your grandchildren.
So the Jewish commun ity was still somehow overseeing you  taking care of you and the others?
And it was real Jewish hospitality that was known before the war which was absent during the war and again  you know  it was like slowly coming back to life.
And uh  the Lithuanian guards  the Lithuanian part--the Lithuanian partisans  Lithuanian soldiers  machine gunned them and then covered them up with tractors with earth  and earth had moved for three days  with the tractors and run over them to squeeze out the last breath  and when uh the front came closer   and start undigging them  and the same prisoner  pl-uh Russian and Jewish prisoners were still there  they found laying there  mothers with children wrapped around together  and they died together in the common grave.
I think the Jewish congregation gave us some bread and soup  or whatever there was.
Ive got the numbers actually  Ive got the  got a book with all the numbers of  but I  at least half the Jewish population.
I dont think this is possible for a Jewish girl  or a Jewish woman to do.
As it happens  my father has a ve ry close associate  a fr -- an old -- an old friend who was from -- from Warsaw  Jewish doctor  a woman who survived the war  whose parents did not.
So their laws were made  and carried out against Jewish citizens  depriving them of their civil rights and their freedom.
In 1939  and then 1941  and many professions -- many professions  Jewish  were eliminated.
Yeah  we wore yellow stars so they should know who is a Jew  and we walked on the street too  not on the sidewalk  between the street and the sidewalk.
Well this is very strange because both my families  both my parents families were Jewish and in both cases they knew each other for a long time.
But if not that woman  maybe they will stay til after the war or maybe a few months  but it was not a Jewish neighborhood and all the people knew each other and they wo uld never squeal like she did.
The synagogue got closed down  the Jewish school got closed down.
And the eveni ng -- and we were the only Jews there  no other Jewish family at all.
And this handful of Jewish people lived with the Gentile families  like we did.
A cholen is a traditional Jewish meal which you put in potatoes and beans and meat in a pot and it stays for 24 hours  it cooks.

For me it wasnt anything new and I wasnt going to marry a Jew anymore.
Now Berlin is becoming not so easy to live in as a Jew  even though theres a larger Jewish population.

And then later on when we started to feel that there is something going on  us as children  we went on Shabbat Saturday afternoon we went for a walk and we were singing some kind of Jewish song  and the first time that lots of the town people started to scream ﬁdirty Jew go to Palestineﬂ. At that time Israel was called Palestine.
So one called the other one to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back.
If a Jew had to wear the yellow star  he was set aside...he was set apart from the community.
Well  Im thinking  did you ever go to streets that were maybe the baker  or there would be a tailor  or you would see lik e streets that would be particularly  you know  more Jewish  in the Jewish section of town  or or neighbors who might be around.
And I tried to ta lk to him  Im Jewish  Im Jewish  no  no.
But we went to school in [indecipherable] to public school  he went to public school and I went to pub lic school and they there were a few Jewish children.

But where would they have found German speaking people who wanted to do spec ial and hazardous duty  if it had not been for refugees that were Jewish and German speaking.

There was a -- an official Jewish agency that was responsible to the [indecipherable] forces  but -- and my uncle worked for them.

When they attacked the synagogues and set uh fire to the synagogues  smashed the Jewish shops   vandalized everything they could lay their hands on  beat adults and children when whenever they found someone because by that time adults and children above the age of ten I think or twelve  I'm not sure  had to have a Jewish star so you immediately could identify who was Jewish and who wasn't.
And most of the neighbors on our street were Jewish  was fair -- heavily Jewish because Lvov actually had a population of 110 000.
Every Jew that left Germany was entitled to what we call today $10.
You know  without much understanding of the Jewish religion  you have this 12 year old child  who wasnt given any explanation very much  coming from a religion that is much warmer and softer; it seemed to me much more tolerant of children.
But well  from -- from the understanding  ma -- from my understanding  they got like an excuse  they never know that its Jewish boy  they ne-never check it.
We had a cutter in that shop and our bosses name was Stigel  that was a German Jew.
And strangely enough  this was an MP lieutenant who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of Jewish background.
So -- What a -- what about the conduct of European Jews who -- like the -- the Jewish councils  the -- th-the people who -- I dont know if you had any encounter in -- in your hometown where there must have be en Jews who were in charge of the ghetto?
I had one very [indecipherable] and with another ca -- in a Jewish house.
Also  in the ground floor of the building there were -- it was customary in European cities there were stores and one happened to be a beer hall and that was not the best because when I slept at night I could hear them sing songs like \ Jewish bl ood spurts from the knife  life is twice as good.\
The interesting thing is that the Germans  the Germans and the Ustasa all kept the Jewish community functioning.
Boycotts in front of the store  dont buy from the Jew  et cetera.
And decided we go to  we decided we 26 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 27 Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds 22 going to  we going to escape from  from Hungary to  to Austria first  and then  then Germany.

There was a famous Jewish doctor who was the head of the American Medical Association in the United States.
And so you were only at this Jewish school in Cologne for a very brief time?
And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh what will happen with the Jewish population  so we get a little breathe  and uh to change the government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced that what is stopped  the deportation  so it was a little bit out from the immediately danger  but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead.
That's a Dutch name for \ Jew\  But you could not pin them on.
German Jewish people who Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 48 Okay.
They sent them out and brought them to our town and they were all in town kind of like 100 families or so  put in one big Jewish organization hall and they built some   they lived in horrible situation.
I wa s a member with her of the National Council of Jewish Women.

A lot of Jewish  as well Jewish U.S. soldiers  Russian soldiers and Im not sure but I something in my back of the mind  I Im su re that the midwifes stepdaughter  who was a photographer  I believe she took pictures.

These were eventually assembled in a big warehouse in Wiesbaden in the custody of the United States Army  and they in turn turned it over to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of which I was the director.

And I came to the headquarters of the Jewish fighting organization on Zamenhofa.
But it lists every Jewish name  every Jewish household  and a street address  and had an introduction  which is quite voluminous  to explain the position on all of the Jewish community in Berlin   and some of the people who were exceptionally well-known  including Albert Einstein .
The police was assigning to each wagon  you know  a person in charge  and I say my father was the most e ducated person in that place and he was a really respectable-looking man  but they took the Italian worker who was drunk and uneducated and put him in charge because  he said it openly  ﬁI'm not going to put any Jew in charge of a wagon.ﬂ So that was the thing.
The police officer -- it was a station that no Jew want ed to go to.
I belong -- you know  I was giving to the Jewish -- United Jewish Appeal since 1958.
And -- and the one Jewish girl  her mother ma -- married a -- a Jew  and her mother was -- she said that  ﬁIf I lived at that tim e in Europe ﬂ she said  ﬁthats what they will do to me  too  even though.ﬂ I said yes.
We ha d an form engineer  a Jew who knew how to defuse bombs  who learned it apparently in there  and in other teams which just had to be somebody in the team of five people to dig up bombs who had to defuse the bomb and some of them went off.

The law was very specific that every Jew as defined by the Nure mberg laws has to wear such a yellow star on his outer clothing whenever the person is in public  a nd it specified even exactly where it had to be worn  on the left hand side at about the level of the heart and also it couldn't be tagged on by pins or safety pins  bu t had to be firmly sewn on  and this way they wanted to avoid that people might put on a star and then later on take it off again and 49 the Gestapo was known to walk up to Jews with a star and sort of try it with their hand  with their fingers to get under it to see whether there is a space between the star and the garment to make sure that it was firmly sewn on.
So he ma make like close his eyes  he knew they are Jewish.
Others used to take the the the clothi ng and never bring back not not the clothing  not the bread  and this were brought to the to the Jewish court  you see  so so so people took parcels for Pnina and they never gave it to her.
So they were [indecipherable] they were policemen that they -- they used -- that they used by the Germans as Jewish police to keep order or carry out  you know  some of the orders that the Germans use d  especially in rounding up people  you know  for -- for the labor camps and checking documents and so forth.

[AG] If we could  used to pass them food  what we could spare  pass them bits...

And some of the Germans  Ukrainian and also the Jewish from the red kommando. \
Anyhow  from that school I graduated into the Jewish school of the fine arts  by the way  also been a pupil  uh  and later I went to  we ought to now reach 1940  uh  1940.
They will ki ll us because the Jew didn't show up and this.

The Jewish community was small and the existing schools were Catholic.
Now you have to understand that here was a Jewish girl  sixteen years old  speaking to a German  to a man wearing a German uniform saying I love you and I'm not going to let you die.
It's a beginning of a new approach to the Je ws  but you see here the.. all these indications show that certainly the Jewish catastrophe was not seized in all its terrible dimensions and it had certainly not priority in the considerations of the vatican at the time.
There is a couple here  theyre not Jewish  very nice couple who whom I met at some friends house.
They were not  in that respect  not like Europeans  who are so much for education -- Jew -- I mean  European Jews.
But had there been a Jewish state in the 30s and 40s  I am convinced that there would not have been a Holocaust.
Interviewer: The reason I was asking  those questions about yo ur father was that in July  1940  the Nazis ordered that all Jewish patients in mental hospitals  and in wards and in clinics and so forth  be removed and sent to be killed.
Could be that we Mother mentioned that she she has to go there to to that  and work  or or or on a market day  there are Lithuanian herring barre l. There is the Jewish barrel  there is some other barrel.

He gave me some food  whatever he had and he kept me till dark but he told me that...exact...he gave me an exact that over there and there are Jewish families  in the woods hiding  from another city  .
So I went th ere to him and I said Mr. Capolsky  or whatever his name was  yes I have a job  but I have to go to the Jewish unemployment to get the permission for you.
And so there were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses  one officer came and he said to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other.

The only country in Europe that if they saw you helping Jew  you could be shot on the spot.
By that time they knew wa they they knew I was Jewish.
And they were sometimes very...going to tell you a story about a Jewish girl.
And  uh  from a cult...cultural point of view  it was interesting that it was a library organized in the...in the...by the Jewish community  which each of us...almost each generation of boys and girls from the high school  they work as a volunteers in this library.
And I have a...such a painting of Esther of those people grabbing  you know  the the vegetables  garden  34the potatoes and and this is where they caught...the Jewish caught in the ghetto and they said   one of the bright spots of the ghetto  because Dr. Elkes tried to keep the ghetto not to turn into animals and not to eat one another so he tried Jews   for instance  those who grabbed the potatoes  they brought them to court.
Then in a couple of minutes  he...the police  in comes the owner from the...from the barn  and the policeman said in Ukrainian  [\ Sudeya Zhid zabir.ﬂ ] That means \ a Jew comes in your...came in your barn from the truck.ﬂ He begin to come...the policeman comes...they come l or 2...I don't know how many it was and comes in the...on steps and comes to watch me in the top.

SWB: Tell me about how the Jewish population in Feldafing organized itself and what kind of culture they did and did they make a newspaper?
When I speak with my friends from the east  uh there was also something that they called the youth movement and it's interesting when you meet the people who are who are came out of that  they have a certain special approach to to the Jewish community and to to life which I share very much with them.
The Jewish Council had the responsibility for the Hollandse Schouwburg--the theater where the Jews were brought to be sent to the camp of Westerbork.
And next to me was a woman who had a little child with her  a little girl  and she uh told me that the people who came to arrest them from in the hiding places said the same thing with the same words as the Jewish Council said...as those guys said who arrested us  \ Take your children with you.\

I see they are Jewish too  you know  they came from Israel  from Nazareth  from the -- Jesus Christ came from the dynasty of David the King.

As a matter of 40 fact there have been cases like I mentioned before the -- the 75 Jewish communists who returned to follow their families and there are two cousins of my father from Ioannina who were also on business on the day of the arrest  and they returned to Ioannina to be with their families in exile  and they never came back.
But if they catched you  that was...that would of be terrible  but... Then finally  you know  they closed Jewish stores  they started deporting Jewish... And uh I...I was home  and for a little... Yah  the thing was that I was registered Jewish in the Viennese Kultursgemeinde there.
So some of them were Jewish  and I remember ra you know  Mr. toris -- Terispolstis   wh-who was practicing w ith my father  and also Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 28had  you know  just a relation.
Was a Brooklyn Jewish kid  his name was Marda from Brooklyn  he had the car.
Her mother Jewish was atrocious Polish was atrocious  so she pretended that she was mute.
A Jew loss all his rights and therefore he was a person without rights.
W-We looked just like the rest of the kids  we didnt publicly appear -- I mean we did not appear Jewish in any way.
And for this reason I am working in Terezin  in it 's archive  in Prague  and I'm working also in my town  Berno   in the staff of Jewish society.
The Russian prisoners of war were marched -- that's what she told me  to the town and even when some of the non-Jewish -- well  the Jewish population couldn't but the non -Jewish population would offer them water  they would hit them with the rifle butts and would n ot let them accept the water.

And as a Jewish boy  maybe I got something that if they will take a look at this  they will found that I am a Jewish.
Did you meet many Jewish people after the war in the United States?
And  of course  it's very easy to determine if a man is Jewish or isn't  especially in those days so that my mother always did all the talking.
They didn't...and when they taking ou t four people to kill  then they supplement another four they brought in  so there's alwa ys twenty-six men in a cell  and then  of course  I learned over there about the liquida...about the beginning and the I found out what they decided  you know that they liquidate the  the  the Jewish people and about the liquidation of Warsaw ghetto.
At that time that was one of the last uh chance for the Jewish refugees but we were so used to uh this procedure that normally it was calm and it choose to be the same thing now.
At my grandfathers funeral a man walked up to my brother and I and said you cant hide from being Jewish.
Besides  I always fe -- I felt that I am Jewish.
The only thing that Id like to have you have them know  that our experiences over there and experiences since that time  have made made a non-Jewish person  and non-j most of our buddies that were over there with us  feel more sympathy for the Jewish race  and more more admiration for the Jewish race.
I was assigned to the second battalion of the Jewish Brigade group.
And every Friday night they would take me in thei r army vehicle a nd take me to the where we had a Jewish service.

Jews we re in charge of it  and the Jew -- the housing department had lists of the streets of the houses a nd how many square feet were available in each apartment or room.
He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- forced to perform some labor for the city  otts -- clean cities  or whatever.
He could feel rejected by them and the country  so he had a very  since then  he so to say P[person's name] admired the Je ws to politics and he became very  very generous as a donor for all kinds of Jewish and non-Jewish causes because he felt that he owed these people something.

They only knew each other in commercial situations  but not that I could go some somebody could sw ear yeah  I know this this Jew came from this and this place  or this.
But nonetheless  there were large numbers of people  some of whom Ive known among -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on  who thought  you know  this is a passing business  and now were -- and now were -- good Germans will -- will take care of this upstart over there because in other words  where th -- I f -- I forget about the world  but where -- where did the Jewish leadership?

But lucky for me  they didn't feel at all that I was a Jewish refugee  they told those people and we found out from the husband because he confided in those friends of my father  they thought I was planted there by Germans  they wanted to know how a Hungarian officer act during their regime.
Q. But the men who were taken away were just Jewish men?

And th ey could not recognize me or I am a Jew or a Gentile.
Only the women  we had a Jewish drugstore - pharmacist  so Jewish women but otherwise  Jewish women  well off  didn't work.
We didnt discuss it  I dont recall that -- I -- th-the one thing which  again  which is interesting in the context of how one views refugees today  when we arrived in England  they -- and I have these documents still  or booklets  wa -- they -- I dont know whether wh -- whether the Jewish agency gave them out  or whatever.
Its a very  very difficult situation there  but nevertheless  I feel that  as a Jew  Im very proud of Israel  what they have done.
The total amounts made available to persecutees come  basically  out of all sorts of sources  but I  I think  primarily  out of the sources that came from German y in connection with the Hague negotiations  which  at Vassanar in wh ich I participated in 1952 and '53  where we negotiated on behalf of both the government of Israel on the one side and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany on the other side  as the two Jewish organizations  negotiated  negotiated there.

The majority of movement was from the outskirts in  not from the ghetto out becau se very few gentiles lived in the middle of the town; the majority was Jewish.
So I think there is  as I said  I think being Jewish is being like a statehood  you know  its -- its -- its -- its a very special thing to me.
And I have a very good friend  Jewish friend with me  and he says  ﬁYou know  Rachelle  I have a good dermatologist  what about -- I think he can do that  he can take it off.ﬂ Because it was for me  it was so demeaning  for people to think that I put my -- Telephone number  yeah.

So  in the sixth sixth grade  there was this young  little Jew Jewish  smart  very smart girl.

A nd  and otherwise  people continued to eat and to write and there was established some possibilities to teach the children  mainly the parents but also some schools were  Jewish schools.
Very few  there was no gymnasium for Jewish women  there was only the gymnasium with the nuns  the Ursula nki nuns ran a Catholic  high sc hool for Catholic girls and all Polish girls were Catholic.
And so -- so all the Jewish kids were sort of pulled out of their s -- respective schools and told to go to this one school.
All the Jewish people did go down  the ones going to go to the gas chamber on this right  the one who is going to live a little bit  on the left.

So then the next day we...I was sitting with Dr. Elkes in the Jewish Committee.
The Hungarian friends were not Hungarians  they were Jewish  see it goes way back to the place was originally part of Austria-Hungary and part of  within Austria Hungary  it was part of Hungary and anybody who wanted to exist at that time  or get ahead had to learn Hungarian and that's where the Jews became sort of broken up.

But it became personally close to me during my embassy days  40 years late r. In Luxembourg there is an Amicale de Buchenwald  and these are Luxembourgers  some Jewish  non-Jews  some were deserters of the army  some were the parents of Luxembourgers who had been forced into the German army  who deserted and then the parents were thrown into the concentration camp  so we had a -- a 34 mix.
So getting together with them probably was the most enjoyable time  because they were just very warm  and very affectionate and very -- I -- it -- it -- its an amazing way to look back  that I didnt have anything ba d happening to me  or you know  theres some people that they were called a dirty Jew.
So that wasnt so great after awhile  but they were very dedicated to 4 helping the Jewish kids.
And there we there we got into some apartment that belonged to some Jewish pe ople.
How does one under -- I mean it -- It felt that the dark days are coming up on the Jewish people  and it will go from bad to worse.
And I had a friend who was ha lf Jewish  her father was Jewish.
There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish  whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people  and I knew about it and I was always radi cal.

They all got that address from Father   and then I got a couple of Jews and then I got another couple and then more and more and I never knew if they were Jewish or not  and I found places for them  and there was a baker.
And then we also said  we-ell  after they after them well go away because they were [indecipherable] girls coming  so we thought  oh  theyre gonna do with us the same thing they did with the Jewish girls  but they didnt.
Uh  and that was end of the Lithuanian uh Jewish people.

I was born in Vienna  Austria  on December the fifth  1909  and I had a good life and I worked in Vienna and when Hitler came on March the tenth  '38  I couldn't go back to work and I said okay   give me letter of recommenda tion so they said no  you're Jewish  no.

The way I understand that a Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the ghetto and our ghetto.
But there is also a mention that they had to go to Sieradz  which was the capital city  or whatever  district city  in order to get it  and Sieradz told him  okay  you you can do it for your Jewish community  wh ich was  if you also do it for the Sieradz community.

We were about 15 years Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 12 old  who looks like a Jewish girl  or not.

This organization had its seat in the same building and I believe ev en on the same floor as the American and World Jewish Congress to whom to whom all my reports went.
So they were somewhat familiar about the history of the Jews in that area  and they had studied about the they had sort of a course on comparative religion  so theyd study something about the Jewish religion as well.

She wanted to arrest the men  and they did; 30 000 Jewish men were put in concentration camps.
Does this -- does it -- its funny  my own perception is -- I mean  first of all  when I think about the -- the Jewish Holocaust and the number of people that were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 116 executed and the way it was done and theres the -- the whole -- I -- the only thing that I can think is hi -- i-is -- and a -- and it was one of the questions I asked you earlier  which was h-how did -- how did it escalate in -- in peoples minds -- y-you know  from the victims minds  how it escalated?
Would you describe...you've described the misery and the suffering  but can you describe to me what it was like for a Jew living under the Nazis at that point in tine?
You know  that -- at that time  that the insult that he was called a Jew and not a gentleman and that he had to s -- clean.
During that period  and in the month af ter that  we were interviewed almost on a weekly basis  by the Swiss government   the Swiss Red Cross  Swiss newspapers  Swiss radio stations  Jewish organizations in Switzerland  America  Canada  Australia and South America.
So you had a very tight-knit Jewish community in your town?
So we came together in th e center of the town  and then when they got all of us  they took usŠthey chased us like cattle near the Jewish cemetery.
And I sent my money to -- as much as I could to Jewish American Congress  and to the Shoah Foundation and to the Holocaust Museum  36 dollars  which supposed to have some significance because its twice 18  which 18 is life  [indecipherable] which I learned.
I was going ther e as a Jewish American athlete  but as an athlete basically.
The there was a a Jewish agency that that helped at the beginning.
But so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he did have housing and he had a German  non -Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which is very weird.
And he said to me  ﬁYou know  even not being Jewish  I had no conscious  because you were so innocent  I couldnt do it.
And they were in the one incident I remember it was in the day time when a soldier was beating a religious Jew with the payes (gestures with finger a circular motion) and he was beaten very badly  very badly.
So it was nevertheless a Jewish school -- Yeah  that's right. --
The the cardinal of Austria  Innitzer  welcomed Hitler as  you know  the native son returning to his country and so forth  and and it seemed so unbelievable  how overnight something as dramatic a-as a as giving away everything and becoming a devoted Nazi  a-and the Jewish people going to be the target  you see  because we Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17  2010 30heard it con-consistently  with the editor of the newspapers  or ev ev everything became pro-Nazis  a-and you saw no opposition whatsoever.
When she took us in  this Jewish people what they were hiding there  went away from her because the whole town know that she has Jews.
In other words  we were still sort of free  but we have to abide by the rules of the Germans and...  but we were moving around freely in the area of our confinement; and we were still together  which was the most important thing  my parents and my brother and I. And we...our lives were still sort of normal because we were able to get together with friends  with relatives  and amazing thing that all through our confinements in the ghetto or in a work camp or even in concentration camp is the fact that... uh...we were...  the Jewish population always had a sense of...of wanting to learn...of wanting...of...you know  wanting to have knowledge  so we did not stop.
The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you might compromise the whole place.
And thats how we went  and thats -- it was very interesting because I never told them in Interview with Esther Dezube December 7  2000 29the group that I was Jewish.
Now he -- I told him I was a Jew  and he became the rabbi in Krakow  he was not from Krakow  he became the rabbi  and every time something happened  he came to me  he told me this.

And he told me a little bit about the Maikovskis case  and about the problems with the Maikovskis case  and he explained to me that the members of the special litigation unit in Washington  D.C.  which had been formed the year earlier  1977  and which had recently  in the spring of 1978 expanded to a staff of approximately four lawyers  two paralegals and one part-time historian  needed someone w ho was based in New York  who could conduct research in the archives in New York  the main one of which was the Yiddish institute for Jewish research  which at that time was located on the corner of East 81 st Street  and I believe it was Fifth Avenue.
I wasn't c oncerned at all whether these children went to Jewish or non-Jewish families and this was largely due to the fact that I think that those people had been out in Prague and those people knew what I was doing  Martin Blake and Doreen Wariner and all that were very conscious of the urgency which one could see out there.
One Jew became a trappist and then a girl also became a nun and they were also arrested and killed.
But  you see  even after the war  for something as terribly important as a Jewish cemetery in a town th at had all this population obliterated  there isnt a sign that there was Jewish community there except for the cemetery  and that was my project from the beginning  Pola Frank ( ph) and I were saying: Here you have the pictures  here is what it looks like  the houses were being built on the cemetery  first the Germans took the tombstones to pave roads  then the Poles brought their homes closer and closer.
So they had some big idea we are going to supply  we are going to include a triangle under your number for Jewish women.
And this we were  ever ything was okay  but we had to put our names in a Jewish  they knew we were there  our name wa s there.
I had to pass a little section where onl y Polish people live and as I was walking some youngsters would attack Jewish guys.
And so eight days later ou r family gathered in our living room and observed this first milestone in a Jewish life  probably the last such ceremony held in the city I was born in The Hague.
They just had done it first on the Jewish cemetery  but then when there's no room anymore  they had done it in the ghetto  and the ghetto was life  in between the killings  going on semi-normal.
A fair maybe -- some percentage  I know you di-didnt went around to survey who is a Jew  who is not a Jew.
They are going to church and the Jewish people are going to the temple.
And as young kids  they met  fell in love  and both families didnt want to have anything to do with them  because one was Catholic family  and the other one was a Jewish Orthodox.
The two buddies that I had  Jewish boys  Elliot Bass and Abe Corn.
Papa went down and one of these Nazis kids came up  the Hungarian  and he says  \ Hey you bloody Jew  do you have any papers?\
There was all these boys and girls  and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade  who brought food and drink  and they took us for weekends  and I joined this Zionist group.
Of course they changed but you  main thing in a Jewish family is your family.
And you were not permitted to go outside the Jewish quarter.
Well  first off  as I said  when I came to London  I was living with a wonderful family  with the Jacobs  who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs  hed been an officer in a Jewish brigade in World War One  and of course  knowing a lot about Zionist history  all this makes a little sense to me.
But he was very Jewish and he decided no  Im not going to live in a German atmosphere.
During this -- all of this time being in the ghetto  were -- was your family able to observe any Jewish traditions  any of the holidays in any way?
Because I knew that  that nobody will think that a Jew has the audacity  when they are not allowed to travel third class  to sit in a first class compartment and  and  and just go in style.
Im hoping to find papers of the Reichsfertreitung  the Jewish community organization  when I get there because none some to have survived  and they did a fantastic job  but- So  you went into the French zone and the British zone?
Q. So it wasn't Jew going to Jew  a Jewish family going to another Jewish family and saying we're in the same situation?
And we knew a guy who was a radiologist  who also had so me Jewish connections  and Interview with J udith Heimann November 21  2011 61he said  well  Ill ask some of my colleagues  you know.
My mother was very instrumental of getting Jewish people passports  passbook  whatever.
He knows Im USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 43 Jewish  and theyre Southern Baptists.
Many Polish people were afraid that the Jewish people might reclaim 10 maybe some properties.
Belgium is the only country that today we have 4 000 Jewish people who are alive thanks to the churches .
I had some dried bread with me  and I used to melt snow for water on the Jewish cemetery in the mausoleum.
Like it was just day  and there was a lot of Jewish farmers over there.
So they had been told  if you find a Jewish couple  tell them immediately to take a taxi and go to Bespepyau  Bespepyau Hospital  where they would be offered hospitality and put into hiding.
My father apparently adapted much better and he found a little clique of -- of Jewish men who were in hiding and they played cards.
They  Dutch people supported their Jewish friends  discussed what the options were  decided to go up over the roof.
So I came back to Cleveland and trained volunteers for the National Council of Jewish Women  I think about 3 or 4 years. (
So from Sagaguda together with the people from Czernowitz  the Jewish people  we 6 were transported to the Stadium of Maccabi.
They still we re able to get people some 15 Intergovernmental Comm ittee for Refugees (IGCR) : \ A body formed in 1938 to manage a solution to the problem of Jewish refugees.
If th -- if a Jewish -- if a Jewish man  he had a business  you know  he put [indecipherable] to hide the cl oth  they report it to the Germans right away.
And the women that you said that were the prostitutes at the camp  do you know what their ethnic background -- were they Jewish?
So we did in two weeks we had about 60 houses on the two sides of the Danube  Buda and Pest  where the Swedish flag went on and we had Nazi-clad  Nazi-clad Hungarian  Jewish boys standing outside taking care of the houses and nobody could step in because it was a Swedish territory.
And there's a Jewish town major and they forced the Germans to redo the synagogue as it was.
And I went to Warsaw and I had a friend who was looking very Jewish.
The most important thing I guess  thinking now  we didn't  we didn't have any information about what was going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all  was uh interdict radio sets was taken from the Jewish people.
So  they knew I was Jewish and I went to Liege  and walked arou nd with a false ID  went home  traveled by bicycle and I was there when the Gestapo came -- Okay. --
And  in the meantime there are a few other doctors  other Jewish doctors  also came from Israel and refugees and so on  look at this.
Town was  I should mention it's part of Carpathia  the population was about between 28 and 30 000 and kind of old fashioned by today's standards and about half of the population was Jewish  other parts were Hungarian and Ruthenian and at that time when I was born  there were also Czechs living there  the Czechs were the administrative people and the officers in the army.
A lot of Jewish people already worked in this factory  in the glass factory.
I must say that perhaps my father's biggest cont ribution to the Jewish community was that he was able of explaining these things  but there had been others before him  and I would like to add that this is happening today also in Germany.
By that time  yes  yeah because I used English at Hebrew University and also shared the room at the Weizmann Institute with a guy from South Africa  a Jewish guy who was also a student there.
For Jewish people who went to fight with the partisans  was there a different commitment and a different situa tion than for the Soviet partisans?
It was a stereotype of the Jew that had existed prior to World War II.
Because if they would have caught me  seeing uh that I had dental care through a Jewish dentist  then they would have punished him and me.
I m ean  we were observant of all the major holiday -- Jewish holidays.
And like I said  everything  it was just working my way  bu Was it a Jewish doctor?
If I had lived in Europe at that time  I could have...I am not Jewish  but it c ould have happened to me.
And they make all kinds of lists  and the lists were done in my area where I lived and my sister has a friend who were a Jewish policeman in the ghetto  and he s -- and somehow she fi nd out that I were in the lists.
A Jewish person  because ev ery person that lived before that in Ukraine that was Polish Right  could go back  mm-hm.
A. We happened to live -- and I answered it to you before  in the Jewish neighborhood.
He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish intelligencia.
And if they havent  I have two male cousins and they have married Jewish girls  but their own children  except for one  are -- no longer have any tie with -- but you know  I dont know whether the effect of the war  or whatever it is  but whatever I have read about statistics is that they -- this is very typical of the Jewish population in France.
Being...again we lived like on the 5th Avenue  my parents secured immediately an apartment in the future ghetto  and the always optimist Jew that we hoped war will end before we'll have to move.
And if you take a look at the membership from -- from 51 to this day  you will find geographically the Canadian Jewish Congress  the major American or ganizations  the leading Argentinean organizations  the leading Australian organization  the leading South African organization  the Jewish agency for Israel  the -- the leading French  British  the German  the worl d organizations. [
And the sad story is that first of all  they were incredibly more e ffective than the Gestapo because the Gestapo basically in tracking down a Jew  was sort of like a blind person trying to find something  they had really nothing to go by.
Even before they came  they contacted the Ukrainian nationalists  anti -Semites  and they told them the first few days you will have the right to go to the Jewish homes and do whatever you want to.
He was the President  but the French was really...uh...really was developed in the ghetto and it was only nature that after the liberation when I was already in Israel and I got word that...uh...this Jew came to...we were in Dachau  we were in concentration camp  and then we were in Italy.
And I said to him  did you know a Jewish family named Mayer.
They  one of them is just now  at the age of thirty getting involved in Jewish activities.
Somethin g bad about what the Jewish people don't  you know  or you hear the story somebody sa y before the war even.
Well  obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships.
It was a concept that was not within the Jewish religion.
And so all he could  yeah and als o  he was a short  very thin  wiry man with a reddish goatee  bald head but a fringe of red hair around the back of his head and his entire head  as I remember it  turned red ju st as his beard  he walked toward me and finally  I guess he took some time to think a bout what to say  and then he said  you are a Jew and you don't know what a Chumash is?
But our teachers were army offi cers and they were Jewish.
We dont know how he was taken  we only got a telephone call from somebody who had left in time and told us that all Jewish employees men had been taken to prison.
So  what Im trying to say is that I -- I was never alone by doing this  and I came -- I never came -- oh  I was engaged once  to a Jewish girl from Detroit  because I went to the chapel  to Jewish services here -- the military chapel  and I met this man  and he introduced me to his niece  who was visiting from Detroit.
German) 23 Yes  sir (German) 24 I am a Jew (German) 18 and eating.
The first thing which happened was that we were called to a Wehrmacht 14 office where we were mustered out of the army for being Jewish.
so another voice answer  \ Yes  these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai  \  a certain place where Jewish use to work there  hard work.
We went hiking with Jewish Boy Scou ts and  and -- yes  more or less -- Were you -- You know  go to the movies and -- -- still able to go to school?
So she said to call the Jewish kapos  they should give me twenty -five on my body.
I mean  what is he going to do  go and tell people hes getting food ti -- food stamps for two Jewish kids?
And since the Jewish Council which whose name was     which means Jewish Council  si nce this uh Council didn't have any money left  wasn't giving any money any mo re  since I had nominated a committee for each house to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth  I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financiall y  economically.
I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl  but who am I to say something?
If you want to find out if somebody's a Jew  you said the word  \ Am ho.\
Interview with Eli Dortort August 3  2005 42 Im very much Jewish minded.
If I have to go to the city as a...as a not a Jew and to go...when I was there  I was not a Jew.
And I'm struck when you mention the choices your parents had to make  the leap of faith to bring another Jewish life into the world at this very perilous moment.
I think the Jewish state is something that deserves to be supported by our government  which it does very well.
Also they were digging around the house because they believed that every Jew had a lot of gold and they -- they buried it.
I came to him and I told him  \ You can talk Jewish?\
And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier  a Jew doesnt know what a rifle is  a Jew doesnt hes different than all of them.
If -- you know  if you find a Jew hiding or if you find somebody and you deliver him to the Germans  youll get two kilogram of sugar.
And that ended up being a major problem because about a year later or so  after my sisters were in hiding  her husband  the husband  announced his wife was hiding two Jewish children.
You know  I be honest with you; the Jewish  they occupy all mostly business there.
It was not for his  in his interests that this anti-Jewish action should secede  that's w hy he told it to Tuckawitz who immediately informed the German  the Danish social-democratic leaders  who immediately went to the head of the Jewish community  a very respectable and respective lawyer of the high court called C.B. Pedricus  a famous Jewish name.
Once the order was given that the Jewish people -- and I hate it.
And when we speak about  I mean the way the Jewish people are here  they make it easy for them.
I went a few times  but since I wear glasses  they immediately recognized me as a Jew  and -- because Russians usually dont wear glasses.
I at least you see  but  of 54course  he he he rescued that this was a very small part  and in the evening came to Dr. Elkes at his home those who were separated  husband from men and then from children from parents and so on  and they asked him...and then Dr. Elkes uh asked the   the commander of the police  of the Jewish police  to ask from Roka th at they should take home from those 10 000  hundred men who were in to to...in his language these were very important artisan ...this is a very important physician  and this is a very important this...and the next morning when th ey were all from the small ghetto on their march to the 9th Fortress to the to the   the the Germans called the 9th Fortress Anhilation Point Number 2  and of course in their secret uh but I got it  you see  and so Dr. Elkes was permitted to go in and take out the hundred but then they fell upon...all of them  Dr. Elkes rescue us.
Im trying to find somebody else thats Jewish that would serve on the board here.
Eventually  what happened was my mother simply put a raincoat on and ran across the street to Jewish people who were at that point exempt  where she stayed for the rest of the day.
And the interview is  all in all  its about three hours long  and and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish community.
There was  as I told you  there was a section  a Jewish section in the heart of Vilna  a very  very cultur al town that had a lot of theaters  archives and museums and it had  and Jewish  very rich Jewish life with libraries and all kinds of so cieties and charitable organization.
They go to a Jewish high sc hool  which the Jewish high school is accepted.
there for many  many  many years and the next thing is there was a Jewish section and people were interested in what you call it the businesses there because the v ery religious people.
Fevek was the director of a high school in Sosnowiecz that was attended only by Jewish chil dren.
I either have to leave the school altogether or go to a Jewish school.
Do you know if they were Jewish and they were trying to escape?
There was  for example  they brought in  at the certain time in I dont know if you ever heard  there was a so-called ıiestej prapore  which is the sixth division of Jewish soldiers.
I think the -- the man in ch arge is the one who signed  who  being a Jew -- his name was Izrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war  and during the war  the consul of Spain in Salonika.
Its very heres something that come to my mind; that one of these families  I am still in touch with them  and h-h-he this guy was good friend of mine in in school  its a Jewish school  Epsztajn gymnasium.
Whether it was from the Jewish committ ee or was from the doctors or was from the resident.
And there was an old -- there was a mansion pretty close to the middle of town  which served as our playground  and that was a nice place to meet and of course  at that point we only played with Jewish kids.
When I was going to school for every Jewish holiday and Christian holiday  he sent me $100 check and he tried to do it in a quiet sort of way.
They may have been Jewish  they may have been anti -Fascist  I dont know.
And everything - a lot of people - a lot Jewish people escape over there.

He says  ﬁNo way am I coming to the United States.ﬂ I says  ﬁI put out to go to Israel and thats where Im going to stay  thats my country.ﬂ But is that -- Yo -- You -- On one hand  youre saying thats out of fear  or -- or is it more out of an allegiance and wanting to be in a Jewish place?
And were the chauffeur and maid Jewish or were they No.
He was  and all his officers were mostly Russians  Russians at that time but rather a potpourri with a bunch of people from different -- they were POW's  they were escapees like Jewish escapees  or people who felt not comfortable with the Germans  and there -- they were composed of mostly of  of those people  and our daily life was constant to go on the move  constant on the move.
However  later I found out that there was a Jewish orphanage and apparently quite a number of Jews living in Pankow.
They passed a law that they wanted to take away from people Jewish kosher killed.
I had nobody ther e. The only thing I had was my -- my Jewish soldie rs from my army base in Berlin had given me addresses of their families in New York whom I contacted a nd this somehow made me feel I wanted to stay here and even 30 though the Jewish committee told me I probably wouldn't be able to find a job in New York and I wouldn't find accommodations in New York I managed through thes e contacts to find myself a furnished room.
The chief of the hospital was a Jewish fellow  Dr. Stapens who was fascinated with my stories.
I was the only Jew  I was the youngest  I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then  and lets see  the men would go out at night and raid police stations  and -- and ci -city halls  and -- and break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards  and -- and official German stamps  and -- and weapons.
CY: If I could say it in Jewish it would be even bet- ter.

My mother working with the Jewish organi zation had thanks again to the organization of the German an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the addresses of the specific raid s. And thats the way I knew where to go to get the children.
And the summer  during the summer  through the Jewish Community Center  we were sent to Camp Louise  I dont know if you you may so my sister and I both were sent there for three weeks  whic h was really nice of them to do that  you know  they did a lot  the Jewish community and also the Washington Hebrew congregation  where we finally ended up  which was mostly juv German Jews.
And once I got into a a real fight with them  and they told me that I was just a dirty little Jew  and they chased me out and chased me to through the streets.
Were you the only Jewish people who were he was hiding  this [indecipherable] gentleman that was was helping you?

Not in this particular camp  in other camps down the years  that they would have the Jewish people go into a room and tell them that they were taking a shower...you probably heard this story...where they would gas them.
We took the Jewish teachers and we formed Jewish schools and that took care of that.
Were you -- About 1933  I was kicked out with all the other Jewish boy.
It was Jewish policemen  what been -- like you had a job  whatever it was necessary to keep everything in order.
As a matter of fact th e only way I could talk to people in the DP camps and particularly to the children was in my baby Hungarian  because you'd always find a Hungarian Jew who could translate for you.
I was a little girl and when I was on the street  my grandparents would say  don't speak too loudly  uh don't hop  don't skip  uh uh don't make yourself noticed because there were all the Nazis around us and so at a very early age I was already aware that I was different  that I was Jewish  I shouldn't be noticed  should be quiet.

We -- first of all  we kind of felt that we are intellectually superior to -- that -- you know  the object of study and working hard to learn more  was more  you know  in the province of Jewish life  because Jews always aimed for being more educated  because Jews felt that the only way  the only thing that will bring them into society is  you know  by being educated well  or being better educated.
But I loved being where I was  in the position I was in  because I had a big family  I had my own support system  and I -- I -- I -- we didnt experience the anti-Semitism that much  because a Jewish child Interview with Helen Goldkind February 21  2001 22could  if -- if he was really smart  he could reach to be educated.

My mother was a very progressive woman from what I can judge  now and even then... she was very active in Jewish organizations like Hadassa and Wiso... she was very socially active  she belonged to a lot of philanthropic organizations and social organizations and she was really  in my opinion  very advanced in her thinking for that age.
Ge ntile families who did not want to return their Jewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible parents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back because of that.

From there we got on top of the train and we got to Prague   and Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 56the first thing we did  we looked up th e Jewish community section  because we knew that there has to be  because Im not the only one who survived  so some are they have to get together and find out  or get information how to get where.
There was n-no Jew left anywhere Okay  then he -- he asked me in his office and sit down and told me that  to tell him how co me that I wasn't killed.
The following year there was a law  all Jewish stores had to write their names on the outside of the windows.
Oh yes  both my grandfather and father were very involved with the Jewish reform.
Then the guy turned around to me and said -- [speaking German] Which means  you are Jewish.
To the police  to the burgomasters  to the officials in the civil registry  I think the Jewish council that is being blamed in all over the place  had very little to do with whatever there was.
We li -- we did observe all the Jewish holiday s. Not all  I mean the major holidays.
So he would a a Jewish person who had received a notice that he has to come to the court  my grandfather would represent him.
I remember the principal coming in once and said  \ We don't want the Jew Heppner in this school anymore.

And we had a lot of -- my father had friends what was not Jewish  and one of them said  \ Abraham  why you don't convert?
23 Then we stayed there for about three or four weeks and then my father decided what he was going to do was build up a German Jewish congregation in New York even though everybody had told him it had been attempted many times and they have failed.
Im not saying young people who had no money  but there were very prominent Jewish and non-Jewish families that couldve done it.
I was already in Palestine  only I transferred to the Jewish army a few months later because they didnt want me to go around in the street and somebody will g -- recognize me.
The Jewish people have contributed a lot  not only in -- in Poland  everywh -- everywhere they lived  in -- in many fields  whether its medicine  or whether its engineering  or -- or -- or so many other important fields.
And so  as a child  you went to school  you did all I went to school  I was very Latvian  because there was maybe one Jewish I was Jewish; my brother  my little brother; and one more Jewish.

He wasn't an educated man  but his Jewish heart came out and he said  \ Stop suffering.ﬂ I did not know...I thought he...I said  \ You went by one of the and they were nice to you.

What would you two boys do during the time th e Jew the German children were in school?
So anyway  Lustig was married to an Aryan woman and he got the job as leader of the Jewish hospital.
The next to speak was 41 Levy and he...well  it's no t only that he's an excellent speaker but a very powerful speaker  and for the first time in my life I heard a man in an officer's uniform who is a rabbi  taking his government to task about the deficiency a nd about the short-coming and ab out the fact that in spite of all the appeals also he has made  uh uh as a rabbi and and and as an of...as a member of the Jewish community in England  almost nothing had been done  and I was flabbergasted because this in my background  you might call it Prussian bac kground  this is something I I didn't expect.
And I wouldnt say that I heard a lot  but I know for instance  when deportations started  my mother was very  very upset and she -- she was -- she was helping pe ople  her -- Lithuanian 20 people who were also Jewish people  but also Li thuanians.
The SS  the Gestapo  the Shutzpolizzi  the Geheinpolizzi  they're the ones  this was the elite who want to kill the Jew.
But But they found documents that they were ready to kill all the Jewish people from from A til Z  to annihilate them  all of them.
That a family  take a Jewish family  and in the first 100 meters of the forest they kill them and took away what they have.
So about five of us Jewish kids or 10 from that unit  after supper  we went to his barracks and it was Kapos only in that barracks.
And I remember asking the archivist 20 years ago and he said  well  you know  you were declared [Speaking Non -English Language]  a town  knew the Mendels family was there and they were a Jewish family.
And according to Jewish law  he didn't have to do that either.
I do certainly you know  adults that were with the HIAS   or the Jewish Federation.

So they...me and may womans...in the outskirts of the city in a little room.ﬂ and they sent in a doctor  a Jewish doctor.

She saw...saw a Jew and she gave me I remember...the first time she gave me milk and bread.
Interview with Gert Silver March 30  2006 14 Oh sure  dirty Jew  and that -- that kind of thing.
Here we have a map of the major camps for Jewish displaced persons with the arrow pointing to the Foehrenwald displaced person s camp.
And the thing that annoyed me  I remember this very clearly is that you know school normally started at eight  but because we did not go to the Jewish religion classes but went to special classes for Christian  there were other Christian children there.
How did you feel about being Jewish in an essentially Christian community?
And my friends  Id say were 50/50 Jewish and non-Jewish and so our upper was [difficult to figure out what was missing here]  was mixed but our social activities were mostly Jewish activities.
Now  did you -- did you know at that point any refugees from -- Jewish refugees from other countries?
They are buying from Jewish people in town  you know  customers.
So your customers were sa tisfied whether they were Jewish or non-Jewish?
The first port in Europe that opened up where you could get massive shipments in -- The JDC is the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee?
Did was the strai did you live i n the original place  was the street that you lived on almost exclusively Jewish?
What -- they left right when -- when the communist came  because the o -- the other reason they le -- he left also was that a lot of Jewish officers were killed right after the communists took over.
And giving speeches at different Jewish  or other  organizations  so we were sharing our experiences then in different ways.
I guess I am still struggling with where I belong but it seems like more and more I feel that I -- I feel a Jewish identity but not religion .I am less a nd less a believer.
And so I told one evening this story and and uh the dinner where I was invited and the major Jewish uh personalities of the vari ous groups  they they...all through those communities  the liberal community  Zionist...th ey were all there and uh the result was that a few months uh weeks later  I got from the office of the World Jewish Congress in Budapest a letter  saying you told us this interesting... BREAK IN TAPE ...and report what they lived through.
We were afraid of what would happen  although no one of course expected what afterwards happened  but I must say that in  in  in my  my people with whom I  uh  talked and  and worked--they were absolutely aware of the bad situation in in Germany  the bad situation of the Jews and of course don't forget that in  in Amsterdam in the years from from '35 on  we had so many refugees  Jewish refugees from Germany and from Poland.
They burned they burned their store in Jaffa   they were the only Jewish people in Jaffa  the Jewish store  in back  and so I came to Baltimore.
Do you remember some of the people from the Jewish organizations?
Tell me about the Jewish community in Edinburgh when you were small.
I -- ab -- of course I was able to tell them the Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12  2002 27story what I saw while I was there  how they treated the -- the Jewish people  not only that  but the Jewish owners of -- of stores and so on.
We have to try to bring people from -- from the ghetto s. And he wrote a letter to his cousin  it was still in a -- in 28 [indecipherable] in Novagudek ghetto and he told him  organize as much as you can  because they had another pes -- farmer that spoke beautifu l Jewish  you would never sa -- say that hes a Gentile.
Did your feelings about faith  particul arly the Jewish fait h grow over the war?
So the Jewish agency took me and put me in Lodz  in a children home.
I could not understand how someone could simply bayonet someone's leg lik e that  on the street in broad daylight  simply because he was not filling a ditch fast enough  or  as it later turned out  because he was a Jew.
For me it was like a -- I said a very  very big one  with the big shoes  so -- and he came  and he pick me up  and he said  ﬁI know that you are Jewish  you will go with me.ﬂ And even -- even this time  I dont remember me crying.
On the beginning on the 18th century  the beginning of the 18th century  the first Jew came over from Poland.
And that was the assumption  that it would be i-in the Jewish community?
Now  the social democrats went to the pres ident of the Jewish community who had been released by that time and told him he would believe it and at the same time they sent the secretary to our home  to my fath er and gave him the news and at that point my father convinced that it was true and again it was a problem how to react without panic.
And when they got to Russia  he was promptly jailed because he was a Jew  and she was jailed because she was foreigner.
Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday on the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family  my father and I was left.
So if she was stopped  they would have known you were Jewish.
He helped to found the Jewish school  a number of other institutions  but he.
And my father  the well accepted  well adjusted not assimilated in the religious sense  but culturally assimilated Jew would always oppose that.
Hes a -- Well  he bela -- he formed that Jew -- Holocaust Survivors Club here.
And that was a weak point because...uh... usually Jewish people had kinked hair.
So I just pushed the crowd to see who it was  look at a Jewish girl.
It's a curious thing to me  it sounds like you had a very strong Jewish facetiousness.
I found out in 1940  somewhere in 1946  that the Jewish Community in Vienna was reconstituted  opened up again  and that they had all the records -- the reason why all the records were still in the old Jewish C ommunity was because Eichmann  the big killer  Eichmann had taken over that building as his headquarters and everything just stayed where it was.
So it didnt separate us from the Jewish population  but we were not part of that other life.
Yes  yes  it was scary  that was the  it was a terrible scaring  but when we went to Zagreb we went to the Jewish community and they were recommending us to a  where we got the room  they rented a room for us and I think that  of course they paid everyt hing that time  because we didn't have any money.
They had to say that they were of the Jewish race and that they were not criminal  that they were born my father soand-so  my mother so -a nd-so.
It turns that theologically the Lutheran religion appeals to me more than the Jewish religion because the Jewish religion is so obscure and so full of  you know  archaic rituals and the Lutheran Church in  uh  in  uh  in Slovakia in in 1940's was very modern  forward looking  highly educated church and that particular church was a very small minority so when the Lutherans are a minority they are very nice people.
I will never forget the Seders  the warm feeling of being with all my family  and with strangers  because we always -- my grandparents invited strangers  this was a tradition  from orphanage  soldiers who were of Jewish origin who did not have place to go to.
He didn t look as he you know  he was looking very Jewish.

Did you hear anything about the boycott against Jewish businesses in 1933  while you were in Germany?
And many of the Jewish boys simply dont measure up to the expectations.
How did you impart Jewish tradition  or Jewish culture to your children  when they were growing up?
By then there were no Jews in the provinces  only Jewish community was in Budapest.
So I said  ﬁYes  I too  I too.ﬂ And then later  so I knew that she is Jewish  and she knew that I am Jewish  then I told her what I need  said I need the plans.
That was appr oximately 1935  and I was at the Jewish school until the school was closed  and that was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night.
So that was one of his favorite pa -- you know  things that he would -- and he read a lot  Jewish newspapers and so -- but no  he was very good to me when I was very  very young.
And -- and then  of course  when I came to the United States I had to work Saturday right from the start and it so -- it so -- And that -- you were working for a Jew in a kosher store?
Uh  not in Utrecht  but as soon as I was in Amsterdam  of course  I had a lot of Jewish friends and students who were Jews  who studied at the same time.
My mother  because they knew  they had lists of all the Jewish community  and my mother  who as I said was a knitter  and knew very well how to work in that area  they said that she would be the chief knitter for the mayor of the town  who was obviously German.

Once you reach Ljubljana and you were Jewish  this is such a amazing thing about Fascist Italy.
Her fa -- I met her father  the father was Jewish  the mother was Gentile.
So  and then so  you  you combine the fact that the destruction of all your Jewish life and then of all your fel low Jews and then living in the country being a Jew was a bad thing  because that was basically the message to us still  but being Anita Frank 45 [Date not labeled] Page 45 a Jew  much safer for you to keep your mouth shut.
I think it was 1942  and one day they told her that there are some informers te lling the police that she is Jewish and that my brot her is a Jew  and they told them if they did not go away in a few hour s  they will be taken to the police.
I belonged to -- cant remember the name of it  but it was sort of a farm organization  I went to a camp  Jewish camp.

I do not remember  but I probably did  but I couldnt tell you any instance  but I only know that in 1942   when I already knew -- no  1943  when I already knew that they were murdered and let -- and -- and ended their lives in Sobibor  I lit a candle in memory of them  which is a Jewish what you call it?
Yo u wouldn't have expected a Jew to get that but he did.
And I went to my rabbi  and I say  what should I do  my other husband is not Jewish  my first one was.

Very small one uh and most of the Jewish community was involved in either some type of small trades or they were in some of the professions  although we did have some that were rather poor in the community.
But when they saw my sister and she came all sunburned from Africa  they were sure she was Jewish  they gave her so much material  my cousin  to make bed jackets  she made a lot of money.
I dont know if you ever saw in the movies  when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them in those trains and the women  they were so vain  they want ed to look nice  they took the suitcase and everything  they didnt know where they were going.
In this country there are many non-Je ws  Jewish women  who are called Sarah  but in Germany  the name Sarah is totally unknow n  it was purely a Jewish name and Israel  anyway  so  and also the law stipulated not only that we had to take those names  but that we had to use it  particularly in all communications with government agencies or also 16 with commercial enterprises and so on.
Yeah  I said -- 110 [indecipherable] So to [indecipherable] against -- well  it turned out they elim inate Jewish people because they were the majority  and -- and they [indecipherabl e] the things to be there  they had the commander  he gave them everything.
I'm not particularly religious but I do belong to a synagogue and my children have been brought up -- they we nt through bar mitzvah and my grandchildren -- my son married a Jewish woman.
So that anybody who knows anybody sees Finzi   says Jewish.
They were denouncing us  pointing out to Germans if they saw somebody who looked like Jewish and was tryi ng to -- to go to -- to another town without that yellow band.
He was born in 1885  and he went to -- like a -- all the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the town  he went into the Jewi sh school for the first four years of his schooling  which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was.
Further down the block I see a Jew coming there w ith a tallis so I stopped him and asked him where's the shool and he says don't go in here.
He had a kosher home  he sent his kids to Jewish schools  he was very Jewish  but that was normal in Poland.
And my husband was held back quite a few times  because he was a policeman in the displaced camp  and at that time  the sentiment against the Communists were very strong  and there was organiz -- Jewish organization called the Bundt  which was more left  you know.
And my parents took me out of the school and sent me to a Jewish -- parochial  Jewish school.
Then I said to the audience  well people  you must know the German Jew  the younger generation is doing anything to study the Holocaust  and to go to Israel  and to improve the German Jewish relations  its not fair if you say that.
I came for a German doctor  yes  a young German doctor  and so I  you there  he told me  Jew  and so are you healthy and so.
But if my children had married a Jew  I would have been perfectly satisfied.
Astonishing how how good the document is  a very important contribution to Jewi sh planning and Jewish policies in the post-War.
Your family stayed in Poland much longer than many other Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.
I dont know if he was a Jewish man or not  but I rememb er feeling very angry that he was doing that.
And then told the...the Jewish policeman at the ghetto gates  \ There's somebody shot and lying in a ditch over there.
I mean  that was after all the  the things th at we went through  there was a real Jewish holiday which was celebrated.
So this Dr. Gross  hes from Poland  his father was a judge in Krakow   a Jew  and he married a non-Jew  a Po lish  and she helped him to survive.
He knew  of course  that I was a [indecipherable] half Jew if he believed the story  and he was most anxious to place me and to help me.
The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight grades in it.
SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Here in this early issue there's a page uh devoted to my role  uh they liked to refer to me as the iron lieutenant because of the manner in which I-I-I took their cause before the uh military and the philanthropic organizations and uh  uh I responded with the long article called One of you  which is also included in this collection SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: This is the portrait of a great Jew and the second one is the iron lieutenant. [
Interview with Ursula Marx June 8  2016 15 And that was mostly Jewish.
Was there any public rush -- recognition in Engl and of the existence of the Jewish brigade in the British army?
My question that I've had for a long time is: What did you think of when you were first told that Jewish children weren't allowed to be played with  couldn't go to school  you know  couldn't shop in other stores and other people couldn't shop in the Jewish stores ?
Before the war in 20s and 30s they didnt want to have the Jewish people living in Poland.
I wanted to start actually our interview with mentioning the fam ous Jewish historian  .
And I told them the same story what I tell you right now  that -- and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 43were speaking about the Jewish people  yes they suffered the most  a nd they had no help from nobody  yeah.
I'd never heard of Eggenfelden but he called me up and told me the story that there were Jews living in Eggenfelden under horrible living conditions and that there was a hotel...I thought he said it was owned by a Jew.
Jean would  reminds me that I told her  wh en I first started going out with her  that when we started going out  that I really would not consider marrying someone who was not Jewish.
He was... he was changed from uh...from uh...because he was half Jewish  and they had uh they they were told in the cases they would prefer to be Germans.
It was a woman from a school  a Jewish woman  but she used to teach that school  it was for advanced children.
He didnt tell me anything  although I spoke Polish perfectly  and I thought I didnt look Jewish.
And besides this I made a compromise when I went with the Zionist youth cl ub and  and when I went to Frankf urt  I studied at the in Frankfurt and then afterwards I went to Wurzburg an d I tried to bring people closer and make them accept it and so forth all the time  so I think I had this kind of th ing  even I talked to the Nazi teachers in school  I always tried to compromise in a certain way  but not give up my principles  because when the teachers told me that you cannot go to school any more  I mentioned this already before and I just said to him  \ We are on the same wavelength  you be a Nazi and I be a Jew.\
But because it was not allowed to give shelter to Jewish children or anybody  but they were willing to take us in.
But  you know  my sister as well  she didn't have a chance she was never in the Jewish environment.
No one said  ﬁOh  youre a Jew  thereforeﬂ or ﬁits bad.ﬂ I mean I knew from being in school  we had to go to c hurches in school.
All Jewish pe -- teach ers they fire  all Jewish teachers.
A judge it -- we had not many Jewish judges in Lithuania  so maybe it was one or two  so he was very authoritatic  he were talking in language of orders  explained very short  that is so  we understood that it's from the Committee.
The fact that my parents uh never acknowledged being Jewish doesn' t mean they weren't  in very fundamental ways  very Jewish.
39 But  the other kids didn't ne cessarily know you were Jewish?
Only when somebody was from  mayb e a Christian woman and a Jewish father and children  maybe she  they were both in Prague or another town  and she could send something.
And  it still seems to me a rather unfortunate attitude if it did stop anybody coming over because they couldn't get into a Jewish family.
When my aunt worked in the labor camp  she recognized one woman who was not Jewish [indecipherable] and her sister Lydia.
So when they suspected there would be an inspection  they would  perhaps either tell the Jewish child to stay home or another child to stay home  or another child.
And as Ive gone through life and looked around me  you know  a nd people keep pointing things out to me  I think  you know  it really is kind of bizarre  because Harvard University  who used to ex USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 129 -- which used to exclude Jews on the faculty  is now 30 percent Jewish faculty  apparently.
And then Purim came  and a group of Polish people had a theater  a Jewish theater.
Ive also -- also one of the sponsors  and sh-she came one day and asked me -- asked me show the documents  the I.D. cards fr-from -- o-off a Jew from -- or a Czech Jew who e-escaped from Poland and Russian soldier.
We tried to go through the night through the woods going west because we were scared about the Communist and between the Polish Communists were very many Jewish Communists.
The Germans went a little too far  and of course  if I were a Jew  I would not allow for this to be forgotten.
And next door we had a lady who happens to be Jewish happened to be Jewish  and who wa s a violin teacher.
And then we also had duties for a few Jewish  like daycare centers that were around the city  and we got a special permit to go to these centers as nurses and take care of the children  but they were resolved very soon afterwards.
I I was a an influence on my twin brother  who was lucky enough to meet a Jewish American  who was touring Rome .
But they needed some sort of Jewish education and I arrived there and they were very happy to bring them togethe r. We had about 30 kids  and we would meet on Saturday and Sunday at a Kiwanis Club.
Uh...I grew up in this mill district of Pittsburgh to the age of 7  then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I had to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill  and I completed my high school educa tion at High School  40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936  by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi.
Every Pole you saw a Jew here a ttack them or took them away  cant do this  do this  do this  and so on.
Out of them  maybe one Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 9 one-fourth  one-third was were were Jewish people.
The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth.
For instance  you know  the people in the Jewish circle  particularly the people who brought me to America  always berated me that I never applied for reparations from the Nazis.
Throughout this period of time  there was a Jewish council  I think both locally and statewide in Slovakia  that tried to intervene on behalf of the community.
There were only Jewish children and on Saturday we didnt go to school.
>> Bill Benson: And on that night thousands of Jewish men were arrested and taken to a concentratio n camp.
I had  Jewish people  very nice people that were my friends.
My brother apparently had been at school someplace else and was home for one of the Jewish holidays that day.
The most suffering  the Jewish commun ities  people don't know  I don't know about what happened in Hungary.
You were involved in the community... Yeah  we were an organized Jewish comm unity  of which I was the secretary.
It doesnt mean that its -- I advocate it  I am just saying that I feel the Jewish Holocaust was strictly a Jewish issue.
He said it in Jewish he said to him - I will say it in Polish because my Jewish is not too good - he says  ﬁYou are lucky that you were naked because when she saw you  she fell in love with you.ﬂ But those were the circumstances  and this is a real true story.
See the Hungarian courts at some point were very favorable to the Jewish claims because they knew that the fascists are out and– And Jews could not be considered I imagin e as being fascists or pro-fascist.
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 12 The town we had the town was not big  but it was a 90 percent Jewish town  with a lot of youth.
The   elderly Russians...among them one Jew  a lawyer from Leningrad who got 10 years as a Troskiers   and he was have to serve...he served for 47  but they let him out because of sickness in 44.
We knew a girl  a Jewish girl  and she was not quiet sick.
I'm not Jewish enough for the Holocau st Museum in that sense  that I cannot even ask whether they  let's say  give me any sponsorship of any of the really Orthodox  or purely Jewish organizations  the U.G.A.13 or whatever.
We were about 500 guys there  young  Jewish guys  and it was a terrible place.
But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel.
And ears we were  as on the 24th of September  the Jewish star  the yellow star was introduced.
They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about the ghetto and they start  you know  every Jew have to have  you know  the Jew shtern6.
The reason for that was mostly that many of the girls--these girls married Jewish men.
So let me ask you  you -- you were not feeling very much Jewish iden tity during the war.
But this time he knows in the afternoon  hes out from the school for three weeks -- kill that Jew  hit that Jew.
The Germans uh had...I guess there was some sort of an organization that was uh formed from the Jews or appointed as a leader of the Jews and the the intermediary between the German command and the Jewish community where the Jewish community was taxed because I remember having to give up some valuables to help with the war effort.
So he was appointed to be leader of the Jewish community.
I was privileged to be a member of the first course in the history of the Jewish people for radar technicians and I became one of Israel  Israel's Air Force's first radio technicians using naval radar equipment for detecting planes.
Because at that time  in 1940 it was forbidden for people with a parent  with a Jewish parent  to go to the gymnasium to the higher classes.
So I actually two chances to get out of Vienna  either with ...on the Jewish side or on the Lutheran side.
Oh  the first year  I was with the Jewish Family Servi there was a social worker named Edith Costa  and she took us to Revere beach  around here  and we had an accident  and I broke my nose because I was sitting on somebodys lap.
That's wh en I met my first -- the first Indian Jew from India.
After the war broke out  in 1939  by 1940 they removed the Jewish people from their homes and put them in Jew houses  they created ghettos.
And the other children are consciously Jewish  but they dont belong to any synagogues either.
You said you werent brought up in the Jewish tradition but you were brought up in this humanistic?
They would have never said that they had a Jew visiting  because I was a son of an artist  Nardus  their childhood friend.
And  as part of his reaction  he told the story of our meeting and he showed the picture that I had brought him  and he said  ﬁWe know this boy is Jewish  we dont remember his name  wed love to be able to find him.ﬂ Well  in Haifa  a man is sitting and watching television and listens to this and next day hes going on business to Poland.
I just remember him durin g the hun -- you know  Jewish holidays.
Apparently he was sent by German with group of Jewish doctors to the nearby villages to immunize agai nst typhoid fever  because it was again out -- outbreak of typhoid fever.
And thats why they set that law  for anything to do with the Jewish people  Polis h Christian help Jewish people or hiding Jewish people  death sentence.
Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 55 Goebbels said  the time has come to an end of a Jewish overdone culture.
When people tell me the story about Europa  Europa when the Jewish boy was Hitlerj ugend  and he did survive and certain things  I said everything is possible.
And in 1939  when the second Jewish law came into power  a secret part essentially said that people who were untrustworthy for the uniformed services would have been drafted as non -uniformed slave laborers.
And the Jewish police knew my brothers  so they start screaming  \ Where's the old lady?
And Im g and I read things and I read that in Papiniau  a stat a monument has been defaced  the Jewish kids that made a nd and I get very upset.
And there was a organization  I know  because my mother knows her he she wasnt pa-part of the organization  but her good friend  this doctor I talked  Dr. Bridges  who talked with the Jewish doctors about  you know  the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation  his wife  and other  mostly from Catholic organizations  made a a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.
A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary  to have an accountant to work for him.
Well  I haven't seen a Jewish girl since I left for so many months.
He personally  and I have his letter  wrote to the Papal Nuncio to allow this Jewish doctor to practice because as he wrote  he brought so many Catholic children into the world and cared so much about the poor.
And it also became apparent that along the Kurfurstendamm  the main boulevard running through Berlin  that every second store really was Jewish owned.
A lot of j a lot of Jewish boys joined the Polish army  and they started to feed the Polish people much better.
And then they -- some kind of decision was made to re-allow  to bring b ack some of the Jewish doctors in the military to tend to the wounded  because there were e normous amount of wounded people and they needed to be treated and the Romanian doctors were not enough.
Right after Thanksgiving my uncle enrolled me in a private Jewish school where I could communicate with the students.
Even what I can tell you something about the -- how I -- how I lived with my friend  the Jewish people  yes  because as I mentioned to you  my father  and my mother came from the small town  especially later  I was very much more attached to the family of my mother  especially that my godfather was Jusef Meeta  was a soldier of the Pilsudski army  a regular soldier.
And the minute they start to talking about tho a ghetto  but and they used to run aro round around men  Jewish men.
But for the rest  you never heard a nything about Jewish.
She had a lot of Jewish doctors  who wanted to marry he r. She met that guy  who was a gorgeous guy and he had three kinds of doctorate  and he had a big  big job with the states.
So when they saw you co me back  then they changed their minds that youre not Jewish.
In 1936 there was a law that it was phrased in that way German students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish students.
In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't even fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps  it had a Jewish community.
You could not l eave before 5:00 a.m. Although my sister was older  my father always used to send me out to get the rations because a lot of hooligans were picking on Jewish girls.
They also at the same time a law took effect that did not allow a Jewish person  male or female  to go with a Gentile person  male or female.
I couldn't withstand the pressure  and I told him  yes  indeed  we are Jewish.
>> Bill Benson: As you also told us  there were times when the officers would come and warn the Jewish families but they should go and hide for a while.
But this is the only question of -- I was -- and even about the Jewish community  United States  the reaction.
And I also know that ne ver been given to a Jew.
She became again a teacher in the Jewish schools and was teaching then.
Was this -- was your school a Jewish school  or both Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty?
But then they were not allowed to go to the school because Jewish kids were not allowed.
If they say that Leo is a Jewish name  then Leo is a Jewish name.
And he was...you see...that Jewish people make...that's...I tell you honestly how many thousand  thousands Jewish people what they killed for thats.
Theres a there there was a Lieutenant Stein  a German Jew  who was lucky enough to flee Germany before he was brought to the concentration camp  or to Auschwitz   and he came back with the American army  as an American lieutenant  Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 67 or something like this.
They never knew about anything and most of them had some kind of Jewish relations surprisingly.
Do you feel American or do you feel Russian or do you feel Jewish?
Although I do remember I had a very good friend who was Jewish  and she was brought up without any religion.
When we are good  we are good--no matter Jewish or not-Jewish.
And last but not least  there are many photos of old Jewish life in Krakow.
Talking to someone whose grandparents we-were involved in -- in my -- in my life  and talking about a German Jew  who went through almost the same as the European Jew.
After that  in those days -- it's about a hundred years ago  in the Jewish families  a boy was not supposed to have elementary education  and my father wanted me to be a rabbi.
Epstein was the name of the German Jew who took them over.
The Irish rabbi said that he  he could not officiate under those circumstances  and since the military were concerned for the feelings and the good opinion of the civilian population  uh the American military aut horities saw the need immediately for a  an American Army Jewish chaplain.
They would come ov er to a Jew with a beard and smack him and do things like that  nothing beyond this  but they were promising it to us.
By ordering the mayor to do things and by apprehending whom I considered to be a criminal and by ordering the mayor of Schnaittach to restore the Jewish cemetery.
And the man came from the Jewish committee in New York  on the ship and looked all my papers through and he found everything in order.
I mean  you were a human being  you were a Jew  you were a German Jew and you were a snob?
If you lived in na an area like New York  where there were a lot of Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 48survivors  you didnt have to learn to speak English  because you could get along on Yiddish on Jewish  because mo-most of the people that had the little businesses or whatever  you got a job  they were speaking Jewish.
So we decided that...there was no hospital  no Jewish hospital and in the Polish hospital  Jews were not allowed.
2 Hard working people  and they tried their be st for us  like sending us to school and providing us with the best like a Jewish parents  but they also had their difficulties on account  because...because they were Jews.
One of my granddaughter graduated Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School and went to Israel with them  and went prior to Israel.
And the door was open  and I hear that she yells -- the child was crying  and she yells to the child  ﬁBe quiet  because the Jew will come with the sack  and he will take you away.ﬂ This happened in Jersey City.
That's really -- and both families were Jewish  mother's family and father's family?
The Jewish community by that time I lived in Berlin  my family had moved to Berlin  and there they had a very good Jewish school  whose teachers  many of them were college professors who had lost their j obs  who later on sometimes became quite famous individually  as scholars in Israel or in the United States .
In fact  th at was at the Jewish hospital  which was the last  sort of collection center for Jews for deportation.
As I told you  there was a school at the Jewish Community Center what was teaching newcomers English.
Anti-Semitism because there was people wh o had said don't buy at the Jews  don't -- but my uncle had opened store an d they used to say don't buy  that's a Jew  and that's a -- Jews to blame for Jesus' demise.
There was also a group of Jewish slave laborers who had to drag the dead people from the gas chamber; and in many cases  uh...taking out their dentures  the gold.
I didn't see any difference  but maybe they saw the difference between Jew and non-Jew.
I was the only Jewish boy in the in the classroom.–
So when I come in they took me out from the school the Christian school and they send me to the Jewish school  not the Jewish  but it was a public school but it was most Jews was there.
But Rena wrote that I saw her in Bergen-Bel sen and what Rena wanted was  sh e went to Israel  they were not Jewish but she married a Jewish man after the war  a writer.
Lvov at that time had a Jewish community of over 150 000.
And th en we went to another pr ivate school which was mixed Christians and Jewish.
And I know that one of the other men was a political prisoner who -- a Jew  a French Jew who joined the French underground.
Did any of the Jewish population have any feeling about that?
One people were just obeying all the orders of the Germans  trying to save their own lives as much possible  and another part which realized that being a member of the Jewish Council  they had to sabotage as much as possible and to  to use the the  the power they had  given them by the Germans  to  to free as many children and adults as they could.
They -- in order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding  or public hiding from their own children  so they couldnt say very much  but they read the scriptures  and how the very devout Christians  and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays  to keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar  or what have you  but sh -- Passover  and Easter  often overlap  so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us about  it was kind of -- and theyre very nice people.
German) 31 listen  you hear  just what; ﬁIhr verfluchte Jude 29 dirty Jew  you Christus  you murder ﬂ and all kind of things.
Einsatzgruppen  or whatever they were called at the time--to take care of the Jewish affairs.
I wa s  by that time  a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really  but with fairly vivid feelings and recollec tions of being Jewish.
>> Josie Traum: My mom was actually part of the underground and she would bring in Jewish girls  people from countries where the Germans had already invaded and were arresting and deporting people.
Did you have discussions with friends of yours that were Jewish  do you remember them being concerned  or their parents?
Jewish leaders coming; rabbi  other rabbis coming  so  a lot of the pictures of that I should say this  a lot of the pictures that you see at the Holocaust Museum and the ones that I have  are not really pictures of every day life or  and/or suffering  they are largely celebratory pictures; the Macabbi38 games  the theatre performances  the visit of the General  the visit of Rabbi Herzog  that is  they're  they are the pictures are not really a representation of daily life in the camp.
They knew...that par ticular place what knew that we're Jewish... And they weren't?
He didn't speak in this tone like I'm talking now  but he...he found always the right expression...first of all not to to hurt their Nazi dignity  and second to force them to to to to answer him first of a ll  to answer him  and to answer him in a way like a human being  because a Jew is not a human being.
That was the strongest way of assuring the Jewish people of the support of the church of the Jewish population.
So you continued to celebrate Jewish holidays and everything until you were deported?
In fact  there was some good -- some people in his household who were Jewish.
And he ke pt on  and we took away his rifle  because we thought he might -- not do anything to us  but [indecipher able] well  and we just [indecipherable] that he was the only one that we knew -- th ere may have been another guy was Jewish  but -- but we had good experiences too  afte r  and -- with Jews  and non-Jews.
She was even a gentile and she married a Jew and she opted to into the ghetto with her husband and their two children.
And  uh  there were no Jewish children in Auschwitz  just a few Dr. Mengele wanted.
And the atrocities regarding the Jewish paramilitary personnel + every day.
We -- We -- We were in Munich and we were in touch with the Jewish community.
Uh of course our Jewish and intellectual roots uh cause us caused us to continue doing it  so there was some private private teaching and former high school st udents who were maybe teenagers were uh busy teaching reading and writing to youngsters and I who was fourteen was also sometimes asked to teach young children of nine or six to how to read and write  so there was a little bit of act...there was some  there was some  there was a structure to deal with it but nothing formal.
Understand that this was a Yale that at this time had never had either a Catholic or a Jewish full professor in Yale college.
And here wa -- this was in spring of 1944  April 1944  it was almost over and he rounded up the staff and the children and except for one boy  who happened to visit there and was left off the truck because he was not Jewish  everybody was sent to Auschwitz.
If they give bread  it wasn't written down here I'm a Jew.
A good welcome from the guy in charge of the camp  the Jewish fellow  but a lousy from other people  because I dont know why  because not everybody was the fighter on Warsaw ghetto and they called fighters [indecipherable] heroes  and they didnt like us.
I shouldn't say that because I do remember now that on Memorial Day  which is a holiday for everywhere in the world and schoolchildren went to the cemetery but the Jewish schoolchildren were separated from the others and went to the Jewish cemetery.
Interview with Sol Kohn 32 You went from a very small Jewish community to a city that had a large Jewish community?
But  there was mostly Jewish stores in town and they had depended on the Jewish people for shopping.
It came out as I discussed it with other film makers  when I discussed how you handle a thing like this  was it handled properly  how do you handle a thing like this where if you set up as we said at the very beginning  the structure of a Jew from the Bronx going to see Hitle r's number two man.
Th ey were very close  and there was a Jewish school in Heilbronn.
The -- the lady in charge of the barrack was one of our Jewish women from our city  so I knew her  sort of.
Most of the time they took all the house  or nine rooms  and they let the Jewish owner to stay in one room over there.
These were Jewish women who were taken years before and they had been working in this factory already for some period of time and they were also taken from Auschwitz and from other...uh... exterminating and labor camps and they were needed here so they brought them here.
So and I had the people  it so and I had many  many Jewish friends in Citibank.
Uh I had uh uh in this labor gang in which...where we were working  there was one member  a Jewish fellow who worked with us  who was uh what we called a privileged Jew.
I mean  this was really horrible  and my experience at that school was terrible  just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and even though it was really a secular school  it was a public secular school  because in Belgium they have  as they have her e  a Catholic system that is parallel to the public system  I obviously  so the people who came to the secular schools were not Catholic  or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they chose the public school.
She said \ Unfortunately not  because there was a pogrom of the Jewish people that came out of hiding  and unfortunately the 26 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD Poles killed them.\
However  the church did sponsor several Jewish people coming uh ...Jewish families coming over and uh  wouldn't it have been wonderful if we had of known then what actually was happening  but that my...the first inkling that I had that anything such as this happened.
The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes  Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 52 which the museum only recently digitized  and we still have not gone through all of the cassette tapes  but we started to do so just only recently  and we came across one interview that was conducted in December 27 th  1974  in New York   in the office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee  and it is an interview with Margaret Feiler   the name who who you will recognize.
20 Zionist youth movement directed at educating Jewish youth for kibbutz life in Israel.
He saw star...I was with the star  and this was a little problem  and he was looking at me curious way and he was asking uh you must wear these or...and then the question was the the that I making uh the demonstration near the uh to be sympathetic for the Jewish people but never happen in Budapest  but it was known that someplace  some somebody can make some demonstration.
But no  she somehow -- I do n't know what she saw in me that I never realized that she figured that maybe I have the best chance Actually  when I couldn't do anything  I was so angry with her that when I left I just took off my armband  because in those years you had to wear an armb and that showed that you were Jewish.
And when you cross that street  that was that old section  which was the Jewish section.
I was registered there in the New Utrecht High School in Bensonhurst  and there I fell into an interesting group of Jewish activists  so on and so forth  and one thing led to the other  but this is now coming to the United States  already in the United States.

Through the friends  I got into a Jewish thr -- a circle of young women of marriageable age  who were ready to party.
The Jewish people almost died  I mean totally and finally and irrevocably.
Did you feel Jewish in a special way  in a different way than you had before enteri ng the United States?
When you were at this school  the elementary school with Jewish students  Jewish and Christian students?
Did you go to a Jewish school or a Polish school?

Poland was invade by German and by Russian an d during this time  Polish nation  35 thous -- 35 million people  a-and 10 percent was Jewish  a nd some other nation was in Poland the same time  and we lose six million Polish citizen.
A different Jew means some Jewish people  they ga ve up.
I was feeling that a Jew will be like cream on on the top of the milk.
He was a mediator between the Germans and the Jewish community.
Not with the SS trooper troops who goose-stepped past our house one dark forbidding night  their black  shiny boots reverberating on cobblestones  singing  no  shouting in o in cadence  when the Jewish blood spurts from the knife  then we will all be free.
We live -- arrived in America February 11th  1947 and they picked us up on the -- on the -- at the boat and they took us to their home and they were livi ng on the lower east side and I -- I nev -- in a walk-up  it was really amazing  you know  cause this was still the old Jewish section.

I remember one  one in uh  uh  uh  a Jew did it  and a Kapo.
You see  wh at they were doing is that they were picking  you know you have these grenades on the floor  lets say  you know when the Russians retreated  when the Germans  before the Germans would make any steps they would send out these Jewish boys to the mine fields.
We tried to contact them then through the Aufbau   through all the different Jewish organizations and there was absolutely no trace of anybody alive  nobody.
I have [indecipherable] done research in certain area  Ive done this or that  and its considerably less important that -- that I am an American  or that Im a Jew by birth.

And he took you Theres a book there is a book written about that I forgot the title of it  but its access to very many many  many  let s say publications on that subject of Korczak in that library  the Jewish library on Tomackie Street  near in the vicinity of that previous synagogue I see.
And people went there a lot  just because of the escalators  I think  Jewish department store.
I -- I mean in Breslau [indecipherable] Ah yes  I moved back to Breslau and I was started in the Jewish school in Breslau  Raydia ar -- school and all children there were Jewish.
When you were young  did you have any Jewish  any friends that whom you knew were Jewish.
The one thing bad that he -- Hitler did  it was that he didnt kill the whol -- whole Jewish population.
Was there a relationship between the Jewish community and the DP community?
I don't know now  it's too long ago  whether it was  probably a both combina tion of him and the Jewish hospital in Hamburg  somehow a combination  I d on't know how they work ed together and he came out.
indecipherable] What was your position in the Jewish communit y  your families position?
Now we have really problems because next door is the woman who is suspecting you are Jewish.
And these were people who did not know too many Jewish people  there was an area at that time who didnt have Jewi sh people there.
I went to those lectures  Segal and then dances and then the Jewish shows  free tickets for re fugees.

He was not just a Jewish but he worked for the Germans  but this is...he wanted to save and he he wanted to save himself too  but being that he was the the whole...the whole   you know  the the key from the factory and with the Germans it's if you went to the higher echelon you could talk to them.
See  my father was Jewish  my mother was Gentile  but as I say  my moth -- mother  at one time  she converted see?
Then the community was most a Jewish community and it was very nice  the people.
And I stayed three Jewish her brother-in-law and he r two sisters  we were in the same building together.
Being born would have made me a Frenchman  but still they were Jewish.
And there were a lot of Jewish doctors that had a Jewish hospital.
But that they just come right out and say  Im German  Jewish is my religion.
So they brought me to--this was in Berlin  it was a Jewish hospital.
And he  his name was Eisen because they  the parents got married  had their Jewish wedding and that did not come in Poland.
Well they spoke Yiddish and somehow that language I find very difficult to tolerate  especially that I start having friends who are visiting me at times  and I was actually ashamed that there was Yiddish spoken around  that this is openly Jewish home and I saw him reading Jewish newspaper and somehow I felt aversion towa rd this.
I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists  because after all  we Jews are religion rather than a nationality  and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality.
I knew things about Jewish life  and Jewish philanthropy  that I learned only late later on.
The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes to let the Germans go on  so to say  building fortresses along the west coast to protect against a possible allied invasion and Denmark was suppos ed to be kind of supplying people for the Germans so the last part of the agricultural produ ction went to the German army and the last part of the industrial production went to  so Denmark as a matter of fact became kind of unwilling  but still partner to the German war effort   one has to admit that  but this  sorry yes... Let me ask you about the Jewish community a nd your family in particular.
Otherwise  they used to have public sports and Jewish services  religious services  they taught in schools  not schools at home for children  at hospitals there was a place where they used to -- there was a certain industry in Ghetto  to produce certain items or to fix up German uniforms.

There we re a lot of assets deposited in Switzerland by German  Hungarian  etcetera  Jews  everyb ody was putting their money in  whether it was Jewish or not.
And my sister was arrested and taken to the Gestapo  and all the Jewish kids were arrested.
In the town there were about 30 Jewish families  and life was normal.
There was a Jewish bank  you know  that it was more of a -- it was a bank  it -- it functioned as a bank  and it charged interest  but it was more a beneficial society  you know.
Did you -- you just reminded me  but did you  after you left home  after you left Germany  did you ever celebrate Jewish holidays again?
And the people  the Jewish peopled them undressed  helped them to clean up bodies  and helped them in the shoes and in the uniforms came in ghettos to be washed.
Only the Jewish army station in the ghetto  and -- and the main thing was  everything what came about from Kofsky.
Amsterdam uh had an old Jewish quarter and the Germans put fences sort of around it and when you entered it  it said Juden fer tal  only for Jews.
So uh...and uh since most of the customers my father had were non-Jews  I mean this decoration which you c ould display in a certain way  helped him so he was still accepted as a as a German  if you want to  because at th is time there were no Jewish...special Jewish or something like.
I remember I had a necklace full with Jewish emblems; and  and I thought  \ Oh  when I come in a non-Jewish area I better take that off.\

The Jewish police got the order to go and get the slave laborers  so that was one part what was what the Jewish police did.
He first he beat the hell out of him  and the Russians came around  there wa a lot of soldiers  they came around and they seen wh ats going on  they didnt intervene at all  til the guy got ready  and then he s he says to the Russian  he said  this is the guy  when we were in the ghetto in the and boxcars used to come in Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 20with potatoes or other kind of food for the ghetto  so this guy took away all the food  he gave it to the local people and to us  when it in the bottom on the train there was dirt  he said  this is for the Jew.
Ma -- there was never any prejudice in my family -- I remember even my grandfather -- now I remember that they had probably some Jewish friends  from the names that they -- vaguely I remember  but one more -- one th ing really Im very happy of  that in Trieste we have the most beautiful synagogue  beautiful  and I dont know how it was not touched.

That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in Warsaw  the 70 000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry  or whatever industry that was working for the German economy.

They are mostly farmers  not very educated  and they looked at a Jew as a foreigner who doesn't belong in this society  in spite of the fact that there were quite few prominent Jews in the Army  very limited  who were colonels or one was a general  but they mostly were connected with medical services through the Army  but not the organization or things of this nature.
And they used to the Jewish people used to go there to this what they call a restaurant.

And other thing interesting say at that time that I have to tell you was a girl in our town from a very high -class family  put it this way  was Jew.
There were a lot of discussi ons  and I will never forget when the aunt who came to Libau  she was going to make me these Viennese sandwiches so on and so forth  I remember still my aunt was saying to my father  the Anschluss was taking place in Vienna when Hitler marched in  that Jewish women were forced to take off their furs and to wipe and polish the cars.
But yet  there were -- yo -- I told you about this doctor  the Jewish doctor  my friend that we escaped together with th -- when -- that he went to the hospital to get the job?
And then  of course  we -- we knew some Jewish songs  which ar e popular in this country  too.
There was a curfew  but we still were able to go out and go shopping and buy food with uh the Jewish star on.
There are Jewish circles who condemn Poles for anti- semitism simply because it is now more convenient because there are now until at least recently they were more helpless than the Germans.
So wouldnt they then assume that you were Jewish  or not?
And so I heard a lot of stories and I knew a lot about Jewish life.

While we're talking about that  non -Jewish children also were Hitler youth and Hitler maiden.
And he paints with an absolutely fa ntastic imagination the situation of the Jewish people if Hitler starts a war  where millions of the Jews will -- will be killed and disappear.
I -- thats still sort of a dream in the back of my mind  because somehow -- I know Im USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 49 Jewish  theres no escaping it  theres just no escaping the fact that youre Jewish  no matter how friendly  how welcoming an environm ent is and the United States is the most -- probably the -- the friendliest country for a Jew to live in today  maybe even Israel.

>> Dora Klayman: At one point  unfortunately  before he returned  someone who was not from that town but who -- was from like one of the surrounding villages -- w e found out later on who it was  pointed out to the Ustasa who were returning the place at the time that there was this Jewish woman in this house.
He was a soldier  and they had like a -- well  a soldier girl from the Army  where they went for food and things  no  like a restaurant  and over there he met a girl  she was from Hungary  Jewish  and -- but he left  it was the +  so he went to Israel  and then she followed him  and he married her.
>> Sylvia Rozines: That's why they didn't throw on the factories bombs because they realized that we were Jewish people laying there.

His wife thought that he's dead because the Germans killed all the Jewish POWs.
Jew!ﬂ every time there's a name of a Jew  but otherwise  no.

In one of the meeting we had  oh  a few years back  I never forget that little bit -- was little bit touchy  I disagree little bit with that -- one of the speech  had one professor from Schenectady University  he was a young  Jewish professor  35 years old  something like that.
Anyway the Russians were advancing and the Germans decided to evacuate most of their key machinery in the factory as well as us  those four or five hundred Jewish prisoners who were in the camp who by that time were considered kind of specialists or important people.
So we just  on our own  we left th-the HIAS [indecipherable] Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 46tell us to go there  but we decided he picked himself up  he came to Washington   got in touch with somebody  also through the Joint here  di like Jewish Social Services  and they took him someplace.
He must have said something  ﬁIf you're a good Jew you don't eat it ﬂ and I must have said  ﬂI'm not a good Jew  I want the pork.ﬂ I don't know but there were altercations about this.
Next day he came with two Jewish guys from the Russian Army  also from Poland  they put on a full table money  they did n't want to touch it.
Do you know anything about where your father fit politically in the Jewish community?
And this manager  the Jewish manager Mr. Weinstock  who managed the factory  was getting fidgety and he excused me by saying that I have to back to work and shoved me out of the door.
Michelle  the daughter that I went to Austria with is probably the most -- they all -- they all know that they have a Jewish mother.
that there were no more than 35 000 Jewish concentration camp survivors in Germany and Austria.
My question is : During the years of C ommunism in Romania  were you persecuted again for being Jewish?
And by the way  I dont think that the most of these cr azy SS men  Gestapo  knew what a Jew looked like.
F-E-I-G-L. F-E-I-G-E-L would have been a more Jewish name but G-L was a typical Austrian name  almost as common if you will  as Smith in the States.
And we were in this -- in this Jewish hotel in -- I think it was [indecipherable] just outside Amsterdam.
And so the younger told me it was very easy  but others  Jewish members help us out.
So I came to them and I told them  ﬁListen  I am a Jew.
This was near the Jewish quarter and they figure maybe the Jews have a lot of valuables hidden there.
You know  it's funny  I never really ga ve that much thought because it wasI knew other people where their father was Jewish or vice versa and the mother was Jewish.
Why were ther e no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office?
I think you're right when they find out she is partly Jewish  officially they--.
I also became much more aware of -- of Jewish things  things Jewish after we moved to Brussels  Brussels had a much more active Jewish community  more synagogues.
They have these -- these ideas  you know  that a Jew on penalty of death maybe wouldnt cross himself  you know  because I [indecipherable] you know.
So the presence was massive  there was always an issue  and in Romania when I lived  it was th e second town of Romania  and by that time it was almost half -- a little bit le ss than half of the population was Jewish.
Any Jewish newspaper  if I write it well  would pick it up.
Were you ever asked to serve in Palestine by either the British army or by Jewish Palestinians?

So it was known -- Who was Jewish -- -- for example -- yes  because these were re mnants in Greece  and in -- in -- in the Balkans of the 500 years of Ottoman rule  where not only the Jewish communities  the Greek communities under Ottoman rule  they were a se -- effectively self regulating  and self governing  except  of course  for matters of war  or crimes  or things like that.
It was hard because like I said  the Romanians were not big fans of the Jewi sh people and so there were no Jewish teachers per se.
But again  based on this assumption  that certain categories of people are going to be bypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups notion obviously came very known in the Jewish community.
He said well if you convert  I can get you a birth certificate of grandparents  because you had to have at least two  grand  non Jewish   Christian.

And Deni didn't  didn't understand German but she felt is when she came in and she said to me  lady please give me the Shulameet  I shall take her to the country and nobody will know she is a Jew.
And this place was -- was on the weerneck  next over there -- over their fence was a Jewish cemetery  Kierkud  and tha -- across the street  on the ‚nother side of the occupovasid  but a little bit farther was again shufka.
Not Jewish communists  but Lithuanian communists  who e ither would be there  or w ho had been in somehow or other known  or active?
And there they saw actually they saw that he is Jewish  and so they took him then to Sered  and from there they took him to the concentration camp where he [inaudible] yeah  to Auschwitz  yeah.
What was reaction of the Jewish community around you to the news that was coming out of Europe ?
And besides this  if they had any problems  they had right away in that house  people whom they could ask and turn to  because these  and these  their Jewish commun ity you see  had contacts with getting food  getting other things an d so forth.
I think it was in 1975  or 74  there was a letter came from the Jewish community  they were going to have a 50 year reunion of the Jewish community of val -- of Volos  of the people who left Volos  because a lot went to the United States  a lot went to Israel   or other parts of Europe  or Athens.
And my father took some ve ry big risk because only one country on Europe during the war German sugges t if somebody hire Jewish be killed on spot  what happened thousand  thousand times.
Anyway  it tooks years; and finally I came  uh  uh... and a Jewish organization came along and helped me.
One time  again you can read that if you want in the biography  there were three kids who were in a home for Jewish children which was completely under German control.
And I re member having the street smarts to sing a patriotic song  so that nobody could accuse me of either being too Jewish  or too whatever.
He was working with a Je wish a -- Jewish agency  I believe  the father.
When I was being when I had st ones thrown at me  I dont know now whether I realized that that was anti-Semitism  that it was because I was Jewish  I dont know.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 49 Lets -- lets talk about -- I dont want to make it a question  Ill just say lets talk -- talk a little bit about your Jewish identity.
Uh the fact that I was Jewish I think did not matter at that time.
So I -- I want to get back to this Jewish thing for just a little bit  because so much of what happened to you  or everything that happened to you was predicated on your being Jewish.
anti-Semitic attitude at that time  so he was not mistreated as a Jew  he was di mistreated as as an as an not only as an American  but by the fact that there was not enough food for the German peop le  the captive Americans were given no food at all.
So they were killing lot of Jewish people and they were killing all the Jewish people they could find.
Because what was going on town and these pograms and attacks on Jewish  there was no reason to be religious because  you know  a religion is a wonderful thing when you're comfortable and everything goes the way  but if things don't go your way  and you're being murdered for no reason at all.
They did come through when I did Jewish music and Jewish this and Jewish that.
There was a -- a steam ba th with a sort of a small makeshift beach  that -- owned by a Jewish businessman  that sort of became the hanging out place in the summer.

When the Jewish blood spurts from the knife  then we will all be free.
There were two German Jewish couples who were a little bit on the rough side  who became much rougher in St olp  more to say about it.
There was a sergeant there  a Jewish sergeant and he took a liking to my dad and he said to him  you know Leon  Im going to be stationed in Germany.
Right at the end of town  there was a Jewish cemetery there.
Now  with -- you see  the Jewish cemetery had -- they were -- adjoining Polish cemetery  and Tartar cemetery  there were brick walls in between.
More important  in order to uh have the possibility  to monitor the Jewish movement and to  to  uh to get a better from their point of view  the fascist government  a better possibly to  to uh to keep control of the Jewish population  th ey order that all the Jewish people from small town around our town  for example  to go and to go  to come in the big city  like our city.
I have here in Utica many Jewish people are goo d friends  close friends.
But do remember the survivors and the 6 million innocent and the 1 1/2 mill ion children who were murdered for no other reason than just being Jewish.
I think there were two of us in the cl ass who were Jewish.
So they...first of all a Jew doesn't deserve that he he should ge t an answer at all.
So I got a order from Bukonroffsky  from September 1943  that he gave a order to all Polish AK members  that they should go out in the woods  and to find the Jewish Bolshevik bandits  and to kill them.
So Jewish life was a rich life  I would say  although I must tell you  sa -- when -- I go back now to -- to this sa -- during the day on Saturday  the thing that really touched me is my mother would tell us stories about her life as a teenager in a little town in Poland.
It makes me sad  but at the same time  I feel the Jewish peoples going to survive.
I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the river if they get water  and it didn't make at that point in time  it didn't make any difference whether you were Jewish  Polish  catholic.
So what I went  I went to the Jewish organization in Austria  Vienna  and I asked what I can do?
So I said to him  \ But if I move to a Jewish family  I'm already taking away the place that my brother could take.\
Mother is alone and the letters that she writes to Father  21 Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their Jewish population.
We were growing up in a small town  population about 35-40 000  and it was I would say that the Jewish population amounted to ap proximately ten percent  no more  due to the fact that there were large factories in the city  in the town  which were government belonged to the government  and the people who were employed in those factories they were manufacturing ammunitions  and also they had foundries and iron ore mines People who were employed in the factories were mostly Christian people  gentile people.
So he came to our commandant of our camp  which was a Jewish man from Krakow.
This was the cream of a cream  you know  the elite of the Jewish intelligence.
And it was three weeks  as long the war lasted  I was a soldier  till they caught me  and  as a prisoner of war  and all the Jewish prisoners of wa--all the prisoners of war  they sent to Ger many  to work there.
There were tons of Jewish people in that concentration camp but the power rested with the seven SS guys.
We escaped from this hiding place  went to the attic of the Jewish Administration Building where Lucine's father was still active there  and through the hole in the wall I see my parents and my sister walking with hundreds of people to unknown  to the concentration camp.
The government said the Jewish children cannot go to the public schools.
Maybe in -- not in so -- s -- same degree  you know  but we was not much better than Jewish people  you know th at  when we give you interview about my wife  Frieda and myself.
So your school was Jewish   where you went to school?
And one da y I came to her nobody was ar ound us I said  \ Are you Jewish?\
Q. So you and the ten other Jewish children are sent to Brussels in 1940.
It was another thing  we came to -- tto Krakow  and i -- I went to school in Krakow and my mother register me already -- not -- she didnt want to register me th-th-that I am Jewish  because after the war they had still pogroms in -- in Poland.
But i -- but a -- a New York Jew is an entity unto itself.
I said  \ You can't ask the Jewish organization which are now spending every penny they can raise to save the lives of these D.P.s to move them out of here and to rescue them to put money 76 into trying to get restitution of Jewish property.
And of course that -- that was totally disarming and I -- I always remember that  because when I came to America  of course  then I realized that this a multi-cultural country and multi-racial and certainly not the kind of background that I came with  where it was predominantly Catholic and a min-minority being Jewish  so that it didnt compare and that was another sort of eye opening experience.
It took us a few days and we ran across somebody  a Jewish man who was a blacksmith from years ago from a city in Gloslavik (349) in Poland.
So I can imagine seeing this other young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me.
And I says  but I must tell you  its very hard  very hard for me to look around and see people that havent got the slightest idea of what the Jewish population went through.
And and before that time  I was sort of part of the social fabric of of my playmates  but I also was Orthodox Jewish  so I was sort of a blend.
Yes  even if you get killed  at least you're not going to get killed because you're a Jew.
And I got there  they told me they Interview with Helen Goldkind February 21  2001 6cannot sell me the ice cream because I was a Jewish child.
And uh so I spent uh uh a couple of nights outside of my apartment and uh then uh more and more uh news reached us...and I took cont...tried to contact my other friends and found out that also the uh the uh major administra tive buildings of the Jewish communities had been somehow vandali zed  so that uh there was no...there was no activity.
Then  when we moved here  we joined a congregation  wh ich was Bethesda Jewish Co ngregation  which was a very strange congregation and not too successful for us  because the kids hated religious school so much  it was so poorly organized and so poorly done  that they absolutely refused to be bar mitzvahed.

>> Bill Benson: So Jewish kids had three classrooms in this large public school.
Well  since my husband was Jewish and I had then lived with my family for a year  I had really accepted that faith as mine.

Probably saying to me how can she still believe in God when she saw all of these things happening to the Jewish people.
Well I entered a Jewish parochial school - a day school at the age of... I was still five  not quite six when I entered school.
So by July  by the beginning of July  Hungary had only one Jewish community left  and that was in Budapest.

Another Jewish family gives their house and their rooms as a Jewish community center organized.

Hitler's Nazis who didn't know me But hated me merely for being bor n Jewish and in one  single day Murdered in Auschwitz my entire family.
I mean  you know  that was  for instance  one of the great contrasts between Americ a and Europe  because in America -- in Europe people knew about the Nazi regime   and it was not only a Jewish affair  thousands of non-Jews  10 thousands  hundr ed thousands [indecipherable].
But  he imme diately took that and was sort of like in a coma  so he was  obviously they couldn't ta ke him along  so they put in a phone call and had the Jewish hospital pick him up and then my mother and sister were taken and they told me to come along because they said it's likely if the father is not capable of being transported  that my mother and sister would be sent home again.

Becaus e we--they-- didn't want to have Jewish refugees in Paris  and so they evacuated and we went with other Belgian non-Jews into--we ended up after a long ordeal on the train and buses in central France  in the Ardeche.
We went up to the room s  two rooms were taken already  taken by the Jewish police.
We had the money and consent already from the Jewish community there.
And thats what you do  you -- you know  they need clothing  you -- you get together clothing from other people  you put it in the valise  and wicl -- and food  you go to bakeries  you -- you [indecipherable] need -- in Jewish its shnorer  you know that means you -- you get together s -- food and whatever they need.
And I said no  I dont think I hide that Im Jewish.
And of course  no Jew is going to say he lives on Goering Strasse or on Adolph Hitler Platz.
And I went back to the Jewish Social Service  and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available  and th ey said  ﬁCome  its part time  if something opens as full time  well get you as full time.ﬂ I was just going to ask your -- your Masters degree is in -- is it -- Social work -- social work at Catholic University?
Did you  uh  feel that you were different in any way because you were Jewish?
They were trying to help the Jewish people there  but the Germans didn't let them do it.
But also  I mean  af ter '33  you didn't have many Jewish children.
And I said  ﬁFor God sake  its towards the end of the wa r. I dont have to take anything from such a anti-Semite.ﬂ I got annoyed  and I called the o fficer who looked Jewish to the other room that I want to talk to him.
Now  my grandfather was actually the very few f -- you know  ffarmers in Jewish ca -- fashion.
Did you have any sense of how well trained the Jewish fighters were  how organized they were?
It was important to marry in my same faith  because my youth and my upbringing was Jewish and my holidays and all that and you know  and here I have a Jewish girl  who knew what -- what -- whats all about and -- and not only that  but she understands me  she understands my bac kground.
I take it the majority mostly went -- if we didnt have a Jewish state  we went to Palestine.
To give you an example of self rule  if there was a dispute between two Jewish people  between two Jewish businessmen or what have you  it was customary not to go to court  but to go to a dintorah.
If you asked him  who are you  what are you  he would say I am a Jew.
I didn't have any knowledge about the Jewish religion but it didn't matter.
Yes  by that time they -- of Jewish extraction  you know  somehow.
Well  my wife was -- we -- w-we -- when the Jewish committee was organized  of course  I was busy.
What other functions did the Jewish Council and the Jewish police serve?
Some urban  some rural  people that had only in common by being persecuted by the Nazis because of being Jewish.
That was going on for three  four days  until some goyim 26 -- decent goyim -- were able to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there  because they lined them up and they murdered them on the spot.
As a child growing up and going to school in Copenhagen  uh what were your relationships if any with Jewish students in the school?
And -- and my sister and I and my two cousins and my -- and my sister-in-law were the only Jewish children there.
I think that it was about  maybe half of the popul ation was Jewish.
Well  right away after we were invaded  we had a call from a well known uh Jewish Socialist/Communist friend of my grandparents to as k for shelter.
The Jewish  because I had a Jewish star on it - they say you brought freedom  freedom to us and these  the whole the whole ghetto felt that America saved them.
But God  lets say Im n-now saying from the sight of the non-Jews  if he create -- he w -- he picked out -- he picked out a Jew.
The neighbors again  I dont think we had any Jewish neighbors in the building  or perhaps there were some next door  but I -I dont remember any.
We know that Hitler didnt -- didnt -- he was a ideological motor all the time  especially in the Jewish question.
Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24  2003 59Philosophically   I think the Likud policy of trying to presser -- of the occupied territories is contrary to Jewish la -- to Jewish law and contrary to Jewish interests  because theyre trying to create a South Africa   where we have -- you cant be a religious state where some people are more equal than others.
And my friends  they were the best friends of mine from school  they put on brown shirts and started to knock out windows in Jewish stores  the same thing what happened in Germany.
And for a Jewish organization called Conference of Jewish [indecipherable] Germany to send a letter to somebody who was five month in th e concentration camp  you -- your application for compensation is rejected  is a minor pleasure.
You know  revenge  and I remember one Polish Jewish boy said    the Polish national anthem.
Now  that sounds like an illusion and a terrible accusation  but I experienced here in my early days more direct Jew calling than I did in Germany.
There was a Jewish school and everybody knew where the Jewish school was.
There were lots of Jewish kids that ran aw ay without their parents.
Like all my friends  my Jewish friends  not all  but maybe 60 or 70 percent  they left school and they went to Israel.
Her state of mind at that poi nt actually improved  or she took heart from the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the concentration camps working at Telefunken  but there were also German soldiers who had been injured on the Russian front   many of whom were missing limbs and Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 17were put to work basically  as best they could in the factory.
According to Jewish customs  on S aturday you walk into the synagogue.
One of her aunts had a maid and she recommended where to go  to a woman  who was non-Jewish and he r husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp.
And over there the Jews was  and in [indecipherable] were Jewish  and in Lwow   too  there was so many.
So he did his shtick  and he started to talk  and the most influential one of the most influential people in the community  a Jewish doctor  got up and came to table; I was sitting with a friend.
And I so we came there  to this wonderful home  which was full of German kids  emigre kids German Jewish kids.
The commission consisted of Germans and Lithuanian s  because the Lithuanians showed them where is the Jewish home and the little secr etaries.
The more the Jewish kids  Jewish students come together  because they sometimes was the object of some bad words  maybe bad action.
However  since I was accepted to law school  and in the beginning I th ought maybe Ill be a law-lawyer  and however when the instructor professor wa s coming to the class and you know  the Jews were sit standing behind the benches and he said still  the Jewish student will not sit on the left hand side  I will not star t the lecture.
Whats the when you when you look at the American milieu  the American life  and I take that to be primarily Jewish American life  and you look at that sort of ethos and spirit and people there  and Israeli  could you expand a little bit on on where you see the differences  where you see the similarities as far as Thats very complicated.
Nothing that would have involved a community agency  a Jewish agency  a government agency.
69 P-Province of Modena had approximately 250 Jewish families spread out.
I did not want them to feel that they would be persecuted just because they are Jewish .
She was married to my mothers brother  and she survived because she wasn't Jewish.
I didn't quite understand how just go back a little bit  when you liv ed in the house on Zichy Jeno Street  before it became a clin ic  it was a Jewish house.
You said something interesting  had ther e not been a Holocaust  there would not have been a Jewish state  and -- and made me wonder  had there not been a Holocaust  how would your life have been different?
Because if you will tell Jesus when he was alive that he would be a God  he would probably commit suicide  cause he was a very good Jew.
I didnt know what their title was or anything  I just  Jewish congregation of Straubing   to the head of it  and I got an answer back from them  and they we told them th what day we would be in Straubing.
He then married in this ancient  ancient Jewish family  but that was a mixed marriage.
We went through side streets and though alleys and we wound up at Basils delicatessen on Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street  and we figured well have the last good Jewish meal.
Did it go on  you dont remember any restrictions cause No  I mean I went to my private Jewish school.
You see these were not all Jewish refugees  although the majority were.
We were taken to what was once a...the Jewish gymnasium in Sosnowiec  which now served as a \ Durchgangslager.\  \
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 18 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: her to the  she will  she will get a  she will get a gentile  she will not abe a Jew anymore and I said to the Veronica  no I can't give away my child.
And as I mentioned before  when we went back to Lublin  these were very chaotic times  there were people going back and forth and trying to find each other and -- and we were greatly helped  of course  by the refugee organizations  you know  by the Jewish agency and so forth  and -- and people just didnt know what to do with themselves  you know  the survivors  you know  they were -- there was no job  this -- that they could get jobs  or they established businesses  or reclaimed businesses.
Well  we had -- now  eventually  when we had to operate as a Jewish group for four months  this was -- thats where the woods stand -- because we already  like I say  we joined the two groups  we joined all together.
Well  so Im a Romanian Jew  what difference does it make?
And how did you feel as a young Jewish child going to a Catholic school.
Do you know her name  her nationality  her -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 8 Unfortunately I dont  and -- whether she was Jewish or Polish  Im not sure  but theres -- someone had told me that she survived the war  but nobody -- just -- by -- by now I am sure that she is not alive  because I was -- I was eight or nine years old  but that woman must have been in her 40s.
We had them and we had Catholic and Protestant agen cies and most of all we had the OSE  which is a ch -- Jewish child welfare organization in France.
I cant tell you exactly now which one is which  but anyway  Usas or -- Colonel Usas told my father that the only thing I can think what to do in this situation  Ill appoint you as a director of the Jewish hospital.
So  then I felt it's not only the Germans  but everybody enemy to each Jew  even to people who were not Communists  who were not part of the Soviet government.
So I said  \ I am not Jewish; there is no reason for me to have an armband.\
Now they came looking for me because he wanted to tell me that he appreciated me returning his money to him  that it was really surprising that somebody who's Jewish would not steal it but return him the money  and 8 frankly when I discovered it was money I was had some second thoughts of whether I should have done it or not.
It didn't have a large Jewish community  but it had a synagogue  an orthodox synagogue and my  as a matter of fact I remember my father and my my uh grandfather going to synagogue uh and I remember on Friday night they had services  Friday night  and we had our dinner and the candles on Friday night and uh it was it was a pretty tight Jewish community.
If I tell you the truth  as an American citizen of Jewish faith.
Maybe the Jewish people didnt make any more money  but they tried to acquire like candelabras  a suit.
They just felt we'll take the star off and nobody will even know that I'm Jewish.
Those accepted only two percent of a small percentage of Jewish st udents  and they had to be the best.
Three policeman with this young German Jew and my husband said  \ Do you know me ?\  \
I had an advantage over the other Jews who were coming from Poland  who didn't speak Germ an unless they spoke Yiddish  and uh  Yiddish to some unfortunately  to some of the Germans  to the SS was like waving a red  uh  red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish.
There was a guy who owned a USHMM Archives  RG-50.549.02*0007 36supermarket chain  a Jewish person who was a quite a philanthropist.
I wasn't the type of guy  they did some --some Jewish boys  they wear peyes(earlocks) or something like this  they like to grab the pais.
It became obvious that the home had to be closed  and that's when the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants of France  this Jewish welfare organization for children  entered the picture.
I understand as of late right now  they changed that any public property -- like  for instance  a synagogue  a Jewish school  or the cemeteries or any lots of that nature that had belonged to the community as one  if they had claims to prove through legal means  they would return it back to the community.
We didn't know the background then about the negotiations in Stockholm betwee n the American Embassy and the Jewish -- well  congress on one hand and this foreign office on th e other.
And she wa -- at -- in the time I think -- I believe she was a nurse in the Jewish hospital there.
I know about the anti -Jewish laws they enacted starting from 1938 where they restricted the number of Jews who could work even at private companies.
And also my mother had a cousin who was in the Jewish brigade.
And he wrote many letters  some to the New York Times  some of -- of which were published  to the Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities during his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal.
And then there were two people some somehow  and this gets confusing  I was back at the Jewish Childrens Bureau  or somewhere  where these two people came and talked to me.
He went -- he -- he walks through Asherslabin when everybody would 52 know in -- in the district that hes a Jewish boy  but nobody was worried.
So we went through our documents and tore up everythi ng that in any way i -- i -- i -- hinted at -- at the status as -- as -- as a half Jew  and my mother being sort of a probational -- an Aryan -- tore up all these hard won papers  tore up family pictures of my gr andfaren -- parents  who looked Jewish.
So I didnt know  we didnt let on that we were Jewish or anything like that.
And I look at them differently  just like the Germans -- the non-Jewish people looked at Germans who -- or who are Jewish  and [indecipherable] they said they like us.
He is now the president of the -- what is the Jewish university -- A school -- Brandeis?
All of a sudden .. people Jewish people were in demand as speakers.
And -- So Nessie and Floras group  is that Jewish Holocaust survivors and friends of -- Yeah  yes  yes. --
Bar Mitzvah and -- and -- Did you feel very Jewish at your Bar Mitzvah ?
Oh yes  there was a Jewish library  and all kind of Zionist lectures  and -- and we went -- we were exposed as young children already  to go  everybody want to -- hey  well go -- well try to go to -- to Israel.
You are a Jew  and your fiance said that I have to bring you back.\
The JD C did not have any staff in Germany and we were the representatives of -- we were the overseas relief organization for the American Jewish community.
And the father of this boy called the Gestapo  here is a Jewish doctor  pretends to be Polish.
My mother immediately called the orthopedist at the hospital and was told  sorry  he isn't treating any Jewish people and he can't help.
But for whatever reason  maybe because it was ordinary tr agedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the Holocaust  he didnt tell me about the fact that his first wife had died.
Was this place where later I get the order to release the Jewish  last Jewish people  which was alive.
Most of the agencies  Jewish agencies  in France were worki ng with our money.
Even Gentile people  or course  who had never seen a Jew wanted to be there.
In 1938 this violence against the Jewish population was expressed through an evening of violence that targeted shops and businesses.
So one of them 21 Jew (Slovakian) 17 gave me a piece of bread and a piece of bacon  you know  to me.
My father who was in Buchenwald  and they had no choice or didn't think of a better solution  was evacuated with the Jewish group a few days before myself and the rest of the camp of Buchenwald was emptied out.
And I had friends  I had man y  I had many Jewish friends  because we were many Jews that were there  running away and Luci en was also a nice place  it was the mountain we went.
I knew him  and he would send us food and send us clothing  and I think we did it also through the Jewish Community in Cairo.
Did you have any contact with any Jewish Christian organizations  any organizations of ecumenical nature?
What can you tell me about the day that you turned 13  which is so important for a young Jewish boy?
Then they organized the ghetto  they organized the ghetto so he was responsible for the Jewish should have where to live.
So you go your way and learn more about Germany and I am a Jew and I want to learn more about being a Jew.
I just wonder  I have heard of anti-Semitism in the Black community that might have effected  for instance  Jewish Civil Rights workers  but I have not heard too much about USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 96 anti-Semitism in the anti-war movement.
We cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first reaction he said to me  you know young lady  this all sounds like a fairy tale.
Now the Jewish people had stores around town and I guess all kind of stores   like suits and clothes and materials and so on and so on.
Jew -- the Jewish students had to sit in the back row?
The Jewish community relations which I am a chairman of the Holocaust Committee here in t in our organization  and anytime something happens  they call on me.
By this time already there was more hunger in the ghetto and anyway  the Jewish the Judenrat was forced to make a list of so many people for resettling.
The food was almost none; until the Jewish Federation there in Piaski established a kitchen  where we were getting daily uh l pot of soup per person and some bread.
106*0143 27 during the there was a vacati on period about four weeks or so and there was one kid a German kid  not Jewish  who drove he was 15 years old and he drove a milk delivery vehicle  it was a motorized vehicle.
So there it is  a Jewish refugees war against the Nazis.
Because Mr. Bereczki -- my grandfather had removed his Jewish stars from his jacket and pants.
This -- this was never a re -- a religious community  but for instance  my daughter Jane went to Jewish gr ade school in -- in Caracas.
I said  \ I'm sorry to contradict you Sir  but your diagnosis of me being a Jew is correct.
And that forced me to ...to absorb and un derstand as much as I could  to.. .to really be as Jewish as I could be in the making of that film.
For a long time  I didn t marry a Jew  I never went to the synagogue.
I don't have to deal now with such anti-Semites now when the war is toward the end  and I approach the officer who looked Jewish.
The other ones were either picked up because they were in the resistance -- and one other one was Jewish.
I have to give place to everybody.ﬂ The other partisans  they didn't want them  because when -- if somebody was going away from the ghetto and you were a Jew  sometimes they were killing them.
By the community  by the Jewish organizations  that Iasi will become a place of fighting and we moved westward  southward to Bucharest.
But why should she use a Jewish woman to...\  And especially she liked dark-haired woman.
But eventually I got the job  you know  the one the one Jewish friend  one of them came back.
Now  a few months ago I was invited to Norfolk  Virginia  to speak there for a Jewish central organizations.
>> Susan Warsinger: To the Jewish people in the community in Washington.
And being Jewish I wasn't able to go to the movies or the swimming pool or anything else.
Well  this is -- it is simply -- I've heard of other German Jewish refugees coming to England -- My brother was not German.
And  about a month before the uprising  there came a transport of Russian prisoners of war  Jewish Russian prisoners of war fro m Mins k. Well  in this  this transport  they picked out about 25  30 people  and they were all soldiers  all  one was a captain  that was a Sasha Pechersky   and they wanted anyway  the first day they came that we told them what's going on they want to run away the first day.
I was concerned about my mother and my sisters but I was afraid to get in touch if somebody even looked like Jewish.
I told him that and to buy saccharine because the Jew s were so smart they were making saccharine in the ghetto with the factory. (
Finally  Morrison  who was the Secretary of Labor in the English government and a Jew  came down to us and tried...Yeah...we...we...to convince us we shouldn't have a hunger strike and we shouldn't do this and that  and I wrote especially hymn for the Holy Pesach there and...uh..and that c'est l'appell was everyday and everyone came out and we had a hunger strike for 98 hours.
Ah  as a rule -- as a rule  we got mostly associated with Jewish boys.
However  Colonel  my Jewish friends did wanna put nails under his tire and everything to get even with him.
And if  if they don' t look out for each other  they all get killed  because they're black and because they're Jewish  and the little boy in the wheelchair came up and said  \ Ms. Adachi  will you come to my ballgame  I am great in playing.\
Bill mentioned that some of the enforcement of the anti -Jewish  anti -Semitic laws in Hungary was in 1938  but something called the Numerus Clausus  which were the anti -Jewish laws in Hungary  began in the 1920's  about 10 years before the Germans started the Nuremberg Laws in 1933.
Israel lets any -- as long a -- any Jew in  okay?
Then I found out that she took over the Jewish families  the store  the sh oe store and all his ap artment with beautiful things  with paintings that maybe you see in Louv re  and a big bust of Adolph Hitler.
Was it important to your fa mily that you marry a Jew?
We were observing Jewish but otherwise we were just about the same.
Hes changed his name during wor -- World War Two  when he was serving in a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army.
And would you believe that one of th em gave two or three candies out to Jewish children?
So why dont the American Jewish -- Im trying here the Jewish comm unity  why dont they sort of write to the they said I should do it.
So yes  they were both Nazis  but within the party And one needs to be objective about this  because there are people  Jewish people in particular  who condemn them right out.
They had the company there and they hired they got the Jewish kids.
Yes  I have a few Jewish friend  but like I al ways said  they are American Jew and they dont know exactly what it is to be a European Jew  so we have a lot of difference.
So through the joint Jewish community of the German gu -- [indecipherable] German Reich  at that time  made sure that children that didnt have the means to lodge there  to place them in homes  and also childrens homes.
I sensed that because the words that would follow it would be sometimes easily recognizable: \ dirty Jew.\
But I...I was thinking a Jew even with shaking hands  but he will not kill me or the baby.
He was also very instru mental in building what was a time 3 place for the young people  a big  big building that was established oh about '33 or '34 for the Jewish youth in Esson.
It isnt important what he was -- he was really so down to earth  sitting down with -- with the Jewish guy  sitting [indecipherable] he took him in in the evening  he had a fireplace  and telling stories and all kind of stories  his -- and -- and he -- hes telling also about the Liker  he says he saved his life  he -- Nathan Liker saved my life.
54 I was actually asking for money  and that may have had something to do w ith it  but money for the relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit.
The French anti-Sem itism is really looking at the Jew as a foreign el ement.
What were your relations with -- you were the only Jewish kid in town.
They were  in those days  to give you another example  they were -- to help a Jewish girl find a husband and get married was a big mitsveh.
Frank Liebermann: But 107 affidavits for war refugees because after World War II there were literally millions of displaced persons wh o had lost their homes and he  in fact  was -- received an award from the Jewish Resettlement Agency called HIAS together with President Truman for doing outstanding things to help in immigration.
And I think it was choice of several Jewish people there because they knew that the German don't recognize the Jews and + claim the Jews  so they felt much safer in Germany than Poland.
And Im s orry wa -was it a Jewish organization that Yes  the Jewish Federation.
At one place--if--if my uh wife's grandmother was with us  and eventually an officer with her you know we felt  as Jews  already that we don't belong to any of them--there gonna kick us out but the--the army--the combat troops--they had nothing to do with the Jewish they batik.
They were -- they were also horrified  but it hadnt affected them as badly because many of our Jewish friends had family who had gone through some of these times  so they were more inclined to feel the horror that had occurred  wh ereas some of our American friend who were not Jewish heard about it  but it wasnt as hurtful as it was to us.
When he left  we left because we knew what happened because the Gestapo's gave orders  'if you bring a Jew  you get a pound of sugar.'
We got all the way was made up  got a guy there  a Po lish guy that used to smuggle us to the forest  and we came to Bergen-Belsen  the the Palestine brigade  the Jewish Jewish brigade from Palestine  they were waiting near the border  and put us in on two truck  brought the thing to Bergen-Belsen.
I mean  theyre both examples of difference  and one might be more  sort of steeped in -- in the difference of a European background  and one steeped in a re ligious difference of being Jewish -- being Jewish  so Im just wondering how much you -- I mean it -- living in New York  probably youd perceive it less than in other places.
They were certain rule hiring Jewish man or woman  you know?
We couldn't speak very well  but they all kind of -- if they knew that Interview with Esther Dezube December 7  2000 30I was Jewish  it was just never brought up.
But for quite a time Jewish people didnt know that when there is a transport  the transport is to be killed.
Which is my inspecting a some hospital facility somewhere in this county we were in  which was a hospital for Jewish displaced persons.
Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5  2013 33 Russian and Jewish.
As far as you know were other people on that ship also Jewish refugees?
And the guy I worked with  who was my immediate  I dont know  senior person -- with whom Im still in contact  by the way -- was from quite a traditional Jewish home.
And he said then the little boy ran down  the Jewish boy  and he brought me a babushka.
So the fact that there were two Jewish students in the high school  the Italians did not kick out the Jewish students?
And hes -- when hes getting -- hes looking for another job and -- and -- you had mentioned that he had had -- originally had tr ouble finding work as a civil engineer because he was Jewish.
No  I went to high school  a state high sc hool  which was in more or less in the Jewish district of town.
How do you -- do you feel trusting now  of -- I mean  after having that experience  do you feel that -- that as a Jew  you can really trust -- as a Jew living in America  and as a minority -- Yes. --
A. They first started to get worried when they broke all of our windows  imprisoned all the German Jewish males.
But if your father or your grandfather was a Russian Jew or a Polish Jew  even if you change your name  even if you get to be a priest  you are still a Jew.
And he came in 42  maybe spring 42  or this I dont know either  exactly  but he was from the earliest Jewish transport  he came with the Jewish transport.
And he said he asked me the question  so if you are Jewish  where is the what is the highest holiday in our religion?
So  you know  as soon as they opened mouth  you know  they i-i-in Polish  they knew that they are Jewish people  and it means that they couldnt they couldnt save themselves pretending to be Poles.
He told them he has two...two...two girls  Jewish girls that he asked who are they.
Well anyway  I tried and I went and I convinced and the commandant was very much against me...the Jewish commandant  because he couldn't escape.
And there was one Jewish -- one non-Jewish boy  who was the son of the physician in the town  who went up to the teacher and told her  and she actually did nothing about it  because she was part of the Nazi party.
And then came out a woman  was near a building also  and she came out and I -- she must have been -- told me that she was Jewish -- she is Jewish too.
BB] They looked  they didnt look too bad cause all the bad ones  obviously all the bad ones had gone to the crematorium  but I always remember when [COUGH]  a new lot arrived  and there was a Jew there  must have been six foot six  and he weighed thirty stone at least  and everybody said at the time ‚cor  aint he lucky  how being so fat.
And they put you in jail if you call somebody like here a Jew.
Janoush Korchuk really was an assimilated Jew  but he was Jewish at heart  and at that particular time  he was living outside of the ghetto  but he moved into th e ghetto  and he opened up orphanage houses  which I believe i-is -- he s well documented  even through the United Nations  and when that Janoush Korchuk  wh o was a healer  a doctor of philosophy and everything  the way he composed those child ren   who were already orphaned  and he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 105 was with them.
The kapo was a Jew and the block  kapo  everything was Jewish over there.
So  Im sure I think that I had some of those mixed feelings and wasnt  I was younger th en  that interested particularly in trying to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 41 41dig up a lot of Jewish history.
And it was really one Jewish boy that was in our class after the war  in Berlin  that brought that magazine to school and showed it to us.
And I heard how the woman  Jewish -- Jewish couple  older couple  a woman said to the man  did you hear what these girls said?
And there was like a haze  yellow haze  and then we saw chimneys and we saw thats bakeries  or [i ndecipherable] whatever it is there  and -- and then  as I said  we had to jump down  you know  and it was pretty high  and some of those people that were there  they were Jewish inmates of Auschwitz that helped people to jump down.
Im curious  you had gone to Jewish schools prior to that.
So what youre saying is that the G.I.s were strongly prejudiced against Jewish people . . .
He is a son of a very famous Lithuanian writer and diplomat who happened to marry a Jewish woman  and he has two sons.
I also -- can you imagine th at about the religious schools  the famous Lithuania  I got to know only probably in the -- after our independence  when I was sent -- I wa -- I got a fellowship in Oxford  and I was in [indecipherable] and I learned really what Lithuania means for Jewish culture and religious culture and so on.
And we  my husband was not caught as a Jew  I mean  he was caught as the leader of the French  French resistance.
No  through  they were  the whole family was   there was a woman  she was related and she went with the children's transport  going to France to save the Jewish transport  we knew that.
He was not very religious  but he was very Interview with George Pick November 13  1997 31active in the Jewish community.

What other -- what other sort of official acti ons were taken that affected the Jewish community under Romania at this time?
I start to run but then I figure it's no good to run  people going to think  it's going to be  maybe it's a Jew.
Right away they could tell which house was Jewish because everybody else had to fly the flag.
See  one of -- part of the problem with the genocide was that the society in 38 - 39 did not di scriminate  did not distinguish it  and the Jewish organizations were used as way of dist orting and not clarifying what was really happening.
And when I was in the Jewish cemetery there was nothing to remind me of my grandmother  there was ground.
02:12:38 That there was the same thing in all cities  they had the same  that the Jewish people  the German picked  not the German  but the Judenalteste  the commander  picked some people and that was his police  the kapos.
He left and went to Paris afterwards and founded a -- a fine  deeply religious Jewish community in Paris  Ru cardet.
Jewish children by that time  they were probably dead alr eady  you know?
I took them aside and told them who I was...that I am 20 really Jewish and I am looking now to get back to some place where there are Jews so that I could get to a community...a Jewish community.
But so  when the when the soldiers came  what you have in your memory  if I re if I can repeat it  would be that yo u saw the Jewish people greet them  and then you saw that they were hungry an d dirty and smelly.
We were also in an area what lived other people  but your contact mostly you had with the Jewish  because you were resented very much from the not-Jewish.
So the -- out of the girls be -- the mothers being the ones thats really educate the children  because theyre home  or because the Jewish religion  the Orthodox say so  thats fine with me.
It didn't take long before some people came out and reco gnized  of course  the Jewish symbols  and began to talk to me.
He looked at me  he sai d  \ Very dirty \  in Polish  \ You son of a bitch  you are a Jew.
Secondly  in terms of the Jewish survivor  I felt that in order to restructure a living pattern and to uh uh excite some kind of a cultural development or a return to a- a previous rhythm of life  we couldn't do it in a mixture.
Not sick  or perhaps it was both  and my fa ther threw away the fetus  but one of the the Jewish men in the village  those that had joined us at a la later point  was told that the fetus was thrown away  and he was starving  literally starving  and he went  picked up the dead fetus  cooked it and and they ate it.
His name Witzberger   of course  made him suspect to be a Jew.
The Jewish life just is gone   especially in the small towns where the majority of the Jews lived in Germany.
His comrades knew it  they teased him  said oh  Miller is making a long face  he must have seen another Jew.
I will say this  we did not have to have any i -- wear yellow stars 13 or anything else that identified us as -- you know  physically as being Jewish  and that my mother did speak this perfect German.
Okay  so that I mean  most of the people in our building that ow my dad owned  were not Jewish.
Interview with Erica Laufer 25 August 19  2012 And since nobody had ever seen refugees before and the zeal they have  they assumed it was  thats the way Jewish people are.

But then my sister married a young man from Eastern North Carolina  who wasnt Jewish.
In the later part of the existence of Blechhammer  there were not only Jewish there.
It was so my sister had one classmate in her class who was mischling   you know half Jewish.
My daughter who is also married to someone who was not Jewish  believes very strongly in raising her son Jewish.
Then he told me...he took me to his camp where I was hiding out there for several...for some time until the Germans invaded the camp and I had to leave the camp because I was Jewish.
And the people lined up  but I didnt know my mother was Jewish until then.
They organized a Jewish militia and they come up to the Jewish head of the Jewish militia and say we need tonight so many hundred people...two hundred people.
I am very proud to be Jewish and I'm the better for it.
You see I have to state  ev en in this prison  you knew immediately who was Polish who was Jewish.
No  but its been well documented and they -- they didnt want to be -- a -- a -- a friend of mine  Alex Jones wrote a book about history of the New York Times  and he was the creator -- cur -- cur -- curator of a program at Harvard that I participated in  the Kennedy School of Politics as a fellow  and of course he has a lot in there about the Times not wanting to identify itself as a Jewish newspaper during World War II  and so that was -- That -- does that elicit any emotional feeling in -- in you?
And since th en everybody knew that something terrible is going to happen to the Jewish people in that District.
When Victor and I were in Poland in 1980  we went to visit the Pole -- the Jewish cemetery and it was in horrible condition.
I would say I actually I had two friends  one German  one one Aryan and one Jewish.
Uh it's really...it was the next twenty years what Jewish...the Jewish community in in the world has pursued as goals and so on is defined there.
It would have been very easy for her to point me out as a Jew.
It was a curfew like for the Jewish people  you could not be on the street.
So s-she said I could go to one of the department stores  which had been Jewish before  Salingers  and I went in there to buy a sweater for her.
She got in front of the mirror  dress herself with her best clothes [indecipherable] everything  put lipstick -- she was very pretty woma n -- to look as elegant as possible  not Jewish 44 at all.
they didnt go from house to house as such  but there was plenty of -- remember  with 110 000 Jews  I mean  like every third person Jewish  it wasnt hard for them to -- to pick out the Jews  you know  and so that was -- that was a -- a very -- quite a shock and very traumatic.
Oh yeah  thats good because a lot of peopl e -- lot of people dont -- I tell you  my middle daughters family -- her husbands family  Jewish  she didnt even believe it when -- she said she never heard anything about it during the war.
And uh at that time there was a Jewish boys school and there was a Jewish girls school.
This was the Jewish Labor Committee branch and there were lots of surv ivors in Sweden.
No  (he was) not recognized  so eventually no Jew was any more recognized anyway  so he was drafted in the labor unit and somehow he managed to get into a labor unit which had a commander with whom he managed to get along all right  so he didn't have to work there.

I wrote to my parents on a regular basis  and they answered  and Auntie Elsie took me to a Jewish language school every Sunday  wh ich was a big sacrifice for her because they were very devout Plymouth Brethren Chris tians  and so she missed the Sunday morning service taking me to Hebrew class.
In that train  th ere were a lot of frozen staff people in this train  and he has buried them in the Jewish ritual way.
And my mother  as I said  she tried to offer us to go to work in Germany because she felt as a Polish person -- as a Polish person because she thought that that would be safer because we knew that the Polish people could tell Jewish people much quicker than the Germans.
And there was a uh darkish man with a beard and a beret  look like a Sephardic Jew.
So she find out about me  because when I came to Krakow   and I went right away to two leaders of Krakow  one was -- his name was -- he wa s involved with the Jewish committee  he was a lawyer before the war  his name was Stulbackt .

The brother of an uncle of mine had survived as a Jew in Berlin  and he invited my wife and me to spend our honeymoon in Berlin.
I was faster than he and when he came about the middle like  of the stairs and where there were homes  he was afraid because they shouldn't tell that he's chasing a girl or maybe it's a Jewish girl or something  so he left.
Yes  I believed in it to a certain -- I didn't believe in what's called Jewish Socialists  or left wingers.
And then one day they would agree that the Jewish person somehow will come in th e dark to get some of the gold.

Even though this was  you were  you said it was a town of mostly Jewish people?
And when he was a  and he's the one who didn't go to Jewish school  I mean he  he dropped out essentially  I can't remember  his fourth or fifth grade.
This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army  it just goes to show that you put your secular existence far above your Jewish consciousness.ﬂ And in the corner was this ra -- Spitzer  the lawyer ra bbi  and he was sitting behind his books.
So the people dont understand that they grew up in different environments  its just that being Jewish is a religion  you might not even practice it.
Up to that point  did you have any Jewish friends  were there any Jewish families living in your town?
And there were about  I would say  three or four more Jewish family.
And after they had started with that  then certainly the German bureaucratic perfectionism got into the business  and then they had the systematic liquidation of every Jewish women and kids which they could find in Ukraine  or elsewhere.
When I went to the 121 Jewish qua -- the Jewish quarters  which was about to be dissolved really  in Lower East Side  thats -- thats -- thats my people  thats my youth.
German  and whether Jewish or not  most men were sh -- male chauvinists.
And Im not putting down the Jewish fe but every single paycheck  they had to pay back.
For me it was a surprise that there are different kind of Jewish that they need two synagogues close to each other.
So they had a selfish interest in cleaning up the  the Jewish inside the country rather than the war effort.
He said as he got there early in the morning  two lines had formed  he stood in th e one he believed he had to go through  and the other line were elderly couples and it turned out that these people were undergoing compulsory divorce if one was Aryan and the other one Jewish  they were compelle d to be divorced and he described to me not only the utter silence in which both lines inched forward  but the weeping  the old people as they came back down  not knowing where to go  what to do  w ith whom they could be.
The 20th district also had a good size well  not so [indecipherable] but had a sprinkling of Jewish population.
Now  our leader was a Jew who was forester  which is very unusual for a Jew to be this profession.
They're all family of Jewish butchers  but he broke out of there  ‚though he had barely  probably  a sixth grade education  and he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the east.
And when we arrived...of course  hungry  exhausted  with lice  first met a Jewish fellow and he was in charge of the sauerkraut...of the sauerkraut...uh...basins.
And the and I remember in the most households when Hitler came  they came to the door (they know exactly where to find the Jewish people  by their name and everything  the Austrians) and they came to the door  they took all the men away to the concentration camps.
They said  ﬁSo many Jewish students  so many people are coming here on scholarships  we have to check with the university  is it true or not.ﬂ They called -- I said  ﬁCall them.ﬂ They called them  and Friday afternoon  the offices were closed.
His two sons  theyre married to Jewish USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 46 girls  his daughters married to a non-Jewish  very nice young man.
In the town was about 15 percent maybe Jewish  but I dont know exactly is.
Towards Jews you cannot be harsh enough because the the final solution is the final solution of every Jew  but he took over certain functions that wasn't in in the in the priority...in the in the authority of his superiors...  so they sent him to the to the front and he was killed there  you see  and so it turned out that these five hundred and thirty-four  they had to admit to Dr. Elkes finally that they were killed by the thirty-four that sabotaged the Jews too.
It was in–hen...then it started...the...the...you know  some people let out the...all the communists from the...from the jails and they started to hit Jewish peopl e. Jewish people couldn't go in the streets.
So -- and there were also Jewish policemen  who were forced to do dirty work  sometimes to -- to -- a -- as a whole you didnt trust the -- the -- them.
But one day he called us up  this Fevel and said  \ I saw in a Jewish paper  there was a Yiddish paper  written in Yiddish  it's for the Americana  the American and it said on the front page of this \  unfortunately I don't have that paper any more  I had it for . \
You know we knew there were  they were killing the Jewish people but that they put them all in concentration camps  some of them  and put the gas chamber on.
She was married  and her husband was a Croatian Jew  but he was bank director in Vienna  and she was she loved being a Croatian  a provincial lady  and she actually brought to Vienna a Croat room  a folk room  like a peasant room.
Who was  as it happened in a Jewish family  she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother.
We could not stay  they would not keep us as a Jewish unit.
And they bring from the old houses  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 6 6you know it was about 20 000 people  21 000 Jewish people.
The Jewish population at that time was a little under 8 000  and 90 percent or so  lived in Copenhagen .
I was the first chairman of the Jewish Community Centers Coffeehouse and a co-founder of the Washington Committee for Soviet Jewry.
He was in a church and I said no you are a Jew and he said no I can't.
I didnt know that I was Jewish until [indecipherable] I didnt know I was Jewish  I went to synagogue  but it never concerned me  never ga ve me a problem.
And she told us that she was in love with a Jewish man and he jilted her and shes very happy that she didnt marry him.
But you had a -- Unless a -- I would -- I dont know  I probably didnt look very much Jewish  or something.
But still I just di dnt realize it that shes Jewish.
One day the SS came to our barrack and said  \ Jew s  Poles  Germans  any prisoners  out of the barrack.
I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business  in the store with the non-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who spoke beautiful Polish.
They used to call it [Hebrew name]------- and they went to Hebrew -- the environment was completely Hebrew and Jewish.
You know  they didnt make an issue out of her being a Jew.
But you go with the Polish Jew  he in troubles  because it's a element of theirs is different.
That the survivors of the Holocaus t here in Philadelphia  we have our  first we were called the Jewish New Americans.
And I traveled  nobody stopped me and it so happens that I was never  never stopped for questioning that I'm a Jew.
And it  the whole thing accelerated to the point where the last  when the only way she could be declared an exceptional person  as they were called  which means that youre not considered Jewish  was to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene I remember: her taking my grandmother down and my grandmothe r had to  under oath  sign an affidavit that she is an  she was an illegitimate child beca use my grandmother was cleaning house for a lawyer  a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time  a bachelor.
And I have two cousins in Lyon and th-they were o-of that branch of totally -- of not knowing what they were doing and having really no significant Jewish life  but belonging to something that is so traditional  that God forbid you dont change it  kind of thing.
When the remainder of the Jewish people  the small group of people  became aware of Treblinka  they began to organize themselves into armed resistance.
By the way  there were a number of American Army Jewish chaplains who helped the Brichah in similar fashion.
Yeah  this -- Eugenia works for the Jewish community in Tallinn.
A. The   are you talking about the Jewish or the Polish ?
So when they asked me what is your nationality  I thought I woul d be proud and say I am a German Jew.
But this was on e later of how other pe ople working in this place were Jewish  Blancka recognized some one from her home town.
And so my wife  I think  told him that I was Jewish  too you know  and this  so he invited us after the dealŠwhich was a good oneŠhe invited us to a bar down on the street  an outdoor cafe  to drink something with him.
49 Yeah  I -- my -- yeah  my mother needed a dentist and with protection  s -- and -- and a dentist  because there was no Jewish dentist  a Jew -- a dentist wa s prepared to treat her  when she pays in gold.
So they didn't quite disappear  but since they were not allowed to go to school  you ask me an interesting question  I don't know whether I asked myself consciously the question  where are they now  I think maybe I assumed that they went to other institutions  maybe to Jewish schools or something like that  so it is not as shocking as you think it was  it was kind of a gradual process and maybe I said I wonder where they are  but you kind of assumed that they went to another school or that they  maybe a greater assumption was that they probably went to  to America  to somewhere  but I mean it was not known that -- you see in 38 they were asked to leave  and many did.
So the Jewish organizations told us  it was a very short notice from one day to the other  tomorrow  at 10 oclock assemble all the organizations and we are going to Canada.
In 1937 when I graduated high school  Hitler at that time was in a position where I knew and my father knew and every Jewish person knew that there was going to be a war because you had to save everything that had metal.
At any rate  being a former..a pious Jew who worshiped three times a day  fearing that he may die and his boys would not have prayer book to doven  he said I didn't even have room to stand up because I got...somehow he got paper and ink well and ink and from memory he wrote this siddur  Bohovich siddur.
So  was your family very Jewish identifie d in terms of the synagogue  or was this in terms of social groups more?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview & Readings w/AVRAHAM TORY page 30 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AT: To the Jewish committee.
At that time one of the things was to antagonize the Polish against the so -called Jewish -- basically saying to the unions  we don't want Jewish managers to manage Polish workers.
We did have religious training though  but the religious training came because in Vienna at the time religion was part of the curriculum  and since we were Jewish  that was not given in the schools.
They said that the factories had to pay a salary to the SS for all of the Jewish slave labor that they employed  and this was an indication of my father was considered a premium em ployee  and that the factory would have to pay a higher wage  a premium wage to the SS.
And the Lyba actually  if not Lyba  we wouldnt survive  because he was a village Jew  and his profession was he was a trapper before the war  and he knew the woods.
He want ed to study medicine and for a Jew to enter Dorpet university wa s one of the most di fficult things.
So this is...gives you...I can...I can speak about the underground as much as you wa nt but one...one thing I want to say about the part of the Jewish committee in the underground.
In Czechoslovakia we were just a very short time and then they to ok us with trucks  always with trucks  and always there we re young Jewish boys that came from Israel that were helping us organize it.
JWB: JUDAH NADICH: Oh yes  Umb  there were certain camps  particularly  in Bavaria  under the supervision of the American Third Army  commanded by General Patton  like Feldafing and Landsberg  where the camps were locked  and where the Jewish inmates were permitted to leave camp only by means of a pass system that permitted a small percentage of them to go out of the camp on these passes and of course they returned to the camp before the end of the day.
nods head yes ) And after I met Sam who is not Jewish.
I then got work in a small sausage factory which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees.
At that point there was still a small table of kosher people and actually  I wa s able to eat kosher throughout those years that I was in -- in the Jewish hospital in Berlin.
But you have to be completely Jewish when you had a Christian father also  and a Jewish mother  you were not allowed  I mean  to stay or to do things.
I remember the night she had the baby because she was not -- Jewish people were not allowed to walk -- to go to the hospital .
We took in also a Jewish man  a German  from our state  from Hanover.
And uh things also in this respect became somehow easier for my father and and he didn' t bad...do badly  to the same extent that uh you can say that Jewish business did not...I mean certain of them clos ed but Jewish business  retail stores and so on continued to exist.
He said no German Jews because we dont know if youre a Jew or not.
And later on  maybe -- maybe -- I dont know  six months ago  I read a story in one of the -- somebody was doing a reminiscence in one of the things p-put out by the Croatian -by the -- by the -- what is it called  by the -- by the Jewish Community Center in Zagreb  where this mans sister  who was married by that -- that [indecipherable] Count Ansenberg -- was it Ansenberg?
In Lubartow  they assembled all Jewish from Parczew and other towns.
A Jew couldn't be a janitor  a Jew couldnt be a chimney cleaner.
And I said to Mom  ﬁMama  Im going to Jewish school.ﬂ She started [speaks foreign language here] ﬁWhe re are you running?ﬂ I said  ﬁIm going to a Jewish school.ﬂ And while we going to a Jewish school  they will not cal l us dirty Jew  and no anti-Semites  and I dont want to see them.
But the kids in the playground  Im not the norma l kid  Im a Jew  dirty Jew  right?
He became  uh because he was so highly intelligent  he would uh he would shout very hurtful catcalls when one of the Jewish childr....uh we were three boys in this high sch...in this high school class  and he would uh interrupt by catcalls.
But because of their hospitality reputation  and restaurant reputation  the soldiers in the Jewish brigade  who passed through Holland from Canada  or from Engla nd  stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher  stayed in their house  or ate in their house.
The Newark -- The Jewish community in Newark  the people were born there  but by the time 1950 came around  they started moving out of Newark.
And the fi rst Pesach performance for one of the Jewish organizations was a shock.
I saw the children but I didn't make any point  you know  to distinguish which are Jewish and which are not.
I told them  I said  ﬁWell Im not talking for th e Jewish community.
It was a small town  it was about  I would say -- we -- we were -- it was only about 12 000 occupants and approximately I would say that 50 percent were Jewish.
And so they w ere half Jewish  but both of them were in the organization TOT  which was the labor camp for people they didnt put into concentration camps  but in a labor camp.
There were two other Jewish kids there  the Gestapo intelligence looking for Jewish kids.
And the people who gave us our affidavit were customers of his in America  who are not Jewish and saved our lives.
One time was no ghetto  a gypsy came up  we were standing in th e kitchen  she took my hand and said Jacob is thinking about you - she could say other Jewish na me - can you imagine.
They were aware of being Jewish  and if they werent aware th -- of  this would have made them aware.
The Jewish life in Louve was the best that can be said back in '37 '38 from what I can recall was lukewarm.
Thank God the Jewish people in America have a good life.ﬂ There is some anti-Semitism here  I know.
And you couldnt even use the word Jew  it was only Soviet citizens and so on.
It's true that most of the stores were owned by the Jewish people  but they were little stores eking out a small living.
My Swiss family was happy bec -- because Dan was Jewish and everything.
And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old timers...uh...Polish  non---non-enemy nationals  Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a long time and whom we could trust.
So he couldnt get ma rried officially in Belgium   so he was just married by the Jewish law  yeah.
Survivor and Jewish are  to me  one and the same thing.
We were observant in all the Jewish traditio ns  Im talking the Sabbath  and of course  all the holidays.
He was the father of Rebecca Konigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion.
Right now theyre all Jewish and I dont know how it is but I think its the same with other people.
I think we were on the right side  and being able to carry out that program for the recovery of thousands of pieces of heirless and unclaimed Jewish property.
So when I approached Mr. Gassenheimer back in August sometime  he said  ﬁOh  December  we got plenty of time.ﬂ And first day back at sc hool in sep -- early September  he calls me  he says  ﬁI just looked it up  your Bar Mitzvah by the Jewish calendar is actually November 14th.
In other words  if somebody was to identify me with a friend that is Jewish  they would automatically say why am I siding with the Jewish girl.
And this people said to my father if you have no choice and you are like help the Jewish people we can hire the people. (
Im very interested  Walter  if you have me t Jewish survivors who youve talked with about your experiences?
And uh while my mother was at this  at this theater  uh she spotted a friend from across the street uh whose daughter was quite friendly with uh his name was Fritz Salten   and Fritz was uh working for the Jewish Council to try and and get some comfort and and support for the people that had been arrested  detained or whatever word you want to use.
Because children in that time were -- there was no statute to forbid children  Jewish children  to go to school so I used to go to regular school.
Don't...don't buy from a Jew because they were...we were quite persecuted in Poland.
Upstairs  the top floor where you begin your tour  you'll see doctors measuring kids' heads because they could tell a Jew from the size of his hea d and how the bones were structured.
And she called me before sh e left  she wanted me to know  because she knew that I will enjoy hearing from her  that she is going to visit these two countries that had such also tragedy  you know  with the Jewish people.
And the other great e-event in those days was that the teacher who was sent in  not a Jewish teacher  who was assigned to teach the Jewish children in my class  came in -- in an Austrian volksschule  in Austrian [ind ecipherable] the chi -- you behaved very well.
And from one day to another  she said  with tears in her eyes  ﬁMy father forbade me to play with you any 5 longer  because you are Jewish  and he belongs to a certain German organization  and would be a danger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl.ﬂ That was my very first -- and  I had to give you all these things you get from everybody  because of course  you met it everywhere  from your greengro cer -- and you met the other  too  people who stood up for you  and perhaps a most outstanding one was we ha d a super in our house  and he denounced my mother to the Secret Police  and denounced me  too  because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend  which was against the Nuremberg laws.
How can the museum be a -- a -- o-only preaching about the Jewish genocide?
The Swedish section of the World Jewish Congress  had someth ing to do with it.
And he run away from Poland  as a Polish officer  not only as a Jew  but as a Polish officer  and she went with him.
So they took fur from the coats  you know  every little girl had the fur collar  they took that and -- and the Jewish police -- police collected it.
So they decided again maybe my recollection time -wise not exactly month or year  but and '40  USHMM Archives RG -50.030*0151 5 beginning or end or the fall of '40 or beginning of '41  the Jewish community sent or decided to organize own school for Jewish students.
And they organized the youth to help them  the [indecipherable] and there were a lot of Jewish people also involved with the [indecipherable] that they didnt know  they believed them.
In other words  she lived with a Jewish lady on Hector Strasa in Berlin  West Berlin  un the western part of Berlin.
When this telegram arrived in New Yo rk  they went to the Jewish authorities.
I have no idea of any of 132 the names of the others  but this is Miss Schroe der  who had to kick me out cause one of the other kids parents didnt like a Jewish boy in there.
And at the time when we were told that the Jewish people had no more rights to go to school  I was chased out and beaten.
So  because of that  we were among the last few full Jews I mean there were a lot of mixed marriages  and there were a lot of off-spring you know who were half Jewish.
As I mentioned we were in the villages  and -- and there were Jewish -- and there were partisan commanders of the religious and so on.
I don't know nothing about Jewish religion but I mean I--my hus band wanted to do this for his father.
But the majority were not Jewish  but there were some Jews.
And he was hiding the dean of the medical school  Jewish Dr. Beck  B-e-c-k  and his wife and two children.
There was food available only through shipments that came from the Joint Jewish Committee distributing to areas of destruction and . . .
Like today most of the Jewish people  like myself  are not very observant but at that time we were observant.
And the war  and the Nazis  destroyed the Holocaust -- destroyed the Jewish people of Europe.
But it was very frightening to have my sister in a Jewish school separated in the eastern part of Amsterdam.
01:18:35 We got called and I think because we were not Belgian nationals--there  you see  that thing  that stateless Jewish status.

You do you keep in mind  we did not have that large or active a Jewish population.
Do you recall whether this was a newspaper put out by the Jewish council and Rumkowski or was this done by -- Oh  definitely within the ghetto.
I'm right now in Italy in Modena and through the help of an American Jewish soldier  I was able to mail it to you.
So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those children  there was one woman special  and she is in -- in the book th -- what they wrote  ﬁMy Hundred Children.ﬂ She collected chil -- she lost all her family  so she collected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee  and they were on -- they had that [indecipherable]  but she didnt had wa -- what -- how to feed them.
He comes from a very poor working class family  a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the Proletarian environment.
And we went through the war in -- in Dayton  and as I said  he became very active -- he became the conduit for all immigrants coming in  because he had his connections in the Jewish community as well as being able to relate to the immigrants.
I was very angry at those Phi Ebs  which was the Jewish fraternity -- the German Jewish fraternity and the other ones  which Marty belonged to.
And I had very good friends  Jewish and not-Jewish 2 2friends.
So before these new laws start being passed in Germany   did you have both Jewish and non-Jewish friends?
I think the director was a very good man  and -- and -- Was he Jewish?
If both of them will drink  nobody will...and this is...so after having heard this this uh consultation of the chief rabbi  it was the wording of the of the of the forma tion of the ...the announcement was in a say that the Gestapo ordered the Jewish populat ion of the ghetto to appear  not that the Jewish committee but the Gestapo ordered the Jewish community...so and those who will not appear at the...at six o'clock in the mo rning  and those who will not appear at six o'clock in the morning and they will be found in their house  each one which will be found in his house will be killed on the spot.
In the evening we couldn' t go to the parks because the parks were not allowed for Jews and dogs of course and uh the the population remained of course the population I mean the Jewish population couldn't go around and buy uh uh whatever they would need immediately.
And we were taken to an assembly camp in Berlin  which used to be a Jewish old peoples home.
In the city  you were -- Koven  where I went to school  which is not far from Povorsk  had a population of about 30 000 - 22 to 25 000 were Jewish.
Any other Jew he could kill  he probably couldnt kill Rumkowski  he would he would he would have to answer to to some.

At that point  many Jewish kids were taken out of th at school by their parents and sent to other schools.
But we were also angry  if I may say  in that time when Jewish people were still all right that they were so indifferent.
The Jewish schools in Berlin were just fantastic  when I compare them with the day schools in so -- in -- non-Jewish day schools in Germany.
Its interesting  with all the troubles  Jewish people would still tell jokes.
Again go for charities -- you know  Jewish orga nizations to support?
Now  you have to realize that some of these Jewish people  including her father  mother  when they were deported  they left behind this  lets say.

There were about 50 Sephardic Jewish con -- Jewish people living in Japan in those days  in Kovay.

Now did you go to Israel because you felt that desire to be in the Jewish homeland?
So what they did is they raided these Jewish houses and collected people in the brick factories.

The person using that word  the nonJew using that word  is not associating with something being Jewish  but it's an old  old word that was adopted in the language.
To take a Jewish family into hiding like that was very dangerous for them.
The husband was working as a clean...horse cleaner in the Jewish brewer in Lithuanian  which happened to be a Jewish brewery.

I think what triggered the whole thing is one of my personal friends recently passed away  also a survivor  from Germany  a German Jew.

First time in my life I heard Jewish language over there.
