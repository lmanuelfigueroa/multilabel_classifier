Order of battle is try to get complete records of the organization of the enemy military  so that if you knew that the second Panzer division was coming at you  you knew that the commanding general had to be so and so  and you n you built up records to know the weaknesses and the strengths of the commanders  and things like that.
One Polish army was established in Russia  which the Russian took prisoners  most of the Polish army.
I took the American military train which was an overnight train that ran between Paris and Frankfurt.
So 365 days to the day  like the prisoner scratches the nail on the cement wall of the cell when the calendar -- and my old friend Rabbi Bernstein  Phil Bernstein  was the Executive Secretary of the Chaplaincy Commission of the Jewish Welfare Board  which certified to the Army that this rabbi yes indeed is sane and etcetera and we recommend that you take him and commission him First Lieutenant.

Since he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939  he was subject to the general mobilization.
They were afraid that they would be called into the army and the Germans are right behind them and we heard already that they were catching up with the Polish army and some they are taking as prisoners and some they ar e killing.
I'm having very difficult times  at times I'm very angry at God  and at times I question his existence  and in 1985  with the help of a wonderful Rabbi  Rabbi Elster  who was the Rabbi of Agudas Achim in Alexandria  he was a personal friend  he was a military chaplain in 19 - in the early 1960s  and that's the way we met him  my husband and I  and we've kept up our friendship.
So they asked  oh  these people offere d us a deal  but they di d not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the– Jordan had the best military force  the Arab Legion  54 trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with  with Israelis.
Did those young fighters really believed that they can conquer or defeat the German army  the most -- the mightiest ar -- army in Europe with having some homemade bombs?
In fact  it became a problem to the United States Army before the war ended  because when the camps that were overrun  eventually all of them  knew that they would get better treatment from the United States Army  and  as we progressed  I would see hundreds  literally hundreds  thousands even  Russians walking  displaced persons walking along the street  along the 9 highway that we were driving on to get from one town to another.
Lets say it came to at one point they says  okay  and we we had to go in the field  because the German  the army had always the right of way.

My one removed cousin met me  he was in the Polish army.
The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months  we heard that the whole Chaco is a military area under the...under the government of the military institution  which we also didn't like too much.
And after the few weeks that we had to be there  we were put on a Army boat.
The only German flag under their military establishment  and even that flag was a war flag  not the regular German flag.
And Did you and your the soldiers who were with you  did you discuss this in the following days?
So were waiting and were talking Polish and one of the Polish fellow American  when we ask in Polish Interview with Joseph Koplewicz October 7  1993 53if there are any Jews in the American army  he said to me  Jews?

Were you aware of the scope of what was happening to the Jews in Europe?
Uh I would like to come back to the element of evaluation of the attitude of the Red Army.
And we had a house and -- which the army gave us.
The political officer in a lot of cases has more to say than the army.
Thats why I lived and as the Russians were retreating so did we with the transport we were retreating.
No  we did  a soldier--what do the soldiers now do: we trained; we transport things; we have guard duty  ju st like--and in the military  you know  people think that military's spend their lives fighting  ev en in the America  even in Desert Storm  maybe 10 percent of the people are actually joined the fighting.
Sure there ba -- in an army   but a matter of fact  a incident  I took basic training in fort -- in Fort Dix  and theres -- Im sitting  we having lunch  all -- wa -- something  sitting in the mess hall.
FEDER: But the -- the army  who -- who wa s Clark (ph.)
He lived in Fr ance  he lived in Theonville  and he served with the French army.
So he was in the army at that time and he had furlough  a few days of vacation from the army and he said ﬁif you come to the school I will introduce to you the girl that I am mentioningﬂ. My husband knew me from before.
The army didnt think so either  because they gave us all summer uniforms  and no blankets  no sweaters  and we were just freezing all the time.
And I said I am German  because I hear that so often  you know.
When we got into the city  our home was taken away by the Nazis  so we stayed in a house of a brother of ours  of my oldest brother  Rubin   who at that time was in the Polish army fighting in Warsaw and his wife and a six-month old baby wa s with us.
And the doctor brought us the information only a bout those who he fou -- he found in the camp  we -- at that time we didnt know about those who fought in the army.
We had no way to reach him  so Henry met in Dachau -- a major from the American army.
Because he was in the army  he got tickets to see ﬁOklahoma!ﬂ  which was a play  and nobody could get tickets for anything  except G.I.s  you know  and I was thrilled to go to the theater.
In those days the army consisted of local batt alions  people from the same town  from the same province went together; and  uh  that goes back to the feudal ways  how armies were organized.
And I worked on that particular day out of town  also in the army they had for the ar my  special place to work  where they stayed.
Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13  2015 11 Lets go back to the the na the anti-Semitism that you experienced inside the army.

He was in World War I. He was not a hero or anything  but he had served in the military.
