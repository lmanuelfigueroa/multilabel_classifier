Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 67 Because my father said the car is extremely good quality  and we just check everything  and we need th the Polish army will need this kind of cars.
Now  when he -- they introduced Mr. Dessler to Papa [indecipherable]  Father tr ied to find out more military personnel.
He was a gynecologist  practicing doctor  but also was active politically against the Nazis and when they took over Czechoslovakia  it was time for him to to flee  and he was able to reach England and wh en the war broke out  he volunteered as a doctor for the for the for the military.
They then we had also influx from from Polish refugees  who came especially Polish military people  who interned themselves.
So Dad began with the purpose in front of his eyes  good or bad from one empty army truc k or another finally ending up in the city of Naivadol in Overeisel.
He came another time and I admit  I must admit looking back now  that I was  that my view was based on a regular army officer  who was very conscious  of a Jew being in the regular army  and anything that reflected on one Jew  reflected on all.
4 >> Bill Benson: And  of course  a year or so later in May 1940  eight months after Germany attacked Poland  they invaded what we call the low countries  Belgium  the Netherlands and France.
My father showed his army ID  said he was going to the headquarters there  I dont know about the headquarters  but anyhow to the barracks because this is where he would have had to report to  and when he saw the paper  he called out  ﬁAnybody more literate around here?ﬂ Im sure he was illiterate  a nd couldnt read it.
They're not to be confused with what happened later at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg  which was an international court.
They took me to the army and they ask me what nationalization I am.
And -- and then to arrest some of them for having unauthorized -- I remembered there was a military judge  a military government or an army judge  before whom they were brought and I went with them to this judge  who was a very decent man and I -- I said  ﬁLook  21 your honor  this is ridiculous.
I found out my mother was a captain from the French army.
In in in the years before we left  where we didnt know where the outcome was  there was  you know  they were pe recruiting Jewish young men  but some were sent to the army  some were sent to work camps.
So the Army pushed the Jews back into the camp and 37 closed the gates and padlocked them.
And this service  according to my morality  I can say -- not only morality  but my -- my understanding that my work is not a work that will support German military activity.
We could  but it was not very convenient to meet this armed Lithuanian with a uniform of the old Lithuanian army.
He was a spit and polished army army comma nder uniform.
So in Germany they put us into into the camps I see because we didnt into a DP camp.
My husband continued to work with the children home because there was one or two place where immediately when the Russian army arrived here people was running out and left the children without any help.
The rest of the tanks were throwing out army rations  or camp rations  or sea?
Which the second Polish corps in Italy was fighting you know during the war with the 8th British army and the headquarters were in San Giorgio  Port of San Giorgio in Italy.
When Germans invaded and my mother started having to wear the star  Hans announced that as a German he was playing for them in the army.
I went to work for the German army with to build--in Kovno they had an airport but a small airport but the Lithuanian aviation had only about six or seven planes Video Tape No.
There were lots of things at that point  we could have signed up as a civilian to civil government and all the things that were going on  but I decided my best bet wa s to go home and start looking from from that angle  and if necessary Id come back as a civilian and of course  I intended to get out of the army  which I did in 19 45  and I was separated in in the 14th of December  1945  and signed on as a reserve officer.
I remember the w hole family  that is to say  Elizabeths father  Elizabeths mother  Elizabeth and for a couple of days even I ate the ration USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 8which her father got from th e military.
School is closed  Polish army takes over the school  your home is besieged by German forces --?
Only the Jewish army station in the ghetto  and -- and the main thing was  everything what came about from Kofsky.
Did you see any German soldiers on the street in Germany?
And sure enough  I found my brother  who was a staff captain in the Czechoslovakian army.
The Russians gave us li ke coupons that we're supposed to come everyday and get food from the army.
And no matter how much effort by morning I tried  that the Red Army should take him with the ambulance to the other city.
And he was taken away to a certain military camp which was far away from us.
And then I was sent to Intelligence Training Schools and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of war.
I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so that they would look like military in the shel ves.
And we were also being taught officers strate gy in military tactics at the lowe st possible level.
Because his military friends wanted him to get out and stay in Lithuania  in the states  and forget th e thing.
So she got out of the army  hes now a lieutenant colonel  he was -- his last job was -- he was military attache -- defense attache in Belarus  which is white Russia  or the city of Minsk  where a lot of Jews lived  and still live.
I got on top of the deck  I noticed that the top had been taken off of the luggage  and the troops  not the cream of the crop  as far as the British Army was concerned  there were one eyed and limping  and they helped themselves.
And then I pick up all young people to the army  because I was in the Akar  and for me was convenient go to the army  because they looking for the member of Akar  and send him for Siberia  that I went for the army  but I have a good friends.
Well  as a result though  I had a distorted military career  in which during which I had the two experiences that we we were to talk about.
They were another couple of people  what they were helping them  and they had the army.
And the problem was that I already had received orders to go into the army.
And  and I started sewing  so after a while we heard that Chaim had to go in the army anyway and also Chaim start selling gasoline.
You know  even...even uh anybody in the Polish army  the Russian army  ...I got lots of guts  and no brains maybe  you know.
So I said I'm not going in the army to have a baby.
But because of the fact that there was a army program that permitted soldiers in Europe to visit relatives if they were available  I decided to take advant age of that  and I went  I think to Bad Nauheim   and asked to meet with my brother in Palestine.
And at this time have been made some changes in the army and we get about 15 new officers to my regiment.
And I dont know how long he was in Germany in the army.
Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military authorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we issued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we handed them out at Nooam in the barracks in the stables there  and told them  \ You got a new name.
First you met some soldiers from th e Polish army  tell us about that.
And Hungarian army units  let's say an entire army was assigned to move in to the Soviet Union.
That al-already felt like a liberation and there were more and more German place names now in the official army reports.
I was in military  so I got one week to go before at the end of the school  I got one week for to go to my parents  you know  to my family.
And if I can put my hand on it right away  maybe I wont take the time now  but they wore patches that said Polish Army Displaced Person  Third Army  Number Ten.
In Pruszkow I was since the Po lish uprising and they took us out to the Chleniec  I told you  until the Soviet army came a nd  to Warsaw and then to us.
And there have been a very strict military rules in the in the capital  in Budapest.
Uh I think of Chaplain  the late Chaplain Isaac Kline in and many Jewish chaplains in various Jewish commun...in va rious Jewish communities in France who first brought the returning Jews the necessities of life-food  medical supplies  medical treatment through Army medical officers and the where-with-a ll  the necessities for daily living and then helped reconstruct the communities.
And they sent me to the priest there  I went to the army  and they sent me to the priest  I go back.
Because the Soviet army was very close  their last efforts was to take th ese people.
And then  as I said before  the the Russians didnt want to to arm the Polish military  because it was you know  something that they just dont do.
In fact  I was there during the time when the Germans were being asked by NATO to rearm a nd develop their own Army.
I learned that he was scheduled to take the night American Army military train to Frankfurt.
I mean  I remember always in army  I dont know if I said it  I had to pick up food for my block  and I -- they hit me on my behind.
It gave me no hope  and my wife also the same way  that in the long run uh uh uh there must come a turn  and uh then uh especially when when when the military uh events uh changed the whole situation by the defeat of Rommel in Africa and es pecially after the defeat of Stalingrad.
And suddenly we see a Jeep passing by with a red flag  with the red army.
But  one of the guy from Arizona  his name i -- was Bob Hager  he find out about me in a United States Holocaust -- he saw the movie  and he ca lled me  and he -- over the telephone he introduce himself and he says  ﬁIm the one from the Third Army  I open the gate there  in concentration camp Flossenburg.ﬂ I says  ﬁOh my gosh.
As the workers trials were coming to an end in Nuremberg the -- the U.S. army could give us space  the U.S. army could give us housing because the Nuremberg trials were being [indecipherable] Right.
And the army had something called ASTP -- Army Specialized Training Program  which was to take the brightest people in the army and make engineering officers out of them.
Or was this a -- Well that was so egregious that even the H ungarian army was forced to hold a court martial for the general who ordered it.
That was a very  very strange situation  because all these people around with big ears report immediately -- I even had several occasions when the head of my military house here  a general  went and made a written report to Antonescu about something that I talked about.
Either I was in charge of the big kettle where we cooked for camp  or I wa s preparing hamburgers for the German men in uniform that were in the Air Force  or we used to cook that farina every morning for breakfast for the military.
By 1940 I assume things got uncomfortable for them  so they made their way to the United States and sh e got a job with the army  teaching -- the army taught languages of every possible language.
So as a married person I did not have to go into the army.
One was in the army  my other sister was gone  my deaf brother and I  we were with my parents  and we saw what was left.
It was easy to see German army everywhere in Iasi especially  and many civilians which were doing certain maneuvers.
I said  I survived in the partisans with the Russian army.
And I had...I had a guy that used to be my uh  you know  who was mostly...it's not like the Polish army before the war that was elite.
Because men were very afraid of being conscripted into the Russian army  which was 20 years  they couldn't get out.
I rea lized that uh all my attempts to save myself and my family  or to save my family and myself had been in vain and  therefore  we we had to take whatever  whatever...I can...only had to hope th at uh the military operations would result in a defeat of Germany and that only in the course of that defeat we could hope to be free again  so that means all our...it was my thinking about su rvival was to see that that uh Germany was defeated.
You mentioned they were your husband s friends  they were the officers -- Yes  [indecipherable] officers from the army.
And so I took the matter up with some military figures and they were against it  but eventually we devised a way in which they would not have to take a position in favor of separate camps  and yet allow me to create Jewish camps.
And  during World War I  he was conscripte d to the Czarist Army with a title of Colonel  rank of Colonel because of his prof ession  that being a gastroenterologist in the Army.
But our teachers were army offi cers and they were Jewish.
But th-the military training I had gave me an advantage over those who came from the quartermaster corps  or the cooks and bakers sch ool  and -- or some other branch of the service which was not as military as technical.
So the Army gave me a furlough to go my home town.
It was a special military school  with different well  we get all basic trainings as anybody Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 24else  but we have also additional we they prepare us to be commanders of  like a section.
Youre doing personal -- Its not military -- -- Jewish -- Jewish letters. -- [
I will put you in a unit is -- that it is that Polish inf ﬂ -- it was called information unit  it was like then the military CIC  and intelligence  and he said  ﬁIf you want to take revenge on the Germans  then you will be -- you will have a possibility.ﬂ So I said to him  ﬁBut I already have a order to go to -- to Quibishevo.ﬂ He said  ﬁWhere is the order?ﬂ I showed it him  and he took and ripped it up.
He felt they were taking the army blankets were going to sell them  so he slapped them into jail for black marketers and I would have to fight with him and try to get them out.
At first it was thought to go with the Red Army  and the Russians  with some diplomatic talks  started talking and there by then  the war is really going bad for Russians  because Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8  2013 94Moscow people government  Ru ssian government goes to Kuybyshev because Moscow is Right.
She had a brother by the name Ernst who fought in the army and he was in Russia then.
And he  I think he was [indecipherable] in uniform as a colonel to the Yugoslav army  Titos army and so on and he was on the on the [indecipherable] for awhile.
They were all soldiers that were fed up  so you know they got into camp.
>> Bill Benson: One of your grandfathers served in the First World War.
And my father  because his army experience  was very good at polishing buttons  and things like that.
Interviewer: He went into the army in 1940  and thats your oldest brother?
That was a nice town and we went there as...as normal...normal army men  but working commando.
So the first the first thought had not been to release all of not not allow anybody to leave the territory  but just grou regroup and form a military unit.
This happened right away after  you know... We got wonderful care from the Russian army  from the medics at that time.
From there we were placed at first with the first Army  who was at the beachhead wiping up the remains of pockets -- the remaining pockets of Germans that were left behind.
So he was taking my mother wanted me to go to cadet school  they said  theyll never accept you with this heart problem  because I should never be in the army  they said  with that problem.
And your father  I then take it  was a professional military man.

They were hidden in the woods and hiding in the woods  I should say  and then encountered the Polish national army resistance group who looked upon hiding Jews as bandits and they were  all but one were killed by the Polish resistance group.
And they stop ther e  and right a way the Hungarian Army  right away  they went to greet them  and cater them  a nd did whatever they want even more.
Did you experience any anti-Semitism at all in the U.S. Army?
My official name was then Kutrzeba  which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupatio n. When the time came to register at the Polish DP camp  I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites  I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I. s that I met were just great and friendly people  and I felt that I should revert back to my original na me.
Oh golly  I ca -- I can -- I knew right away he was a French soldier  cause he had a French uniform.
If he then -- End of Tape Two  Side A Beginning Tape Two  Side B -- was an enlisted man after I came into the United States  went into the army  and I wanted to become officer  but I couldnt b ecause one  mostly for educational reason.

And uh we started to talk and all of a su dden we were in the middle of our discussion about uh Stephen and Franz and and and   and so  so uh it it it was...and this established my my friendship with from from that moment on  and uh then again uh we came to the conclusion we should try to meet more regularly and I was advised that I should definitely come back in another two weeks because another uh uh uh delegation is expected  and I came to Belsen and we had a meeting with the first members of th e...especially of the committee in Belsen and also to this meeting came the then uh uh senior Jewish Chaplain of the British Army  Levy   and we were advi sed that a delegation sent by President Truman would come to Belsen and we would sit with them .
And a lot of my coll eagues and a lot of Jewish people usually they started to do everything to avoid to go into the Polish Army.
You know  the unfortunate part was there  that one day five boys  older than I was  they stole some cigarettes or tobacco that was going to the German army  to the front  where they were fighting.

How can I have brought them from as far out as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and Turkestan  moving them westward  all the time westward toward where the American Army was in Germany and in Austria.
And during this war  underground army cannot do mu -- much more.
Let me ask you  why was -- did everybody go into the Lithuanian Army?
He f ought in the Austrian army  as a matter of fact.
And again  I was proud that I co uld serve in the U.S. Army  and even more proud then  to be a citizen.
And he started telling  he he just had to tell that the German Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 171commandant  the German military said the Jews were in the ghetto already.
He was older and two younger men dressed in the dark uniforms of the local Ge rmans who were uh  uh  uh now within the German army  and who before collaborated with the Germans  and basically were traitors before the war.
Well  we as a military family were given the gas masks  because at that time everybody was expecting the day going to to gas  but never happened.
On the...on the way  we found a truck  a military truck that turned back empty and we 13stopped him and he let us in and we stood on the on the in the on the back of the truck and we kept in the middle  Pnina on the on the side and I on the other side of and we kept so and we say  we are free.
In other words  the land army or nationalist army  which they were.
And  um   we scraped those ovens  and we put the ovens on  and um  the fire  and uh  we had to make the s oup  and then we had to make the coffee  and uh  the coffee w-and the food after we did it  we filled a big tremendous pail  uh  there were big army pails.
So  the American Army 22 22wants to put us in over there.
Then I went back to Cairo  where I stayed another one year  in Cairo headquarters of the British army.
Well  it was found by the Army I'm told in a cave  or in caves  and of course we got it from the Army  but when we got it the Army had already sorted it through to a certain extent and we didn't get any of the paintings.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 35 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: uh then was talking to the people use to be--the one of the jobs  the police once.

Everybody who had TB wa s sent to a sanitorium  and the -- the medical staff of  I guess the military  took care of the prisoners.
As you mentioned before  I was drafted during the Korean War.
Did you ever meet any of the boys who had left the army?
He was a refugee from Frankfurt  had returned with the British Army  had participated in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen and he had then become an officer in the control commission  regulating the admission of people to the press  to the movies and so and I met him when I became a witness against one of the movi e directors  but that's another story in Hamburg.
And one of the selected prisoner was a Polish sergeant in the army who was married and he had children  and he was lamenting that hell never will see his children or his wife  and at that moment a man stepped out and said that he would like to take his place  you know  to save him.
Yes  I became a -- I -- as a matter of fact I became a citizen [indecipherable] a short time after I entered the army  which was a little fa -- a little earlier than it would have been if I had not been in the army.
No  well see  but again  military discipline tells you he couldnt have done it on his own because B  he would also have reduced the effi ciency of the anti-tank diggers  by reducing their numbers.
And then there was another group of people  who were mainly single  who had fought in the Soviet army  or who had been in the partisan underground in the valder  they used to say  in the woods.
Its the late 50s now  your husband has decided to make the military a full career.
And he had two sons– three sons  one went to the Austrian Army and later on to the Polish Army  because it was just a change from Po lish liberalization.
I have a good job -- of course I -- my mind is  my son  my oldest son is in the army in Israel and then if I stay in Ja pan with the younger children  having a har -- easy time  Im making good money  a good living.
I mean  the United States didnt have all that many people at that point who were pro sufficiently proficient in English and German  and knew Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 60something about German army  you know  ger you know.
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 5 Well  I suppose its the reasons are very simple  since my father was in the military.
He said   ﬁT his Army isn't like the old Army.
He immediately went to work as an engineer when he got out of the army and wound up in the in the optics field in engineering.
Uh we were liberated by the American Army; and the blacks were separated  segre...segregated.
You know  that they weren't going to be in the army  but they gonna be working.
And I think law school made you aware of that  especi ally in the context of my experience in the military  that the South– th at we had to do– you know  that things would have to change in the South.
The problem was we had to walk right by the military barracks.
And I suppose wa once he started wearing the military uniform  you know  I was quite impressed.
Why did you decided to send you sons to military school?
Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian soldiers got me  or whatever.
And my uncle fought in th e American Army in World War II while he was here.
And th ere came the second time and third time  asked never any questions of military in terest.
Yeah well many of them came at an age here to America and then enlisted in the army.
And they went and they were helping the Germans  and they were soldiers.
Its not You cant go there and join the army that fights the military.
And I remembert we went and came to our hometown and we walked into the barracks  the military barracks which was situated behind a home acr oss the street from our house.
By the time I finally got these tags and came b ack  a big trailer truck  U.S. army trailer truck had arrived.
However  the German...being this people  full of life because the hy...hygienic conditions were worse in the German army of that part than it was in the ghetto.
On the other hand it was so close to Warsaw that all the people may have been moved to Warsaw.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 In addition to defining who is a Jew  they also de cided that people  veterans of World War I who were decorated with the Iron Cross would not be gassed  they would be removed from society.
And he was in...he was in the...in the army and lost his foot.
And the only way we will do that is if -- hopefully the next generation there will be conscientious people that feel the same kind of mind and eventually come to a time where people will say we are not going to have an army  we are not going to have arms  there have to be other ways of settling our differences.
So  are you doing this work at the same time that Mario went into the army?
When you were in the army   I think you had mentioned some -- you dont like to see food wasted -- Oh yeah. --
And she and she got in in involved with the PX  with the American military  you know  we used to have a PX?
It was taken away by France in 1870  had been given back to France after the First World War and was taken again when the German Army occupied France.
And I remember that in a Purim night  Jews from Bolgrad used to go to this regiment and ask the commander to allow the Jewish boys in the Army to come to this Je wish houses to celebrate the festi... the...the festivity of...the festival of Purim.
How long did you stay in that shelter and how did either the army or some other organization help you to settle into a more livable situation.
And it was just -- My father passed away at a young age  63  I believe  64  depending on how one computes  because they all had two different day -- birth dates  you know  different years  because like his father didnt want him to go to the military  compulsory draft  at a very young age  so he didnt register him when he was born  he registered a year or two later.
I never know just how the system works in in the army  because I never wa s in the army.
I couldnt get out of Czechoslovakia because of that military age.
By that time I applied and join ed the Polish forces which were assisting 17 the American army and occupation.
Did this anti-Semitism that you experienced -- you said this was in the -- in the military?
And in Modena they gave us where it was a military academy before  they gave us that academy to make houses.
Now  I was talking about the army -- I was asking you how you came to go to Feldifing in August of 1945.
Took two weeks about when I was picked up by the United States Army.
And the army was actually under the Communist authority  you know  they were satellites.
Because actually Prague  and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia   the American army was actually on the outskirts of Prague   and the Russian didnt let them farther to go  and the Russians were far away  because they said it was agreement between Russia and the United States.
So he saved my fa ther  and this woman  young doctor  it was another seven months when army came back.
This I only find out later  but anyway  the camp was full of all kinds of nationalities  there were at that time when we arrived there  maybe 5500  there 44 were Russian POW's  Soviet Red Army POW's  there were Polish civilians  Russian civilians  there were Frenchmen.
And the German lieutenant  talked to my mother and she pretended that she was a German -descended person.
But of course  Normandy is also -- has a lot of clay  so when it rained the metal would sink and our planes would flop over  but we always had enough trucks and [indecipherable] and so on  that that wasnt -- anyway  we were -- we -- I was from -- from [ind ecipherable] three onward with -- with the -- with the whole invasi on of Normandy  and we -- we had some experiences  but thats -- I am n -- I am not -- and I dont belong to the wa r veterans  who are busy talking about their -- their army exploits.
Hitler and his army invaded Poland and uh there was far from the uh battle  about...uh because from west Poland to where I I'm in the south...Tarnow is in the south  middle of Poland  in the south Poland...about uh about over two hundred kilometer kilometer from uh German border over...so in uh almost two weeks we see the German airplane uh go around  even shooting uh people from airplane on the on the field  all over uh on the town  but there was no much bombing uh in the Tarnow or Krackow .
And we did that  and I remember that the German army was in disarray.
This picture here was taken at approximately in June of 1945  where in my story I told us that we had in the military academy of Modena where we were stationed  it was about 7 000 refugees which 5 000 of them were ex-inmates from Mauthausen  who were brought in in one day on trucks.
So I went for another physical  and I was accepted (laughter) in the army to send to Korea. (
We had heard that the American Army -- they are at the border.
It was a very very frightening experience  but of course none of the Jews had any repence or probably even if they did have any they couldn't have fought off the German army  so we had to be obedient and do whatever we were told and survival depended on our obedience we felt at that point.
We were much aware  the the high school paper  ﬁ The Echoesﬂ began having items more and more of clas smates we had  or students who were now in the service  in the military  back and forth.
Pret ty soon  we heard some voices knocking  some sound knocking at the door of the farmers house and later we learned that Abraham  his little girl and his wife  at th e last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the village  were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at.
Immediately all the ghetto was surrounded by machine  you know  from the Gestapo and military and police and whatever you say.
At night...the same night after they shipped him  some were caught at the...the Russian army caught the trains and busted the trains up and let the prisoners out.
The American Army  for one  would come in and destroy everything they could  and the inmates themelve s tore everything apart.
My my grandmother like I says  my mothers family and her brothers were soldiers.
I understood a little bit  but later on I-I knew -- I knew German very well.
The other chap was a friend of Bills  and his name was Vasili something or other  and he was in the British army.
They would take it on the army truck  and bring out more from the from the courthouse.
CE: Su-Sure -- well I didnt feel like -- I went through a war  I was a soldier in the Polish war -- in the Polish army.
In the German Army  the S S were the elite division  an armored SS division in the south of France.
Later  later  after the war I discover [indecipherable] you dont know why  because the the the army intelligence wanted to know who these people really are.
They had no power over Jews  except they could detain them until military police came by and got them.
And they make like a Polish army who was trained in Russia and probably German army who was  and the Romanian army.
And then we pi cked out one -- a native Krakowian  who survived the war in -- in th -- in the Russia  and later he joined the Polish army  and he came back with the Polish army  and so he -- wi -- and because he was a native Krakowian  and so he was very important  and then we -- they invi -- they picked out the other men with us  so three of us  we got th e order to go in to see how we can find out where the people who -- who built those things are  maybe we can prevent from the destruction.
A lot of military uniforms weve seen in the streets everywhere  that they were occupying the best place to  lets say  live and be treated.
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 111 And so it could be that that many form er gulag prisoners were in that army.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 24 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Okay.
So it was German and Ukrainian at the time in Slovakia.
It was terrible  because Swoboda did not go with -- with -- with the communists  he didnt do anything to help them  and the army didnt want to go.
The police was in force and the Danish Army was...although they were there  they had not much to say or to do  but they were all...life was continuing the way it was.
Now that soldbuch soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there.
After liberation I was assigned back  you know  we were liberated.
And every Friday night they would take me in thei r army vehicle a nd take me to the where we had a Jewish service.
Yeah  later on a few of us moved to a boarding house  you know  English boarding house  about four of us  and then d ecided  you know  decided to join the army  volunteer in the army.
So that meant that we were liberated  came more Russian soldiers.
Am I the staff  or the guy in the Red Army?
In the second World War  it was the place where the American army deposited its World War II records  temporarily at least.
I stayed in Europe until March 1946  so I was in the army exactly three years.
It's  there are so many things that are unusual coincidences in my life  that some  that was in 1924  and I interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army  Ky -kle   in 1945.
We got the dog when he was in the army with the army in Przemy l. They went for some maneuvers to some residential prin a [indecipherable] or something.
What  what prompted you to go work in a German military hospital?
So some of them afte r had been incorporated into the German army  and were then taken prisoners--escaped from the prison camps  maybe  and joined the FTPF.
A car came in  a convertible car came in - in -- into the -- this military bakery was in a -- in a fortress that was built by Napoleon.
Then they took the other guys that were in my outfit and they put them in the regular army  those who volunteered.
He was a very nice fellow  who became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army  and then I found out later on  when I met him after the war  in Prague  how terrible all these officer were treated.
Because it was a lot of Jewish people which -- it was Jewish religion  but they didnt feel th -- the -- nobody pay attention  you know  because in Polish army was a lot of [indecipherable] J-J-Je -- Jewish people  you know  y -- I have a friend here  who the doctor was a -- a ve-very high officer in the Polish army [indecipherable] two years ago he passed away  you know  he was a Jewish  and he was officer  he was a doctor in Polish army  what was many -- many USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 14people  many officer was in the Jewish arm -- the Jewish people was in the -- in the Polish army.
This is the American Army that kind of took y ou under its wing?
And we had -- we worked for German people  and not the army  just German people.
Then we were walking and there was a huge tall beautiful man in army uniforms.
I came back  when I was released from the army we didn't have any money and France was in very shape.
Be being going in as a private recruit in the army  no college education  working up to a field grade officer  which a major is  he can be proud of himself  and I am proud of him.
But here is an very important thing  becaus e I had the supports of the two main parties  the main ones  of course the other two also  but the strongest support of was the army.
This is me in an army uniform in 1946 in Auto-ensign   Germany.
So the w ithin the army  I did not experience any anti-foreignism  or anti-Semitism.
Because there are only so many army trucks or whatnot  and they had all -- also requisitioned our car.
What was your reaction when you saw your first German soldier?
So  on the way  to figure out that were going overseas  from Hampton Roads   Virginia  they find out Im not a citi zen  the army.
05:21:02 And the Army  at that level  has absolutely no grasp  no empathy  no understanding of this.
And then with the war coming along uh  I decided that rather than be drafted I would uh  join the Army.
If I would do something wrong  probably he would try to save me  but to go...missions had nothing to do with him because he was not a military leader.
I was a member and my father made boots for the army.
I was in the Russian army  it was September 1955  I think.
I could I I the change that took place on his face  his whole attitude  he he totally panicked  because this he had told me before that  take good care of this typewriter  that this germ you know  the German police is looking military police is looking for that type.
Then I remember too  there is someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War?
Note that the complete furnishings are the folding army cot  which did 136 have a straw mattress on it  and th en a rather shaky chair  and table  and a washstand.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >> Bill Benson: You found out later at the time.
Soon as the war was over -- and we lived in Karlovy Vary  my brother-in-law was a [indecipherable] of -- in the Czechoslovakia legion in the Czech army at the time.
He could have been in one of those camps that released Polish officers to join Anders Army.
And they needed me there because they had a lot of German prisoners  and I had to work as an interrogat -- as a interpreter and I had to go around with nurses and doctors  had to make the rounds when they saw the patients.
By the following year  Dan and Dora came to Washington  DC and Dan embarked on a career as a researcher in the medicinal chemistry at the Walter Reed Army Research Institute with his work culminating in his expertise in the development of medicines against malaria.
I was fifteen  and so  that was  I had a little uniform and a gray overall with a  kind of a military cap.
Jews  and political offi cers of the army if they could find them.
Im going to help you.ﬂ And  with the he lp of this person  she was able to write to the United States because again  ever ything had to go through military mail  and through them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then by telephone to my mother because the Wa rburgs  the Joint Distribution Committee and the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called childrens home in the Warburg estate  were able to connect once a week.
For that reason  we were discharged from uniform military  but had to stay for the duration of ma -- our military obligation in that village  under paramilitary rules.
And at that point you joined up with the Polish army?
Two days later we were liberated  and um  I think it was a Russian general that came in.
And there was no friction between the Germans and the Jews until I think in 1930  when Hitler came to power  he started to demand of the leaders of that German Nationals -- of those German Nationals  to start to agitate  and complain about oppression by the Czechoslovakian government  and it -- and demand to be annexed by the Nazis.
Now  if you stop high school after two years  which is the 10th grade and you transfer to a Seminare and you finish the two years of high school in the Seminare plus two years in the same Seminare tea -- becoming a teacher  then you are not -- your education is not interrupted and you dont go to the army.
Which army was on the ot her side of the Vistula?
We were very close  and then I got from the military mission in Hungary who was General Key  K - E - Y  called me in  send out somebody and find out if you are alive.
And when Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 62 the war was over  the French came in.
And they were sort of looking around  and there were some German army personnel with them and it seemed like they were looking for something  so I went to them  and I said  \ Could I help you?\
He got four brothers in the Russian army  so he thought maybe somebody  because those really -- a transport with the people came  but none of them survived.
When the Hungarians came back which my father...was a Hungarian soldier in the ... Hungarian army.
Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor  Army motor motor vehicle accident and since there was no American Army Je wish chaplain at the time  the uh rabbi in Belfast  Rabbi   was asked whether he would officiate at the funera l service  the burial service for this Jewish soldier.
He went to the German authorities and said : I got to have a new headquarters .
When they have to take in one area to use so much military to do a big job like that  the front line is .
So right  that was a huge camp that was the central camp in Poland where they sent out the work parties to Auschwitz and various other places. [
There might have been  and I don't remember  there might have been some other American troops there and I think there were  b- from our battalion headquarters  the ninth armored infantry battalion headquarters  who got the message and they came  some of them came up there.
And he went back to Germany then as part of the U.S. military?
And I told him that that's his duty  to join the Army.
>> Albert Garih: When the German Army de feated the French Army in June 1940  and they started marching -- they marched into Paris  actually.
Both by Russian m ilitary  because they didnt want peace  and American military  because they send U-2 .
So I showed him the documents  firstly  these were given to me by the KGB when I was released from my platoon to go back.
Was he in the Russian Army or was he in the German Army?
They would charge him  in the Treaty of Versailles  of \ crimes against the dictates of human conscience \  which had been referred to 14 The International Military Tribunal.
So...uh...I have to say  here was...here was...uh...the legacy to the government of the British Army  you know.
When he got there  he heard on the radio where the German army is advancing and the French government did something also not very smart.
One day I had to go to 3rd Army Headquarters in .
He tr ied to speak to the military commandant of Kovno who he knew.
And I looked at him  I said  well– And he sa ys yes  I Im sorry that I have to ask that  but that that is the rule  and I realize you ar e in the military.
So we quickly disappeared from the  from this ap artment  didn't pressure them or anything and it so happened that the Czech army pa ssed by Czernowitz at that time.
The ar my  of course  was responsible; the Am erican army for th e American zone  15 the British army for the British zone  et cetera.
And thats when I decided enough was enough  this was stupid  the army didnt know what it was doing  and I I was fluent in French and German  I wasnt doing anybody any good in the South Pacific as as a radio operator in a heavy artillery outfit.
He was an officer in the Hungarian army  a gentile person.
I decided to f -- retire from the army  go into the reserves  and -- which I did  and then -- then working USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 170 for -- in federal civil service for another 20 years.
In fact  one of the questions that I was asked by the examiner and I was in U.S. Army uniform  I was a corporal at the time and this examiner  one of the questions asked  if I were called to se rve in the U.S. military in time of war  would I do that?
So the procedure took really a very  very long time  and then...uh...while this was going on  one of my mother's brothers who had been living in the United States..un..since right before he war  he was also in the Army  and..uh..the Red Cross was able to..uh..find him and he made contact with this Jack and..uh..they found out that I had a father living in the United States and Jack said to me that he couldn't adopt me and that was...that was terrible.
But the same time wa -- working -- was alalways belong to the underground army  until I was trained like a miner  and my specialist was the blowing the train.
No  they were just like barracks  except low rooms with two beds in them  that was it.
And we set up shop there and did a lot of work for th e invasion of southern France with the seventh army  and also worked for General Mark Clark in -- in Italy.
1940  he has been called to the army  but the army -- I have the picture -- I have the picture for you.
As I started to tell you  with my long coat  we were wearing army coats  which they were long coats at that time.
Now  in the army  what sorts of responsib ilities did you have?
We didnt know where we were going  but we stopped in so many stations   I know  because this was not a priority train  the army has to go through first  so there was -- they let everybody else go  but we stopped in so many stations  and in unison  I remember we were screaming  wasser  wasser  wasser   and the Germans know what wasser means  because in their -- German language I think its the same.
Well  this is six months later or whatever  the Red Army did come in.
It was not an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be Russians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army officers who were Jewish.
And I when I went into the Army in 1944  I was trained for the infantry  went to Europe  fought in the infantry  the whole German campaign.
And I got friends from military not far away  who had this source of information.
By chance  being a movie opera tor  I didnt have to go to the army.
They were surrounding them and of course  the Polish Army had some fierce resistance.
And we were -- the roads have to be clear for the army to be moved.
Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war?
And then one day I think it was a Sergeant of the Professional Dutch Army came in Uhhuh.
No  he was -- I knew he was a good man  and I kne w he was in -- in the -- in a military group  he had started it in Notodden.
He had the right  as part of the British Army  to go to England after the war.
And that was still when you were in the Soviet Union ?
Now  the reason I am mentioning this because my fathers sister who was very young and married to a young man  in terestingly  when he was taken to the front  for some reason  somebody made a mistak e and his unit was issued Hungarian army uniforms.
As a matter of fact  the day that I was married  there wa s a boy that had family from Belgium and they sent some body  they should bring him to Belgium and he said that he wanted to take her to Belgium. [
Th-then Zatlersort   where I was working  this had a chance because it was for military rucksacks  it had a chance to continue as a group working together.
Soldiers were coming back from the fronts in trucks full with soldiers .
The French Forces of the Interior had a command  and that  as I said  came out of London  and they had their military or para-military commanders here and there.
For military purposes.ﬂ \ Oh  that doesn't bother us \  they said  \ because we have no such question.ﬂ So I got in Germany permission to radicate.
Now  for instance  like that army there  that was some place  too  yeah.
Were there a lot of other Jewish -- very many other Jewish soldiers  and did you stay together?
Bu t when I was 14  the people where I lived  you know  the younger people all had to go in the army.
And th-those come those communist youth people  they they got rifles  they were had weapons  and they were f-fleeing together with the red army  retreating.
He could not where he was because it was a military operation.
Lab -sig was expected to fall soon  along with Nuremberg where the 45 th Division \  that was my Division  \ of Lieutenant General Alexander 7 th Army was fighting through the heart of the city after a surprise assault from the Northeast.
But the Eisenhower visit did  because it was right after the Eisenhower visit that this -- oh  what was his name -- this colonel -- this Texas fighting officer came in and said -- to my office and said  ﬁMy career is in the army  I -- Ive fought valiantly in -- in the war and now my reputation is being jeopardized by this criticism of these conditions in my area -- in my area.
See  it's not my combat experience where I question Army orders or anything  I feel proud to 30 slaughter (Yiddish) 31 They are killing Jews in Wolfratshausen (Yiddish) 30 have been a combat soldier.
That they supplied the uni--the German army uniforms for the partisans.
So  everybody was really happy that Vilnius is returning to Lithuania  Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 77and everybody was concerned that the Soviet army is being introduced in Lithuania and having bases here.
But they knew that they shot us  because they didnt consider us army  they considered us bandits.
And so what happened was that they put us on the train and it was a regular train  but we were escorted by soldiers.
So  from the tsars army  after World War I ends  thats when Lithuania starts fighting for independence?
In the meantime  the older son is working in a very high  secret Israel Army factory.
So that was one thing and then Im every kibbutz had to send some people into the army at that time because there was a  they called it the Palestinian army.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 33 By that time I had done a lot of things.
We looked like the army  later on the patrolling airplane told us they didnt know what the hell was going.
We had not been admitted to the German army  but we were mobilized like everybody else and had to present ourself in a separate little office and these soldiers were very nice about it and -- but of course  we  we were not mobilized.
There are Polish military schools  but I am too small for those.
My name is Richard R. Seibel retired Colonel in the United States Army.
They sang their Nazi army songs and they marched through the streets and then  of course  we encountered individuals...Germans marching walking on the streets.
And the next truck I will see  the next military truck I will simply jump in the middle and he could run me over and this is it.
So  he says  since you dont know English  he spoke to me Yiddish  I have there in the hospital there it wasnt a hospital  just sol you know  with a couple doctors for the army  army doctors.
And the middle one was Sophie and the youngest one  well she was the youngest  Anita.
>> When you came to the United States  how or where were you -- what was actually going on in Germany or in your own town?
So  in a quiet  buzzing way  we heard that the German army took over Czechoslovakia   Romania   other parts of Hungary   Poland   France   all the eastern European countries.
I we were we were stationed in Linz   in western Austria  and I was I I had attached myself to the to the intelligence section of the army.
It was far away  deep into the Soviet Union  and -- and there was a -- a -- a sense of triumph in the Romanian community and clearly they were -- there were a lot of things being stolen from Russia and coming in  it was known there is a -- trains of items were brought a nd officers came with cars loaded  military cars with their own build -- I mean  their items stolen and -- so somehow the concern with the Jews decreased a bit  and we felt that.
Wilhelm Gerke was a short SS man who knew exactly that once the ghetto are being liqui- dated that the Germans in charge of the ghettoes were being sent to the front to fight the Russian army  and having good connections in Berlin he got a new assign- ment and changed the name from ghetto to concentration camp.
My father knew very influential persons  in the military  in politics.
Going to Germany two  three -- I went to Berlin in fir -- first time in 56  you know  and -- and the question was not the old Germany  it was the east Germany  you know  a-and the west Germany  what we do to rebuild them  and th -- the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the acceptance of a occupation policy  who was not very wi -- wi -- all the aspect of which are not -- we cannot be very proud  because we use  you know  th-the-the police  we use -- etcetera  you -- i-is simply bring back of what the contemporary situation with Iraq  where we did not want to use the army in the [indecipherable] of Saddam.
He joined a fascist Belgian group and eventually joined the German army along with 25 000 -- approximately 25 000 other Belgian young men.
My father was drafted first t-to the ar to the labor army  labor camp  to to labor work.
But they werent overly concer ned that the Germans had invaded Poland?
And the Germans didnt use them on the-- to fight on the front  but they used the all divisions  you know -- you know is a evosovla -- all army maybe  I dont know it -- maybe -- maybe two  three division.
Also  Auschwitz was on a Polish territory and originally Auschwitz was built to accommodate Polish political prisoners.
I just wanted to know where did you go from Germany?
And I came out of the army  I-I stayed in the United States because my parents lived here  and th and thats the story  yeah.
And what they did is what they what they did is they instituted a they built a bridge from the large ghetto to the small ghetto  which was also surrounded with wires  and that was always under military supervision.
When a when I was in the army  I didnt want to go to Korea   and it just so happens that I knew a few people in personnel at Fort Benning  Georgia   and I mentioned to them if they ever have a levy for somebody with my MOS  which is a pharmacists MOS  I would be very happy to go to Germany   yeah  I just did not want to go to Korea.
Of course  I took lot of abuse  again in the army  because of th e number.
So the Polish army came over there with their tanks and with their trucks  was already in town.
But theyre going to induct you.ﬂ I said  ﬁWhy do you do that when Im a sick person?ﬂ ﬁWell  if you are sick  you re going to be released from the army and thats all going to be.ﬂ So thats what happened.
When we found ourselves on the road with all the evacuees of every stripe and of every possible persuasion  because you had the Jewish prisoners of war - Jewish - you know  prisoners from the concentration camps  and you had Polish laborers who worked on the farm  and you had German military and German out of uniform  and German civilians with dogs and cars and whatev er - we had to carry their stuff.
They thought that we really some important people from the Home Army  which we're not.
And the ghetto was guarded on the outside by the Latvian military guards.
So it didnt apply to everybody but I would say to some that it was that Dachau was not  except for those of us who saw it  was not the main When you meet survivors  do you automatically tell them that you were in the army and you were Well yeah Im not pushing it at them but if they ask and so on  yeah.
Did the army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these people.
But in any case  in the event of a raid in a camp  the United Nations had to receive prior notice from the military.
And of course the f -- the farther -- th-the longer those -- the war lasted  the more conspicuous were a young man of military age who were not in uniform .
I was a military man  but still directly to shoot in a fight it's different.
and youre discharged from the army  and you look for a job  you said?
I adapt myself to the problems  even when the war started right away and we ran and...uh...we tried to escape  went...went with the Russian army.
Well  uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall  the 11 Chief of Staff  several days before this a commun ication telling him that the report of Dean Earl G. Harrison was very critical of the American Army in Germany but on the 10th of August  the day after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi Weiss  he received a cable from Secretary of War Stimpson telling him that the report of Dean Ha rrison severely condemned the American Army  that something had to be done.
So the American army had to pull back  move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska Budavitsa and then they stayed.
The young men who received military service in Germany escaped illegally across the boundary and went to Lichenstein.
I didn't know they were all going south to avoid the German Army.
My father studied law in Germany  and he was just a young lawyer when he was drafted into the army.
Actually my uncle  my father's brother  younger brother  died on the Russian front as a member of Slovak Army.
The air drops  also money from banks  and from -- funds from the army left over  etcetera.
The first problem we had was when we stopped in Stuttgart at a military mess to get lunch.
There was some military that they tried to fight  the Germans.
They didn't want to get killed  b ecause they were afraid  in case the ŠŠ because the Polish army  they had underground.
What happens after the Po lish army division pulls back from th e battle of Berlin?
But they had no political or military power to assist the Danish  the German occupation forces.
And You you had mentioned that earlier  so if you can expand a little bit about coming into Germany wearing an American army uniform.
So I was taken to the o -- to the office  and this is not part of the military duty  of going through the military training  with all the [indecipherable] all the exercise  and so on  but in -- in spare time  day time  lunch time  evening  you do the -- the office work.
But -- so  we came back to Heidelberg  and we -- we live in government housing  and I got changed to another city in Germany  and became the liaison officer to the German CIA  for the army  and there -- Im going to speak about some other interesting things.
He was a very interesting guy  spoke English fluently  had married an American girl whom he had met when he was attendin -- attending our army war college in 1928  and he -- he was a very 64 helpful individual.
He said listen and you go back to the town  the first thing you got to do register with the military.
And he was  I'm sorry to say  in the Austrian Army during World War I. And my parents were married in 1927.
We have involved with the Russian Army and then  of course  the Germans were bombing the streets and we were going through the hole.
I said  you show me in all the mankind history  if a person if a army [indecipherable] is in defense  there is no uprising  they dont.
They take only this families which they have somebody in the army of General Anders .
You know - the Germans started the war with the Russians - 1941  June twenty-second.
They must have been given food by the American army of occupation.
But they took them over to the place where we dug those trenches that they supposedly told us were for the military tanks to be falling in.
Were there still Germans and then ba by that I mean soldiers  inside the camp  or not?
They also used to bring boxes from the military for wood for kindling lighting.
The military would come pouncing down on them because the military declared its intention to protect the German economy or to rebuild the German economy  and these black market operations were  they felt  destructive of the economy.
So I don't know if the Germans came back to pick them up  but anyway they were away.
Again  the Jews of Budapest were lucky in a sense that the Germans were so busy to round up first Jews in the countryside  that by the time they came to Budapest  it was October  November   the Soviet Red Army were ordered into the outskirts of Budapest.
So then we I never got to Paris  oh even though it was only a few miles from there  went into Belgium Were you part of a particular division  a unit  or or larger military presence?
I want to find out about your life growing up  before you joined the army  and then well go into all of these experiences  that are the core of the story.
Tell us about your liberation and what happened to you once you were liberated by the Soviets.
I remember the beginning of the war we saw German soldiers from the regular Army.
It turned out he became a messenger in the ghetto and it was good to have any position  I mean as long as you had a position  any position was better than no position at all  so he was important  they could send him here and there and he didn't have to dig those air raid ditches and he didn't have to be around on the street and being beaten and all kinds of things  so he came to me to get my Leventer cap  02:58 the army cap because they were collecting them  so Jews should not have military caps and there should be no way for them to melt into outside and pretend to be non-Jews and trying to get away.
They were the priority number one almost like the army trains at that particular time.
And in 3rd Army...there was a 12th Army Corps group headquarters  in Wiesbaden I think  they wa nted me to come and work with them  I remember that; I got a letter from the General as king me if I wanted to be transferred to his headquarters -- it may have been Colonel Denson 9 who dealt with that  and I said  \ Listen: I don't want to do his work any more than I want to do yours  I want to get out of the Army  that's all I want.
He had this document from still the Reichsbank  and that he had was going to Holland to bid on some very important mate rials which were needed for the the war effort in Germany or for the military  and they couldnt keep us incarcerated because he had to get on with this business.
Alex's nearly 21-year old grandson Tomer was drafted into the Israeli military at the end of 2012 making him the third consecutive generation in the family to serve in the military.
He walks out  and I bend down to b -- said  ﬁDeutsch  if you press charges  you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 27 going to die.ﬂ I said  ﬁNot only this  as long as Im in this army  you going to be with me.ﬂ He says  ﬁI going to get out of the ar my before you.ﬂ I said  ﬁNever going to happen.ﬂ Sure enough  Deutsch  every morning after you -- with the band -- they took off [indecipherable] with the red -- red face.
And I wa I got my diploma  and and Im in the army.
I was only one and a year year...one and a half years old when he left us to serve in France and in Russia with the German army.
Well  you go to the Polish consulate and you sa y you want to volunteer for the army  and -- and they say well  thank you  and we will call upon you and you will have a medical examination -- Right. --
You know  as I've gotten older  the greatest surprise that I think as I've thought over this thing  and particularly the way the information policy of the Army is now  is that literally no one read my script before it went on the air.
But anyway  so when -- whenever it was  six  seven years ago  when Croatians declared themselves independent  first it wa s Slovenia  and the Yugoslav army tried to put down the insurrection  if you will.
You will laugh  but I sort of remember when we celebrated a Jewish holiday.
His experience of the First World War was that he saw the German Army occupying the surrounding countries very quickly.
He says  ﬁBut you left Poland in 1919  that was when -- or 18 -- when you became aus -- it was Austrian before that  so youre not actually Polis h ﬂ he says  ﬁI cant give you a passport  except [indecipherable] exception  your son is -- the oldest one is 19 years old?ﬂ No  17 or eight -- ﬁ18 years old  and if he joins the Polish army  I will give him a pa ssport.ﬂ He said  ﬁThank you very much.ﬂ [indecipherable] We left.
So  instead of being sent to a field  to a division  I ended up at a military hospital in Camp Rucker  Alabama   as a clerk.
The troops ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 were there.
It was apparently a barracks at one time  well whatever  but there we were.
Then the next morning  they brought me into that Russian officer.
I have beautiful pictures from the three brothers what they were taken to the army.

Two of your older brothers  if Im not mistaken  were in the Polish army.
The whole brigade  it all  of the whole army was General [indecipherable] All right.
Here is somebody who was a -- let s say a comrade of your fathers from the officer corps of the Lithuanian independent army  who survives  lets say  a Soviet purge.

Not as much as I thought  cause Id been in touch with Americans all along  and Id been in the army long enough to realize that what I miss were all the little things that you forget about.
Okay  before So I was in the military when the war break out.
First of all  forgeries of military papers were very rare and hard to get in the first place  and then it was only valid for six months; then it had to be revalidated.
And I traveled back to school throughout the whole night because the railroads were bombed  and I had to change two or three trains  and I slept while waiting for the next train  I just slept on the bench and the station master knew me  and the gave me some blankets  army blankets to cover myself up because it was cold.
Now  this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army  why did you have to bring her into your offices when very few people were there?
And actually  they paid me very well  and that was the amount of money I took along with me to the...to the Czech army and I was never...uh...I had enough money to...to help myself if I needed.
Rabbi Max Braude  who had been a chaplain in the military  did some work with DPs.
Polish citizens were drafted in the Russian army  and they escaped.
We thought all along that maybe once the army becomes near  we would sort of be discharged.
But I know that this couldnt last  so after a few days -- now  it -- you gotta remember  I lived for five years with my uncle who was an officer in the French army  high ranking officer  and I used to hang out with all his cronies all the time  you know  the colonels and the majors and their wives  and all the -- because they used to take me over for tea.
So I don't know if my parents before that  if they were worried  but I know that my parents would listen to the radio and hear calls from Britain to ask for volunteers to join the British Army to fight against Germany.
And he said  I made arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river  the Russian Army was a little bit more organized.
Built in in imperial time  and and it was the we were prepared to support the the the attack of this British armored division on Wilhelmshaven   which already surrounded by the Polish army.
What was... [BB] I was in the Army  up at Catterick. [
Really  there were quite a lot of boats going o -- further up at the coast  the big fish er boats  they could take 50 at every trip over  and that was -- but our boat had b een there before  because that -- that [indecipherable] used to -- since the 29th of August  where we shipped soldiers  Danish officers  because thats -- they started -- Danish military battalion -- no  thats regiment  I joined that  later on  after coming to Sweden.
This is the one who was became a prisoner of war in Russia .
Well  this one brother who was in the Polish army  was Zachary   I heard -- one of my cousins  the one that helped me the bleeding in the camp  she survived  Ida.
So I guess Im a fugitive from from from military justice.
I did not go -- I'm supposed to go to the Army at that time  my father says to me  you don't have to go  let's go together because we don't know what happened.
What was it like now that you got Russian troops in control?

Along comes this army truck that is going back -- was retreating  and they pick us up.
Eisen -- Pattons army was the famous third army and they -- their headquarters were just outside of Berlin and they had -- th-th-they were in charge of -- of these areas where these camps were and f -- I went over to this guy  Major Fisher  in Pattons headquarters  who was presumably in charge of this sort of thing and I said  ﬁLook  cant you do something to relieve the overcrowding in Feldifing?
And the third time  my uncle  who had come in 1939 from Germany  sa id he was his guardian  which he was not  and signed the papers that it would be alright for him to join the army.
In the meantime  we saw this truck in a ditch  in the field.
So thats the Russians kind of influence  a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before  and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis  or Germans  and Germans beating up their comp atriots  or so  and with full vigor  I mean  just reversed direction.
Uh the uh field hospital that had been stationed by the Amer ican Army in Dachau to help save as many lives as possible of the survivors  moved on.
As you mentioned before  I was drafted during the Korean War.
An officer in the United States army  youre not supposed to commit adultery.
We were allowed to read army records of what was happening  and thats when we really got to know what was happening in Germany.
She said  \ This is the command...the command of the German Army.\
Theres the German army  and then tell me  who are these police battalions  and who do they work for?
So thats where they send me  and I was inducted into the Polish army there.
And all the Poles were kept  because they were pretty sure  they just didnt know who  that there were spies being infiltrated into the U.S. army in Europe.
And the war crimes program of 7th Army was folded over into what they called the War Crimes Group  whose headquarters was at Dachau.
And I had made another friend  who in fact saved me in the end  who was the head of intelligence  military intelligen ce  in Tours  which was the neares t city.
Then he was re-drafted in the army because before the war he was an army chaplain  yeah  he was a mobile Benedictine.
And when the Polish army receded  drew ba -- withdrew while the Germans came in  there was -- weaponry was left?
But in a few months they -- they drafted him and Interview with Michael Lin February 27  2000 41he joined the army.
That was a really stupid move on the part of the French army.
You see  because we didnt fight with -- for Gods sake  we didnt fight 74 with the Soviet Union  we fought with German  but all the time  in history of the second World War  sorry  Soviet army was our enemy from the 17 of September  1939.
it says that by the time the Soviet army got to Berlin  there were no German soldiers any more  there were only 14 year old boys that Hitler then inducted in the army.
That made a very -- not a hateful feeling and yet  you know  in between there that  yes  these are mothers that are -- they may not have had anyt hing to do with this mess here  you know  of Hitler and his...but that What did you know about Adolph Hitler  because I'm trying to get a sense of how much people knew in the United States  how much the guys in the Army knew?
I went back to West Point to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty-two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty-five  at which time I was ordered to join the headquarters of the United States Army  3rd United States Army.
I...I felt very  very proud of those fighters that went up  19 and I am not a military person.
Real life doesn't start in the military  but I spent two years.
And all of those people there that army  they're taken to camps.
So when you talk about Dachau  do you mean the town of Dachau or do you mean The camp. --
I mean  it was the -- it was handed down from soldier to soldier and from ev -- and we really di -- we spared the -- the old German army  the Wehrmacht  the old army  the Germans  th-they knew they were captured  they were a prisoner and that was it.
Instead of going to the Army in their country  they come and volunteer here and stay for two years.
And so these units were trained until 1943  I think  where they were then made ready for for military service.
I had to make a very long train trip  and they cram med us in a few wagons  and then they had loads of wagons where one German soldier was sitting and a big sign  forbidden for others  only for the German army.
They eventually came to the States and he joined the Army.
Then we went out with the Russian army for a while over there.
And th en suddenly  German airplanes came over us and began bombing.
My dad and his brother heard the calls from the British to come on over  cross the channel and join the British Army.
Well  were told by the political officer  by the po litruk33 in a camp that  ﬁYou are going to join Polish forces  you are going to join our victorious Red Army are going to fight the damn Germans.ﬂ 03:25:59 [Technical conversation] End of Tape #3 32 Round (Russian) 33 Political instructor (Russian) 28 Tape #4 [Technical conversation] 04:02:54 This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.
It -- I mean  at the time that he was born  it was Germany.
Yeah  was called Hersheys tropical chocolate for the army  and it didnt melt.
For one re -- think I didnt know is because my -- one of my brothers joined the Polish army  Zachary .
My mother was crying  \ You just came back from the army.\
And then they draft me to the army in 1947  where I was more than three years  more than three years.
So they they had prof essors  they had teachers  they had  you know  simple people who were in the army   you know  for example  you know  just just being a private in the army.
And we were the worker to -- to dig the trenches  ditches  anti-tank  in the certain territory of the predictable direction of the Soviet army.
And I was -- sat in the train  it was a mixed train of civilians and military.
And both of them were in armed servi one was in the army  one was in the navy during World War II  and we became quite friendly.
historically speaking the Jewish Brigade formed an important mission by recording for history in an organized fashion  stood up that enemy as Jews and not just as soldiers in the army.
I...I...I met him a couple of tim es  because of this situation with the young fellows who volunteered for the British army.
We knew that had been take n and that that certainly that they came pretty close  the Russian army close to Krackow  and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events   in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the I think  and uh reached Krackow...Krackow was only  I think  sixty kilometers from Auschwitz in the east  then a day before th at uh uh the order came not to wal...not to march out any more to the factory  and the question was what's going to happen  because certainly uh uh without knowing the uh the uh the uh thinking of the of these SS gangsters properly  what are they going to do with us  it was touch and go.
Maybe theyre not as observant  you know  religiously  but when they wore that uni -- wore th-the uniform of the military  they did it with pride  wearing it and holding their heads up high.
So the talks were on the subject of military efforts  and an-and Europe at that time was sort of sensing oncoming second Worl d War.
Well  the radio said we go to wa -- sub -- the army is going defend wars -- Warsaw.
And t his came out   and I bring it up in the army.
My fath er disappeared  we knew he was in the army  we did not know if he was killed or what has happened.
But I used to send them Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 108 packages when I was in there when just a minute that I send them packages after  when I when I when I was in the army.
You finished college  and then did yo u say you went into the army  into the service?
Sometime later he was down at a university in Geor gia  became a radio technician  then came back and took a job with the pilot radio company in New York and eventu ally  joined the army voluntarily.
So we had talks  and then they -- he said  well  dont fear us  because we are just in the army  and if we dont do it  what we are supposed to do  we get killed in our -- our own country.
That it is not true the rumors that you're hearing about the atrocities about the German Army and the Germans is not true.
>> Manny Mandel: One of my favorite kind of warm  kind of fuzzy stories  my father drafted into the Czech Army.
My son  my grandson  my daughter -in-law  we all went to the military there  all se rved the country .
I was  we were liberated by the Russian army in July 1944.
And another th ing which I thought was rather interesting was that the moment I was called into the military se rvice  my parents stock went up in the world.
I spent three months in this recruiting camp and then they had to assign us to units and I already wanted to study medicine  so they assign me to the military hospital.
Do you think it was a mistake to have these trials based on the military law and court martial law?
So that meant that we were liberated  came more Russian soldiers.
And we told the guard who was a soldier and he was a nice guy.
And we were in that camp a little while  and I wanted and and it was it it really was some kind of a barracks too  after after when we went out from the civilian  we went in a little barrack because we were ready to be to go back into Germany.
6 Well when he was in the army he never told anything about it to us  no.
In fact my father served in the Polish army later on already because there was a cons cription  also Metek served in the Polish army for a short period of time.
It was a big waste  but I -- I recognize where -- where army has to be in readiness.
And there were a group of Russian partisans  under the name Shapiga  and then Wandervaselevky's group  and th e I  People's Army Group.
They wanted to get those young fellows  arrest them  because it is obvious if they are young  and they used to serve in the Polish Army  they are reservists  so naturally they are no good.
Whatev er packed whatever they could carry with them  and ran away from the away from the army.
RL: Also  the Israeli army is one of the best armies in the world and that gives -- when did they say -- the Jews [indecipherable] fighters -- SL: A lot of brains there.
He was in the military  he enlisted in the military when second World War started.
And in the eyes of the military  we looked like heroes to them.
And this -- I used this name during my time in the Polish army  which I had a very  very im portant position  until I escaped.
So they found me a job in a hospital where they used to bring the German soldiers  the injured soldiers.
Because there was fight ing between the German soldiers and the allies.
Yes  well  I spoke some English  I had high school German  German high school English.
And my military career is something else  and Ill talk about it later on.
Yeah  because they needed the teacher  the other teacher went to my grandfather couldnt go to the army  you know  but they were both grandfathers couldnt go.
So  he came to our camp  and he took my sister  and he ask him to be a cashier  her  in American military camp.
The Germans claimed afterwards that it was an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews.
This - the happy times  the American Army and Mike Vogel.
We did not know what the military situation was certainly  because we were cut off.
Okay  this is me with a friend  and this is when I was 23  and I -- I was in army in Russia  in Ukraine.
And this way was on -- I was in the army until I went to the -- exercise the records there and so on  so on.
63 I: And then your husband was out of the army.
Anyway  one morning we heard those shots very loud and a few minutes later we had seen the American Army came to the camp.
I studied 2 semesters  43  42 and 43 at Berlin Law School because I wiggled out of the army.
A lot of Jewish of ficers were among these Polish officers and they were killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army.
But it you really it was not the kind of service that I expected in the United States Army.
Theres no question that it was dominated by th e -- the far left  because they were the best organized group of resistance  but EAM ala -- EAM was the political side  and ELAS was the -- the military side.
So in 1961  I guess I was 32 then  I left home and I went to Columbus  Ohio and I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 76 worked for outfit called Army Audit Agency  and we did auditing of the military establishment.
They were beggi ng army they should take them because they felt that the Russian s were right there behind them.
He couldnt be in the army  you know  he had a hole hole in there.
We were allowed to go to southern part of Russia  where Poles are being collected and Polish army  to fight with the Soviets against the Germans  was formed.
So then actually  was it all over that only the Russian army and the Russian people liberated Prague and Czechoslovakia .
They listened to what I had to say and their first response was  well  we think you are quite sincere  but wrong  and so you had better go work in the Army medical corps.
No  I said the dynamics between your team members  among themselves  the 35 or whatever  yeah  especially in view of what you just told me that there were DP people and there were Germans and then there was the Army  so how did all that work?
So he wasn't good for the army  so they sent him to this camp.
How many trials did you have there prior to the Military Tribunals?
Doesnt matter  you know  because the German occupation  but Lithuanians were still fighting the Jew the Jew the Polish  and the Polish Lithuanian  fighting Lithuanians.
And later on  couple of months later I was reassigned as chief of the order of battle  a division of of eighth army headquarters.
So  I dont know  I guess the people in Dachau I mean in in the yeah  the town of Dachau thought that was just a training camp for the SS there.
Then  what were going to do is move beyond this experience  into the time after the war when the Russians came  and found you  and inducted you into the Russian army  or the equivalent of it at that time.
But the Third Armored Infantry division  again  Patton s Third Army  the we were the first Americans they had come across.
When he volunteered when the war started  he volunteered for the British Army  and he had to take a British sounding name  English sounding name.
And I gave him a big American car  which cost nothing because I got it from the Army and we had free gasoline and free logistic support  and I said  \ I want to know what the Germans are thinking before they think it.\
He was taken by Russian army in the eastern part of Poland and when he was in convoy  the guard  the Russian officer or soldier  I dont remember who  told him; you look Jewish to me.
My father was able to practice dentistry in -- in the army  but not in England .
But when we got there  our home was occupied by the Russian military  and they used it as a warehouse for grain.
One of the things that happened and I -- I should interject that I forgot to  is my -- is son -- th -- my uncles -- my uncle who had been sent to the coal mines  Herschel and with his family  and my Uncle Zelig  who went to th e army  we were all reunited.
This camp had a radio  interesting enough  for the for the whole camp and when they were playing music or whatever  this sometimes it was interrupted...I remember that one evening somebody broke into the music and said here's Frankfurt  the the occ upational radio of the Amer ican army or something like that.
And the equipment was sold for  bought from the British army.
Like I told at the beginning of the war  I was in the school  the Jewish school.
But I made it and I worked -- it was military  Nasha Voisko.
All all all the young men that that were in the in the military age  they were taken into the army  or the they volunteered for the army.
You see  as I -- I -- I -- I would like to live it  we were in the group from the troops  yes  somehow our Home Army troop.
Also uh uh shouldn't forget that this November's events came after Muni ch  the all...I remember that I think it was September...thought we were somehow on the br ink of war in 19...September 1938 under these four  Hitler and Mussolini and and and Chamberlain got together in Munich and hammered out the agreement selling out Czechoslovakia to the Nazis and this also uh somehow gave the Nazis the feeling that now they were very powerful because actually uh Chamberlain had submitted to them and then he was so foolish when he got back to to London to to wave this paper saying that in the morning before he left Munich for London he had another meeting with Heir Hitler and this is to say the proof that we have peace in our time  so when the November events came  certainly Germany already was in a much stronger politica l and military situation  and for us uh uh it was the indication definitely that that uh the end of the Nazi regime we had all hoped for  because we had thought that for econo mical and political reasons there would be...it would be only be a transitory existence...that this was not true.
If the military government were very concerned about this kind of activity in so on especially the rumors that some had been murdered  we felt we couldn't abide by it.
Was the first thing they told us to do  to go immediately and to clean  because it's more difficult to say  because the same time we saw the Russian uh troop  Russian army goes to the city day and night.
They assigned us a barrack and they put me on a bunk and they called a German doctor  a German military doctor.
I'm sure they had a lot of German civilians working there  but the German troops.
Yes  because then there was a community  how to say  and I knew that in genera l the army was not as bad as the gendarmerie.
I did that three times after boot camp in Basel  but I made always people...uh...laugh at me because I...I made...I s poke out quite clearly what I thought about the military and...uh...they said  \ But you are quite right  but you are...you serve in the military  so you are a hypocrite.ﬂ (Laughing) You speak against the military  but yourself are in the military.
It has to be only German fi lm  made in Germany  photographed by the Germans  official Germans  too the army or the Waffen SS people and so on.ﬂ It made our job so much more difficult.
So they declined employing young men who had not had their military training; so I decided to get my year's training over with an d come back and then be able to get a job.
It was -- It was dusk  and I approached our new home  and there was an English army truck standing in front of the house  which was nothing special  because the -- the Jewish Brigade always had trucks standing there in -- but a-as I ran by  from under that -- that camouflage canvas  a womans voice called  and said  ﬁOh sir  could you tell me where the Lessings live?ﬂ It was my mothers voice.
And they put me in between Germans  SS guys  next to German military.
When the Nazi...when the war started  he was pulled into the Army.
He had been in the Army and he spoke the language  and I sort of spoke it okay.
And the Army is absolutely the most rigid hierarchy in the world and if you turn that to your use.
We were not far from the old frontier  and my brother was in the army; and he was on special courses in Chisinau (Kishinev  Keshenev  Keshinov  Khisinau  Kishenew  Kiscinev  Kishinef  Kiszyniow).
with the result that Patton put the Lipizzaners under the protection of the United States army  all Lipizzaners  which included the ones fro m the stud farm  who were included in that general order.
Rabbi Elster was serving the military  his -- what was it  two or three years  and then was going to get out and be a rabbi in the civilian world.
As I mentioned or didn't mention  in accordance pursuant to army instructions and regulations would have been to go through channels  but I had no time for it.
This is where  normally in the army  you would write letters  read  and relax.
Well  I was -- I was in the infantry -- Yes. --
And he was born in Germany an d he came over to the United States when he was nine years old  and when he was  I believe  32 he was in the Army in World War I and went over to Germany  yes.
This was if you -- if you not fam iliar with Lithuanian history  at that time we had to fight the [indecipherable] army  the Bermontas Soviet army  the Polish army  and we had front on three sides.
So I had to take a 10 day leave of absence  which I wanted to get paid for and the army arranged a special citizenship exam for me in Rolla  Missouri  wher e all my records were still  where I was taking my took my examination.
But particularly is what we were interested on war material  they have in Suitland 33 tons  and Im talking tons of material on the second World War  what the American army confiscated from archives in Germany  Italy  Yugoslavia  France and Austria and Czechoslovakia .
However  the coup was suppressed by an SS division  and so came to a quick end  the only open insubordination of the German military in the Second World War.
Did your father want to go into that army or not?
So  just one example  there were other officers  Jewish officers in Lithuanian army.
And it was driven by a German sergeant who looked like a Nazi sergeant and he sat alongside of his passenger who was a  a very handsome Lieutenant in the German army  blond  blue eyed  most attractive looking man.
And they mounted mech anical work required  you can gather from Belle's description  of the movement of the document from a cave in which it was uncovered by the army and its intended use by an attorney after the document ha d been translated  and so on and so forth.
So  they took me to an office where there was other military person just with a shirt not with that straps and I told him that I had to succumb to anything they want ed.
The sky was clear  and pani Pajuoste were was the military base behind Panevžys  there was a huge cloud going up of the explosion  apparently  huge cl oud.
And we have to we have to go to the se to the army.

Remember that the French army had the authority to requisition cars for their needs.
So  well  then I didnt know this  but the the army decided in the earlier period  when they werent so overwhe lmed  that they would experiment with a a wireless.
So  when when and wh ere did you enter the army?

Nobody saw Vilnius for 19 years  and now suddenly  y ou know  I saw that that city  and everybody wanted and even Lithuanian officers were intere sted  in my opinion how did the Polish army look to me?
It was the policy at that time for the Army to move forward as fast as it can and not try to destroy all the Germans as we go but bypass them and let the infantry come in and finish up the work that we started.
So  we all signed up for the Army  the Navy  Uhhuh.
I felt -- I felt  I didnt say so  but I -- that if I -- this -- I had been in his place  and a young boy comes over  missed out on a cation  has nobody  I send him back to school  maybe -- possibly through college  and if he want to [indecipherable] his money back for college  say  ﬁL ook  you can pay me back wh en you can.ﬂ But he -- this was not the case  and there was also one of the reasons why I went into U.S. army.

During the war  the Slovak Jewry did something which was not typical.

No and I dont know how -- oh  Im sure the army made efforts and there may have been some arrests I didnt know about.
Well  we were always looking for interesting prisoners  so when the city of Treya was about to fall  I was sent  as I often was  to go there and find out how mili to write a report on the how a military government functioned after the first de day or two.
Zierice who was the commandant of the camp  told him: \ Well  you have 15 minutes to prepare yourself.ﬂ He said  \ Now  if this lieutenant lives  I will put you in the base hospital which is strictly for military personnel and you will be in charge of that  but if he dies  so do you.ﬂ And so Poloho operated and he was successful and the lieutenant lived and Poloho was then transferred to the base hospital which was a permanent building in the main compound.
What we did know was  number one  take care of any survivors medically and also see to their welfare; that is  proper food and a place to stay  clothing  and then have them interrogated by the representatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of our military police detachments -- CID it was called -- and then also have some JAG people there to see from that point of view what was going on.
We are in fact now having by -- gone by train and by truck through Italy to Taranto  which is in the arch of the boot  to board a ship  actually became a British military ship  to transport -- to take us to Haifa.
Now let me go back to 7 the synagogue in Schwandorf So the first Hanukkah light I thought I'd spend it with the Jews in Schwandorf.

In Milan the American headquarters put me as interpreter and I was with the American army a good six  seven months.
Within the next day  my father got his orders to report to the town of Zhest   where there was a big Polish army unit.
And we decided to go to Wiesbaden  which was 20 miles from Frankfurt am Main headquarters of American army.
I was one of many  many people by that time  others of my my my peers  huh  and I was ar I think probably more self c more se lf confidence in myself and I know looking back that the army made all the difference in the world to my growing up.
And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother  who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship w ith my fathers brother  is after World War   when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother  they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo  who obviously had a very good military record  and said  ﬁWhy dont you come back into the German army?ﬂ And he said  ﬁWell  you know  Im Jewish.ﬂ And - and apparently they said to him  ﬁWell  w hy dont you just say youre Christian  it wont any difference ﬂ and -- and left it.

Interview with Felix Nicinski March 6  2007 55 That was the last camp  the third camp in Germany  that was Bergen-Belsen  and thats where we were -- we were liberated by the British at that -- the British liberated Bergen-Belsen.
Were they from someplace else  or were they  you know  Germans I dont know.
Everybody was taken there from these wooden barracks/ Everybody was -- it was a military hospital for at least ill people.
And during wartime  incidenta lly  the fire department  and that was made known also  did never  never did anything to protect or put out fires in ordinary apartment houses because they were needed for mo re important objects  you know  either government or military installations and so on and so the whole population had been trained in extinguishing fires.
The the the terrain around our town was swampy and and lot lots of forests  lots of woods and it was used for training the Polish army  so we used to do business with the Polish army.
The first one was Palazze  which is near Naples  but they were old Army barracks.
She went to school here to speak Eng lish  and she was a seamstress for a period of time and during the war working in a -- a -- as a supervisor in a factory making uniforms and raincoats and so forth for the military.
I think that had it not been for Henry Lun zer  with his or -- with his sort of military organization  in setting up an administration  a nd an office that actually could operate within German  and particularly in the British zone  but not only in the British zone  in terms of provision  in terms of negotiation with British mi litary government for the needs of different individuals and groups  I think that we would have achieved very little.
Even when I was in the Army  it never went to their mind that I could have been different.
You know  they knew more than just the planes  they knew the army -- the Russians are coming.
There were 10 million of them and the Army is repatriating all of them.
Suddenly all of the Italian army disappeared and we were free.
So  the one turned to me in German and he said can you speak German.
By that time he decided to make the military a career cause he s -- put in too much time into the military.
You look a little bit more intelligen t than that  what else can you do?ﬂ And I -- I said  ﬁWell  sir  in attempt to be a civil engineer I also passed the draftsman test  not just the language test.ﬂ He called across seventh army headquarters  engineer sec tion  oh yeah  they need draftsmen.
Thats that diseased camp  and they gave us the German barracks.
A private in the German army  kind of made him sit there to see what it was like.
And I was -- I served in the German army  without  thank God  getting the German citizenship.
When the liberation army started moving in closer and they started bombing the camps  so the German soldiers lined everybody up and they started to shoot them all  or to shoot them before the Army got there  before the liberation came.
Then he was--in the war--in the war  he was released from Dakow and put in the army and the uh--I happened to mention that I have a child--he don't live in the ghetto  so--so he brought--one day he brought me a bag of sugar and he brought some flour  I think like that.
He was a strong guy and he was really fighting there  in this army.
So he explained to me that it was Yom Kippur  you know  the Jewish day of asking for forgiveness  and these were Jewish men  members of the Soviet Army  who had just returned from Europe  from Poland and Germany.
My husband came back after being uh discharged from the Army.
Well  uh  when the war broke out in Poland  I was a Polish soldier.
They were calling all the Jewish children who were at age at that time  who were 17  18 19 to go to the Army.
Because in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service  and it wasnt just a two year stint  it was 20 years before they were released.
He was not trained in th e military  I am sure.
And what I mean  artifacts  what I have seen is primarily jewelry  cases and cases and cases of jewelry that  military trucks that drove up and they loaded all that stuff up and .
All right  this little story when my father came back into the village  and saw the military police unit breaking up  and he went up again  to the redhead guy  who was just about getting on his huge Harley-Davidson motorcycle  and revving up the engine  and my father said -- and the guy said  ﬁAre you here again?ﬂ ﬁYeah ﬂ said my father.
What  we didn't  but we felt like whatever they advised us  this  the first farmer  the one that had the sons that they were hi ring in Polish army and everything  we felt that they are right.
And the German Army  at that time  was advancing into Egypt.
After the war  my brother was in the English Army  he went to the police where he lived in France  and this is what the neighbors told.
So they shipped him back to Germany  and thats when he came back.
I didnt even know there was such a thing as being able to volunteer into the German army  but maybe by that time they were desperate for volunteers because  you know  the front was moving  they were moving  moving  moving  you know  west.
Well  I was very nervous about that  because  for one thing  on the July 20 th  all that film  I had something which  there was some army colonel that was attached to us  and we found out that he had taken some of that film and sold it to so me American company.
You said you had a lot of power in the army.
Then you have to contact underground army  Armia Krajowa to contact Polish government in London .
And they decided to to leave  and they left and we had been living together with them  you know  nobody check And this is German army?
My brother was in the American Army  and I wrote the English letter  and I gave it to a British soldier which I got acquainted with.
So they trained me in French MII  French Military Intelligence Interrogation.
So but finishing high school because then he went in for the army.
But  the Army was also greatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem.
Bernstein gets assigned to Army Headquarters which are in Frankfurt in the IG Farben building  a great German industrial combine  huge  huge headquarters building.
We [indecipherable] landing [indecipherable] keep the Germans out [indecipherable] go on to Italy.ﬂ And he said  ﬁWhat do you want me to do?ﬂ ﬁWe want you to parachute at night  in the [indecipherable].ﬂ He had neve r jumped by para -- he was 50 years o -- oh  they didnt take him to the army [indecipherable] were 50  I think.
I don't want to have the Army get into an adversarial position with these DPs.
Now  backing up  what led up to your going into the Army?
Thats how the Army  again  who tells you what you should do.
And it -- the jokes going around was that before our childrens tales start -- started with once upon time  and now our [speaks foreign language here] high command of the German army announces that.
And in the -- whoever work ed for the military bases had a special shein.
And having experienced the German attempt to universal military power  I decided Id had enough of that.
And he said  ﬁWe have to do so mething  we employing these people.ﬂ The U.S. army was employing them as auxiliary guards.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned to us that your father served in the Austrian Army.
He asked the people for money  and then this was the first two times  when the war started he was drafted as a reservist  as a doctor to the army.
And they didn't accept any kind of antiSemitism or racism amongst th em  because for them the Nazis 5 were not only enemies on a military uh basis but also certainly on a political and moral basis I would say.
He is a military off...doctor  so in the room you cannot leave the room  the beds might have to be made  the toilets have to be clean  you know.
By the time [indecipherable] was  and my brother had joined th-the illegal geose  this is the Israeli army  which was illegal one.
And like lunchtime  the American came into the camp  and they start to people was hungry  you know  they wou they we went to the to the military  says  give us food.
And the univer the army made reservation for me in University of Lwow  for political science as a background for journalism.
Be rgen had -- these were army  this was an army camp.
We we re making barracks for the whole Russian army  the German army.
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 152 So but he knew a lot of German s  you know  people that were in Poland   and that they had to be in the army because otherwise they would be dead anyway.
Wa one bu-but then we were released from that service earlier  before our term was over  because there was supposed to be Lithuanian army  you know  armed forces be being established  and the general said that he needs some experienced soldiers who could be un you know  non-commissioned off o fficers  something like that.
That was in the period  the short period  before the German army actually entered Lodz.
I had  you know  th e uniform and the ID and all this.
My daughter-inlaw  as I said  said she could have never been a military wife.
Were there still Germans and then ba by that I mean soldiers  inside the camp  or not?
N-No  in -- in -- when you were there in the army  with the other American soldiers  did they evidence any anti-Japanese sentiments?
In 1938  it was my turn to be--to go back into the military but then I decided instead of going to be back in the military  I wanted to take an extra service  a special service.
These were people apparently who had been  at least the officers  me mbers of the Polish army in '39 who were then shipped to Siberia.
AG] Well... had to  had to join the Army  and everyone used to say when they  everybody  twenty had to join the Army  war or no  conscription [DL] But why did you join the Army itself as opposed to Navy or the Air Force? [
We got a festive send -off by the U.S. Army in Bremerhaven and when we arrived in New York on May 20t  the pier was full of newspaper people and photographers.
He has a son in the army  whether he is alive  he doesn't know.
You know  the German Jews in at that time  and down there  they were not poor.
And slowly we were moving on and moving on and it was dangerous because the German army fell apart.
I was still  you know  poor man  sick  in the military uniform  because only wa -- everything was burned.
And he called Leist and told him gave him the job to do it in Warsaw   to find hundred Germans and there were tens of thousands of Germans living in Warsaw at the time  military and civilian  to form that list.
It was too close  the army was marching by  you understand.
And the Russian Army entered already in Romania  was entering already in Focsani.
Id never ha d any experience of that before  but he  being an army officer  a captain in the British army  ha d experienced -- and so I learned from him.
A nd my father spoke Russian very well  because he served in south imperial army  and they became friends  and that Ivan  as we called him  came and went.
We later on found out from someone in the government in Switzerland that this whole transport of Russians  was killed in Austria by the Russian military  including the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 37 infants  and we had infants.
And as I said before  I told the colonel that you cant  that the responsibility was all his and it was under his command.
So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work  when the work was finished  they let them go.
By the way  in ‚41  he volunteered for the Army and was rejected because Dayton practically doubled in size during that time.
So we tried to get across the border ahead of the German Army into France.
I decided I go to the military warehouse and apply to be a tailor there.
It was a what do they call it in the military  those places where there are holes in the ground?
That was work  it was an army sort of  out of civilians that were not labor  that were not taken to the Russian army because we we re Polish citizens and they only took us from one camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed workers and all kind of different places  from one place to the other.
So when we came to Warsaw we came to a beautiful apartment  friends of mine parents were still....on the summer house because it was summer in Europe and we...this was   and we took their apartment  but we didn't remain too long in this apartment because the Polish army moved in...in the building with the...you know  so we were afraid.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 29 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: before the Germans came.
Your family  you know everybody started to get news as the Soviet army was approaching Berlin.
My feeling because the Americans landed in Morocco  Nigeria  somehow that was part of their -- the military ration.
In Russia  when my brother was liberated he was liberated under the Russians and then he could no longer leave.
I wonder what they often thought  here are these men  after what they had been through  many of them had responsible jobs  listening to a 27-year old army officer telling them they can't have responsibility for themselves until they maintained certain degrees of sanitation.
Many east European countries were terrified of the Soviet army  because of rapes  because of what happened to the female population.
>> Bill Benson: In just the few moments that we have left  your father  of course  had left much earlier to the United States.
Then I said  ﬁWill you give me a statement that you dont let military allies -- that you wont let me cross the border with four cans of gas?
And I was sent for basic training to Camp Blanding in Florida   infantry basic.
And then he when the war was I mean  Lithuania gained its independence  he ended up going to military school  and became an officer in the Lithuanian army.
And I went to a German in the woods; and like I say  I...I didn't to... Was civil  not uh...not uh...not  not from the Army or the SS or with the dogs.
So  you know  Swiss Swiss males took their uniforms home and their wife will sew them after doing their military service.
If we divert our limited war  you know  military res ources to such objectives as bombing the tracks  it will delay the end of the war.
And then come thousands and thousands and thousands came every every hour to the army  cause this is this is central point from here.
Was a little br idge over the Prozna River and it was dynamited by the Polish army that the Germans should not be able to come in.
Oh  in some ways   yes  because I have this sort of wonderful military life.
They took them away and interned them all in camps and took their weapons away and then they said that it was the police's fault and the army.
Since then Manya has spoken frequently on behalf of the museum both here in the museum and in many settings across the country  such as military ins tallations   universities  and colleges  as well as local schools.
He tried not to deal with the U.S. Army because he was absent without leave.
Because the Army  we have so many cooks-- every one  every company has a cook--so we didn't eat.
Because Im not a military Its the 90th troop carrier group The 90th troop car Nine zero  90th  yeah.
I am -- when -- when -- when I got into the camp -- into the camp there  you know  and again the officer at the entrance of the troops who were guarding the exit there  he wanted to shake hands  you know  make his contact with the western allied army  and then he said  ﬁLook  theres one area in this camp in which theres the -- what you call the zoif -- Typhus?
The other days of the week  I would get a military vehicle and a driver from southern base headquarters in Salisbury  and c over one slice of England.
And he was a medical aid person  that was his job with the battalion  but he was also a a translator.
And -- but this was -- they were all speaking German.
And when the war was over I was transferred to the war crimes  and I was from then on in war crimes until my discharge from the army in December  1946.
Did -- did the Joint Distribution Committee or th e U.S. military governme nt  did any of these people know what was going on and they just let it happen?
But the first time I sat in the rotunda and suddenly I saw all the military walking in with the flags that liberated the camps  I -- I just started crying like a baby.
And the only thing -- they didnt bother the army  they were marching  they didnt bother anybody  you went out to get some water.
In the meantime  we saw this truck in a ditch  in the field.
Chaim had to go in the army and I'm ﬁWhat will I do?ﬂ And he say  \ You know what you do?
After 50 years  our liberation by General Patton army  the army  I was invite by German authority to celebrate 50 years of free dom.
They...I think they landed on the...on September 1st or 2nd  befo re England had declared war but Germany had already entered...start military ope rations against Poland.
Not only in physical training in the military  but we had to do a lot of training we had to learn from books--tactics  manuevers.
And there were Germans in the supervisory sort of positions as military.
They were just -- I don't know what kind of -- auxiliary army.
And they were housed in German army barracks  and they lived better than the population because they had all the heat  the hot water  they had decent food  which was short at that time  but they were bored.
We've got to save something for eventual Army headquart ers  okay.
So it was a form of torture (laughs) I felt the United Stat es Army was directing its torture at me personally  and it was a terrible time  and I ha d applied for officers candidate school.
So did you meet other U.S. military people in the camp at the time?
Im sure they ki brought in the teachers  because the teachers that we knew and I really didnt know whether they speak hungar I know my father spoke Hungarian for one reason  because the soldiers must have had on their agenda certain things that Yorel Pollak was was a g-gender urmeshda they call it that time  like a not a general not a in the army  like a how do you call it?
I couldnt speak for her  that -- give her a seat  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 133 but I  as an army officer had -- was considered maybe -- they -- they -- they figured we had -- we won the war  and we wer -- demande d certain things  but I wasnt normally doing that  but I was insisting here  in this ca se.
So  when they war was over they made him chaplain  Army chaplain  and then he went with the Dutch Army to Indonesia and then he came and they didn't know what to do with him so they sent me to the United States but I didn't do anything here.
And at first the Polish forces were winning  and then the Soviet forces got all the way to Warsaw   and it looked like that the Poland was going to lose  and they were going to enter the rest of Europe   but they wha-what is today called the miracle on the Vistula   Marshall Pilsudski   together with Marshall Foch   the French support came up with a very good military strategy  and beat the Soviets  and took hundreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war  and th-that was the end of the war  th-the the Soviets capitulated.
So  we cannot be I think sometimes even Netanyahu or the others  it was naive to think that an Israeli  the Israeli power  military  could prevent Hitler.
No  1945 [indecipherable] -- in the British army no  I was still when the war was on  yeah.
There were army trucks all over  picking up all the soldiers from th -- on the streets and taking them back to the camps.
I says  I work for the American army and they pay me with scrip and thats wh at I have.
When war started  my father had to go to to the army.
He was afraid of anybody because he was...uh...every 3 months checked if he can go to the front line again because he came from Rovno which not far away from Limburg and there they took him into the army and they retreated and you know where he in 14 days the Germans were before Moscow.
They went over there with the Polish Army - They went over there under supervision of the English.
I think that many military leaders now  are of the opinion that it was a grave mistake.
And he also was in the army in the United States.
The girl on my left  her father was in the military  and he was to be the Austrian attache in Berlin.
My personnel manager had got me out so I was only in the army for ten weeks and four days.
So his Right  he was in the Polish army he was in the Polish army because there was a call to arms  you know  asking all eligible males to present themselves at this  that and the other place.
The Soviet Union has every every every establishment uh the commercial or military uh etiquette  used to have a war paper  paper that was  you know  the praise those who did good work and criticize those who did bad work  and so on and so on.
They pretend that from beginning they are friend of Germans  you know.
They gave us food; the Germans were debating where they should take us.
Is that that when were talking about those war crime trials  and what you mean is trials that took place within the camp of Dachau   for the camp of Dachau .
Interview with Helena Knapczyk May 10  2013 132 in the army.
My boss thought that the Germans could fight off the onslaught from the Russian army  so eventually the fight...if he's safe  I'm safe  so he could open himself a little bit.
It may have been some kind of a military defense area or something like that  but it was pretty green...pretty and they separated immediatel y the men and the women.
So  until the until the Germans unearthed Unearthed that Katyn Katyn and they announce it  America  and England said it was done by the Germans  and Stalin [indecipherable] the exploitation  and he had Polish Jewish fellow who was a general  what was his and he formed communist army in Poland   and that was another army over ther e. And they went all the way to Berlin  too  with Russian army.
Early was a regular--the army experi ence was we were not treated very well by the British because we were Palestinians.
And the time when I went to Germany -- Germany  if I saw somebody that was my age then  I would know that he was somebody in the German army  somebody that oppressed the Jewish people  and -- and whatever it is  so I would feel very badly.
I suppose the next thing would be what happened in Yugoslavia  and -- beginning in 1991  when military forces of Serbia invaded Bosnia and Croatia  there were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a Nuremberg trial certainly did help  with respect to the creation of the international USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 28 criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
And a lot of young people died be cause farmers needed the fields before so that army came.
He was in the army  was in this commando unit  and got killed.
I got when I came out of the army  I I I go I got married to somebody born from here  you know  an Am erican wo-woman.
This year  I attend -- I have one class like a -- they teach us -- they train us th -- something about the army.
I mean  it happened to have been the Russians  but at that point we didnt know it was the Russian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed.
Th-The ka this the red army was on some kind of alert already  so they we re mostly at their bases  wherever that was.
In other words  the policemen are Jewish  the -- the courts are Jewish  the -- the -- the army is Jewish  the Air Force is Jewish  the -- the -- you know  whatever.
And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the street a uh army elements  a pa...army patrol  and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who commanded thirty men or so  and I said look  these people want to arrest me and this is my name.
He had plenty of it  but the German was benzene  which was white and the American gasoline was red and that's one of the things that military used to always check when they'd find a vehicle  and that was one of his responsibilities  too.
But at the same time  being in France  you know  the traditional enemy of Germany  th e strong French Army.
Because I knew already from experience that everyone in our congregation was  uh  executed what  uh  refused  uh  the military services.
His associate ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 was a very nice man.
My father sent a cousin of mine  who was in the British army  and he came to put us in touch with the Jewish agency.
And I remember one man in particular who had just learned about what had happened to his family and I was there in this JDC uniform  which was like a 6 military uniform and I was good  strong physical condition and I remember his walking up to me  with tears  he had just learned apparently  about what had happened to his family.
You never give up  you show yoursel ves in strength  not down being  and well  which also  I like to add something which I used in the army in a different way.
Hungry - that the kettle that they brought in from the kitchen - we had to send people to bring those military kettles with with soup that you didn't know what the soup was made from  and yet when it was dished out to everybody  a portion to everybody  we had a line-up of people  a list of people that could lick that kettle out after it was finished.
Said his father is an officer in the army  and they wouldn't talk to a Jew.
I was assigne d the business of writing an executive order for President Roosevelt  dire cting the seizure of enemy owned patents  pursuant to the Trading With th e Enemy act  which you mentione d. Also there  I worked on establishing the curriculum for the school for military government.
You see the thing was which newspap ers then reported here that a lot of the German army had nervous breakdowns because they made the young children   women undress  dig a hole and then they shot them into it.
One thing  I lost tons of information  because the German concentrated army of war against Soviet Union .
We talked about your Army life and being in Korea and some of the experiences yo u had there.
When I was working anytim e I had somebody to see  the Polish army  the Russian  they had nails under their shoes  52 nails in the Polish army.
The JRSO  Jewish Restitution Successor Organization as designated by Military Governme nt law.\
Kovpak was the biggest partisan...was a whole army  and we're going to fight with the German army  playing very serious mission and you are five young boys.
I of course it was emotional to her  you know  but me  its a you know   I been by myself for so many years  you know  this is so I came to her ap she had an apartment  she gave me a little small room with a Murphy bed in it  and I really dont know ho-how to explain that feeling  it was it was kind of strange feeling  here I am from the camps  from the army  into civilization.
Your -- Your time in Germany  did you move from place to place?
>> Bill Benson: George  so everybody understands that  this was  for the outside world as far as they were concerned  it was an operating uniform -making factory  and that everybody in there was mak ing uniforms for the Hungarian army.
And each one of the bedrooms was neat  just like a normal army  uh  room.
After the war  after leaving military service  he was assigned as a civilian to the Nuremberg war crimes detachment  and there participated in several of the interrogations of top German generals.
And like I said  I got exa-examined  and they said to me  some people  ﬁYeah  but you -- you act like a -- like the strong guy  youre a military officer.ﬂ He -- some -- some people said  ﬁYou dont look sick to me.ﬂ And I said  ﬁIm not  I ﬂ -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 34 but -- but when you go in the -- the Germans  you got to tell them you -- you suffer.
He kind of fell down forward  and the military law is  if you hit the chest or the heart  you always fall forward  you never fall backward.
The Jewish community at that time  of course they didn't have the same kind of privileges  officially uh under Austra-Hungary it was of course if somebody would change his religion  they could become in the military a general or something like that  but the religion was quite important.
And I had no idea what he -- he wa -- all I knew  he was a volunteer in the German army.
Those that had the relatives in the army had better sup better assistance.
The Army had just started to train mountain troops and didn't really know what they were doing.
My father came back from the World War I. He was in the Austrian army.
He was only about 13 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 25 years old.
So does that mean that you have contact with these Germans?
I was not -- I had a very good time  because I was with the army  and the army are wonderful people.
So they start advancing and the army was very powerful  you know.
Now then we [indecipherable] we saw  in our gymnasium  in ou-our high school came a German detachme nt  not the regular military  I dont know  the uniforms were somewhat different  they have digging equipment a lot  and there was they will kill Panev žys Jews also  the rumor was there.
There were Czechoslovaks were se nt by the Russians to Siberian and then they came back with the army they organized in Siberi a. They were mostly Jews because they were running away from the Germans  from Hitler.
I am a private man now  so I was put in another kibbutz of young people with the supervision of Jewish soldiers in Mestre   Mestre it very close to Venice  and we spend there a very nice Rosh Hashana  in the ghetto  Venice  in the Nafi of the English Army  with a chaplain  evrything  very nice.
We first were hit by that when my father was drafted into the service  into the Army.
So they got an order to take care about families whose fathers on the f -- on the ar -- in the army.
At first the transit camp  in fact  was one of the synagogues until the military  yeah  that synagogue  by the way  had been only lightly damaged during Kristallnacht and had been repaired afterwards.
People got scared when they saw uniformed uh soldiers or police on the piers because the Swedish military uniforms were very much like the Germans.
And even though hed been four years in the first World War  I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and experienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to what we read about  what took place in World War   where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios  but he was on th -- we never discussed that  he -- he -- he could not -- he could not -- Talk about it.
The shoes too  I remember th-the -- the tall  you know  its lace up  you know  the - the army clothing.
And for example  I knew a former colleague  non -Jews  who was  his father was in the Army  and at one point we start to talk with him about  to meet him and to talk about the war  about the  what's going on  and he had some good feelings about our fight.
Found out that the German Army  Hitler had crossed the Austrian border at midnight  was on his way to Vienna.
Not German s. >> Bill Benson: And before the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944  was it right before then that your father also had to leave?
He went further  he said that it was only through military conquest that Germany had ever been great  led by a strong man.
And 20 -- pe -- probably two  three days after the Soviet invade in Poland  we was ma -- surrounded by army -- Soviet army tanks  and after small shooting  we supposed to surrender.
I was very happy to do that for her but the Russian army passed by here and they came into the houses and emptied everything and they took.ﬂ Somehow  looking around it didnt seem that the house was robbed by the Russian army or that anything was emptied from there.
So the first doctor  German doctor I saw  which was the 24th of September in 1946  he said that on the 10th of April 1944  he was 174 centimeters tall and at that time he weighed 42.8 kilos  so that was under 100 I already gained  and with fever and so on and so forth he had contracted tuberculosis in a concentration camp of Ravensbruck and this is made for the military authorities because at the time my father wanted  the idea was TB  you had to go to the mountain air  they wanted to send me to Switzerland  to   which was a special hospital for TB patients.
Well  I let her go on telling that story until towards the very end of her life when I was with nieces and nephews  all those fancy nieces and nephews  I mean  hew nephew had invited me to dinner one day when I was older and attractive and he was a young officer in the British Army.
He did very well because with the shortage in the United States of the feathers and down  because the army used to use it up for sleeping bags and so on.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 For two years I was an expert.
So since I left the active army for nine years  I became executive director of the Reserve Officer's Association  which is a major military lobby on Capitol Hill.
And they brought all these French Moroccans out of Africa  up there to the occupation army.
Now uh  while I'm thinking of it  my  uh when I escaped later on  my weight  I was uh put on the scal e by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five pounds.
And it was a trip in the plane  in the army plane and then all that.
So  the assignments were a regular routine  almost like Army life and we had to participate.
But it was my military background  I got myself a guide who was fighting in the Golan Heights   and we we went up the Golan Heights the same way his unit went up.
And we marched the Jew out and turned him over the military government  and I can't tell you what became of him.
She is registered to go to the army and I dont know if theyll let he r out or not  but theyll try to and theyre coming to the bar mitzvah for two weeks.
In the -- in each barracks there were -- there were a few barracks.
It was very difficult for me to come back  I had no documents  only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number and with my name  that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army.
So it was German and Ukrainian at the time in Slovakia.
Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28  2015 8 What did your father tell you about his service in Marshall Pilsudskis army?
We had to withdraw  not we  but the Hungarian and the German army  had to withdr aw their troops in such a hurry  they couldnt get into these trenches.
Because the rest of the army  the normal army would have been sent to the front.
And I would say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people who had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite remarkable.
That one is plucked from a regular army unit  into another one  which doesnt reveal itself Yes.
He was seep he got a job in military government as somebody who could be trusted  and ultimately turned out to be a member of the city council and became head of a new Jewish community  because there were a few survivors who drifted back to Aachen and so the province decided to facilitate the development of a Jewish community  and he actually became its head  I think  for the rest of his life.
Well  there was a there was a a an unfortunate  or fortunate  I dont know  uphill on the radio  some kind of a military person  pronounced that in order to formulate new units of the army  all men able to bear arms should move east.
c.701)  there wa s a lot of German army people th ere  standing around.
But when the Soviets army were approaching  they get all these men to all the machines  and send them to Bad Gandersheim   and they built factory to bil for build airplanes.

Of course I later learned the reason that uh she had been uh kept at the police headquarters was that uh my father had uh uh a lot of uh being that he was wealthy and uh had connections with the leading uh members of the community  so even after the ghetto was organized  he was able to uh obtain through uh uh payment a document from the uh uh mayor of the town in Zwolen and the uh German commissar  the German uh governor of the town  a special document for uh as a merchant and uh supplier of uh the uh uh shoes to the German army and whatever  so he he obtained uh a passport uh so to speak  a uh it was which a document with which he was able to travel and uh the idea was that uh after uh the war broke out and the  Poland was divided to the German Russian sphere of influence  uh his uh he owned two trucks that were confiscated so uh we couldn't get no means of escape but uh he was still dreaming of the  to get us uh out somehow uh with money that he still had and influence.
And Ken -- his name used to be Helmut  but they always change the names wh en you went in the army.
Army\  speaking  `cause in Hungarian calls it Munkaszolgalat [Hungarian Labor Service System].
But once I was in the American zone in Feldafing  you know the Military Police  they came in a lot to the camp because they had connections with this local police  the survivors.
Military government...I didn't know what it meant  but it was closed.
So in World War I  he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good administrator  so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsba d. And there he then later settled.
Well  uh  when the war broke out in Poland  I was a Polish soldier.
This was a construction organization and all the guards there were middle aged Germans that were not taken to the Russian  were not 16 taken to the army.
High military people who fought for Poland   you know  were removed from their apartments.

So when I gave the names to the Army  the Army and the Red Cross started to look.
But the military planners had not foreseen the fact that there would be Jews in the concentration camps  they would be the largest number and there would be people who would not or could not return to their homeland.
I stayed there until May 20th as a refugee in then I left in the military service as a soldier.
Couldnt get home because this was still   the Romanian Army were there.
And if th e Russians tried to disarm them  they would blow up.
I think in the beginning I mentioned that my father volunteered for the Army and fought in World War I. So in 1934 the Nazis it decreed in that same rally in that same assembly  that the Jews  effective immediately  are no longer German citizens.
They didn't like to go... We went into the market to buy something  sometimes the KGB come ove r  surrounded everybody  or somebody  and 23 they escaped from the army.
So if Kesserling wanted to locate his wife the last time he heard from her  we could contact a military unit of ours stationed near Tege rnsee and ask them to investigate.
So if they were not at a certain level  or had not been members of the SS or the Nazi party  the Berlin document center check would surface nothing  and the armed forces information check would surface  if anything  possibly and -- the name of an army unit or a police unit  and nothing more.
My two brothers that were sent in the woods when the Germans fought the Russians  I don't know what -- I didn't know what happened to them.
Also  the after the Jews  after the war had almost ﬁXﬂ amount of thousands of Jews in GermanyŠafter ‚47  after the program in came 100 000 Jews from Poland  came over to the American occupied zoning of the army  100 000. (

Because in the area there was a couple of battles that were Polish forces were defeated because they were not well organized.
And so he would be teaching in high school  the basic skills of the military.
Oh yeah  you see  I was liberated when I was in Sweden already.
We ate apples because P oland has a lot of apples and there was nobody to pick them because the soldiers -- I mean the farmers were in the Army.
So  after I finished my basic training  I di d have a college degree  the army decided I was officer material.
Czechs became part of prot-protectorate they call  of Germany  and Slovakia became independent  thanks to Hitler   you know.
Did the call up  where you have an interview  and they ask you what youd like to do  would you like to go in the army  would you like to go in the navy  would you like to go in the air force  and I said  ﬁWell Ill -- Id like to go in the army.ﬂ I think really because my grandf ather  on both sides  my 57 father  his brothers  my uncle  all been in the army  so I -- it was -- it was like it was like a tradition.
Then in Austria we went through the border to the west  to the parts of --} We had to cross to Italy. {
The working together against the German government and because of that the AK which was the army which was against the Jews  and they were pulling down  in 1946 they were pulling down the Jews from the trains and killing them.
And then my father sent in a -- an armed soldier and sent a note that we should go with him.
Uh...uh...(pause) I can only tell tell you what happened afterwards a little bit is that my brother was...a couple of months later was drafted into the...was supposed to be drafted into the Dutch army to fight in Indonesia so here we had already joined a Zionist organization and he decided to go illegally to Israel because he didn't want to go to Indonesia and fight or go into the Dutch army so my...we had been together for thirty-three months in very small quarters and my brother left  early '46 he left for Israel and we didn't see him for many years because  you know  we stayed in Holland for a few years.
And he s I said  guess what the what the guys in in the army call the Marines?
First Lieutenant Fritz Schnaittacher of New York City was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service in connection with military operations against the enemy by Lieutenant General Hi -sli ck   Commander of the 7 th Army.
Later there the International Red Cr oss and other sources press the German and the fighting army was equal to prisoner of war.
And so my first thought was  they didnt look like victors  they looked like a a losing army.
And they would take off  looking for survivors  carrying army blankets with them.
But after military they said to you  you cannot go because you know secrets  you was in military.
A German army came in with a truck and they were looking for us and they emptied all things a nd they find a statement  so we lost everything around twice  but we were smart enough to put our life more value on our life than our belongings.
I my self and one of my buddies who happened to have woodworking as a hobby be fore the military were given an opportunity to work in one of the local cabinet shops on military materials -- exercise equipment  I guess.
And was -- house was partly destroyed  you know  and in our house was couple other people who was evacuated from east  and my mother was  you know  very  very pleased see me because was thinking I never come back because this time Soviet army take many prisoner to the Siberia.
So you were part of the Red Army that liberated Kovno .

And he spent but he was  by this time  promoted  and was what the Germans call a Rittmeister   and that would be the equivalent of a captain in the American army.

I have seen my own army  Lieutenant Calley  who -- who killed women and children in his [indecipherable].
After the war we found out that this transport was taken to Auschwitz concentration camp.
I  in turn  knew his address and through a British soldier that came back to the Czech army  a friend of my brothers  through him  thr ough the British army  through London  through his mother  I was able to send a wire to New York  to let him know that I survived.
So And during the war he was before the war in in the underground army he was lieutenant  and then during the insurrection  captain.

I remember while being in the army in Austria I went to I was in Vienna one time  and there was a show in one of the Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18  1997 79parks  and there was a especially one of the things  one of the the acts was a comedian who was telling jokes about the war  and half the audience was watching the stage  and the other half was watching me.
>> [Laughter] >> Michel Margosis: At least that's in the Army.
So the dr aft board says  \ Well  we can handle  we ca n change that  why doesn't he go and join the reserve unit and go into the   the army base here once a month and he can do it for a number of years and he doesn't have to go in the army.\
But I was a research assistant to senior researchers in  in Soviet foreign and military affairs.
They have to bring it into the Jewish community so they can collect it for the German army.
And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days.
So the Russians asked for volunteers because that didn't agree with the military plan.
On the military side there were 2 000 Jewish troops in the city of Berlin in four armies.
So instead  I enlisted in the U.S. army for three years  whereas a draft would have been for two years  something like that.
Many who built for war in say like the bridges  railroad  toward the Russian front were excused for active service in German army.
The families of military personnel were being evacuated on the fifth day of war  and I decided  although father designated me as the head of family  I decided to designate my younger brother and join the fight.
We were left for dead  and the -- well they told me to use that  but the only thing I -- I was disqualified from the U.S. Army after one parachute jump.
73 published  unfortunately  which may be around somewhere in the Pentagon  but the Army decided it would be too expensive and had no useful purpose  and so they nixed it at the last moment.
He came storming in  in an army car with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the county village.
Oh  the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes.
Do you remember  at liberation  and you  you suddenly saw  realized that you were liberated– Yeah. –
And on March the 15th  the German army marched in and...uh....occupied the...the... the remains of Bohemia and Moravia.
She applied for a job there because she felt if she was working for the Germans  she would have an ID showing that she was working for the Germans.
You know  those long wooden spoons that you that you cook for a whole army.
And this whole neighborhood vicinity became like a like a like a military  I mean  hell.
There was a lot of people were dying from their side and we called to the...to the population not to enlist in the armies...in the German Army and to the Germans we put out leaflets they should desert from the army or should go in the ...in the...to the partisans.
So my mother wrote a letter to him  whether its better to leave me in this military school  high school in Palestine  or to go to civilian life.
The Soviet army had a reputation of raping its way westwards to Berlin.
The -- the army didnt want to be bothered with refugee problems.
It was an old dam no longer in use  but se rviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an Army 6-podL to get across with about 6 inches of play on each side.
When I came back to my army  I have a a friend of mine  very close friend in the army  in the artillery.
For three months I couldn't join the army until they cleared me.
But Warsaw was a occupied part of Poland by the Germans.
And there was prepared the so-called Second Brigade of the Czechoslovak army.
We belong  like I said before  to u -- underground army  and still from our people from [indecipherable] was all time suggestion.
So it a regular situation with the army  its wasnt that they were not very [indecipherable].
And the German soldiers heard that  you know  we spoke their language.
This may be the reason why he was not drafted earlier in the army.
It was quite obvious that we could not -- our army  or anybody else could have possibly stopped the Russians from coming in  but one should have dont it  at least a sort of symbolic someth ing -- resistance  you call it.
The soldiers were did were were they they mu st have been part of a military unit.
I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to e lementary school in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is  is hard to say  because at this point in the 1990's after living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish  I think  is so rusty that he didn't use it.
From Switzerland  we went through the border  you know  to Germany...back to Germany.
I enroll in the engli -- English classes through the Jewish social services  and then the army came  and my both -- both folks got sick  my mother and father  and they got the co -- help through the Red Cross  87 with the commitment that when I come up from service we will pay it back.
He was in the very high up in the Home Army.
And I went over there to the army and it was close to... I told you about Majdanek  remember?
>> Bill Benson: In 1941  then  that's when the Germans came in.
And then what happened finally...finally  the Russian army started advancing closer to...to Poland because the Americans helped them out with arms  with trucks because they were really in bad shape.
It was of -- I cannot describe it  but I was -- and I am  I guess  I -- I was a very good military wife  and I tried to do everything by the book.
>> Bill Benson: I was going to say  you left right before.
And so [indecipherable] I did get married to this girl   and he got permission right away  in the -- in the army  you had to get permission  becaus e -- not just for security  but they didnt want any bad elements to come into United States  girls who were prostitutes  or -- excuse me  or had other things   Communists  or something.
Not only that  but he was already in action and he had... he had a medal for his service in American army because he got in trouble somewhere in the...in the Trieste.
Even if I wrote my brothers  who were now as physicians in the army  sent me vitamins. \
That's what the United States was called as far as the Army overseas.
>> Michel Margosis: World War I. Well  I got acquainted with him later  when I was in the army.
And that's what they...some villages what they...German take for the army.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 >> Bill Benson: You would later  of course  go into the US Army and find yourself back in Europe.
Oh yes  it was a lot of tears  and well wishing  you see  because at the moment my brother-in-law  who was not in the army  yes  because he was already new married man  55 yes  husband of my sister  but anyway he had to go  yes?
ten years old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were assigned for slave labor with the army.
Landed in the morning there  and there you could see what a defeat of a big army mean t...hundreds and thousands of wea...weapons had been thrown away by the by the Germans.
And he paled  I could see the blood was running down his face and i mmediately he reaches out for the telephone  I assume to call the military police  an d I jumped through the window  it was a ground floor.
They called it \ work service\  but it was a real... such rough training  uh--what I mention later what incidents happened in that camp--just be prepared for the army.
it it...the whole  the whole atmosphere had changed when particularly when certainly was that you could f eel slowly also the military effect of the advances of the of the advance of the Allies in the east and the west.
He was also in the Home Army  and he was in the underscore in Italy.
On many occasions  you know  it was lot of occasions  where just like in the army  you know  just like in the army.
Since I mentioned that things were bad for the German army  and it seemed like they were losing the war and it was like toward the end  so at that time some Germans...civilians might have been a little kinder and maybe they helped some because of the fright of what may happen to them for what they did.
Treat you like a you are yeah o-or in the army no t in the army himself  in the toilets.
They were held up by the center  by the military people in Bordeaux.
the U.S. military  the Third Army moved up and took over Weimar and they came in to us.

This was during the Korean War  but this was a police action rather than a war so some of the provisions for citizenship didn't apply and I had to be in the United States for two years  for five years so in March of '53 I was discharged from the army and became a citizen.
They didn't take him into the army for one reason or the other  but they gave him a position as a doctor on th e merchant marine and here was was...got a position with the...I think it was the Blue Line in in in Manchester  in Liverpool...sorry...Liverpool.
How he got there  from Tusili in Bosnia  he ended up in the United States Army and was -- I think he got TB or whatever  he was demobilized.
Even they were the certain cooperating army from outside Germany  its like Ukrainian army  Hungarian army  Lithuanian army  Estonian army.
Uh...the...the people which were...my brothers were at the age of 17  18  or 19  they were dragged down to an army camp.
And a short time later  our group all joined the ru -- the Russian army.
There was a military  a Russian military  hospital train on the next track.
No  there wasnt that much [indecipherable]  occa -- in the military yes  there was more of an understanding than the civil service.
So thats an indication to you of what ki nd of men these were  these military government officers were.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 There was one German.
Yes  the Waffen SS  its sort of an oddity of German military organization  that they put the so-called Latvian legionnaires into the Waffen SS.
So in the months of July and Au gust we hired a staff  did the necessary work to collect all of those military and SS documents in the Pentagon  and then I went to my first love  which was to find th e I. G. Farben docume nts.
He was in the German army  and I think he was very proud to be there.
You graduated medical school  now be an intern in the hospital for a year  and then we will take you into the Army and we'll commission you as a medical officer.
And with American Army soldiers  most of whom were still wearing battle dress  their helmets on th eir heads  battle uniforms  thei r guns left in the lobby of the synagogue.
And the other one went back to Germany and there's me.
And -- and w -- at the liberation he was actually working for the American army  and -- as an interpreter  and he had a di -- uniform and a motorcycle  and -- and he was happy  I guess.
I was inducted into the army and had my basic training and then they saw I speak German  I guess.
Eight horses  40 men  thats whats marked on the cattle cars. [
Did you go to war -- did your parents and you go to Warsaw first -- Yes. --
And those camps were -- many people were expert in military affair  as well as Intelligence  as well as Morse code  and things like that.

Now my other uncle had run a communist army and went out and fought in the army and stayed in Russia.
But the French army... Was illegal  because the real army were at the service of the Germans.
How are they different -- or how do they fit into the military  not being a milita ry person at all?
And I was the only one that got the assignment to join Chuikovs army in the direction of Berlin.
But we   actually  got on very well with the military authorities.
We walked towards Gross Rosen which would have been approximately a hundred fifty or two hundred kilometers or a hundred fifty miles  but then in the mid...we were hardly out of town when we we re told we cannot use that road because uh for military reasons  so we went back into our camp and thought that would be it.
And he dressed in his army uniform and I said  well  I have to take you to headquarters to for them to decide whet her you are to become a prisoner of war  or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian.
So we had a dental clinic  which was equipped by the military.
He originated from somewhere in Galatia   had served during World War I in the Austrian army  and uh after the war  after Worl d War I  he had made his way to Berlin  had established some existence as a cobbler  had married  uh had a nice family  and with a so-called Polish ar...with a Polish accent  in September 1939 and he had be en taken a prisoner and and and was shifted from Buchenwald to Sa xonhausen  from Saxonhausen to Auschwitz  and so so he had  when I met him  already he had spent quite some years behind th e barbed wire.
They would go and train at night in the art of military fighting.
So I had a special set of orders  as to -- that I was a member of military intelligence  and was authorized to en ter German homes  and also authorized to interrogate  investigate whatever mission Id -- I decided on.
The following winter I think we made a tent  you know  like the army  I suppose  and that's what we slept.
Now  the other men were also -- were they also German Jewish immigrants with you?
So  they tried to push away all the people  until the last two or three weeks  th e Swiss Army was on the border.

Well  uh interestingly enough  in a number of French communities  small groups of Jews returned and the American Army Jewish ch aplains did an extraordinary piece of work in helping them.
Most of my friends were in the process of going to the military or being in the military.
Bill Benson: As I mentioned earlier  your father fought for Germany in the first world war.
We were getting a little more fed and a little orie nted where we were  what happened to us; and on April the 23rd  1945  the French Army liberated us.
You know  after I worked for the military government right away.
And meanwhile the labor office had decided that they couldnt put me in the army  but somehow it didnt seem right that an 18 year old should not be in uniform  and they had just the ideal job for me.
Interview with Dustin Dezube December 7  2000 19 It was sponsored by the sawha  which is the Israeli army  and I toured Israel with members of the army  and I participated in gonof for a couple weeks  which is boot camp  basically.
Now  my brother  when he was stationed as a military soldier in fact I think he was a lieutenant or a captain at that time in the army excuse me and he was stationed in Heidelberg  he did visit Trowta Noelting  the stepdaughter  and they did get together.
Thats -- I ha -- I have nothing respect for French army  absolutely.
First we were in Berlin  a nd then we moved out of Berlin on the airlift in 1948 so that was my first airplane ride in a military transport.
It's a pity that the army did not know that  you know.
And France declared that all men had to stay around and join the Army.
And the American army was really very helpful to the disp laced persons.
We used to even see them dropping with parachutes ... From the Red Army?
What were the Russian soldiers or Russian guards like to you in that village?
And uh  he takes me to the next office and he says--You see  this is a salvage depot were they bring all the material that is left and brought into Bali-- American army material.
Then later when I was in the -- in the Polish army  I was in the intelligence  and I had sp ecial -- you -- in a special unit  so for a certain time I had to be -- to have a German name  because we had to interduce -- to in -- interrogate German officers  but there is a long story in my book about it  so I had a friend  his name was Lazarus Spillman  so I made out documents that I am Lazarus Spillman.
But not a couple weeks later well  Polish there was a large Polish army in the west  in Italy  from those who Poles who were in Soviet Union   taken to Soviet Union   and when war break out  Stalin release them Right.
We were on equal  maybe a little  we were a little bit maybe more dedicated than the influx of Americans  the few Americans that came in and wanted to be officers running the Army.
I went to the railroad station to meet Judge Rifkin who was ar riving on the military train from Paris  and later I learned that when Ben Gurion came back  and I saw him again when he came back to Army headquarters in Frankfurt before he departed  he gave General Eisenhower  as the general had requested  a report on his findings.
But the the army wanted know exactly who they are  like like you are asking me now.
Thought the next morning  we must go to the -- find the am -- American whatever  military office and sort of report there and say who we are and just ask for protection.
The Danish police of course had to obey the Danish government  that's the usual attitude.
And I said God only would have known that about six  seven months later the Red Army would already come in.
And uh Lithuanian  Latvian and Estonian families of people who uh escaped uh from the advancing Russians  people who in large part were  I believe  were cooperating with the Germans and  of course  as I knew as I got to know some of them  some of them did serve in the German military in the Estonian divisions or Latvian divisions.
By then we were also getting not just people that we were training in interrogation  but we were also getting general officers and field grade officers from military divisions in the country and also some from units already overseas  who were brought back to get some special training in military intelligence  particul arly aerial photos and interrogation and -- and order of battle  German army organi zation  that sort of thing.
Oh  when I joi wh en I joined the army  my employer didnt want to let me go.
Could not remain in the army  but he became a famous lawyer  and after 40 years I found that he has a practice in Florida.
Mostly the military that -- that crossed  were put in camps  yeah.
Then  when we walked  w-we start talk  you know  said  I told  my father is invalid  yo u know  wounded he was wounded during he was in Austria army  he was wounded.
There was slavery  and they worked for the Germans  for the army  of course.
Did you know what was going on in Europe with the situation with the Jews  or what was happening at all during the war?
And they marched in a military  uh  rank of two toward me.
And the soldiers  they had  the army  had very high  they had the trucks  with very high wheels  so they give us  give us a ride in the city  through the whole flood  and they brought us  I had an address  and they brought us over where my brother lived  with a friend  in  in Hannover  by a German woman.
And we did a lot of things for the army  for the Romanian Army and for the German Army.
Later on I do  I mean  when we got to Germany and we got to the first DP camp  which was Poking  P-o-k-i-n-g.
When he was drafted  in -- in ‚44  he was in a -- in a casairner  this is a military establishment in Brandenborg.
I had two brothers what were in the  in the army.
To what extent did the Army turn a blind eye to what you and the Brichah were doing about maki ng sure that supplies got through  etc.?
And they said  \ No  look  is the stamp of the French Army.
They gave us cigarettes  you know...not cigarette...package of tobacco uh what I have never smoked and I bought it back to the camp so what they took it away and uh and we...the couple weeks uh  you know  they feed us good and the the German what belonged the farm  he don't like...he don't get along with the military what they have sent out with with us to take care of us.
You see  there were not too many Jewish -- Jews when they went to the Polish army.
That's what happened when we were surrounded by the German Army or Gestapo or SS  whatever.
So ou r rabbi had the secretary  a Jewish guy  a -- a sergeant or something  who was also main career in the army  and when I had the argument with the chaplain  door was open to the next offi ce  and there was the Jewish chaplain assistant sitting outside.
Mother and dad never talked too much about their experiences in Poland  except that I remember dad saying that we had to leave Poland because he would have been inducted in the army and he didnt want to be so he went to Brussels and my mother followed him then shortly afte r. Do you know their birth dates?
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: And so at some point  though  the Soviet Army came in 1944.
The Russian soldiers  wherever they were  when somebody wanted to come this way  the Russians said go back.
After that I had a very good buddy of mine in the Army  in the army you us ually get one friend who is more of an than anything else.
But meanwhile  the rule in the Army was that if you had a place to sleep  you could get a pass.
The Germans first took the dangerous people  who are people with Army  officers  you know?
And there  uh  he had to wait about three months  uh  [to] be transferred from the  uh  Vienna Army jail to Berlin.
It was Army of Krajowa (AK)and it was the communist the Army of KKR was against the communist and the Jews went with KKR.
Im not in the army  thats all  because he the colonel thought after everythings finished  he send me to a military school in Moscow  because his parents he was from Moscow.
We all had the feeling it's a matter of time because we were aware of the events  the the military events and uh the the second front had been established and the the Allied troops were already deep in France  so three of our uh uh our comrad es who were old-timers  who were already there for years  had come to the conclusion th at since you never know what would they let us...would they let us live to see the day of libera tion or not  had uh decided they want to try to escape  which was not an easy task because uh first of all so ma ny barbed wires around the camp but also uh you can never...could never be sure of the population uh around Auschwitz  whether they wanted to cooperate with th e Germans or not  but they said we'll risk our lives.
In other words  the hierarchy of the military had come in  and they learned about what happened and they were showing it to the general.
And I  I looked like a scarecrow in Army uniform and  and  and in fact  I  I  I  this is the uniform I took a picture  my passport picture in.
We got there  the order came out  these people are not to get any food or any big amount of water  and these army nurses came and they apologized for not giving us food  they said  \ You're going to die if you eat food now.
They took 72 young guys  and they took him to the barracks where the army was.
Interviewer: Because of the military action going by   nearby – Irving Ha ss: The military; y ou see  the military was already going .
And at that time uh I went back to Portenza  that big...big town where we came from  big town  that town where we came from and uh we uh...I sought uh employment and the Allies are a military government wh ich was at that time it was called AMGOT  Allied Military Government of Occupied Terr itories and was later changed to the Allied Control Commission.
German administration  the military admi nistration was changed to to civil German administration  although the lowe r echelons were Lithuanians  but was German.
So that was first used for a transit camp and then the military sort of made a demand to have that synagogue for  I think  storage of some sort or other.
That what w e had to deal with from then on  for some time  simply bec after finding out that we could leave th-the Russian free labor camps jurisdiction  then we could we still needed assistance  so the army units were op en  fed some of the civilians.
Afterwards [indecipherable] Red army was defeated very badly  and the moment even Polish army ended up to the Kiev  very far  far  deep into the Russia.
Tell me again so I understand...your father-i n-law was serving in the Romanian army... He was to bring the two daught ers  my wife and my sister-inlaw.
The military  they came and played bridge with us and they brought us Englis h cigarettes and the English cigarett es were parachuted in France.
Well  the training we got was a a-analysis of how the German army was structured; tactically  strategically  chains of command.
The whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from cannons and we used to load it on trucks to take away.
Had a private room  not not like military barracks  it we we Small place.
And the reason they were annihilated is we were supposed to  three divisions were supposed to jump and maintain the road open for the second British army to move through and across the line and liberate Holland.
A lot of people– they did have to put us in a camp.
| And from this time  as I went from the Army  it doesn't take too many times  you could hear that something will be done with the Jews.
And I was in the army in Israel [indecipherable] the Independence War.
Of course  then there -- we came to the Warsaw  first contact with the German.
But they kept us there for few more days and they told us to mine all the main roads and bridges  not to let the German army retreat so easy.
I dont remember  but I know we were told we had to go up there  so we got in big trucks and went along and were singing the army songs as we went up to pick them up.
I most certainly did not want to be -- to join the military  because this wa s the last year of the war  and the conditions were pretty grim.
And as you can see on that video  on this picture up there  I saw a couple of cars with police or military.
So instead of really speaking German the way I knew German  since I also li ved in Danzig  you may recall  I would kind of speak a broken [indecipherable] German  which helped me also to get some bread  you know  from the Germans or some food when I had my -- my paper as a vol -- as a future volunteer  you know  in German army.
Did they ask you about your experiences dur ing the war at some point  or did you tell... did they know anything about your history?
Maybe you know about this that there was 02:18: Sikorsrki Army.
I mean there wasn't any -- after the Polish Jews I still as a child thought well it's them but not me  they wouldn't do that to German Jews .
Rumanian -- I mean  Jewish people were in the Rumanian Army  and after that were expelled from the army.
And that was still when you were in the Soviet Union ?
And all thought was burning and machine guns and military going.
This where all the volunteers came and they met us in a...with a military band and the volunteers... Where did you go from Lublin?
And uh in very close contact with the Danish underground movement and with the uh so-called free-Danish army in the UK.
It was a military barracks where the people had to do their military exercises  you see  and you could almost watch that from every point.
You know  I mean  we kept getting more  but it was it was always the 35 hoarding  you know  carrying whatever you could in your pockets  you know  and and and when we finally got to the DP camp in Hallein   you know  it was originally run by the by the army  you U.S. Army  and they had the the gigantic kitchens  you know  and all the all the food that you could eat  you know  and That was the first time.
Thats happened during the war in Poland  organize and you know  and the top was mostly the officer -- army officer who was not killed  who was not in -- in a camp  and organize  and the other thing was very good prepare  you know  thats life.
Yeah  it was -- it -- I was in a barrack  and they were saying that the English army is approaching  and they -- we should not go to the gate too early  because we might be shot.

Well  so shortly after I made that determination  that I was I was ready  I I wanted army life  I was put a placed on an or a shipping order  to be shipped out.
And even in the midst of a battle zone we received uh letters from our relatives through military mail  even when he when his unit moved on  he would sometimes trudge through the whole night just to deliver us letters and maybe a little and get back to his unit.
There was a policeman  he was a secret member of the military groups.

You know  they were Russian prisoners and they shoot the heck out of them.
What we taught then was German army organization  which we knew nothi ng about.
And when the French Army came in Frei burg later  quite later  he looked for me and wanted me to help him go back to France.
17 Q. Did you -- how was your feeling that Willie was Austrian  I mean he was part of the German army and the German army was responsib le that you couldn't go to school  that you had to work.

It -- it -- it just is -- became -- was a bit of a shock that we had to leave military governme nt  one day to the other  but I think it was an extremely wise decision.
He was tall  handsome  with army boots and he was very much disturbed  his eyes were filled with tears.
So  instead of taking him to the military hospital which was the other side of the city  they took him to my father's ward.
And one that their chief was a British colonel  but they were all British army  and they were working with us  because they were going through the same documents and th e same background.

The military and the soldiers and the Germans and the Partisans were there.
And we knew they were there because right out from this town was a very large military camp  a big military base barracks where military were stationed.
Im I was a I have the Iron Cross  I was in the army.
Now  what happened was as the ships began to take passengers to the States  and we were using army transports  there were a lot of Jews in the first ship ship  one ship  two ships  about four ships  and the press in the United States  of course  ﬁOnly Jews are getting visas.ﬂ There were lots of anti-Semitic comments in the press  and Im sure if you look at the press at that time  youll find it was only because we were on the ball.
My mother learned from the grapevine that one of the key needs of the Germans  of the German Army  was for radio tubes.
Now another thing you mentioned earlier  your oldest brother he was drafted into the Hungarian army labor service.
Then I said to him  ﬁColonel  do you know your army regulations?ﬂ Yes  I do.
And so we stayed there for a few months and then the owners of the villas wanted to get their villas back  so they moved us to a place near Bari  a camp that was used -- it was a -- this was a Italian military camp before the war and during the war  the ge -- the Fascists kept their internees -- Jews from Germany and from Yugoslavia  were interned there.
So I had signed up for the army for the duration of the war  and why I did this  I put down in ink  in Europe.
Mrs. Duncan?ﬂ And my mother said  ﬁS hes not in.ﬂ And he said  ﬁOh  could you tell her  Im her nephew.ﬂ You know  also in the military  but in the army side  you know?
They made a deal with Monsignor Tiso to create a Slovak state  because they just had their hands full  and th-they wanted to draw on the military capability of Slovakia  which was quite considerable.

Before the ghetto was liquidated there was an organization  and the German Army  they made bridges and we came to this place and we had to repair the boats.

You have to do work for Zburov ka of Brno which actually was delivering some military equipment to Egypt.
And the third army had come in to the fight for about several weeks or almost a month or so before  and they were pushing out farther even ahead of us.
The Polish arm the Polish gove rnment told him  we gonna get you a farm for free  and we get you cows  things they took away from the German s  you know  from the and they would give it to the military b ack everything  you know.
After the war it was Polish Jews  and now its all Russian Jews.
But the in doing so  the losses were heavy  and with those losses building up  the army looked at programs like ASTP   and said  we have to abandon them  because we need ground troops overseas.
And so they would make some people honorary Aryans  but of course the flipside of the coin was that you were made to serve in the German army.
And we had the right wingers  the ‚revisionistim they were called  and they were singing revisionist songs and marching up and down in the military style of the revisionists.
I was in the forest  or better  in the Rudniky Forest  as partisan till July 1944  the 9th of July we heard the thunder of the big guns  the artillery  the Katusha of the Red Army  or the Soviet Army  so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or so  that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this area.
I went from village to village and I even put my name in on certain areas because I was afraid I was taken into the ARmy.
First time I was taken to the military mess  they get me vast pool of rice and r and raisins.
So  the army said  ﬁWere not going to give you permissi on to get married.ﬂ But they changed their mind later on  he got cleared  and I -- I married her.

What did your father do for a living once he left the army?
But then we were bombed with machine guns by the Germans because that whats army  I was laying in the trenches.
In 1923  he was trying to avoid the Polish army  he went to Berlin  and he worked in Berlin for four or five years  approximately  as a shoemake r. He was making fancy shoes there.
Originally he said we would live in De nver because he had such a good time there in the Army.
He also served in the Lithuanian army as an officer [in] training.
By -- when I -- when we moved to Wildeflecken  he tried to do the same thing  but he was overruled by Captain Jaigiss  who was a liaison officer with the American army.
No  it was a Polish Army garrison  which from what I guess  they wanted to bomb  but they probably missed.
In Austria we have to cross the border again to the area which belonged to the British Army  means Italy.
Now  the Czech Army  as many Armies  don't have various musical kind of things.
See  the Germans were much more refined  they never used the military for this purpose.
And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer as his displaced persons officer on his staff in Munich  which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army.
But  when the German army retreated  it -- it was no different than -- it was same as the Egyptian army retreated in the Negev  you remember in the Six Day War?
It was a military transport ship normally carrying something like 300 or 400 soldiers or military men.
But...we were trained as the army but without uh.. .uh... with out any... Weapons?
I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civi lians and military for the seized capital  they were saying th at he was going to burn the ghetto and and kill all the Jews.
And so he asked...uh...a friend of his who was a Freemason and a colonel in the army to speak with me.
He said he couldn't get a pass for us; but at midnight he will come with a few soldiers and he will put us on an Italian military train.
But she said  I don't want you to come to Israel  I don't want you to go to the Army  and God know what can happen with you  and I gave enough away ; don't go  stay and go to America.
No  no  no  you see the ar Czechoslovakian army in 1938 Sorry  he was with the Czechoslovakian army?
And somehow  a United Nations request to the other states was to reduce the military  the numbers in -- of the people in the military.
My father was in the army and he came back home so I was praying that my mother's going to come.
The early executions  of some of the com my communist friends  you know  that who were in the communist youth organization  fl ed together with the Soviet army when the Germans approached Panevžys.
At the ti me -- they were in the German Army.
The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in  but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.
Father was counting that maybe one day the army  Russian army will come cl oser  and the Germans will run away.
There were some people there who were members of the home army.
Because the army requires you  as an Orthodox rabbi  to conduct most of your service in English  and thats why you lost the congregation here  and there are about 200 Jews here  and you walk in here on a Friday night  you get a dozen people USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 141 here  you dont get anybody.
Me and other boy  we had a Polish army  and there was another boy by the name Mojzesz was the German Army.
You know what -- what kind of service your father performed  or where he was -- My -- I -- I -- I think my fathers younger brother was in an infantry regiment.
The reason a lot of the farmers cooperated with the partisans was because the German Army confiscated whatever cattle  whatever they needed for meat from the farmers.
Secondly  the second mistake is much worse  it says that when I went to art school in London after my military service  I wanted to get into the Central School of Art and Design   because I had heard that it will because it was so anti-Semitic that it was hard to get in.
And there in our regiment we had also many officers from Slovaki  from the Slovak army.
By that time the Germans had rolled up whatever was left of the French army  horse and buggy types.
I was afraid that they were 30 going to -- I was with them really  it was called at that time   a Polish Army  but I didn't want to go to Warsaw and I was afraid they were really mobiling young kids to go to Warsaw.
So what -- I had my first experience with the army.
At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction of the military government.
So  we were told also we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate Wilno because Wilno was very close to us about 20 miles or so.
I realized what it was after I was in Germany and after I had seen enough of the activity that led to uh the early moveme nt of labor camp people into army men and from boy scouts into young soldiers a nd from ordinary men uh with ordinary credentials  carrying shovels  dressed in regular clothes but carrying shovels ready to clean out as soon as the American athl etes left  ready to clean out what they could from there to get it ready for the army.
Did you when you were in the cattle car  and you started talking to people  do you remember anything about any of those people  what kind of people they were  whether they were all military families  or some professions  or No  theyre they were a congregation of all kinds of people.
My parents so  then  we had the American visa  but my father didnt have the permission from the army to leave yet  nor did he have an exit visa for Yugoslavia  an exit permit from Yugoslavia.
And then my husband -- of course we were not together  we traveled on a military boat  so the men were separate  and the women were separate  and because I had a small baby  I was privileged to have a cabin with another woma n  separate  private.
13 Anti-Nazi military partisans  associated with other groups in the French Resistance.
Now  that was family situation and there were all where they were stationed were old German Army barracks.
And in case they decided to hang onto the empire  they needed military support  ideally from the local population  hopefully.
8 It's not r elevant  but the Soviet government had a pact with the Polish government in exile  and they tried to form an Army to fight the Germans  but that's part of the history and I don't want to bore you with that.
Finally  the husband  who was an officer of the Hungarian army  was in Russia  was all over the German army because we were allies.
He came with some food that he got from his army unit.
A camp -- a camp that they put you to work.
So they uh...we stayed in two hunting camps  small little enclosures  and all day long without food after crossing the Alps and at at night the trucks came again from British army trucks 21 with officers in this already uniforms and they have ID papers for all of us with new names.
He actually was from South Africa  but he was in British army.
A division with mi -- the army diverted to clean -- to -- to clean out thei r -- their trads -- their groups.
Well  hearing th at  I was glad that I had a chance to get out of the army and I grabbed it and I was discharged on my birthday from the army.
You know rumors  like in American army rumors or any place where a lot of people  rumors.
We find out -- we found out that he was somehow protected by the military establishment  defense.
Of course with the German control  there was some Germans with them.
I was a 4-F  but I -- I was born with a -- a -- a heart abnormality  which disqualified me for military service  but I still felt it was an event I wanted to observe first hand and I heard about the American field service  which sent ambulance drivers  as it had done in World War One  to Italy and to the first French army  which was then not yet back actually into France.
For the rabbis it was not paid for by the army  but its just some time off they got that -- seeing the holy land.
You know when the -- they already made  how to say  when you going in  you had to open up a piece of wood lik e in the military to open up  to go in.
The uh reason was that the Germans had lost on account of Stalingrad a lot of manpower  had uh uh inducted into the army also skilled labor  so they we re short of labor  and obviously were interested to to now somehow in our in our skill  if you want to.
The morale of the German Army began to be sure once we entered German proper  began to deteriorate rapidly.
After I enlisted in Orleans and I guess we were educated in military manners in Orleans  then we were shipped to the Maginot Line.
But the army was really practically 99 percent in a chaos  didn't know what they are doing.
But it never did come to that So after  after a year in Italy we were all evacuated from It aly to Great Britain since we were part of the 8th British Army.
The Russian Army is advancing and they should be here within weeks probably  and with this they left.
For one thing  as I mentioned last night  we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared  so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence.
Given  you know  given my military government experience of working  again  with the military.
What happened  one Sunday morning we hear bombs and the Russian army starts to run away  and next morning the German army came in to town.
It's hard for me to explain what..uh...they lose  Germans they lose in the war  and Russian army come...uh...come back to Ukraine.
So some of the supplies were coming from the army. . .
And my father said well its true the Germans certainly wont hurt women and children because after all his memories  like most Polish Jews.
As the connection  he came to me every day 12 o'clock past lunch time and I used to give him...uh... uh...what...what the army was wearing.
So the tricky was for me and few other my frie nd of mine  hiding and stay as long as possible in the camp because the American 3r d Army was so close already.
You were in college how many years before you went to the army.
I found that out when we got to Ravensbruek and we stayed in line to go into the bath house and she asked me while we 8 Armia Krajowa [Home Army] (Polish).
So we went there and we told them  they took us by truck there to the little town  it was about 10 miles away  and on Friday services  it was a British chaplain  a Jewish rabbi from the British army in uniform.
I mentioned we liberated Dachau and one of the gruesome experiences was when I was suppose to interrogate a Brigadier General who claimed that he was transferred against his wishes to the   the army  instead of . . .

I just went to -- as I told you  I wa s not very pleased with the military so for about 15  20 years I had no contact with any -- you're free to look at the book.
And were you -- But I -- we were asked -- one reason I later didnt keep a diary in Italy is we were asked not to describe where we are and what we we re doing  so -- because of military -- Right  right. --
At first  I -- after completing my military service  I enrolled in the Haifa Technion  thinking as a majority of my friends did  that only a real trade will  will do in Israel and especially in my case  observing the tragedy of the readjustment of my father when you have a profession that relies on the language.
In the meanwhile while we are in that military train  I already in between time stopped off in Minsk because I knew already that I was curious for me to see what's Minsk.
Then later on in the Slovak  they even the people Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7  1997 28did realize  it was like  in the beginning like secret  but then they started to bring back injured or dead soldie rs  then the Slovak people started to know that the actually the Slovak army is in the war against the Poland and Russian.
He also had a military scholarship  but he didnt take advantage of it.
And then What was it like for you to wear an Israeli army uniform?
I remember he was in Polish uniform with the with the rank of lieutenant  I think.
Anyway  so Ruberchinsky went to the United States and I decided I would come to Canada because -- I ll be honest about that  some of the American presence had become so militaristic that I got to be concerned a bit about the message of true democracy on the one hand  which I lovingly em braced  and the military regime perpetuating itself because of the feeling of universal power .
For example  all during the '30s  Farben produced 90 % of the gun powder  and certa inly during the war they produced 95% of the explosives that were used by th e German army.
So our first reaction was to talk to that elderly couple that I just mentioned  and their son -- he was a first lieute nant in the German army  was actually home during that week  on furlough.
Thats wherever I am  I found my obligation to be honest and I could avoid serving in the Polish Army which wasnt easy.
Thanks to the the Jewish Brigade which was a brigade within the 8th English army.
So  so my work there in military government was  was highly respected.

The the Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be do ne because the roads are already fortunately not the Red Army that occupied them already.
They were both in t he Army and they were both taken prisoner of war by the Germans  when the Germans attacked.
Anyhow  so then I was a student at the University of Munich  and somehow in -- in 48 I saw an appeal from the prosecutors at the -- one of the Nuremberg Trials of the German hi gh command  asking for witnesses from the Baltic countries who could testify against the comman der in chief of the army group north  Field Marshall Vonlabe.
He says  he got when he was in the army  you know  the Russians they took the Polish citizen  they made a army from them  you know.
They thought that fall might come any minute  and I remember my mother was afraid  because my father was an officer in th e army  that he might be one of the first to go back to the service.
However  Heimann pleaded and obtained for the right that they should not be put in a prison with Germans  they should not be put in a prison with American soldiers in the stockade  they should be put in some separate place where the Army can have a few guards and watch over them.
And the Russian military people came in  and they saw him  and they saw him being wounded  and they said  well  well well send you a doctor.
There was a General Giding  who was the head of the greatest slave work site  the building of a military airport .
Well  in camp  the rumors were going around  and you know I was there  the war goes on  and all of a sudden we heard that the Russians are mo -- the Russian front is moving down  and how we knew that its really getting close  one Sunday  when the coal mines werent -- the coal mines were working  bu t in our free time  they take us out to dig ditches  for the army to  you know  to dig in.

He lived and he was in a concentration camp and he  then  what was the other one?
My interpreter was also Jewish  he was -- he was a German Jewish refugee who was in the Army.
Did the Army have any mechanism for the soldiers to talk out their experiences of what they saw No.
The biggest surprise  a year later after my sister and I went back  is that he came back on a Soviet Army military train.
BB] Well  I must have done because I had my six weeks leave and I had to report back to a camp at Haywards Heath and there they had to bring us up to date on drillings and such and they had young lads there who had been in the army for six months telling us all how to fire a bren gun and how to dismantle a bren gun and  of course  we werent interested  we knew how to do it  wed done it enough times before but we did it but we didnt do it fast enough or at least thats what the young NCOs said  mumbles  I remember one time when we had to through all hand grenades into a big net and I threw all mine in  six in  and okay the bloke after me  caught the edge and fell out.
For instance  the course la sted two months  and during that time you learned or-order battle and German army  all the th ings that I mentioned.
I was a little worried about USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 32the fact that the United States army might interfere.
The the lets see  where we became part of General Pattons Third Army  and we were in the combat command A  and we went to we we went to Rechrival  Belgium .
So I've seen the Russians going  and a lot of Jews did  runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers  everybody going east.
Was your brother concerned about being taken in the army at this point?
In France  during the war  he went to the army  to the French army.

Then this the head from the army gave us their place  was a lager  Halline.
Talk about her being in the -- the womens organizati on  the girls organization -- Oh  she was in -- I -- I thought this was automatically in th e bundeutshameet and in the Nazi time  not only that -- because when the Nazi came  these two girls were living on their own  their father was somewhere in -- in the army  they got a -- from -- from the court.
He said to me there was a chance to escape and join the underground  Polish Army  in the forest.
He was with the third army  80th infantry division  317 th headquarters company.
Ill be I will have him  and and he was very happy that its a little boy  and so and my brother was always trained for the army  because my father was so proud of his boys.
I mean  that was after all the  the things th at we went through  there was a real Jewish holiday which was celebrated.
All of a sudden the Germans were the army against the Jews.
They took my mother  they took my older brother and my father was not well since he got out from the army  he went to a committee and they said he cannot work.
Not so much with the family  but other friends of mine and relatives who were in the army  we discussed it among ourselves over and over again.
A ripple went through all of Europe  and of course it reached Germany and it reached Army Headquarters.
And so you wouldnt know what concentration camp he was in.
Of course  if the military were approaching  of course  we had to step down.
The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in  but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.
V-E day  I -- we were still -- I was not military government yet.
We were living at that time on the outskirts of the city  uh  mostly Christian population  we didnt know exactly what was going on because by the time we got news from our local radio it was almost noon  and the rumors were that the Red army was already in East Prussia  what means in the German territories.
And I guess the Ar my authorities in charge  they had the Army medical corps men working there  and in any case there were so many jobs to be done because what we were really doing was creating a new -- creating a hosp ital as we went along -- Um-hmm. --
After the Russians came  did you tr go back to the house where you grew up?
The British army didnt want me because I was a German.
Anything that moved -- that involved transportation had to do through the army.
They were ethnic Germans  and he was an an SS officer.
When I worked at the military bakery I would bring home flour every day in my thermos  fill it up with flour.
Y -- military units going to the front  and military units retrea ting from the front.
Polish Army didn't last too long  Within less than two weeks  or three weeks.
My uh...then I found out of course about my uh older brother who was in Yugoslavia  in in Serbia  with the Mihajlovic army  that he was killed the year before  uh May 8th  1944  yeah...he died.
And before you know it  there were soldiers surrounding us with rifles  literally their finger on the trigger.

And in this household you first joined the underground  and then at age 13  you were accepted into the underground army?
She he came to the Russian... He...he took us to the Russian Army and he... Over there  I came and I asked...I knew one word of Russian. .
Well  in -- there was a -- the army initiated the services that were every Friday night and so on  so forth.
The British were there  th-th-th -- so there was a military government  but there was no pa ssport of any sort  so you couldnt go anywhere  it was totally out of the question.
There wasn't  right right after the war there was nothing and we maked  we got th rough the army  we got the contact with somebody with a big spools wi th yarn.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 25 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Germany or every occupied country  had on the front page a report from the front.
In June of '46  which is towards the end of my stay  with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the infiltrees  don't give any incidentally  I wasn 't the only camp director or staff protesting these things.
We didn't know at this time that  for instance  Jewish leaders were stormi ng the chancellories in London and in Washington uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't kno w that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL  saying that uh uh the uh governments have to co ncentrate on the completi on of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording  that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners  the Nazis could become more vindi. ..
As you know  in Israel was the Haganah  then I was a soldier in the Haganah  and thats all.
That was it  and after th at  a few days later we saw the Army coming.
I was a little older than a child then  and I came home and didn't think much but  you know  was something such a terrible thing and I remember them Polish soldiers before they're walking back from the front and carrying those heavy backpacks and our army  the Polish army  wasn't at all motorized with a horse and wagon  and they were already surprised because the German army surprised them  went ahead faster than they can run.
And I said what I am doing  I am here and buying fruit with this and this guy  and they are buying this [indecipherable] for the for muıt and for [indecipherable] for the Slovakian  the German army.
Seen the whole army there  you know  and then  when [indecipherable] they took over the Ukrainian part too.
For them there was something bigger so and so on and from the communists army this was terrible.
But they had sold them to the Americans and this was now an American military operation.
We didn't know -- >> Bill Benson: Were the Germans really gone ?
And Burkhardt confirms to him that his reports are very si milar  that he has confirmation from two German diplomats  the one from a member of the staff of the German foreign office  the other  a representative of the military establishment.
They were obliged for five years  but once the army took over  then its the Red Cross duty.
The ambulance took me to the hospital  which I understand at that time was the military hospital in Istanbul.
You couldn't be shaking like this all the time  waiting for them to come for you...It's nothi ng  it  I don't think that it's a life that anyone  anyone who has lived in a country that has never been occupied  and has never been under the boots of a  of an enemy army can understand.
Because anyway I'll be...I'll have to go to...to... to the army.
And this was our first introduction to the German army Then the next day  I beli eve  we saw that there was no use to hang around.
The English army liberated him in Bergen-Belsen and he was together with his only brother whose name was Joseph  Eliyahu in Hebrew but in Hungarian he was Gyuszi  and everybody called him in this name.
They sent to us some people...among them were 2 officers of the Czechoslavakia army  one adult and one Jelo .
Were n when were you in shape did the army ever ask you the details of what had happened to you when you got missing when you went missing?
The French have an expression.... Dirty foreigner  and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs  but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the south when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a ship  I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a compartment  a railroad compartment.
And -- and then a few other things  I don -- I-I forgot what it was  anyway  was a knapsack just full with 145 food and -- and by that time also  the army had taken over traffic control and at each major intersection  there were transporta tion officers directing traffic of course  what there was was the traffic was all military by that tim e. Military trucks and -- and j eeps and this sort of thing.
And even  I thought  I mean  even even Napoleon  whe really a reasonable military leader  he did things  and I thought well  Biržai will be also in history like Jaffa  you know  some cruelty which happens during th e war  you know  without any reason  something well  what do you mean  I m ean Jews were hiding weapons.
He heard that there was people there and he was still in the Army and thats when he came over.
And expected me to  I was expected to write home in the army  after the war  regularly  often.
That was in 19 twent well  the Wars of Independence were completed in 1920  and and he was discharged from the army in 1922 because the army was reduced  the war was over.
Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 129 He was safe  and he joined the army and then left Russia early.
I mean  they drove that Mercedes as fast as it could be driven and of course theyre the only vehicles you saw on the Autobahn were military vehicles.
You went back to Poland   then went back to Germany .
There are sabotages and there are what we call the illegal army  illegal newspapers and I'm sure many women worked in the newspapers.
I became -- my husband beca me a lieutenant I don't know  and my girlfriend some kind of ranking German official  and we deci ded to go as prisoners of war to the American Army.
My father again thought it would be like World War I and that in the Flanders  the Belgian Army and the English and the French would hold on as they did in World War I. >> Bill Benson: Stop the German advance.
However  once I met my husband and we were ma rried  I was able to become an American citizen because my husband was in the American army during the war  and I became a citizen within the first year of our marriage  and I w ould not change that for anything in the world.
So I was standing and my late husban d didn't look like a Jew  he looked like a tall  skinny  light complexioned  and the Germans  the military came to me and asked me something.
In September there was a rebellion inside the German Army  the German occupation troops.
Those that were deported or ran with the Russian Army whether the Germans attacked  about 80% -- about 90% survived.
When we were in Jelene we had food like the military  normal food.
Some of them were  these were mostly army barracks and so when we were in  in the camp  this particular camp was near Munich.
But we heard from s -- some people -- I mentioned the name Ruth Lindheimer in Halberstadt  the girl I went to school with  she was in England also with the kindertransport  but her father was in New York  and he was in the American army  he served in the war.
Iasi was already better organized and the war itself was covered in the newspapers and the German army would drive through every day  every week  with more enforcement at night  we would hear them rumble by.
I was in uniform  I was a sergeant of the US Army  and shes asked me three questions before becoming a citizen.
In 1920 my father fought as a -- as a soldier  again -- Polish soldier against the Communist Red army.
And then when the Americans marched in  I think it was April the 12th  my father went to see the commanding o fficer  told him about me and they came with the military ambulance  and took me to a German hospital which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company  and I was with them  ooh  for quite some time.
Army Material Command  which was the headquarters -- again  as an accountant.
So from there--at some point we were near--there --well  we were attached--by this time we were attached to the Third Army  to Patton's Third Army  and we were somewhere near where Patton was  and I don't really know where that was  and it couldn't have been very far from the--Buchenwald  the concentration camp Buchenwald.
Doing military plans when they they were doing their  you know  their exercises  I had to to to document where theyre going to be  and what time  and what units and all that kind of stuff.
And then...and then I went...I was in the Polish army and uh they took us...we...you know  the Russian army already was...the Germans were loosing the war already you know.
When I got called up  my mother -- my mother sort of said  ﬁYeah  thats that German instinct ﬂ you know  got to go back into the military again.
Counter Intelligence Corp of the United States Army  and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which was part of the 3rd Army  Patton's.
And it was -- I remember it was night when he came in  and h -- I couldnt recognize him  because he was so dirty  and he was unshaved  with this army uniform  the long coat.
But when the trains came  what we saw  these were cattle cars.
I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day  I got acquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in civilian clothes.
Since it was a garrison town or they had military b arracks  the Nazi's occupied the military barracks and they took Jewish details there to work.
I took a group of friends of mine  went into the main highway where the German army was surrendering to the Russians.
But it was the Russian army that was chasing the German Army.
The other one also joined the army as a matter of fact  so they were real.
Her husband was an American veteran and  eventu ally  the Army brought us to the States .
He uh  like many Germans  he was not a military man.
And w hat the British did  is that they took over the German Army camp  and they turned it into a DP camp .
And it became the Germans in 1917 they had a lot of educated peop le in the army and they decided to stay in Lithuanian to teach us  and then we had enough people to get a private school going.
25 What was it like for you as a Jewish boy in the Polish army?
>> Bill Benson: They were told you need to leave here.
Then es-established this themselves in France  and they started building up Polish military  because there were a lot of people that were escaping.
Well  number one  I went in the army  for various reasons  to give something back to this country  as a civil service employee  in the army now  in the army  also as a volunteer.
She ran away: So the youngest sister -- she with a friend went with the Russian Army back to the Soviet Union to look for my sister.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 That left my mother and her two children to take care of everything that had to be done  to leave a home and move somewhere else.
We remained on our side and the people on the other side  there was still the army holding the gun.
And the other way  Etka survived because she was a chef for the German army and they didnt know that she is Jewish.
What it was  it was slave labor on the Army jurisdiction but they wore civilian clothes.
They had in mind that I would be used in the army of occupation  being either interrogator or being intelligence.

And now the German Army was disintegrating  so that they would disappear and pull back as much as 50 miles in... And  uh  then set up lines.

END OF TAPE 4
These were eventually assembled in a big warehouse in Wiesbaden in the custody of the United States Army  and they in turn turned it over to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of which I was the director.
Well  this was a mixture at that time between non-Jewish soldiers  and Jewish soldiers because in the  in the Polish military  in the army so to speak were Jews and non Jews alike.
We still saw some tanks  some military cars going  you know  on the road  but not ma the mass  which was before  you know  during the night.
I figured I can pick up on my education  and th e army is going to pay for it.
And of course now we were seeing army uniforms and -- and -- and the allied soldiers who were headquartered wherever they were  and -- and the soldiers were -- were walking the streets and my girlfriend and I had a little tiny pad each  because there was still not stuff in the stores  they were still ba sically shuttered.
Like  he was a military  and if he we if he got a friend who was from Chzanow too  but he was in the Russian army  he was a decorate Russian army  he used to have a medal from Lenin.

The Army shouldn't have done what it did  put me in that position.
And I tried to do my best  so I replied  be cause I took some lessons in German and I could speak at that time  German.
Normally we used to have powder eggs  the army powder eggs.
It was not until April of 41 that Germany declare war  and -- an-and -- and inva ded  and the reason principally is that in Yugoslavia  the then regent had  not necessa rily allied himself with Germany  but had signed a non-aggression pact with Germany  but then there was a revolution  or a coup by young officers in the Yugoslavian army  and they expelled the regent  and elevated the young then King Peter  who was a minor  to become king  and overturned the arrangement with Germany  which infuriated Hitler  and in -- in a lightning campaign that lasted  I think  about three and a half to four weeks  all of Yugoslavia and Greece were overrun.
But  unfortunately  for us the first Germans were good Germans  so- called.
And this German soldier was behind where my father and his colleagues were.
They gave a wide -- well  they gave me a high category  officer in the army alone  that the same thing  had went to college  or you become a -- a teacher  you have to have a certain intelligence  and they told me they going to give me a high rating in Social Security  but in that case  if I want a higher -- rating high er income  I have to pay them anyswhere between 20 and 40 000 dollar  whatever I ch oose of categories.

My br the one classmate whos left was was in conscripted in the army  was sent to Russia   was became a prisoner of war for two years  or three years  he was in a Russian the worst possible condition Ru-Russian prison camp  and he survived  and ultimately he came back.
They came out of the train  and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where they came from  but...uh...it was several of us...MPs  military police....and when they saw the Star of David  there was one of the most things I ever experienced in my life.
And there were American Army chaplin's assigned to divisions and Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 11 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Tuesday afternoon  the city was occupied by the German army already.
ﬂ He told my grandfather t his isn't the same Army that was here during the First World War.
In January of 1943 there was a catastrophic event for both the German Army and the Hungarian Army  particularly when the Germans lost Stalingrad and the Soviets had a counteroffensive and part of the front -line troops were Hungarian  and the Soviets just rolled over them.
Somehow -- the allies  when they were preparing for D -Day  they were trying to convince the German Army that the invasion would take place in the Straits of Dover  the shortest distance between Britain and France  about 25 miles  35 kilometers  so they were bombarding there.
And f rom ju June to September  and September he was left the army  and in December we married.
Was born in 1843  and I suspect that he was fighting in this 60 in 1860s in this one of these crazy insurrections  where the Polish-Lithuanian area a gentry actually arose against the tsarist  you know  with pistols and sabers against the Russian army.
And I would say some o -- some -- our young didnt have their chance even to serve in the army because you had to be 21 years old.
Sooner or later  we'll have to be prepared  officially if the Army is no longer in existence at least underground is active.
I remember in the army it was the other  other way.
But they were also blowing up bridges  and shooting German soldie rs  and with the Vietnam experience fresh  and the parallel often drawn by our own attorneys  some of whom had served in Vietnam  and certainly drawn by judges who had handled civil cases involving problems dealing with Vietnam  this was obviously an issue that we were nt going to able to win a case  even if the Communist happened to be a Jew  and the -- and the Communis t Jew blew up a bridge  that an army occupying a country  unfortunately it has the right to kill people who are blowing up bridges.
In 1933 th ey left the rest of the family  my grandparents and left Litic and they immigrated to America where some of their boys already had gotten  became very American patriotic  you know they served  the boys  in the second World War  the army  the navy and so on.
So  we di dnt know that the Russian were -- at -- Russians will enter so soon.
We were supposed to put it on the roofs of barracks where they were storing a lot of things  military supplies to go into the eastern front.
They we re sent out to sweatshops where they made the uniforms so the military could get dressed.
But we were there and I think it was May 1940  that's when the German Army came into Paris.
She was a  an Israeli army officer  born to Hungarian parents who s poke perfect Hungarian and this was her job  to distract.
So we walked down the road  and suddenly a German patrol came up.
And he would have fought for the Austrian army of course?
Now  wed already had  to a degree wed had some military training at in high school we had some  w-we had wed had some at Kansas  KU  at Lawrence.
Yes  I had this -- there was a Hungarian laborer in the kitchen at the -- at the -- at the army headquarters and he would lend me his -- his I.D. [indecipherable] car -- I.D. card and [indecipherable] MPs didnt faze me.
You know what I mean  that the war seemed to be going bad for the Germans at this point  or was that not evident?
And then the second reason was that our army was not trained for that.
And those people who came there  the Russian military  not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating.
Anyway  which is not far from Feldifing  which is a series of small buildings with rooms and bathrooms and whatnot  which the -- the Germans had used for  I think army people and the -- there were Polish officers  or members -- Poles  who had somehow taken control of that and were living there.
There were two brothers  the nephews of the chief of staff of the German -- Germ an army  whose name wa s Walter von Brauchitsch.
My eyes filled up with tears  and I looked at him  and the minute I looked with him -- at him  so I imagined w -- how would we be if he would come to Poland for a visit when I was in the military?
She was just going around the streets and scr eaming  and they must have shot her because she never came back  and here I was with Mom  myself  and then Ruzia was at that time  and Zigmund was already in the Russian Army and wh en the Russians were moving away when the Germans came  they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to have the German people come.
Were there an unusually large number of collaborators  that is people who joined the German army or fought with the Germans on the eastern front?
The question is really the role of Danes and their resistance to the Germans and whether or not -- how many Jews they were able to protect or save.
My son  who is in the military is coming to visit us  and please  for heavens sake  dont say anything against the Soviet government  b ecause hes going to report you  and hes Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 47going to report us  and all of us are going to be taken away.
And then he worked he was in the army  and then he was so he did not farm.
This was not being soldiers because Jews were not given guns or any kind of military training.
Was  was in April  about the 15th of April  yeah  we started to see the where they had been marched ahead of us because  uh  in because of the nature of the spear-heading  the 11th Armored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap  this is the 11th Armored Division  and I was in the 56th Engineers  and that's this little insignia right here which is our uniform insignia.
Early '44 the quisling army  the two divisions that fight for the for the  uh  Slovak quisling government  uh  makes a deal with the London government [ NB: the Czechoslovak government in exile] and the idea is that when the time comes to  uh  for the Russians to cross over the Carpathian mount ains  uh  that government will come in  the Slovak army will attack the Germans in the mountain pa sses from the rear  hold ground until the army can come over and uh that's how it would be.
When they went forwards towards Russia  everything was so perfect  it was the best army.
I don't say that the American Army isn't  but I'm sure it's more visible as the way the Russians were.
You know a lot of people came from all kind liber ation camps and they put them in..in that camp.
And its amazing what people can go th go through and survive and still have so those cousins of mine came to me  and the first thing Julian took them to the army to the to the shoemaker to have them make some shoes for them.
And the French Army and the English Army were unable to fight them  first because the government was unbelievably bad.
But you deal only with army member s  or air force  or navy.
And then the Army was demobilized   and then my parents had to make a decision as to what they were going to do.
I didn't see them in 1939  because when the war started my father was called into th e army and like the result of all that propaganda and all this they mobilized a million people  but they were not ready for it.
How long had it been since you were un der Nazi occupation  cause you just said you were with the Czech army.

Em  most of them elderly people  since most of the younger people were in the Army.
We stayed all time with the apartment of my aunt and her husband and her daughter which was 10 years older at this time and also their daughter-in-law because the son  my cousin was in the army  an officer in the army.
But my father arranged for my cousin  who was in the British army  to come back to Poland  and to put us in touch with the Jewish agency.
And after the war he went into the Ru ssian army  when the army -- Russian army freed the people in the camp  and then even visited us in Romania.
We pleaded with the  uh  Italian military police  the Carabinieri  to give us back our documents  such as they were  so the Ustaıa would not see that we are being pushed back as Jews.
He was a officer in the Soviet Army  and ...to work with us.
He was from od  yeah  but he served in the Polish army in the war with Pilsudski.
We go to the station  and I am accused because of my shaved head  I'm accused of being a deserter from the Polish Army.
We knew only this side  the east  the Russian  the Russian army.
We were  in the Czech army  I have to say  it was a moment of a wonderful feeling  to not be less than a louse  as we were in the concentr ation camp where they had power over us and we had nothing.
We heard  first of all before the state came  they called to the Army.
See  now they have those nice military homes where they can go for reading a paper  and play piano  and do card games  there was nothing.
Yes  I was teaching a regular American hi gh school  where The American Army and the American diplomats kids would go.
>> Susan Taube: Also  he was a World War I veteran  from World War I   fighting for the German Army.
One wa s already -- one was already a soldier in the Polish army.
And sometimes they took them to work  you know  to make the uniforms for the Germans.
And they they march with their red flag  they march toward police  I didnt follow them  and I f later find out that the Lithuanian military officer in Panev žys telephoned the Soviet forces  whichever the commander was in Panevžys  and asks whether  you know   thats supposed whats what should happen  because they were trying to to disperse the police  you know  and take the po lice headquarters in Panev žys .
And a lot of Polish military came ove r  and refugees generally refugees  not military refugees from Poland came to Lithuania  and they found quite quite a bit of understanding and sympathy then  you know.
Interview with Eli Dortort August 3  2005 45 Because I deserted the Polish army  and I didnt want them they find me  and then they still have the English army  so I didnt want to have this name  because I was a deserter at this time.

People have been transferre d into this new camp which it was an old army barracks  the Panther   the Panther School of the Germans  but I advise you try to make your way to a building there where you'll find uh uh peopl e who are trying to organize some some some committees.
I might have mentioned the nonfraternization policy that the Army had  with good reason it turned out.
Well  we went  we [were] inducted in the Army  in the Armed Forces  in 1942  uh  late in '42  in November  and we maneuvered in Louisiana and Texas for approximately a year  uh  a little over a year  and  uh  we  uh  then went to Texas and the plains of dry  plains of Texas near Abilene  at Camp Barkley and then we went to the desert to get desert training at Patton's desert training center  which is now a national monument.
One is that he was a World War I hero  a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army  and he was exempt from Jewish law.
They -- the Holocaust and the atrocities as-assoc iated with the Nazi regime was not part of the military.
Hot Springs  Arkansas was the spa for polio people  and the army  navy had a big general hospital there and they went -- I went there for 30 days to take the bath and it cured me of the arthritis.
I did do an audio oral history for the Army War College at Carlisle  which took me through  of course  my experiences in World War II and my early experience and subsequent  but there was no concentration on this type of atrocity thing  although it was mentioned but not as much as we have done today.
And the other men went into the Army t o fight.
And I also remember that the American army put me in a room  I'm sure they did it with ot hers also and I was interviewed and I remember a soldier sitting there and typing  typing for hours and hours to interview me.
Yeah  but what you saw  you know  everything down there  it was military trucks  what Persians were driving them.
And finally he managed to call his superior  they came in and it happened that that village was having the night exercises with a password  military.
And usually  I dont know how mu ch he o -- he charged  but being that my husband was military  and an officer  a young officer -- I mean  a junior officer  he charged us only 10 dollars to see our son.
And so that day  that big day came  when tanks  and military machines  and guns  and unbelievable attack on every house.
You see  we never knew from one day into another (phone rings) that our life would be ending  whether they're going to take us out to be shot  whether they going to use for target practice  whether they going to somebody over one  and  they take us into an army  or they want to uh  want us to join the French Foreign Legion  which we didn't want  they tried  we didn't want it.
Well  first of all  you know  once we were under the protection of of the military  we began to be fed.
Now they agreed on this; and that actually persuaded the military to come in.
It was via the Grossbart family and my brother getting out of the army.
So we were with the army for about I think about ten or 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] Kaunas and to liberate it.
As the Polish soldier back up  there was so many weapons and happened in the woods I find a beautiful new rifle  Army rifle  and I bring it home and I hide the rifle in a barn  in a haystack and that time if you're hiding any weapons...the posters was all over  you know...that means death sentence.
And we went to the Czech army  and my sister said  \ So beautiful two people  they take away.
There were some more  like my uncles and aunts that went to Russia.
And then somebody came and said to us  \ Ach  the Germans are gone.
So I left a note over there in the Jewish community center that I'm in the army - twenty kilometers from Warsaw .
And so it was a very good combinations between the two big parts  contra parts of one big organization with that they should have one roof in a certain place it was called  in a certain time it was called the MTC it means Military Technical Commission.
That I wouldnt I dont think so  becau se my father was just living off of the military pay  and it wasnt that much.
You had to take a can from the conserves  from the army what they all was over there  the barracks.
After a while   they took my father away from the family.
So I liked having had the experience in the military in Austria.
So so thats thats why that land wa s for the government to give to those that were fighting for freedom  and and thats how my father got as a reward for being in the army  and How much land did he get?
Uh I communicated with uh the uh Joint Distribution Committee in New York  through military 6 channels  and I was cabled from the JDC but th rough the Jewish Welfare Board which was the only organization set up to deal with American Army Jewish chaplains.
And I found out  sure enough  theres a organization called Arma Kryova  the army of the land.
We came  we test them out  we tried them out  we had some people  our men knew how to use those firearms  they were serving the polish army before the war.
Of course with the German control  there was some Germans with them.
So  I was not 21 yet  but I was on three weeks paid leave  but still in the military.
Uh the medics were there in in great numbers and and again with the military government colonel also and uh I uh I drove into that factory and uh and I saw this courtyard and the and there were some what I I can only describe them as as living skeletons walking around  going about certain chores such as getting water uh in the courtyard and over in a doorway I I saw another young woman sort of leaning against the doorway and and she seemed to be in slightly better condition than than the rest that I had just seen and I walked over to her and addressed her in I think both in English and in German  and uh because I assumed of course that she spoke German uh and uh which she confirmed  and I uh I wanted to see  of course  where the rest of of her companions were  and I asked her about them and she just motioned me in and I ...uh we went inside and uh that was of course a scene of devastation that nobody who has ever seen it will will ever forget.
It was a former military eh Ger eh military eh eh barracks.
There were five Jewish guys  and Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 26there were three Ukrainians  and we all stuck together  we were we were the best of friends  all the time  because we were from Poland and from Ukraine  so were from that region  and in American army.
So we lived that way for awhile and then my husband got his education degree and he got a job in New Mexico in a place called Alimagordo and teaching history in high school and it was a strange thing because he had been stationed there when he was in the army air corps  training on a missile base there.
And then the  the inmates caught one of the officers who was at that camp about a week la ter I guess  and they turned him over to the military authority and one guard they caught an d they spread eagled him and stoned him to death  on the ground  so he must have been a...mus t have been a very bad man of some sort.
Here  we get informed that the military are going to leave; and the SS men  SS is coming to take us over.
And then when they went back to Wichita he  he joined the ser vice  he went in first in the Army Air Corps and then in the Marines  he kept enlisting  just so that  you know  he just wanted to do something for his country and he wanted to get away from this  you know  memory of this father  you know  he didn't want t o deal with it.
The defeat and disarray -- the ray -- the way a -- on that front -- on -- on the Russian front  the army.
And I made the argument that those who are entitled are scattered everywhere and we couldn't give the assets to a small self-proclaimed group who were not subject to any kinds of controls  which we were of course as a charitable organization of the Military Government in th e first place  under control of all the world's Jewish organization in the second place.
In Airfert we  we switched clothes  we took off our stripes and striped jacket and so forth  we got into military clothes.
We knew that the Germans were running away but we heard footsteps directly above us and we recognized by their marching  by their walking  that these were Germans.
I went to high school in a suburb of Pittsburgh  and from there I went to Lehigh University in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania where I majored in metallurgy and had a minor in English and journalism  and also you might say a minor in military.
The army Was she the only woman or Interview with George Pisik July 14  1993 5 The only woman wa were there large numbers the only woman I had spoken to  that I had any contact with.
And I came back to the train station and I couldn't get a civilian train  but it was a military train  showing them documents that I was working for the KGB  and I had to go to Minsk.
Half military uniform  I have half civilian  a very bad impression.
There were no dollars in those days  the army used to pay them in special papers.
To put it in historical perspective  there's a record of the Jews being in Slovakia together with the Roman Army well before the time that the Slovak tribes cam e to Slovakia.
Well  thats when I joined the army  and I my mother and I had a ken consultation.
I have spoken to Rotaries  and like I say  Ive spoken to the military.
I was asked to run the conference on war at the University of Wisconsin  shortly after Hitler came to power  and we gathered leaders  including people from military academies and professors from both Wisconsin and other universities  some USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 16 ministers  like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred W. Swan and others and they made talks and there was questions by the students and there were some demonstrations about how important the whole thing was  by some of the students.
They said  for goodness sake how can he be...t hey didn't certainly know which location it was because it was a military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war.
They took us on a cattle train... a lot of cars - a hundred cars over there - a cattle train.
The British army sent us to -- I was in Italy.
After the war  the situation was marvelous  everybody was happy and very fond of the army and the generals and about the whole government.

I was promoted to major general as I assumed Chief of the Army Reserve at the beginning of May  rather  in May of 1971  and so I'm now a major general of the United States Army  retired.
>> In learning a lot about Polish history or during this time  there's a lot that I have read about that Pols would look for opportunities to take from the Jews  wouldn't always help out the Jews  maybe were glad to see the Jews go.
I live in Tel Aviv about '44 to '52  eight years in Tel Aviv  and then I -- my father  he goes to have a farm  a Rickacher farm  and then I go to the Army.
Most of my uncles were taken to the Russian Army  conscripted to the Russian Army.
I was glad  glad to be part of the US Army.
The Russian military sent some officers to help to organize the partisans into a fighting group.
And he paid me in marks just like the same marks that we got paid from the Army.
My mother my father was in the army  called in August that he should come for to serve in the reserves  but then well  he was a second lieutenant  being a teacher and a musician.
Not all ga -- people who worked in the Gestapo were collaborating with the Gestapo.
It subseque ntly developed that this assistant was active in the Jewish Army of Resistance.
our river  divided War-Warsaw  and on other side of Warsaw  after r-r-river  army of Russia came and stop.
Uh  Hagana  who was the army of Israel  when Israel was not a state yet  was active in  in Europe under the name of Brehot.
Only Jews were taken for the Munkasa  for the working force  but if you were a Gentile you could go to the army.
I came here I was a little bit disappointed to find all this and even now  even within last week when I see among our own ranks in the military  prejudice  white supremacist  Nazi   but to me  America at that time was the country where I thought I could live my life and my children as Jews  free.
He had himself b een a captain  but he was demoted to captain after World War two  because they made many peopl e officers  and after World War two -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 67 Excuse me -- -- it was common that a lot of officers  who made more money being officers in the army than civilian life  wanted to stay in the army as a career  but they couldnt use everybody on staff  there was too many people.
They served primarily for the Romanian Army all their dairy products and for the community of the same area.
My father was called on the f -- on the -- at the army  on the [indecipherable] from the -- when war began -- began.
Each block  of course surrounded by barbed wire and a ditch and a gate with a ga -- military guard standing there or whatever.

I dont -- I wanted to be a hospital nurse and at that time they were -- the army nurses were on the hospital shifts.
He had a factory that made mica for  I don't know whet her they were used in guns or some kind of armor  for the German army.
The same Ukrainians what...you understand the   and the Bulbas  this what what they were killers are here in the army with me together  and I knew that I would be shot every minute in the back.
It was special because I know there was there was an easy chair where you could sit down uh  almost in luxury  and there was a couch  not these military beds or so.
And I dont know how they came to the decision  but they decide -- my moth -- my father was mobilized  he was going to the army.
The Russian Army liberated us on the 5th of August 1944.
Hiruia is the written...uh...document to be qualified as a Rabbi in   and from Umgra   I studied there up to the point where I was drafted into the Czech army.
So I got a position in the engineer section at 7th Army Headquarters in Stuttgart and pretty soon I was chief draftsman.
Which is a  a compilation of all the names of all the books in that final  and it was printed by the United States army.
He was in the U.S. Army therefore he couldnt become a citizen.
They were mostly women and children  boys of 14 who had been in the army  who had lost limbs.
Well  again  I was going to school an d I had to break the school and I was drafted into the service  in the army.
And when that happened  when the area was then liberated  what did you do?
And they wouldn't let me  so I went... 24 But you did join the army?
Except now they are they are not 14 - 17  they were they were  you know  ready to go into the military.
And then  some units from military gestapo came to the camp  never used to come on that day  and we thought somebody maybe...slipped out  but they left  and the next day exact ly  the plan was  at 4 o clock should start  everybody has to kill his  his SS man  and his guard  at his place of work.
Armia Krajowa [indecipherable] underground army was very big  but [indecipherable] where I was smaller.
11 No  the school closed as soon as the Italians attacked  because almost everybody went to the army  were drafted.
They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds  so I decided to join the army and get that out of my out of my life here.
Uh we were  my dad was paid the equivalent of a salary while in the army simply so that the family could be supported.
I do -- yeah  I guess they used to give us the little  you know  like army things  yeah.
And then in 1947  I went overseas to drive an ambulance in the French army.
He was one of the very early educat ed  university educated  uh  young people so he immediately in the First World War got a comm ission in the Austro-Hungarian Army.
No  but he became as soon as he joined the army  almost immediately.
I told him I heard that in the Soviet Union we have  has to be a Czechoslovak army  but I didn't know it until yet  if it is true  I know that our army is in the Middle East  in Palestina  and then near to Tobrouk.
He became officer in the Lithuanian military school  and had a very distinguished career in Lith uanian army  in the war with Poland.
My parents  my father fought World War I in the Austrian Army.
For two years in the army  I was assigned to black troops.
So he was providing wood to the -- that Army and he was happy to do that.
Because the daughter  because the daughter of the oldest sister of my mother  she managed to get--to smuggle out with her daught er  to get from Belgium to the occupied area and from the occupied area to the non-occupied and because of that cousin of mine  Michael  who was in the army  everybody knew  had followed him.
And they marched dozens of kilometers  crossing over the whole German Army  with the big beards -- seven  eight Jews with the big beards.
So the the enthusiasm was was k-kind of muted at that point  and there was a meeting  you know  and i-it was muted  until really the Soviets Soviets kept Vilnius for a couple of weeks yet  and they were r-really plundering the ke the city during that tim e  and eventually the Lithuanian army took over Vilnius.
And Did you and your the soldiers who were with you  did you discuss this in the following days?
So it was  you know -- but after the deportations  then of course  the -- the Wehrmacht  the 22 German army was met by Lithuanians with flowers.
When the theater chaplain learned of what I had done  that I had not at the end of thirty days seen to it that Chaplain Klossner should be ordered to another military unit elsewhere  threatened to have me court martialed uh but fortunately I talked my way out of it.
The German minorities and they already started  you know  uh sort of uh secretively first uh German sympathizers and uh talking loud and proud  you know  about the Germany and Hitler and you started feeling a certain extent already uh but uh even then it wasn't too bad  but of course when the war broke out...let's see...in '39...I would say...let's s ee...in '39...then in '41 it was not too bad in in my town  but when in '41 the Hungarian army came in and occupied uh the territory...there was northern part of Yugoslavia where I lived...Voivodina  and uh then uh of course when they came in they started uh...we were  as I...well...as I said I was half-Jew  right.
The third category  War Crimes  that was a cinch: the Hague Agreements of 1899 had defined what's permissible in warfare  what 's not  any violation and devastation beyond the needs of military necessity  rape  plunder  poison gas -- things of that kind -- these were well established crimes  they presented no problem .
And my friends in the army said they never saw such big anim als with such good food.
They believed that  yes  the Maginot line was very strong  that the French engineers were building the best tanks  and building the best airplane  and the French Army was invincible.
>> Fred Kahn: I don't know this very well because my father had a friend in Belgian Army near the border and he called 5:30 in the morning on May 10 to say the Germans just crossed the border.
In 1914 or 15  he enlisted in a Polish military unit which was conscripted eventually and served as part of the German army.
Unclear simultaneous speakers) We were actually no  we were actually attached to the first French Army.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about that  just to make sure everybody understands  the hiding place was actually -- to the outside world and to the Nazis  it was a factory producing uniforms for the German Army  but  in fact  it was a hiding place.
I saw a documentary on Patton the other day  a couple of weeks ago  in which Eisenhower comes to his office in Germany to give him the bad news  that because of various comments he had made  you know Patton had organized an S.S. military unit after the war  which was unbelievable.
Through the P.A. system I remember hearing how the glorious Soviet Army was retreating.
But this was most of the Polish army was destroyed there  the officers.
And then they were very nice to me  because they th ey then tha joined the Polish army  so we reconnected with everybody in Teheran   and of course they I was small  and ti And everybody liked you.
Somebody  I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already  they said within a few hours the Russian army is going to be here.
12 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD And they did the same thing.
We were seeing that the presence of the army was less  and there was apparent quiet  but the rumor m ill and the fears  the -- the -- the sense that  you know  we have no -- no -- no protection whatever  you can -- absolutely -- are absolutely at the mercy of anything anybody wanted to do.
And at the same time  they promulgated a law that all these people from this and this year  they are going to be they are going to be from 1924  1925  1926  they are going to be taken to the army to the regular army.
And right away  right after  the bombing and shooting and disarray  within an hour or two the Russian army moved in and they were liberated.
And -- What -- what -- how did you feel about be ing in -- being in Germany again after the war  and doing this work for the American army?
>> Manny Mandel: We were upgraded from cattle cars to military transport cars.
And these peop le in the military government  they were  in my eyes not good soldiers.
This -- standing up is my father  Moishe Szlinge r in the Polish army before the war.
What happened to him afterwards Well  he became a Red Army officer.
>> Bill Benson: To move to the war itself  you saw the Germans soon after they invaded.
no -- go ahead -- those -- no -- since it was an army camp before  and it was good as an army camp  the commandanters  or the comman ders  and all this sort had si -- elegant 43 homes  and thats where they eventually put the children.
I mean  we were normal normal boys  you know  thrown into army lif e  and he was very militaristic  and he got on their nerves.
Oh  Jews have been in Trencin  you kno w  I mean for -- the records go back to about the 11th century  because you see  Trencin was always a military town  it was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 35a base.
They were in t he American Army and they knew more so about armies than we did.
As you mentioned before  I was drafted during the Korean War.
Well  I was -- I was in the infantry -- Yes. --
My uncle who returned from the Russian Army  he was the only one that survived due to the fact that he was threaten to the Russian Ar my  was the physician for that whole ar ea.
No...nobody...now that we are together  you know...so I said no  I want to join the army.
Me  my sister  and a brother of mine came back from the military.
there was a time when my father was drafted to the army  and we decided  the whole family decided to move to Ioannina.
But the hospital itself was a veterans kind of hospital  a military hospital on the island  away from the camp.
I didn't just-- in the army and we went away from them   went to Krakow.
He was a soldier for four years for the German Army.
Did you experience any anti -Semitism when you were young before the war?
The German Army conquered Paris four weeks after the war started.
But then again it was a problem with the army and I didnt want to leave my mother alone.
Sent me there and I went through a course of intelligence  army intelligence.
And mostly people  their husbands were in -- in the army  in the SS  and then -- they all were welcome  so we told them all those things  that they -- why should th ey have the priority  and after this  all the [indecipherable]  it ended  then the people from the camps  they thanked us  that we made out that she is it -- they changed the whole law  and then we came to America.
And that's how I came to enter Buchenwald I think a day or half  a day or two days after it was liberated by  if my memory's correct  the American 3rd Army  I think.
Now since...we we didn't know a ll the details but we knew that the American army had penetrated Germany uh uh deeply and that the Russians uh had had uh at least uh reached the uh the uh River  so the questi on again came up  what's going to happen and since we didn't know by whom wo uld...we thought that the the Na zis now had enough of us and what would either kill us or or l eave us alone  but no.

I...to proceed with this story  I met with a...a German General who was the military representative in the city to protest...uh...the fact that...uh...Jews were being taken from the international ghetto to the common ghetto.
Now  the military authorities knew about it  and they would launch raids on the camps to grab these people in the act.
We came out from the woods where German soldiers  they were retreating.
Now shortly after that General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of the 15th Army  with headquarters at Bad Nauheim .
Of course it affected me  and it affected any other person who  any other survivor  whether you were a survivor of a concentration camp or of a ghetto or a partisan or a soldier in an army.
No one came there  none of the American army who freed this territory didn't know we existed.
They were obey -- they 18 obeyed commands  because they were treating each other still like in the army.
The chief of police in our litt le town took it upon himself not to send anybody to the concentration camp that had been an offi cer in the German army.
Because he did indeed go into the army and became an interpreter and stayed in Germany after the war had finished to help with the -- with translations for the Nuremberg Trials.
It was almo st as hard to get out of Germany as it was to get into Germany because the American Army had forms and you had to fill them out  and a pregnant wife caused problems.
And those who had people in the age you could be taken to the Army  they run away to Poland.
I was always like in a scout and this was in my mind  it will be like the army.
And that if you didnt want to be an enlisted man and wanted to do more with your career in the Service– I guess my bigger decision was that I was  I did have the option after coming out of Duke as a chemistry major  of going to work in the Military as being in something that was more science-related back then  working  using my chemistry degree.
He met every once in awhile with some general  but he was unconnected with the American Army and nobody realized it.
And so  because they they couldnt have enough equipment  you know  so the so the British and the Americans started supplying them with with the military equipment.
Anyway  when I was sent home there  in th e middle of December  that was the end of my military career.
On Marine Marlin  which was an army transporter  used to transport the army back and forth.
In the army  of course  Im making 90 dollars a month.
And then they sent a young  about 450 young men to Terezin to prepare the camp you know to make bunks and the kitchen had to be because it was a  it was a military time and so they prepared it and then the first transport to Terezin went in December 41.
And -- and he was very good in math  so he told me -- I asked him what was your job there in -- in the Polish army.
Before I went to the court  I sat for some time in a very small  hot flat  without air conditioning  to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick  smelly  kind of wooly  wool material  army mate rial hood.
Then he got promoted to major  and then every officer w ho wants to stay in the army  ma-make the career today  must have a Masters degree in one field or another.
Uh  we ha d uh  uh in our group also a man  an elderly man  whom I had befriended; he had come from Poland in his younger years after service in the Austrian army  had made his way to Berlin  he was a shoema ker  and uh  he had built a nice family in Berlin  children  and he was stretching out his life  his  his existence  but then he was taken in September  1939 with a so-called Polish accent  and had been in a couple of the concentration camps-Sachsenhausen then Dachau and Buchenwald  and when I met him  he  I met him in Auschwitz.
And the speaking went on and it was clear that the German guy who also escaped from the military wants to hide there and wanted to come up.
There were many  many people who came into the army and didn't know how to read and write.
And uh we butted uh a uh a court yard where we lived where the veterans of the Lithuanian army and their families lived and they were throwing rocks at us and at one point uh I uh was hit by a brick in my head uh from kids on the other Video Tape No.
In my case  I had an unusual life experience  the military life  and I had a ga an interesting Jewish experience  too  because my family  my mother was rigid about it.
So my first boots that I wore after the war was some small soldier's boots.
And the German army was retreating in the forest past our train.
I came in as an enlisted man  I became a sergeant  then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able to go to Officer's Candidate School and becam e an officer and make the Army a career for twenty years.
So when the principal told us that there would be no school that day  and they didnt know if there was going to be school the next day  I ran home crying  asking my moth er if my father was going to be the -- in the war  if he was going to be in the army.
Was there an announcement that the Romanian army is going to -- Yes  there was an announcement  yes  yes  yeah  yeah  there was a big announcement  very dramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall Antonescu  was broadcast all over when it 37 happened  on the radio  on the  you know  public speakers and so on  everybody heard it  and the war started  the -- before that  the town was al ready full of military  it was obvious to everybody  imminent that something will start sooner or later because the city of Iasi was at 19 kilometers  which is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia  which by now was Russia already.
And these people was already like me  sent to mili -- ni -- to military unit where we -- for we prepare the -- our border with Germany  1939  for three months  fo r free.
But he said if I dont go to army  the people will kill me because he was one man in the village and he could not do the same.
So these were these people  who were organized who had munitions  but they were against a German army with planes with all kinds of bombs  and they tried to stake an uprising.
Im a little surprised that Polish officers would have been allowed you know  would have been cooperating with with Germans  unless they were Polish police  for example Poli who were working for because the military was it was No  these were Polish construction workers.
Just a few months after Henry's arrival in New York in 1946 he was drafted into the U.S. Army.
And  I agreed to it immediately  and at night we're a group of five  six people from the Home Army  Underground don't forget the basements were connected to each house next to each other.
Where you live?ﬂ Oh  here in Arizona  I retired  so and so  and wa -- I was in a 97 division of Third Army  General George Patton.
What was the first thing you said to the American soldiers when they liberated you?
So the most of my memories are from   which was a a n ew suburb  mainly used by the government and military elite.
So when he came on the height of my position  I was just in the center of the whole line  and about four or five feet away to from me  I stepped forwards in a like military way.
And then the Army went to England  and my father continued to work as a doctor  and everybody had families.
But then the military government moved in right after we left  and I guess they took care of them.
Plus I had an opportunity to use my talent  my God-given talents that I had in the best way and advance my own career was in the military inst ead of the civilian life.
But we got them and we were changed over as Russian soldiers.
So you see  character in character  military action  and other military action  you have to recognize that there is a killing which is say  so-called legal by the military norms  but in this case  this is just a simple crime.
Were these Hungarians  or No  once we crossed we went  we crossed the from ha from Hungary   that was the Austrian army.
He joined the US Army and fought in France and Germany during World War II.
Gentiles  again  the war  the army eventually  everybody who was fifteen  fourteen  fifteen  sixteen at the end of th e war  the last few months  the Arrow Cross people  they forced children out into the street with a gun.
He was -- this was -- no maybe -- that was just about -- before he went to the army  right.
See  my brothe r was in the ar in the American army  and Oh  he had come over a long time before.
5 -- when we were liberated  because we were in the forests and the Russian army advance -- it could have been 44  I may be -- it -- it -- it probably would have been 44  passed the Russian army as it advanced westward -- Okay. --
And you would go overseas and be assigned to a division  or -- or a regiment  or even an army group  or an ar my  as interrogator and when those units advanced and took prisoners  the IPW team in terrogated them.
And all I can remember is that at one point all of us were picked up by a British ship military ship.
Myself and my father we was all the time home  army and we support  we hire you know all paper for print or stuff like this and we give money for underground organizati on.
And after that  its part of my internship  my internship and residency at State University  Kings County Medical Center  then went on to the University of Rochester  then Johns Hopkins  and then finally did my military service in Washington  D.C. at Andrews Air Force base.
So  the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27  2010 5German army.
And we did not realize that within six  seven months  the army will be here.
On the train...I shaved on the in the railroad stations and I living and sleeping on the train  back and forth every day seeing her in the hospital  and uh then finally when she was released from the hospital I got another job on the railroad tracks with through somebody th at I met  and in August of 1944 we were liberated by the Russian army in a town...because already at that time as you know  Russia and Germany were in at war  so liberated by the Russian army  and then uh in 1946...in 1945 '45 we escaped from Poland into the German zo...into the American zone in Germany in a Russian ambulance.
My brother raised his hand  but he meant to send me and so I worked as a volunteer on hard  or forced labor in a military hospital  formerly a Jewish hospital  but at this time they took it over.
After all  the -- within six days the German army occupied the whole Poland.
So he said if you'll give me...if you will be kind of enough to give me the the name of the places wher e I can move because he said there are nineteen German tanks are trying to cross to to close the way for the Red Army and are going to break in  so he said come exact on the on the German tanks  and could you give me...show the map  your maps  so I'll know which way to go.
So then we ended up in North Africa  we were ferried to -- we were transported in trucks  military convoys to the Sahara Desert .
The -- the Italian milita ry of all  air force  navy  mari  everybody  army.
They normally  I think  might have said  well we have no business doing that and turned it over to the Army  but he was convicted and somehow ended up in Lansburg Prison.
But what ha ppened in between  except that thing the our military  Lithuanian military officer telephoning the Soviets  that I was told about that  but I dont know exactly how it went  yeah.
And then the Germans came  and the Russians came  and it was back and forth.
The clo -- the clothing were  I think was American -- American army clothing.
What that meant...the Prut was the border with Soviet Union between Moldavia and Bessarabia which was taken by the Russians in 1940 in an agreement with the Germans and now Antonescu ordered the Romanian army to cross the Prut to liberate Bessarabia  and the atmosphere was very  very nationalistic.
Yeah  oh  they was already in the occupy from the army where after the war.
Then it was belonged to Poland  but the Russian invaded this part of the country  of Polish country.
So they bombed th e camp  they bombed  they bombed the factory  there were some among the  the .
In since he was not in fighting army at that time  fi fighting air force  air force was under the British command.
You know  what a difference between an army and a retreat.
Whoever was in the army came  and we were all there.
This went on  then the Russian army came into Lodz  I remember the Cossacks when they 2 came in.
Their luck it was that the military front moved far away ve ry fast from Hui  so they they weren't anymore in this jurisdiction of the military court.
Well  I can tell you that that's Polish Underground  Armia Krajowa  or Home Army.
Can you describe any encounters that you had in Jewe with local authorities  with gendarmery  the army  with soldiers?
They even used armored cars  in a fake exercise  military exercise; and they did it at first on their own and spontaneously  without informing too much their very high authorities.
How we got away with it I dont know but we had our own military police  thats why.
So -- and my mom  lets say she got like a privileges because she was a wife for a person who fight for -- in the army  so for that it was better dont deal with it.
Yes  but they took us away  you know  so most probably next day the Russians were there  they -- they occupied that place.
We were  in a -- in a way the army of occupation.
Uh I uh I had the  my my ambition was uh to become a journalist  and one of my uh officers in Military Intelligence had been uh Sheppard Stone who was on the staff of the New York Times.
He -- when World War One broke out  he was a -- drafted into the German army.
My brother was by that time in military intelligence in South America.
Now  the way he got out of Russia was because Stalin wanted to cooperate with Roosevelt and Churchill by sending some people to the Army  for the boots on the ground because they were losing to Hitler.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 13 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: the direction of the IXth Fort  a group of hundred people was shot.
And your -- your two older brothers  were they brought into the army in 39  or later?
What other physical problems did you have once they you were there with the army?
So when we came to a place in whi in White Russia   when we met when we went out from the woods  we had a a garmonika playing music   we knew we we met we met in the Russian army soon.
Everyone of them as a matter of fact  including the military with the one sole exception.
And then we heard the Russian language  and there was the Russian army and the soldiers were telling us that they took over the area.
Were you in  during those years after the war  a-after you came to the U.S.  were you in touch with people who stayed?
The Army already had these records  we were all ready  we had the prisoners  we had to do something with them.
I -- I threatened the army that Im going to resign my commi -- ﬁYou cannot stop me from marrying her.
That was the happy moment in the life of being in the American Army.
My m-my younger brother  he was in the army  1939  and he escaped to Romania   and he was  you know  in Hungary   and after  I think he went to England .
We had a military (laughter) wedding because I was at that time.
I was one of the la st ones  because apparently  I found out  I was investigated and then I left and went to see the relatives I had  stayed a few  went to a kibbutz for a little while  then when I was ready for it when I met with Eliahu Golub and he told me  ﬁYou should join the army  we want people trained for later on for the Haganah.ﬂ36 What were your first impression s of Palestine?
Only this kind of people were  you know  were lucky if you knew somebody or the people who were directed to the Russian army and went on the front or went to the Russian uh  you know  uh uh  you know  working brigades.
>> Bill Benson: I wish we had a lot more time.
And I was one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home again and I was working back again in the job.
They c they took us not only the oh   my older two of my older brother was in what they call a army labor camp.
I remember one of the military doctors  because there was a few doctors around trying to do whatever theyre going to do and I heard one saying  I cant let this one die because he is my challenge and he revived me.
Not us  from the brigade  where we were had all our papers and army books and so forth  but mostly those who came from the Soviet Union .
At that time  there used to be the youth  used to be paramilitar y. Jews were in the army  but as the laws changed  Jews could not be anymore in the army.
By this time we were Interview with Richard Peterson April 6  1999 66in Pattons third army  transferred.
The military take -- takes the taxes out of your pay right away.
And I said if you consider six years of active service in the army and parachute troops qualifying me as a pencil-pusher  I'll have it your way  yeah.
They were part of the Polish contingent  a part of the 8 ROUGH DRAFT COPY NOT A VERBATIM RECORD British Army.
Our is Russia...Russian...uh...Russian...uh ....uh...the opposite the Russian regime in communism  the new army be considered fascist.
Fortunately the same day there was a train load of volunteers to the Polish army.
And so when he would come home in his military uniform  with his white belt  I mean  this was not just my brother; this was somebody to look up to.
Then in March was it February February  March  that the the the one Saturday morning  the negotiations stopped  and the German army marched into Austria  and Austria became part of the German Reich.
I 2 enlisted in the army in September of 1942 and was discharged in the summer  I think it was in August of 1946.
This identification is consistent with U. S. military records  which indicate that Muhldorf was in the zone assigned to the 99th Infantry Division and affiliated units (i.e.  14th Cavalry Group/Armored and the 86th Infantry Division).
It was too old picture for him--he was in the army then.
>> Bill Benson: Before we talk about that  you remember him leaving.
In the meantime my brother came  but things were so bad in Israel 01:36: that he knew that I would have to wait a long time to get into Israel because there were just too many people and the British were not willing to do it  so pretty soon I got a visa to come to the States and I came on a military small boat  Marina Fletcher and I have the telegram that was sent to me and I hope the Museum can have them  or wants them.
And when I wa s in the military  that was the first time where I have any– and growing up in this country  yeah  thinking back on it.
You know  in -- in older days  you proved your loyalty by USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 62 joining the military in a uniform or going to fight for your adopted country.
When my sister Edy got demarked from the British Army and came over  once she had a job  Bertle had a job  they got an apartment.
Did you experience any  sort of blatant anti-Semitism after the war?
So I focused on research  I didnt return to my army da ys or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II.
Well  uh they didn't know that I was Jewish  you know.
And it was a wa y of life  thats the way -- just like his father was a military man  and there were no questions  thats they way it was.
And again  what were your thoughts when you would see German soldiers?
Why was there a German Army unit stationed so closely at the Croatians' mutiny?
He just recently spoke with cadets from our four military Academies who are now on their way to visit Auschwitz.
And this is what I said  and I was the last speaker  not expected maybe  to speak at all  and when we get it first at th e house  with the congressmen  and it was  at that place  it was the military commander the -- from the Jewish war veterans of the state of Illinois.
We were in the army  I told you [indecipherable] there  watching those prisoners.
Then my father wrote me that he's coming back from the army.
There were some -- I mean there was some movement  at that time already  before Russians came in in 1940  there were some movement to teach Jewish people to be a military people  because they already were thinking then about Palestine.
They actually it started out as a personal body guard of Hitler  but then the SA was pushed aside and the SS became the dominant military and civil force in Germany.
I know that books about Patton and the movie about Patton showed that he was ordered out of the Third Army because  supposedly he slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily for malingering???
They really thought that we are an organized  you know  42nd battalion of the third army.
Do you want to say anything else a bout your experience in the army?
Or -- Or the -- the SS commando was -- was bombed or something like that  you know  like you -- like you read today in the -- in the paper  about Israel  that they blow up a -- a Jewish army post  or whatever it is.
If the person was actually a member of the Wehrmacht  it means of any one of the three branches  army  navy or air force  the person had to have a Militarpass  military pass  with picture  iden tifying the unit  etcetera  etcetera.
What Roosevelt had done was he created this large army specialized training program and took the flower of the youth [indecipherable] the kids that were intelligent and knew everythi ng that was going on   and under those Interview with John Bucur August 18  2003 25circumstances he suddenly says  well Im goi ng to close that up and then send them overseas.
Particularly because they saw I had been  I served in the army and all this.
When they – when they marched into our town with the – with the Hungarian army Š with horses; with all kind of tanks Š all kind of cannons  vehicles.
I think  looking back  the courses that we had  there was a real awareness of maybe boning up on your mathematics and so forth  that kind of thing basically because you might have military.
He was in the army but there was no war yet.
He was a soldier  I dont know  I couldnt tell you.
You know  our street was called Shishinska  which means uh  like uh  Czechoslovakia  which was the street which led to the Czech border  and people were walking up that street  and my mother said something like  \ Oh my God  I hope they are not... \  and at this point that motorcycle came down the street  was an incredible roar  came down the street  and was two German military in them  and uh  the thing which I remember most vividly  my brother had his wristwatch in his pocket  and he was just removing it from his pocket  and so  his hand must have trembled because his watch fell to the floor  and I remember seeing  it  it was 9:10 in the morning  and I was sort of thinking that something that  that was the moment when  when our world was gone.
As the uh  when we uh  in May  just a month or so after uh  the war was over and troops were put in as uh  as uh  well for military government and uh  I for instance was assigned a little town uh  by the name of Wimbleberg   uh  and I was in effect the military governor of that.
I'm curious about what else the Russian said  what was that scene  like when the Russian soldier gonged the be ll.
That first it  it wasnt even  the war hadnt even ended yet  so a military trucks were going east and they were going west and they were going south.
The Committee rounded up a number of lawyers who knew the German law and made them temporary colonels in the U.S. Army  and they worked on particular cases.
So that's where the switch came from Air Force to Army?
My cousin came and put us in touch with a Jewish agency.
Because most of my friends are from the Army and none of them are Jewish.
And he happened to have as an adjuta nt  a recent graduate of the military -- Greek military academy.
They would drop it and the partisans really organized themselves as an Army.
So if you served in the Army  you could get a GI Bill of Rights.
So one was a train that actually did arrive at Theresienstadt  and the second train was captur ed by the Russian Army  and this was the third train that had come from BergenBelsen.
He made his way back in after the Russians left Poland.
And in that camp they had another camp and one tent where they put all of us.
I was demobilized from the British army in Cairo  in '46  no '45 and then I stayed one more year as a civilian with the British army and then I went to Palestine.
You told a story earlier when the man came from the Army  when he went into the kitchen and somebody had defecated in there.
I eventually learned how to handle a gun and I spent 4 years and 3 months in the British Army.
Now  at the end of your time as a pa rtisan and then in the Czech army -- Yeah. --
Can you tell me a little bit what you did after the war?
Still  it's not the same thing as being on an army base and not being able to have any fun at all.
I -- I would say its equivalency of the mayor  you know  but -- but the mayor -- occupational kind of military -- he was in -- he was a military person  he was a soldier.
He is a horse dealer in Freiburg  Germany  and this is some type of military parade after the war.
Well  you cannot deny it  you have pi ctures  you see who stood in our main street accepting Soviet army.
And here he said  \ Would you like to make that all...destroy all the things by refusing to do military service.ﬂ \ I offer you \  he said  \ to...to go to the medical...to where they don't have to kill.ﬂ And you...and so I accepted that also reluctantly.
I had lost 10 years  between the concentration camp  going to Morocco  going to [indecipherable]  going to the Israeli army.
In general had it been  aside from the war interrogation -- Well  I didn't like and don 't like the Army system of taking orders from -- you know  you take an order from the next higher up  and very often the people who gave the orders didn't know as much as the people who took them. {
And apparently  there was a prisoner of war camp nearby  and they wanted to bring these prisoners over to talk to me  the Germans.
And so one night we were sitting at the dinner table  which was downstairs  facing the street and as I'm looking ou t the window  I all of a sudden see a small car  small German 7 army car pulling up with four German Gestapo agents jumping out of the car and running into the house.
By the following year  Dan and Dora came to Washington  D.C. and Dan embarked on a career as a researcher in medical chemistry at the Walter Reed Army institute of Research.
Oh  no thats -- that is the nephew of the German chief of staff of 91 the entire German military.
That was their first transport to Auschwitz  to the concentration camp  first transport.
Because the Germans started building an airport that could handle uh--uh military planes cuz that airport was very small before then and building runways and that is what many--many hundreds of--of Jews were doing during the first uh several months of the ghetto.
By 1945 the red Army reached Theresienstadt and Bob was liberated on May 5  1945.
And historical -- historical paradox and irony  and the sociological paradox is that those -- the graves of those killed in those -- in the massacres  are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the cemetery  which cocontained the graves of people who were killed during the first World War  and in some prior war  which was called the War of Independence  wh en some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in the army.
And enlist I did not long  after Pearl Harbor  and I was uh admitted to the Army in Chicago and ordered to report at uh Fort Bragg in North Carolina on uh May the 2nd  1942.
I keep him here and let's change services and make him a military here.
And from there we went to Yorkshire  my company went to Yorkshire  an d -- which there w-was a big army camp  Ketray camp  and from there we went to a very nice pl ace in the -- the lake district  beautiful place where we build a -- a petroleum dump for storin g gasoline.
Very interestingly  the house bordered a -- it was an enclosed area where mo -- not mostly  where all the American military and their wives lived.
They send us to school to be to be preparing for the army.
If it would be another year  they would probably take us into the army too.
But there was now going the military trains  and all kinds of civil trains were stopped.
No  they dont understand that  and as I said  I was in Polish army when we fought Germans  and we were attacked for Soviets.
And as a matter of fact  I still have my military passport with me.
Uh we need help badl y and we hear there's thousands of people and you obviously have the support of the army and the committees and so ...and no...he said it is now so.
And especi ally the Polish army started there and they would go from Samarkand and the other places to Ir an  then Iraq  and then to Palestine.
It was a it it they call army  but it wasnt army.
When --ﬂ Yeah  and he was also told that I'm working in a factory and then he aske d when I am home and he was told I'll be back on -- on the weekend and he said then  ﬁWell  tell him I'll be here next Saturday ﬂ I forgot  probably 10 or whatever in the morning  ﬁand I want to ask him some questions.ﬂ And -- and then he left and -- and we felt very threatened by that and -- and of course I was the most vulnerable because I was of military age and I did not have  as I explained earlier  the complete set of required papers  so Margaret's father went immediately to our Nazi district leader friend and complained bitterly about it   said that the village policeman  I remember his name  even.
There was a Polish unit  a Polish army that fought -- decided to come into Poland  to liberate Poland with the Soviet army  and help establish a -- Vonda Rosherefska  it was her name -- and to help establish a new Polish regime  a Socialist regime  so to say.
But those forests a year later became liberated by the Red Army.
And this address was a textile factory of which allegedly made uniforms for the Hungarian Army.
Moise Weiner: He was called to  maybe to  not exactly to the fighting army  but he was called to the army.
And  when the war was over and they had a -- a -- a -- a court case against the Japanese criminals  you know  military  also some of the industrialists were taken to be investigated and Maury was their attorney.
March  April 46 because by April I was in the -- in -- in the DP camp in -- in Italy  and I know he didnt stay very long because he had to report back to the army.
When there is no war  the military are second rate citizen s. The military is sort of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 119an underclass  and its been that way ever since I came here and I -- and I was a military and still am a miri -- military wife and Im very proud of it.
>> Bill Benson: In Kenya  once the war broke out -- because so many of the British subjects there  the men  joined the Army to go fight so people like your father and others who were not ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 in the military really were forced to tend to the business of the British that they left behind.
Actually  my grandfather on my mother's side died in World War I  he was a soldier in the German Army  fighting for Germany in World War I  and my grandmother was a widow and she ran a store.
He was the one who got me into the army  and who whose ideals he was a great orator  and he knew Polish literature by heart.
And -- so there was not and -- and these army guys were not social workers.
I took pictures of them in my album and if anybody sees this in St. Louis  I w ould like to refer to my album that I gave to the St. Louis Jewish Council on Ala Street in 1946 of January  when I was discharged out of the Army.
There was an offensive in the middle of the f winter in the Don bend of the Don river in the Ukraine  where the Soviet army had a counteroffensive and they in six days they wiped out 200 000 Hungarian army men  and 50 000 Jewish slave laborers; among them  two of my uncles died.
Did you see any German soldiers when you were in Normandy?
Well  we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit  about 100 men.

Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: closing gates and the rest of the Germans who were there eh six hundred and forty or five hundred and forty I did--I really don't remember.
I went to see a film last year  ﬁIn Our Hands ﬂ how the -- the Israeli society and the English army  you kno w  but not on the Isr aeli [indecipherable] that they shouldnt tell  but to the end  they raise up  and they says  ﬁWe going to fight our own flag.ﬂ And then they mentioned how they took out the people from Poland  that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 80 group  but I was glad to see that  you know  a lot of people dont know about it.
In the beginning they took away army ca mps from the armies wh ere they occupied the countries.
So actually my dad and his brother both got to England in 1940.
A son joined the American army  he was injured in the invasion  in the D-Day invasion.
It was not the army  but it was like a national guard...uh we watched for for German planes and .
And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army.
We had to have some air  and he saw the Russian soldiers.
So and then we got brought to the train and when we were brought to the train and we saw that there were not only SS men but soldiers.
02:05:22 Along with the German army came the Einsatzgruppen  killing squads.
Many people who were liberated at that time had to go to the Russian army and still in the last few months were killed on the Russian front  after surviving concentration camp for over four years.
WZ: There was a special deca rtelization branch in OMGUS  8 in the Office of Military Government in Berlin  and they did a great deal of investig ative work and I think a great deal of work under General Clay 9 to break up the German cartels.
So  I asked to give me back the apartment and I asked the baker to please empty the whole thing and we came back to Paris and we bought some furniture and I went to the army.
And then we went to -- we were in -- in Milano for a little while  and then we went into a camp  like an army camp  not too far from Turino.
Yeah  we decided  a bunch of them  we were friends   we decided to join the army  but  I must say that the army was not weapons.
We used to all the convoys to Jerusalem because the Jordanian army cut off the road to Jerusalem   cut off the pipe of water to Jerusalem.
He ev entually joined the American army and was killed in the Battle of the Bulge in January of 1945.
He wouldn't give a buck  and when we started running away from the Germans we were following the Polish army.
And after the war -- and -- and -- when it came out  Hans Baron was his name  Baerchi he was called at school  he -- he was sent back from the army -- he was in the army and as his father was then a Jew  so he was sent from -- and he was not in 79 the army and he was denounced once  because he was walk -- walking about -- that hes a deserter. [
We then arranged a ceremony in '46 for a charter of recognition to be granted by the United States Army to the Central Committee.
AG] Forty-five  and er  the er  Aylesbury  somewhere around Aylesbury  jumped out the plane and er  had to get deloused  the powder in there  this big hut being deloused  all the women  Army making tea for us [DL] And at this point  did you  were you having nightmares of your time at Auschwitz? [
I -- I did go to army reunions once a year  and when I walked in the hotel -- I usually went Friday mornings or Sunday afternoon.
Then we took military trains that took us to -- it wasn't easy.
By May of the following year of 43  I was drafted into the army.
As you mentioned before  I was drafted during the Korean War.
We hear the people talking and then we find out that my brother was killed  the last day  when the same day or day before when the army came in  the Russian army.
Well  after they learned of what happened  they were so upset that how could they--the military authorities--not recognize some compassion of uh helping me stay out  or do something else.
So we come to this large room  and I see lots of young men in military uniforms.
My father wa s working in a factory for the army to make...uh...coats and so was my late mother  but they worked in different shifts.
As we later discovered  rebels from the Polish underground army ambushed them outside of Piaski.
How could they not   you know   with what the liberating Army would find?
I'm very grateful to this country for giving me the opportunity to be an American citizen  serve faithfully in the United States army  got honorably discharged.
Uh  so uh once uh we returned to our lines  uh we compared notes of what we had done  and I learned from the military government un it that they had heard of a group of  of Polish and Hungarian Jewish women who had been uh dumpe d by their SS guards in a  in a vacant factory bldg  and um  who um uh had been uh liberated uh  uh by  by our troops  so I  we knew   we knew of course that we had to do something for th em  even though we couldn't do anything that day anymore  and in the morning we se t out uh  uh greatly reinforced to  to take care of the matter  and I had heard where that factory bldg was and I can remember approaching it uh and getting out of uh the jeep and walking across a courtyard uh where I saw some uh skeletal figures uh  uh trying to  to get some water from a hand pump  but over on the other side uh  uh leaning next to the en  uh against the wall  next to the entrance of the building  I saw a girl standing there  and I decided  and I decided to go walk up to her  and I asked her in German and in English whether she spoke either language  and she answered me in  in German  and uh I uh  I asked uh about her companions and she said uh  \ Come let me show you \  and we went inside the factory.
And it was important for the air force for the military and even for NASA to know what is going to happen in such a case if y ou send a signal for instance  it can be affected by and really ruin it and that is not something that you want to have when you are in say war or whatever.
But any th-this is rather strange  because the British then were accepting the Polish military man that the and allowing them to emigrate from the camps to Great Britain .
And I was hoping to come to America  and -- but what was very nice is that when the war ended  you know  Anders said  since Poland has lo st so many members of its intellectuals  professionals  that he wanted the young military to be educated  and we were offered an opportunity to attend Italian universities.
Well  they were well-furnished and seemed to have -- be well-decorated and -- and I suspect there were probably maybe nicer than what the equivalent officers in our military would be furnished.
I used to go to the army doctors  and I didn't know anything about children  cause I was never around children  I never knew anything about it.
So the they took horses  which one was shot before there was no man  every man was in the army women took the horse  sliced it up and made the stew out of it  or a soup out of it.
She was a doctor in the Russian army  and there was a certificate for Palestine for her at the British consulate  could we help her?

Were th ey historians  or were they mil -- another set of military intelligence people?
And the army  they -- it was -- it was quiet  he -- nothing  I mean  there was n -- and all of a sudden  overnight  they pulled out.
The Army is something you are actually thrown into a structure.
He got it in the army  and he eventually died of it.
Some of them joined the Polish Army that was in exile.
I was so interested in personnel administration and industrial psychology that I thought that I could do it in the Army.
But that was like a similar situation to the military organization particular organization  but that was more not everybody could take advantage of that  but there was such a thing.
And we belonged to the Richie crowd  we were the trained military inte lligence personnel.
But its also interesting that in the British military  you could have been transferred into these intelligence units without being a citizen.
And the reason was that we live on western shore of the Vistula river and on eastern shore Soviet army approached chasing Germans.
because by that time  there was also a nother transformation that had taken place a few months before my arrival in the partisans  namely the partisans became organized as a modern army  with echelons  distinct divisions  regiments  ba ttalions  companies.
So I had this place with about a hundred Germans  and I said to this farmer  ﬁAre you sure theyre no Americans?ﬂ Because I got after action reports from the army  before I [indecipherable].
It was 1941 in Ukraine when my father was taken to the Russian army  to the front.
She didnt survive  her brother survived because he was in the Russian army.
Although they tell you never to volunteer for anything in the Army  when they asked if anyone had had any close order drill  my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon.
So the American Army took us out from there to a place S ugenheim in W est Germany.
You remember the field army stoves  are you familiar with that?
And so they didnt have enough room to take prisoners to Russia  and they would shoot the prisoners and throw them through the wi ndows of the of the prison  and from what I know from eyewitnesses  that they were one level  or two levels high  dead bodies  the Russians killed some of the things.
Out of our mission was called Paper Clip  which was an Army -wide effort to collect scientists.
Well  he was still a prisoner of war in a I guess we we had to process him that way  cause he was a German soldier.
Well  all Army  at his level  all phones are what are called secure.
And in Siberia  at a ce rtain moment in time  there was  everyone who wa s Czech was asked to join the Czech army.
The Russian soldiers  wherever they were  when somebody wanted to come this way  the Russians said go back.
He came into Koretz  was a lot of [indecipherable] where they came back from the army sa -- one without a leg  one without a arm  and ever ybody knows what he was doing to the Jews over there  he was in jail.
They wanted to -- then we met also the soldiers we met before  and my sister found the guy who wanted to marry her.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 157 We were married in Germany  in Heidelberg  which is a famous place for getting married  but I was stationed there w ith the headquarters US Army.

I remember walking very calmly with one of my uncle was the Jewish brigade  etcetera [indecipherable] which I met later  he was in the army  he was in the army paper all the time  and -- and of course Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 68they departed.
It took about maybe two weeks or three weeks  and I got -- because the post for the army was going fast.
I  as a kid you know  you admire military people and I was fascinated by the military splendor that they came in with  organized  motorized.
So then they had the deal that said that Polish citizen can just go back to the Polish army.
I mean  these were men  all high offi ces in the army  strong people  and they broke down crying  they couldn't handle us.
Its this I ra and I met him  and because some of those young army Lithuanians from the German army  criminals  I really  they were criminals  introduced me to him  because they admired  because he was a general.
But its also not really about the DPs  its about about people who about young Lithuanians who had been in the German army.
>> Fred Flatow: My parents owned -- ordinary citizens  owned a factory that made rainwear  which was unique and important enough that when the Nazis  the Army and others  stopped buying from Jewish businesses  they kept buying from my parents' factory because the manufacturing was so unique and so important.
You know  if you -- you ro -- you remember  the Poles divided up in Russia into two  it was an [indecipherable] army that went through Teheran  Israel  you know  and they stayed and fought on the side of the allies  and there was the -- the -- I have a -- a blank mind on the name of ma -- th -- the women.
They joked around and they said ﬁ Topas re mained the only Zionist among usﬂ. Because I was living in America and they were there and th ey served in the Israeli army  one of them achieved a very high rank in the army.
And then they had a deal  when people we re rift  could re-enlist in the army  but not as officers  as master sergeant.
But obviously  the American Army knew long time before what was happening to prisoners.
Oh my father  the fact that he became one of the -- in the army  the -- the religious om -- officer [indecipherable] The chaplain.
Uh I of course had some very interesting experiences while I was in the Army.

He didnt want to serve in the Polish army  so he ran away.
You mentioned your father had been in the German Army I understand Yes.
This fo rtress was supposed to hold the Red Army at the Vistula  and to prepare the city for the fighting  sp ecial detachments went around dynamiting city blocks.
A little bit  because since I was drafted  less tha -- in about a year after my starting arm -- permanent position at Bell Laboratories   there was a two year a -- in -- almost two years intervening in the army.
I went for the physical and I was healthy and they took me into the army.
My father was in the Austrian Army of World War I; he was wounded.
In France  the survivors came to see me at Army Headquarters.
And I wasnt in the army at that time anyhow  but there was no mail between the U.S. and Germany.
If I were to be asked by the U.S. Army  or any U.S. military force  to serv e in the military again due to some emergency  I would not say no.
We stayed there overnight and -- and a Jewish friend of ours who we befriended when-- he was in the American army  met us at the boat to go to our hotel  and then took us to his home for our first American meal.
But it was not  this time  without uniform  and we had to send cloth and coat  and -- and whatever  underwear  to somebody who was in the -- not in the army  but i-i-i -- called working -- I dont know what working  teams.
And be for the fact that the railroad tracks between Grodno and Marstee  were not ready  because we  the partisans  the yesterdays destroyers of that  to s -- to not let the Germans be able to carry on their war  now had a problem of going back to see that theyve all repaired  so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies  as well as manpower.
Until  in July of ‚50  I was drafted into the service.
It was a noma how much every farmer has to give to the Germans for the army.
And it and a Polish Polish government called upon the people of age to come and join the military.
On the other hand I wanted to play this -- this red herring of military hierarchy and the level of responsibility.
And the Russians put a tremendous army in the...in the speediest way to occupy  and to go and to grab the island.
most people  Jews and Gentiles alike  Jews and Lithua- nians alike were worried that the German army was going to march in that week.
So  wh-when you were old  I think by t 11 11 or 10 years old you had to  like here like the the Germans had the Hitlerjugend   the the kids when they had they they trained them for for army and things   and singing and marching.
03:12:01 Can you talk to me a little bit about the military hierarchy?
He probably wa s pretty hurt and pretty much damaged since they give him all From the Army? --
He went into the service and he was stationed with a first army and  oh  God  whatever.
It just couldn't happen that way  so that's th at's an answer to your question and when did I get in the army or how or why.
So the girls took that document to the prison  and explained to the commander down there that \ How can you keep him for a desertion from the army?
Mit -- at that time it was still an army of occupa tion  you couldnt wea -- wear civilian clothes.
I know that they were enemy  our  but they were regular army  like the Polish army who fought German.
At the time the Army did not want German refugees or recent refugees from Germany being officers in the Army  so that the lieutenants in the office were usually German speaking or poorly German speaking from places like Milwaukee and the other German -- Midwest? --
No  this is the G.I.s at that particular time  if they could get to those places  the army took good care of them.
Anyhow  I didnt -- I wasnt too anxious to go back 57 to the division  so they assigned me to six army group in Heidelberg.
What was his what was his experience  serving in the war?
So we thought well  you know  why Lithuanian army doesnt go there and recover Vilnius  because Poles will be not able to resist any more.
He worked at night and got his undergraduate degree and then later on he got graduate degree  all while he was in the military.
We didn't see any Germans there  because the people retreated with the German army and they let us loose and we started to grab food  whatever we could find.
They come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them.
And I got a job in the military bakery  as a German.
Interview with Julian Kulski September 25   2014 110 Military doctor  suggested that one of the ways you could heal is by writing down what happened to you.
We had four military districts and the city of Berlin was quartered with the British and the French and the United States and Russians  each in charge of one of those  we called them sectors.
But just a few months later in November you're in the U.S. Army and you're ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 26 back in Germany.
And I imagine that um  when the Germans took off  running  I imagine that those that were capable of going  they herded them in front of them  because see  ah-uh-uh-uh-uh-upon our approach  the Germans were not gonna stick around.
In your time in the Polish Army  the first stint  were you on any fronts?
In fact  when she was in the army she went back to Germany  and she went to Adelsheim after the war.
Then every individual  every male  even female for that matter  have to join the Israeli Army.
The only general in the Russian army  a four-star general  so the wife had a daughter  again my age  and I start...they took me in.

And we ran away and we a-again got hold of a Czech army -- not any more the no -- what we were before  with a tractor of -- not tractor  with a -- a -- with just a car we got -- we got to Czechoslovakia .
Now  then when I went to Europe and I was there about the time of Nuremberg  I di d not see combat by the way  I was very lucky on that  for four years in the army  never to have seen combat was very lucky and again I thank my father for having been in the signal corps and taking  oh there was one funny thing by the way  which may or may not have anything to do with this but when I gradua ted from Officer Candidat e School as a second lieutenant  I was sent back to the school again as a student  where I had written the examinations and I had taught for several years  which is a typical army thing.
I said  \ Well  I won't go back into the Army no matter what  I don't trust the Army  I've seen them doublecrossing line people  they won't protect me.\

So they would organize  and some of the people who joined the partisan had been professional military people  particularly the Alpini in Ba ldosta  the Alpini  who were very good at climbing  who were very good at exercise  and -- and the German and the Nazi Fascist were determined to -- to get rid of them.
My mother-in-law tells me...I just remembered that...this was in 1947...I returned home in the meanwhile on the leave during the military service  but this was '47  I think Februa ry.
So uh the situation was tough  and many non -Jewish people took out many special fascist organization  took advantage  took all the Jewish business  all the Jewish factory  all the big Jewish house  or small Jewish houses  so the only hope of the Jewish people was to  to get out of the war and we know that there be USHMM Archives RG -50.030*0151 9 or due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our territory or to the Russian army  start the offensive about the Germans over there.
They had demanded a group of people to be in the square in the morning  and t hey said that they wanted them to bind trees for the winter in a camp  just a little military camp just up the road.
And then they -- some kind of decision was made to re-allow  to bring b ack some of the Jewish doctors in the military to tend to the wounded  because there were e normous amount of wounded people and they needed to be treated and the Romanian doctors were not enough.
Then I made a mistake because there were Germans  workers that were working for the military and somebody did me a favor by giving me a piece of his sandwic h. I had two bites and I swallowed it and I was dying.
So  this was the army that was getting me out of bed  and left me there  and I joined this whole group  and then we finally got back to Zagreb on 30 some horrible third-class train  sleeping on th e floor  as I was saying how they were doing in Dubrovnik on mattresses on the floor  and thats what we did.
I was in civilian clothes; I had all the military stuff in that wrapped blanket.
After the war  he was in the Russian army and then he went into the Polish army.
And there were a lot of Jewish soldiers in the American army.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 4 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: war?
Then I was called up to the army for the service.
I took about– We went through th at strategy twice  in 1939 but it lasted two days because soon we hear on the radio that the Russian army cr oss the border and are coming to liberate us  we werent scared anymore  because the Germans we re still 150 kilometers from us.
So the rumor was that the family- family or families of the guy who is serving theŠwhether constricted or regular Army  will not get in transport so he had the idea  no matter how much it would cost in the family really+ wha tever they were able to- that his family as well as my family might be exempt from transport so we married on April -- no  February the 8 th  February the 8 th  1944 .
This was actually a good job because I worked among the military  and I had to clean.
The ones who we re standing there  the army  they were regu lars - regular army.
So  about three days before we came before Krakow  and also Krakow was not ok -- was not taken -- like usually in a war  you go from the -- and this time we went from the east to the west  like the army didnt go from east to the west.
But he said wherever wherever you are  try to go in the direction of again  a place where where the Polish army is organized.
BZ: Well  we of course the firs t thing that the office of military government did was abolish all the discriminatory legislation  the Nuremberg laws of 1936 and various ot her German laws which declared various acts to be criminal   such as intermarriage  such as even ordinary social intercourse with Aryans was prohibited.
And it stood us in good stead stead because the things we learned were  uh  important to the Army and nobody else.
I says yeah  I just said  Im supposed to go to the army  I am waiting.
And  so yeah  that was that was a tremendous improvement 36 compared to to everything else  you kno w. The army provided us with clothes  they provided I mean  the UNRRA  at the end provided us with cl-clothes and food and  you know.
He got a fictitious birth certificate from a fictitious village that made him 10 years older this way he didn't have to serve in the Polish Army.
In other words some of them must have been soldiers in the Austrian army.
So  when they marched us in the that was near Senda when when I woke up with th at carbine at my belly you know  th-the the thing was that the American soldiers had no noise in their army boots  they were quiet at night  so they would I had that carabiner at my belly  you know  they look at me  and and there was a a captain  I think  that spoke Polish.
In the meantime  in the Spring of 1940  the German army man- aged to occupy Belgium and Holland and France.
We  just to go back a little bit  after I was taken out of the monastery  we went to -- the person who was responsible for even knowing that we were in the monaster y was Rabbi David Kahana  who became the chief Rabbi of the Polish army.
Shortly before we came to the proper city in Grodno  there was the gendarmes  the military gendarmes  who were controlling the traffic.
Soon after that I was ordered to England and since I was still the only free  that is non-assigned to a division  Jewish chaplain  I was ordered to the American Military Cemetery at Brookwood in Surry  not far from London  and I was uh stationed with the American detachment uh who took care of burials at their uh quarters in the town of Wilking .
We didn't know how long it will last  heroic Red army will not let uh the occupy.
And they take us in a forest; some military camp was there somehow  because there were tents.
Because on August 30 was the Vienna Dictatum  and in September 6th the Hungarian army entered in North Transylvania.
They were brought  some of the people took us to Katzco and we were brought in the morning later to Katzco and in Katzco we stayed awhile  but we were very lucky that time  because the Italian came  the Italian military came and then we were sent back to Moestar.
Uh...The Czech student  whose name is Ernest  engaged himself into the Czech army that...the Czech army in exile  and he...we were all wanting to help the war effort to fight the Nazis.
However  being moved to uh the 7th Army all of a sudden it seems that information uh slowed down  uh apparently uh and quite actually we were not the proximity to the concentration camps was far greater.
Because I think the afterthought was they wanted to defend Warsaw and all the manpower that would have done the defense left Warsaw.
And there I found out a really surgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this house.
But anyhow  usually you take anyhow when you get into the army.
They wiped out this town because they needed for a military base and they weren't going to bother to relocate the Jews because they don't care about Jews anyhow so they ki lled them.
But they were concerned that my brother would have to serve in the Ge rman Army  or in the European Army.
>> David Bayer: Well  there used to be a big military camp the Germans had called ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 Foehrenwald.
Can I considering the pressure I am under from the Army on the black market  simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam?
We were picked up by Germany um athletes in uniform  Ge rman army men actually  in uniform with a sidecar  a motorcycle with a sid ecar and Marty and I got in the sidecar and he drove us we were almost through with the 12 miles.
So  we left Berlin for Bremenhaven  and I think we stayed in Bremenhaven two to three days  because the ships that were taking the refugees to America were converted military transport ships.
A German officer -- he was not an SS officer  but he was in the army.
And I took a job a on the military sea transportation service  thats a civilian group.
Because one thing yeah  one one thing I do remember is the German army parading down Gediminas Prospect in Vilnius  we were there already.
I went back and the Seventh Army organized us and then they put us on trains and we went to Landsberg  our group went to Landsberg  which that was before a German ca mp and the Americans took away from them.
By the way  it was called ASTP  Army Special Training Program.
They were -- were looking at it fr -- Theyre just a -- -- yeah  were looking at strictly from the military standpoint -- Right. --
He wa s not British  he was simply Soviet GRU military espionage chief for this part of occu German occupied [indecipherable].
Margit would later work for the Office o f War Information  spend time with MGM studios  and because of her language abilities worked for the U.S. Army of Occupation in Germany  re -educating Hitler youth.
Now  is your brother taken in to be part of the army?
What did you see first in terms of the Ge rman army?
We marched to Greece and was the last facility to escape to go with the British army.
He was unable to get working papers in Budapest because he had been a Czech citizen having served in the Czech Army.
And so we wound up in a big army base in Casablanca and they interrogate me and the British were there that were doing the interrogation and they were very thrilled with all the information I could give them about the Atlan tic Wall.
Virtually all the camps were established in former military facilities of the German army  navy army or military.
Okay  so was this an one of the o ccupying armies  victorious armies  or was this a nothing to do with the military?
I was still in the army when I became a citizen and one of the questions that the judge asked of me was whether I if called upon I'd be willing to serve in the United States Armed Forces and I was wear ing my uniform which was kind of funny and then in March of '53 I was uh married to my present wife  who to...to my present wife and uh shortly got a job and shortly thereafter taking advantage of my GI bill uh I went to Syracuse University at night uh because I couldn't afford to go during the day.
And he told me once  \ Tell me  Viliam  why you didn't go to the Czechoslovak army?\
She was a volunteer Red Cross person in Palestine and helped with people who were Polish military refugees who were ill or hospitalized.
Thats story I heard after I come back to Poland from American army and I talked to people who survived the Warsaw uprising.
Next day they took twenty thousand...the the the headquarters from the army made a big...see Russian like propaganda.
And they take us over... Seems like between the Russian Army and the American Army  there was a no man's land.
He was a biggest man the army had in that town.
So next mo rning  we went to the co mmander of the ghetto who was a major of the Romanian army.
We already liberated  we are in the -- still in the woods  but we had to stake you know  and 66 join -- thats for our mission is to help the Russian army to disarm and to da -- day -- you know  and to -- to -- there -- it was a disarray.
Czechoslovakia was occupied  and Hungary partial  and -- in army  was not problem because we are Jew.
That army went...that army went to to Persia and they they were in   that Polish army.
Well  they were I suppose I should say difficult weeks for a person who had never known anything about the military.
And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in  having taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on maneuvers  I was a medical aide  corpsman we called them.
Theyre building homes  people building homes  and they used to -- people are repair their homes  you know  we used to -- and then the army built some -- how do you call it?
It was obvious if you were going to be in the army you were going to get it.
WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: The primary German we saw in this group was an what later turned out to be an SS soldier guard who had changed his clothes into civilian clothes  had a black vest on and we took his picture  which turned out very well.
Outside the SS were the men  where took my father too had to look at this  and the men were surrounded by either the German army or by the organization TOP which was the working arm of the Nazi movement  and there was a soldier who my father knew  either a soldier or a member of the organization TOP  and he told his men  when you come back  tell the story.
A. I was coming from Italy and I had a friend  I forgot his   he was by the   regular army.
They took me -- well  its a whole long story anyway  they -- they took me by the commandants car to a hospital in Georgia from the second army.
Interview with Ruth Kirby 21 July 14  1995 And theyre all very proud that I had served in the army.
So I found a soldier in the group there  and I told him  hey  do me a favor.
My other sister  Frances Ha yes married a colonel in the army and he was the defense attache in Burma and then Indonesia.
Now turns out that this was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me  because the army that fled and the communist government that got created  created actually an area  a liberated area.
They called general priest of the army  they -- now they have a building with 29 general rabbi of the army.
Well  the army had issued me one pair  but I had never gotten a second pair.
It was a camp where young men from colleges were prepared for military work.
So  there are two Armies  the peace Army is the United States Armed  you know  the Army that you  you  you are  uh  have to join when something happens like in the war you  you join  you are forced to join the service.
Because he was actually -- they tried to indict him  because he was a higher rank in the German army  so he probably had maybe other things.
And then you leave for Musocco for Rome   by way of Varese   always in military attire.
But it was something that uh  that the army decided to do as far as Dachau was concerned.
So nobody would show their weakness and be humane to the Jews  because this was the military had different orders.
They were attacked by the Polish army and by the Polish police in the city of Rovno.
During the war  when we were alone and my father we nt to the army  she started buying and selling things.
It was Wehrmacht  the regular Army and he told us that we are being taken to be 15 exchanged  to the exchange station where they will exchange the German prisoners and we were being loaded on the trucks and taken to the railroad station.
So  according to that  thats kind of correct  I mean  thats the army.
So I go out and there is my friend  the officer  Hungarian army officer he was  and three Hungarian Nazis from the Arrow Cross dresse d in Arrow Cross uniform with machine guns  with hand grenade  with revolver; name it.
When the army entered they were first put in a prison  in the Balti prison.
My father  as they say  was sent to to the to school  and then he went to the 1918 Lithuanian independence  he fought with the Lithuanians army  the partisans.
I participated in the surrender of the Hungarian Army and I do remember at the behest of my general and I do remember that the Hungarian general was really only interested in his men but in his two horses.
Rae Goldfarb: She enlisted in the Russian Army as a worker and we -- we got lodging in a boxcar and traveled with the train to fix water towers.
I argued with the military  Unrah  but not on an   political basis.
And they brought us to this camp  and we were there.
It was very hard because the German army with their dogs and all that they were retreating and they at that point they didn't especially care who they killed.
And wha...this saved him when he was in the army because when he was in the Austrian army  Jews were just plain soldiers  and actually they used to be even orderlies to officers.
And we wait for another boat  another Army boat to pick us up.
So he was resented by the military and he wasnt accepted.
There was a Jewish chaplain whose na are also from Chicago  in Camp Home Run  whose name was Michael Lipschitz  and Michael Lipschitz  I to showed him I f my aunt was found too  by the Red Cross and by the army  what do I do?
So you went to the streets  you saw Lithuanian military  police  and so on.
If you were lucky  you were in the hospital because human life was not very much cherished  you know  in the army.
So he had a correspondence with the army for many  many moons about that money for the... I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time  though  we didn't bothe r to sign for it.
So  he said  I became a soldier before World War I  and served in the Austrian army  and he told me the different battles.
These were German-speaking research analysts  most of them refugees from the Nazi regime who were given briefings as to what we were looking for  and then they would go into the documents and they would write these SEAs and they would come to mostly English speaking lawyers and English speaking 14The Charter of the International Military Tribunal.
So the army put a pontoon bridge across to an island  and from the island  we walked across the remaining part of the bridge to the old part of Buda in to the brickyards which was the first stop on the cavalry that we went through.
And then one group  about 600 men  they escaped from the Slovak army to the Soviet Union.
So  I was just barely a year in the United States and I got drafted in the U.S. Army.
And I came there  was th ere a chaplain  a Jewish chaplain from the army.
Then there was the German labor organization  but normally they took people at 17 f-for [indecipherable] anything to gain time  that may -- may be better than military service  again they wouldnt take me.
We were supposed to be in first army which was in the northern part of Europe  of Germany.
That was very important to me  it was something that I -- I wanted to be a nurse and I wanted to join the army and I wanted to go overseas and I felt that I had really succeeded in all these dreams I had.
So Prather told me in his letter I mean  he mentioned that he is going to that he has a a hunch that that he has already somebody that that will be able be in thats going to be helpful in my in my defection from the Russian army.
Later there  after three months  we was automatically -- supposed to automatically be sent to one year military school for future officer  army officer  like West Point  you see  and only West Point is more graduated  you know  thats like half West Point education  something.

And they tried to feed first of all they cleaned me up USHMM Archives  RG-50.549.02*0007 21from head to toe  they had the they had these trav eling showers  what the army shower had carried around  they were wide open and they had water  and they had a little shower head and then they gave you soap and DDT powder to spray you.
At the end of 1945  when I was demobilized from the British army  I met a girl in Cairo and we got married and then in '46 when I went to Palestine  I went with her.
And I made the passport in Russian  out to me  with ju st the undersigned  not the unders igned  the officer William Perl  Serial Number so-and-so  will pr oceed in US Military Favor  and the number of the jeep  which I never filled out  and the bor der date  I had to fill it out.
The -- they were in uniforms  and they were a political military arms of the regime.
I was stationed in the Army here at Fort Detrick and they came and visited me here.
I told him I had simply come to see how well the American Army under his command was taking care of Jewish survivors in the Austrian camps.
Finally  the last chance my father had  he knew an individual that he was dealing with in the Romanian Army.
but these guys in other words had that you were dealing with had not been in  in the military in the Wehrmacht.
There were virtually hordes of German army which they retreated to this other side of the water so we couldn't.
39 That was created almost at the same time when the law was enacted  it was in the last November of 47  but it didnt come into real operation until the late spring of 48 because -- and that is very difficult for us imag -- to imagin e today -- you could not create from the outside any kind of an operation in the occupied parts of Germany unless you were somehow hooked up to military government.
Not a single  they cant point to one sing le engagement that the United States Army or the Marine Corps  the United States Forces lost.
But dont forget that I was an extremely fit young man when I joined the army.
The regulation at that time was that anybody who immigrate to United States  who comes in  and is of draft age  will serve in the army first.
Was the stationary because when it was Aktion  it came special group--SS or special military group who was taking the Aktion then or doing this.
It was also apparent  at that time  it was also learned  that Russian soldiers -- basically they didn't want to fight.
My father was uh immediately went to the military service and I in Budapest with my mother.
And he happened to come out as the number one ma n in his class  and the first man that the -- top man who gets the scholarship at that tim e -- not gets a scholarship  c-comes out on top  the first guy in his class  is offered a regular army commission  which is you can become a professional army officer.
I worked there  I think it was three years  four years  but it was interrupted -- it was interrupted by me being inducted into the army -- into the United States army.
She explained to our roommate that all fur had to be donated to the German army because they need ed it.
And for some reason they left the radio on all the time and we heard news that things aren't going so good for the German Army.
And then to shape up his whiz kids  called us  they brought in some tough army types from Hawaii whod never seen snow but to teach us the old army drill.
By that time  as soon as I think Slovakia became --very shortly after they became an independent fascist republic  they started passing some laws against the Jews.
When you are 20 you went to army for one and a half year.
So he had a this horrible jewel job pole publicly  he was reporting to a German  but on a daily basis  he was surrounded by three military Polish underground military intelligence agents  and was in c daily contact with the civilian and military underground fa cilities.
How exactly did your father survive  it sounds like hes with the army  and -- as a medical corps  but not all the time.
My father was was there  and he was assigned to wo rk with what would be equivalent again here  at one time there was something called ROTC  or something in high schools where they they were preparing the the young men fo r for the service in the army.
He had to show his I.D. ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 They just let him go .
And I started to correspond -- as soon as I heard this  I wrote to him also  telling him about the jewels and telling him about the few things that they left with us  a -- a -- a silver box  because Mr. Schtitzel   during the first World Wars  was a officer in the Austrian army.
When they came into your town did they arrive all at once - did the army come all at once?
Then I got back to work for the American army and this like this.
But we were lucky and we were still going in the car with the Russians  the army.
Also was -- I emptied out some military building  and we lived there  yes  for about si -- five  six weeks.
He wa -- he was called to Germany to testify to be a witness for -- i-it was for Nuremberg.
It wa s a 10 hour test  plus the fact that I was an officer in the army  they give you extra point per the -- the schools you went to.
And then  after about working for Army Material Command for some eight or nine years  I realized  through the Affirmative Action that I am going no place.
All of a sudden  the army started marching  the German army.
How about any of your brot hers and sisters  other than the brother who was in the Hungarian army  were there other members of the family?
He had  at that time already  gr enades  rifles  ammunition  a short wave radio receiver and transmitter  where he was communitcating with the -- the -- the Akar  the army of Cryova  he was like a center post -- center point  where the army of Cr-Cryova was -- was commu-communicating through him.
And so I had 90 days  the agreement with [indecipherable] was I go back to New York  I go to the -- get my citizenship  and the requirement was that  when you get a citizenship if youre in the army  its three years  if youre a civilian  five years  unless youre the wife of a military  and he is all -- overseas  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 90 and he can -- the wife can get it two years  I think  because they prefer to be citizens  to protect the pe -- United States.
There were many refugees who came from the western part of Poland .
indecipherable] So at Bremerhaven  where you on a military ship coming home  or We were on we were on a troop ship.
So  before the break  we were talking about your first days and weeks in the military  and how you were in this wonderful band  but that you did not feel right staying at it  and asked that your name be put on the list to be called up for basic training.
The government  that I have this is it was mandatory to go to the li to actually  they called us to the army.
He was also a captain in th e army  in the Romanian army.
What it -- where you were  what happened and then how liberation took place.
And I had to find my way from Badenhausen  which was quite a long way  to Eilshausen  which was the headquarters of our unit  where Henry Lunzer  the capt -- a former cap tain in the British army  and who was then the director of the Jewish reli-lief unit  had set up our headquarters in the village.
Military orders and whatnot all  so for the time being he thought we were safe.
A lot of them were soldiers and officers from the Red army  Soviet army  with families.
And the cables must have flown between Bremen and Munich and New York and New York and Washington and political pressure brought on Congress people  on the State Department  on the Army and finally after a week or two  a compromise is reached.
I dont know  I came only back from the military  how I found out ther e is a party  how she got to me  I dont remember that.
We had to ask somebody  and we always knew that the army were not as -- they were not as bad as anybody else.
Now this is probably -- I dont know how to express it  but becoming a wife of an officer -- o-o-of an ar -- of a -- of a military person  was the most important  wonderful thing that could ha ve happened to me when I came to the United States.
And as he said  with the transport of the military train to the east  with his -- and for this man was prepare the same  yes?
However  when I came out of the Army  six months and 13 days later and I went back to the office  I was given a check for close to $1 000 for the commission which I had earned.
The reason that Auschwitz was in such a good shape was  it was a former army post  and the buildings were -- the buildings were built to last.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 25 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: German come over to knock him down.
One day they came to us and said : Well  we cannot stay here  the Russian Army is coming closer.
So the period of time when you were in Palestine  while you were in the army  fighting  was she mainly supporting the family by her sewing?
Then he joined the American Army and became a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe.
But then people were afraid that it -- my superiors  that it will have a connection with my name from before  so they said lets have a new name  so Tadeusz was okay  its a good Polish name  so I became Tadeusz Zaleski.
The Army later accused me of being a member of Zionist organizations  but little did they know I'd never been in the Zionist movement before.
The guy who was checking the tickets and a gendarme  a military man...I don't know what he was.
When you were with the Russian army  you served primarily as an interpreter?
It was just--that was funny because  th at was funny because they had us divided in--everybody's Canadian  see everybody was Canadian  Canadian-Belgian  see  because the government of Spain  Franco  had made an arrangement that he's not going to repatriate anybody who is army age and is Canadian  so everybody is saying--we all said we were Canadians  and so they knew better and so they said  ﬁYes?
You went -- I joined the army in Israel  was a [indecipherable] war.
When you mention th e men being rounded up and you and your mother and brother were rounded up  was this by the Hungaria n Police or Army or do you know?
And I remember walking past  looking up and ther e was this great big  tall  tall soldier  two big stars.
And my uncles son was in the American army and visited us there  and I think I may have mentioned that.
And so if you are sitting on the top of the mountain and you're looking down like the Arabs were at the time at the frontier of Lebanon in Israel  whoever...there was some army there.
A. You got this military bread  dry so it can stay ten years.
Taken in 1916  while her father was on leave from the Romanian Army.
They did things for me at that time there was absolutely no accountability for supplies in the United States Army.
In other words  this was what they called RAMP  acronym  recovery Allied military personnel.
In fact  it wasnt -- it was never resolved  except when I came back from the military  it was a financial settlement kind of thing  that we decided how much we re going to provide for him and whatever he does with it  its okay with us.
Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 112 Then I came to United States because her uncle her uncle  my wifes was afraid that if Ill get caught killed in the army  wh how can you take this?
We had a relatively free life  we had  we had a picture of a heroic future for us  whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers  almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are r unning around like ants on the cities of Budapest  I'm going to lead a very healthy life  and fi nally I' m going to have a countr y  I have a home  I will have a fatherland and it was  it was a marvelous feeling.
It was -- you know  its difficult to tell today  because there was regulations put out by the German military headquarters  by Germans.
I was in Warsaw after the concentration camp when I run away from the army.
The only time that he was away  and not living with her  was the two years that he was in the United States Army .
My father came to the United States about 1943  he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war  prior to Pearl Harbor.
That was the last boxcar they unloade d. There were more dead than alive and when the American army came two days later  they found the entire train  say the first five boxcars  boxcars full of dead prisoners.
So this officer is being dismissed from my command and will be discharged from the Army and so you kill the court marshall.
The other recreation was that -- that when I -- when they caught me with a bread  I-I was beaten up so badly that they broke  you know  a big spoon that y-you -- you are cooking for the whole army th -- and that I thought that they are going to kill me with it  but how I survived it is just really by miracle.ﬂ I said  ﬁIsn't that enough recreation for you?ﬂ And then the teacher  the other teacher came in and said  ﬁMrs.
And Wh-Wh-When did you leave Germany and how long were you there?
And in November  when I first...I received an order to present myself to the ...my uh...my  uh  regiment  I could try to postpone the military duty  because I was still not recove red.
The army took them in  and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didnt have a job because every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis  who dont have a congregation here in the United States.
But these kids USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 37 did not know  you know what I mean  any be tter  they were not brought -- I says  ﬁSo therefore  Ill make my biggest request to you   lets take the kids out of the camp.ﬂ And before long  which again I have pictures to prove you -- that point  if at any time you interested  but since we are doing it just for -- on a tape like that  but if you would be interested  I will be more than happy to supply with copies of the pictures  where  at this particular time  the Palestine brigade  or the Jewish brigade  as it was called  which it was attached to the British fifth army  came in to help  not the Joint Distribution Committee  and with their trucks  which you will see on the pictures  Ill -- Ill show them to you afterwards  which with their trucks  we took the kids  and we shi-shipped them out to a separate camp to make a camp  where they could be tended to the needs those youngsters were needing  and they were the first ones to be shipped even illegally to Israel  by means that we were not even aware of how  but they shipped them out  a nd they gave them the treatment that needed.
And from the very beginning  I took the positi on I'm not going to let the war end without my being in the Army  and so I told him toward the end of '43 that  \ Don't apply for a deferment for me anymore because I'm going into the Army \  and I called up my draft board  and they obliged me by drafting me.
As a result  plus that the Russian army had a huge overwhelming victory in January of 1943  where the Hungarian army was at the Danube  large river in Ukraine.
Its all -- but I still call him a cousin  who was a docto r  and being  being a doctor  being of draft age  he and his brother  both of them were drafted into the Polis h Army.
Our government  pretty find out that there was a split of opinion about that  and there was b-betrayal in the high military command.
That was coming in later  say toward the end of '48 and then in '49  it became -- it became -- it raised standards to a degree that impressed Franklin Keller  who had been a long-time principal of a vocational training high school in New York City and who is there as a specialist for the Army  and our French Dr. Frankel who had a life time of experience in vocational training.
Interview with Paul Jonas May 3  2013 13 We had we had over there a it was a building built on the army  Im you know  the Polish army.
Well well  what ha really happened is that my father was drafted into the Russian army.
So then we were in the DP camps  several different DP camps.
The Fifth Army  which it was the British Army stationed there on the border of Austria and Italy  they had a big group from the Israelis  or at that particular time  call them Palestinian Jews who were serving in the Fifth Army and that was supported by them.
We were trained in order of battle  identifying we learned everything about the German we knew more about the German army  their uniforms  their their insignia.
One was killed in the first World War  in the German army  fighting for Austria.
So so thats So that at that point did you know you were in the Soviet Union ?
Well  he was part of the General Anders  the Polish army that fought along with the British army against the Germans.
And I just lo oked at him  I didn't know he was in the German Army at the ti me  I was six.
His memories of World War I were that the Ru ssians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and occupied Poland the situ ation of the Jews improved.
When I was at military history in 1948  we had a British contingent  three British officers.
He said  the fi rst time he had ever worn shoes was in the Army.
But  when the Germans were fleeing and trying to escape and wanted to dismantle the machinery   this nice Germans came in to our camp and asked for volunteers.
He -- and he -- so when they came home from school I saw e -- that my father uni -- army uniform was hang out  he was the [indecipherable] I dont know how i-it -- corf of -- m-medical cor -- The medical corps.
The United States Army was running on occupation funds  which meant the German treasury printed the money  and we used the money to pay for whatever we needed.
I was working there up to '38.. In 1938 I have to go to the Army.
We moved to New York when my brother came back from the army.
And we were taken to Egypt for our last combat training and then transferred to Italy where we became part of Montgomerys Eighth Army and we participated in the final push.
Then of course  with this lady is in Auschwitz and all this  but I had no Was your stepfather or father called up in the army previously?
Did you have t di d you make decisions to go into the military  were you drafted?
And as he had just pre -- previously been in the Yugo slav army  he knew that area and he was telling these guys  oh I know where this is  this is not bad  lik -- well -- well -- well try and get  you know  get together and all of these things  and maybe it will work out and so on.
After this start  Polish government start pushing us to take the Polish passport  belo ng to Poland.
I think it was the 67th -- Polish army something  and thats where he stayed and thats where he was discharged and he fell in love with this little town.
And they -- when they came to the partisan  they were already -- they knew how to behave in the army.
And I must tell you  you know  they were terrible in  you know  equipping the army.
You know we had  there were young men and the soldiers.
Anyway  we would come home and we were in the military -- formerly military camp  which had all kinds of sports facilities.
And I thought  well  maybe I can enlist in the British army.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 Suddenly the Germans moved in.
And what -- what happened was that when -- by the time she applied for the job with the Germans was because she felt that if she had an ID card in case they could catch up with us and ask for papers that this might help.
Then we heard specific stories like from the Warsaw Ghetto  that they were taking people and putting them into the Army truck with a canvas over it and then they would drive around with the truck  put the exhaust into the back of the truck  and drive around until the people were gassed to death.
And when the war broke out  it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the villages  in Kovno and in other villages  because the fronts were going on fightings between the Russian Army and the German Army.
My brother  who was older  he wanted to go to Russia.
So when he was released from the first arrest  he said that that one of the reasons he was arrested was because of that  because of se you know  his giving some things to support the Polish army.
Some of them are half crazy or whatever it is and they just killed them  and then they brought in big trucks  army trucks and they took about a thousand of Jews.
Her husband had been taken prisoner  was part of the French army that were rounded up by the Germans when the French capitulated in June 1940.
Btu the military -- that was now German Swiss  not French Swiss any more  they took us out every day on a walk.
After a few minutes  when we were there hiding on the other side of the fence  I found out that we are in a German military camp.
In the morning I took him  after the train landed  after the train arrived in  in uh Frankfurt  I took him first to uh be registered  to be signed in  to the American Army mess.
So  on my fathers side of the family  military activity was not a -- an unusual activity  despite what the -- the Germans said  that there were that few -- not that many Jews volunteered or f ought  that was totally incorrect.
He was also in the polish army as a main person  an army man  and he was working in the underground in the polish army.
There was no trains  no...the only thing that was going was the Canadian army  all around.
I want to tell you and when I came...when I escaped from the ghetto  I came to the priest and the priest told me the the the widow  the the the...from the farm  she is here with a wagon and two horses and I should take the wagon and the horses and I should cross the bridge that between Kovno and the and the other and the other suburb    which leads to the farm where the wh ere the...they had the farm with the widow  but the the the priest said he wouldn't wa nt to rescue the life of the of the widow  the very good Christian woman in case they ar e be caught at the at the at the bridge  because on both sides of the bridge were stationed military gendarmes  and they checked each and every one  the documents and everything  so it was not very easy.
Then uh uh we...we knew that this...my geography was good enough for that that I knew we we re walking out of the province of Brandenburg towards Meklenburg some how  to the north  and then uh we passed by  interesting enough  one stretch wh ere we saw a terrible picture of uh dead horses and corpses and and and uh destruction because in the night before American fliers had had uh uh uh   they called it  had strafed the area and since there were also military groups  military columns marching and walking  they certainly from the height couldn't see that also refugees were there  so there were quite a number of ca sualties.
Anyway  he come back out and I turn him in to the -- interrogating officer  which was a G2 mit -- milit -- military intelligence  and they took ove r from there.
Not at that particular moment  but yes  we talked  because this group was trained to withstand the Italian army  because  you know.
Well  all the recruits in Polish Army get shaved the moment they start the military  and they keep them that way.
He says you're...they're forming a Polish army  you know  and we're going to send you there  because you always said you you want to to go back to Lwow  to Poland  so I said I know there was a Polish army ... Let me let me back up a little to the to the siege of Lenin...of Stalingrad.
That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training.
In the middle of the night the they brought big truck  military truck came up came in  pulled me out of the bed  put hand on my mouth a nd said  dont talk  be quiet .
My brother came in September and we rented an apar tment  and we lived on my brothers army pay  90 dollars a month.
But the difference it was  that the first fighting group who fights for a city is al ways the elite of the military.
It came to a point  you know  there was -- we caught -- you know  we were complete army.
After the fall of Germany  the Polish troops were being moved back to  to Poland.
Across kitty corner from that building there  there was Vacha   there was a very strong German point that the guardsmen were the Feldpolizei; that was the military police  you know Okay.
Then  was no water that the army -- the army give me a truck  they -- a soldier make on that truck -- put the big barrels  they pump the water  and I drive this water from the -- from the hospital when they -- whwhere was that water place  you know  go to the bakery for they make bread for the army  that during the night I pull water -- drive the water.
Don't forget that the Russians took hundreds of thousands of Jews eastward as the Nazi armies moved eastward  okay.
The daughter's husband was a major in the Polish army  and she was by herself in the mill.
At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government  the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army  the Danish police  everything was in place.
He used my being foreign-born  and having gone through th e Holocaust  by saying when -- during a coun-counseling session  ﬁCandi-Candidate Willner  if you beco me an officer  and the army sends you to Germany  wouldnt that be very bad that you hate those German s  and you -- because they killed your parents  and your family  and wouldnt that be very bad for the army  send you to Germany  and you would have to put up with those people  who did this?
So  he even told maybe it is a fantasy  but he told the Finnish army that he was the dictator  but dont touch [indecipherable].
And thats where -- I was saying downstairs -- excuse me -- the Salvation Army was there to greet us with coffee and donuts.
Why were you in Germany so long - after the war?
I wish we ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 actually could take a lunch break  come back  and then have David tell you about what happened after the war when he left Panama  went back and joined the Israeli Army.
Well  you know  wa it wasnt military  but it was very primitive.
And the army can be responsible  to a certain extent   provided we have the right l eaders.
And then we went to the United States with uh a former military ship  you know.
And the Soviet's Army at that particular time was fighting really to the bitter end.
indecipherable] Well  look I can understand th ey -- they -- you know  they -- what they were trying to do  I -- I wasnt beaten by the British themselv es  I was beaten by the Greek gendarmerie  who were  of course  doing the beating of -- of the -- I think the British  wa -- once I got to the detention place in Athens itself  and to [indecipherable]  once we came under English army control  people not beaten.
The Joint that was working with the American army because Okay.
When the Russians came in  in 1945  to Lemberg  he had a brother in the Polish army  which started at that time  he says any POW wants to join us fighting the Germans will be free.
Its amazing when you take out a whole army of young men  how qui ha rd it is to get anything done.
And I stayed there until the American army was firmly in Magdeburg.
Some non -Jewish young people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans.
But the guards  if there were guards  which I cant think -- you know  they were really German SS.
I went back to Germany when Im in in the military.
But everybody -- there was not one person in the German Army.
And displaced persons were being shipped to the United St ates on army transports.
My father tried to follow the progress of the Red Army   but one day there started to be rumors of what was happening to the Jews in the east.
This was called script money  it was money used by the American military personnel and those attached to them  like ANRA or the Joint Distribution Committee.
I mean  that was the front of clashes of two huge armies  and the red Army and still the Germans didn't move over to Interview with Yehuda Adam 25 the other side to the border side of the Danube to the the left bank of the Danube.
Then he was given in that place  two military schools  special for the war when the war began.
That was one of the reasons it was easier for me to attend that school because he was an officer  and I never thought being a daughter of an officer from the Polish army that I'll be treated in school the way I was treated.
Three years not serving  but every year during vacation  going for four weeks training [indecipherable] in the military  and so on.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 6 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ing at--at--at the Russian soldiers in the back.
My father did just that  and he handed the note to the soldier and and the soldier took back the note to the army commander and then the door opened and he was let in  and the army commander went to see him.
Then the mobilization came and we were sent to on the guard duty in in the city as a Im writing in my memoirs  there will be no our students were not quite military minded at all  you know  they might have m-ma de made a a a play out of it  and it was a serious thing  so we we were removed from the guard duty and sent to a place where there were no people.
So  even though I could have stayed on in Germany for another year or two or three  because at that time I was both a student and earning some decent money where I could take girls out on dates and go to the opera and so on and had an imposing uniform and being an 15:18: officer  the Germans respected more than anything else  Herr Leutnant  they would flatten themselves because if it's a military rank the Germans would respect that  no matter who that is.
They were one of the first to be deported to Auschwitz.
But still  she came to some decision that there was no point to staying or she was tired of it -- That there was no -- no -- yes  I mean  it was facing the Naz -- ee -- ee -- the Nazi popu -- of course  my husband was in the Americ an army and he said when they came -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 50 when they occupied Germany  there was not one Nazi to be found.
And Hitler attacked accusing Poland that Polish troops went and attacked the radio station in Germany   and thats what he told the Germans  that he sends the army over there  and they came .
I mean not so much the... fighting for th e Polish Army  not between yourselves.
And even on the way when we walked the German army came in.
In those times  you know  I wouldn't say I was very proud to be in Russian army  but I actually had no feelings  is what I want to say  I had no feelings.
We dug for whatever food we could in the forest and we stayed in the forest and eventually we saw the Russian army come in and take over  and we went out.
And then I-I think through Major Shike or somehow  we got a Russian military truck to take us along  who was going to Berlin anyway  also with all our luggage.
Our camp experiences and the time there  lets say  perhaps the some of the years th at we spent in the army together.
I threw it away somehow because I thought it would indicate that I have been in the French army  which was right  but the strange coincidence is that there were three 7's  and here I have four 7's on my...here. (
I know they grabbed many watches and an army  as an army and any army that comes in first  you're better off not to encounter with them  but somehow we made it to Debrecen  and stayed for a few weeks with a Jewish family in Debrecen.
Again  the Maginot Line was the most beautiful military constr uction ever conceived.
I was kept there til March the 15th or eight -- 16th  and as I ex-expressed my desire to study medicine  I was assigned to a military hos pital.
Do you remember your training  what what training  army training was like?
And so everybody was vetted very carefully  and although we came under the ausp ices directly of UNRRA  we were also responsible directly also  to the British military government.
And that fact was brough t to my attention by the chaplain  and one sergeant in the American army  in that Jewish committee.
>> Bill Benson: Before we turn to the events after Hitler came to power  your father was a veteran of the German Army.
02:21:00 And from Ouchy  we were taken to a quarantine  military camp.
