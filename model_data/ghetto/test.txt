They use to sell their furs and before they went to the ghetto  he gave--they gave their furs to some Lithuanian people they know and so she couldn't go out of the ghetto and they were gonna pay them back with food--I think like that.
This ghetto  to my knowledge  was not like the Warsaw ghetto where there was physical resistance  of fighting.
The only thing they did in the ghetto is to look.
I mean  ya -- did someone say -- Ha -- well -- -- go to the ghetto?

You...your...your wisdom and your courage and I...what you have done in the ghetto for the three years  you have shown that you have enough power will and you'll...you'll make it  and this is what gave me the courage really to escape and it was very  very exciting for us and we embraced and we kissed each other and then I left his home  two...after midnight  two-thirty after midnight.
How did you know that the ghetto was be ing established in were talking about the ghetto in Krakow .
And so I went to the ghetto the next morning because they kept th e ghetto closed that day  but the next morning they again let the workers go out and people come in .
We took it as it came inside the ghetto  and what happened outside didn't have any influence any way.
Little did they know that these ghetto Jews knew how to fight and were better fighters at times than the others were too.
So he went to that apartment  we came in his house.
Of course  there were accusers  people who found them in the camp  and came and told how he extracted money from them in a ghetto somewhere  and then sent their son off for deportation.

As luck would have it  at that particular time  the German officers were at the gates of the Wilno Ghetto  and they poked the truck and here I come out.

5 ten years  they would liquidate the entire ghetto without firing one shot; because the statistics showed that every month more people died and died.
Was it -- was it dangerous for you to walk on [indecipherable] At that time it wasnt that dangerous because the ghetto was still open  there was still a lot of communication.

At night they would raid the ghetto  they would come in for a sport ki nd of thing  and would just find a few Jews and hang them on the street lanterns.
The whole episode of mine going through  uh  the small part in ghetto or concentration camp  all that  it really hit me in the later years.

There was a section in the city where a lot of poor Jews lived.
My grandmother came to us and stayed with us and went to ghetto with us.
I remember he was a very good looking man  and she was 10 years older than me and it was a tragic that he was killed while wanting to take her out of the ghetto.

By being in ghetto  they bur ned down the hospital  with the ch ildren  with the doctors  with the nurse  across from the place where we used to live  and theres a site.

They were taking the young people everyday to work outside the ghetto.
But all of the people who maybe lived not in Slobodka before the war  they had to come to the ghetto also?
Its a big sabotag e [indecipherable] and all the -- to -- young kids  they said they worked with -- for a ye -- they worked for police  they worked  you know  from 98 the ghetto they went out to work to the police  railroad police  those who carried the prisoners and thing  or my people are [indeci pherable] to the camps  or those prison -- those have a police force  they have a police force and they worked for them.

Mother said we have to find something to do that would take us out of the ghetto.
We were very  very close he and I. Then my father took the baby  my grandfather took me and got us into the command tr uck  out of the ghetto  and then drove us to Mr. Bere czki's.
And  realizing this  I started to try  to eat everything that I  that they would give me  and I would force my sister to do the same  but then  I met  I met um  a friend of mi ne  I recognized her  and she was in a different um block and she was very happy to see me  because we were friends from the ghetto  so she told me that I should come to her block  but hers wa s a children block  that only children were there  from  it was from 14 and up.
That were outside the ghetto  did you hear those; did you know they were going on?
They were understaffed of after the war  we found out he was a prisoner in a ghetto in Lithuania  and I didn't meet him till after the war.
We 26 worked in this camp  and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed the ghetto and there was not any more work.
End of Tape #1 9 Tape #2 I am going to go back and ask you some questions from the very beginning.
>> Bill Benson: And your mother went first and then your grandmother went with your brother.
They took them away to the outskirts of the town which we had to dig those trenches before we run into the ghetto.
She tried to organize a group to get out of the ghetto.
And then when we were in the ghetto  of course  it was very important that you do do some work  that you do something that might justify your existence  so to speak.
The images that Ive heard from anybody whos in the Warsaw ghetto was of leaving bodies out in the street  covered with newspaper and all that  I mean --?
So when they rounded us up to take us to the ghetto  they marched in and we had to leave again all our belongings.
They were also prisoners like but it was families   not like we lived in the ghetto.
I will give him a blow  and I will jump to ghetto.
They used to have thread  they used to have things when the ghetto was still open  the Polish people used to come in and buy it or trade.
Somebody  one of the German soldiers or an SS man noticed you or --?
The Germans would see somebody outside of the ghetto and didn't think that he looked -- thought he looked a little Jewish  they would ask him to drop his pants.
We went from Warsaw to this town where my parents were too.
And every year  when there is  how they say  the day they  the memorial se rvices  the day that they passed away  that is a prayer for the dead that is said  so every year  you put candles on and I used  so I knew what the date for my mother  but for my father I didn't know  so I had a date   I took and arbitrary date for the liquidation of the Vilna ghetto  so I  it is just around the high holidays  so this is when I  when I mourn my father.
One day she came and vi sited me  and I was glad to see her and  you know  hear news about our friends because she was that link  that courier who  between the ghetto and outside people.
>> Bill Benson: What about your schooling in those early years?
He -- If he tried to escape  he probably was caught by the Germans  by the Gestapo.
As we were dr iving into Kielce  I suddenly remembered the address of the house and the street where we were in the ghetto.
When we walked through the ghetto to work after the entire ghetto was empty  it was a very weird feeling and the streets  open windows  flowing curtains blowing with the wind.
When he came back he told us how wonderful it was to get three meals a day and to be able to rest and all of us in the ghetto dreamed about going there even for such a short while and being treated like that.
And every day thousands and thous ands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the ghetto to eat.
We... One day  there was  there were si gns all over  posters  that said all the Jews must go  find a place to live in the ghettos  it's the ghetto was really the collection point for the future deportations to Transnistria.
And so that was and I think  but ri ght now I dont remember  but I think that the gate  very often before the insurrection in in the ghetto  the little children sometimes were walking here and there  maybe begging or something  and I think that Germans allowed that.
The fact is that in the population of the ghetto  in our neighborhood  in our house  also in the organization and the most of the members were not males  but females  girls.
And our ghetto was organized before large towns had ghetto because we already had a ghetto in June 1941  which was very early.
One of the instances happened when all the men of our family were away on the work details and my mother was  that particular day  off and my grandparents  my grandmothe r was taking care of me when the German guards came in and surrounded a quadrant of the ghetto  and took us out for another selection.
They grew up as Lithuanian  as Poles  th-the whole family perish  and they get -- 59 Let -- lets pick up the story of -- of -- of where we ended it a bit ago  you were actually telling about the liquidation of the ghetto.
Leaving the ghetto  we all went on those cattle trains  supposingly that we are going to another Right.
And that is torture what few time he had to do it or other wise he was not exposed to the outside of the ghetto.

But as far as providing food  and I remember my sister was having a baby in ghetto.
Korolowka to the ghetto  and you had talked ab out the birth of your baby brother.
And they were not allowed -- we were not allowed to walk out from that ghetto.
They just gave us a few houses separated them an d then all the Jews from spread out towns had to go to a Ghetto.
So my grandmother was taken away from her apartment and was put in what is called a hidden house  a Jew house.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ETA HECHT page 14 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: never really looked on the back of the picture because it was in an album.
They...they put everybody in thegates...and some type of Jewish police and...uh...and the leaders of the ghetto triedto keep some ki nd of order  so as to try to present us in Io S ;=b guess a better light  and so not to upset the Germans  you 15 know  when...when we walked in front of them.
I think they uh--the one thing  they never submitted any list of people to be killed like there are so many in other ghettos  they forced the uh the ghetto  in the state to give a list of people they--they didn't want to be responsible for picking people.
They thought it was going to be a ghetto and soon the war is going to stop.
We don't know where to go  what to do  but my father had two  cousins in the ghetto and we didn't know.
When the Warsaw uprising -- before the Warsaw  I -- we was organized.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 33 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Soviet Union  and I was very very lucky to get out from there.
Uh  one of the things  if I may just say something  the way they liquidated  the Germans  the way they liquidated the ghetto is by telling people  \ Take your belongings  take your tools if you're a  if you're a  a  a professional  whatever you are  a carpenter  or whatever  and we  what we doing  we're relocating you  this was the German strategy away from ghetto  at least in Lodz  and I know this from a fact from a lot of people that been in ghetto  and this is what they tell them  that they relocate them  due to the war  the Russians coming in or whatever.
Like  I guess  you can move in  bring in the ghetto    certain -- each person  a couple  what do you call it  pack?
Suddenly the ghetto is being made smaller in stead of there being forced blocks.
There was the media from all over the world  the orchestra played  we all appeared in striped jackets with our numbers on the left side of the chest  and um  I sang ghetto songs.
So  it wasnt taken away when you went into the ghetto?
S-So that was -- his story was -- didnt end yet because soon after  we -- groups -- we had a resistance group in the ghetto  and we escaped.
This one fellow who kept us at the beginning and who said to us  \ Don't go back to the ghetto  I have no gain for you going back to the ghetto.
When I looked outside of the window  there were buses lined up in front of the gate and I could see that the Ukrainians and Germans were taking the children into the buses.
I want you to begin by describing the deportation to the brick factory  courtyard  and I want you to give a context  your age  your town  who it was  and roughly what time it was  and how you went there  what you thought was happening.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 17 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: dren.
To tell you also that when we came to the ghetto  there was somebody who was distri buting the apartments.
3Poland but she took me out of the ghetto on Christmas Night and she took me to her house and took very good care of me.
So  we lived in my uncle's house until they closed the ghetto.
When I came to the ghetto  I couldn't find my father because the they made the ghetto smaller every time they made it  they the people had to move in different places.
But my family members did manage to return whenever they worked outside of the ghetto  they came back to the ghetto.
You and -- and your family escaped the ghetto  is that correct?
They had some plans  they had set up their way of doing things  and uh  they decided that one day  was the 28th of November in 1941  that there are too many people in the ghetto  old ones and chil-children  crippled one  and they can't feed that many.
And then we heard that the people there  the Pollacks  they was talking  that nobody's in ghetto already  and there is no ghetto.
We -- It -- We did -- there was a Jewish section  too  but the ghetto was later.
And we walk in to that room and everybody from the people  all the people asking what is happening in ghetto  what is happening in ghetto.
Uh a certain segment of the population from the ghetto was taken to work either cleaning or doing whatever the Germans needed done...laundry or uh some of them were shoemakers or uh tailors.
They -- all of they gave that the Jews had the right they should build theirself a ghetto.
But when the ghetto was established  it wasnt the medieval ghetto  it was everybody was crowded in  in the small place  tak they didnt work in their professions  they had to work outside  you know  s-simple some digging or something.
03:10:18 Do you think within the ghetto life was any different for women and men?
This school consisted of both the per -- teaching personnel and students  of remnants of people that were in the ghetto.
So she told me  come  we will go th -- to this -- to the -- in the direction of the ghetto  maybe we will learn something.
And then in the ghetto  we were put in the worst apartment  and every day we were marching outside.
16 That time they made the ghetto  they put fence  walls from concrete  sometimes from bricks and they started to close up the ghetto.
We were in what was used to be that time was a small ghetto at first.
Only because we were keeping one...because we hired...uh...a... goy with...with a wagon  with...with...with horses to put some belongings over there  to take to the ghetto.
And they used to come in  the SS  and the -- the mayor  Burgermeister  and all the ot her re -- you know  German in the ghetto  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 106whatever they needed at  they asked for.
13 Lillian: Part of my family was in the bi g ghetto.
People in the Budapest ghetto survived because the Nazis just didn't have enough time.
The last victims of its killing machine were transports from Slovakia and The resienstadt Ghetto  in addition to Birkenau inmates whose fate was sealed by the last mass selections that took place in the fall of 1944.
So  yes  we did have police and we did have a Judenrot  but they were a part of the Jewish community of the Ghetto  which was not true in other Ghettos.
And then they liquidated second part of th e ghetto which was in a different part of Warsaw and they brought ev erybody to this part where we were.
>> Bill Benson: If you don't mind  when I first met you 16 years ago  you told me about this  you described that scene when you entered the ghetto.
He was a very known figure even in all the ghetto  even outside the organization.
02:10:28 You mentioned sabotage  was there sabotage in these factories in the Lodz ghetto?
We arrived in Wilno and we were able to go in into the ghetto without any problem.
So the life in Warsaw per se was completely disrupted and I can be witness to this because I lived outside of the ghetto as an Aryan and I was moving  I wasn't hiding.
You didn't need to be in a ghetto at the time either.
But the...the Germans...uh...the underground...uh.. .became very powerful  not powerful   dominating in the Warsaw ghetto and....uh...the Jewish pe ople realized that there...that this is the only way now is to stand and before everybody was looking to.. .to find some food.
Number one  in every ghetto  the same in this ghetto  there was always a big black market.
Mother was working with people as I told you before  and she was the one who had helped to organize the soup kitchens for the people who were coming  brought to the ghetto and they were bringing constantly people because they needed people to work in the factories.
They went on -- yeah  th-the -- well -- well  the resista -- in the ghetto -- the resistance in the ghettos is -- this is resistance.
So these werent part pa -- these werent people from the ghetto  these were suppliers -- Ghetto -- ghetto -- ghetto people.
When your  when the ghetto began to be liquida ted did your father come back from the labor force?
So before they lock the ba ghetto  so we walk I walk with my friend to him  he got in the back  in his kitchen.
And like I say  we are not too far away from the smaller ghetto and other people going to houses here.
That's the way they dreamed  and my men finally came off the off the bus and they surrounded them and we had a real - my men always have little food or a little schnapps and then they had the party that they didn't have in the ghetto in Shanghai.
>> Bill Benson: It wasn't long before all the Jews of Warsaw were forced to move into what would become known as the Warsaw Ghetto.
Tell me a little bit more of what life was like in the Ghetto itself?
And I have to tell you the way the German organized the starting of Vilno ghetto.
And because of that situation in our ghetto in terms of hunger  until about 42 was not that bad.
You see  when I came to ghetto  I lear ned Yiddish  I learned it and I met there a lot of people that in normal times  even they were Je ws  I would never come in contact with them; so it was like a very bi g cultural revelation for me and a very big teaching  said what very bi g teaching that  so I spoke fluent Yi ddish and I spoke fluent  of course  Polish.
They...the SS decided to make a ghetto in our town  in Vilno and there a poor section where a lot of Jews used to live there and the Jewish home for the aged was there.
No the same  we lived through exactly the same.... (Husband) Listen you can tell when I went into the ghetto and I got shot through the collar. (
You can save your own honor and your own life by postponing the transfer of the remnants of the ghetto Kovno to Germany 4 days.
They -- first of all they established the ghetto  and they -- and the first one wasnt so bad because they -- all they wanted is the perimeter around it to clean up  and of course 64 people were given 48 hours  you know  and take what they can carry with them  and go in.
There was a crazy man  he was playing the violin in this ghetto.
So thif thats first thing what they get for  you know  to to bring food to the ghetto.
Wh en they moved to the ghetto  Mrs. RG-50.030*0580 37Fryman  Mr. Fryman and Dora Fuchs and her father were there  and and those were the people who came with them  and were part of the people.
You know  so no one Jew on the street  only father was  and he went to the stores where he make business  and was still making business after -- almost wh en the Ghetto start.
When  unfortunate ly  when the ghetto was organized  she...she came to the ghetto and she was together with us.
No  just one day they said everybody from the Ghetto into the this and this part.
Now  is that where you lived  or wer -- later were there -- was there a [indecipherable] No  I think that is a mistak e. It was no ghetto in Turka.
And she wa s from a little town somewhere  but she spent time in the ghetto  and from there  also came to Auschwitz  so we have been in the same ca mp  afterwards.

Wh en the war started  not yet the Ghetto  when the Germans came in  hunger came with them.
Again the ghetto was made smaller  they took people  so you had to move somewhere else.
But you had a -- Unless a -- I would -- I dont know  I probably didnt look very much Jewish  or something.
And can you explain again  where -- is your brother living in the ghetto and working outside or . . .
Well in Radun  we  what we did  we didn't do nothing  well the men they used to go to work for the Germans  but there was a ghetto.
The only ghetto that turned into a concentration camp was the Kovno ghetto.
They said they need to to to make order to divide between those who get more bread and those who get less bread  and they killed ten thousand so this that we had no confidence whatsoever and we made up our minds no more response to...and then they tried...they started to grab people from the street  and they could grab three hundred because most of the people from the ghetto were at work outside the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the people  so they took these three hundred and brought them to the place  to the democratic square.
So everybody knows everything about the extermination of the Jews  how it works in the Krakow ghetto  how it works then  in the concentration camp of Plaszow Mm-hm  Plaszow .

I wanted him to go with me to escape from the ghetto  and we could not escape together  I mean   the whole family together  so we really had to separate.

It's coming from the Warsaw Ghetto said our generation is dying out now.
In the ghetto  there was no more than about a thousand to 1200 people.
It was when they had the large selection  th ey liquidated the small ghetto first  put them into the big ghetto  as the big ghetto started getting less populated  as they were liquidating the  what was it  ten thousand I think  that they killed in that big  no thirty thousand in big selection  then the big ghetto had room  they liquidated the small ghetto into the big ghetto and took the bridge away.

The first thing was  they took us from our homes  and they put us into a ghetto.
No  I did get there  but this letter and the request for work was only for me to be able to travel  because otherwise I couldnt get out  being Jewish  I couldnt get out of the ghetto.
Because I remember standing right next to it when the people from ghetto in rows of four started coming out and very slowly th ey were marched with the SS men and the dogs and the whole business.
W e knew that things were going to happen  we knew that there's preparations  but because we got out about ten days before  I really have no knowledge of actually what happened  except from what I was reading I only can tell you that when we were outside of the ghetto and we stayed not far away -- of course the burning ghetto could be seen from miles and miles away and when the ghetto started it was just one glob of fire  you could see that all this area was burning and a lot of streets outside of the ghetto were cordoned off.
And there was raining  it was right after Passover  between Passover and [indecipherable] we were in the ghetto.
And that is something that when we consider that there was practically no help from the outside  a nd even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto  how difficult it was to obtain weapons  and you know  how very -- even for money -- I mean  people would  on the outside  w ould promise you weapons  and then you would come and youd find empty shells or you know  corroded things that didnt work.
So  he crawled out from that after they left and somebody helped him out  and he came back to the ghetto  and he told the story.
He gave me also job called elbote that I was...I worked in the ghetto.
I...I suppose my parents encouraged it  but I really was always a bit of a bookworm and I... So this was  as I said  things started and...and nobody...nobody realized what...what was going to happen because  again  I am painting a...I am giving you a kind of picture of...now  of cour se  with it...uh... things started to happen in the ghetto.
03:29:30 At the start of the liquidation of Kovno ghetto  the last few days Goecke  personally  and  and  and Berman or Breller   his assistant -- I don't really remember him.

And he -- it was very dangerous I remember  until I saw him again co ming from work  from out the ghetto  knowing that he is carrying something.
And we went to the building of the Judenrat  I mean like the government of the ghetto [indecipherable].
German) 41 liquidated the ghetto there was the German to go to take out the peoples  took the little children  little babies by their feet and they smash their heads on the wall and -- and the government doesn't know  the United States government don't know  the government from England doesnt know -- they know everything but nobody lift their little finger  because maybe  because they are Jews  but maybe -- they don't kill not just Jews.
Many of the ghetto residents were religious and some were secular.
My father got out during the uprising  the ghetto uprising through the sewers.
Uh  I worked in the bakery and the uh bakery was obvi- ously was baking bread for--for the ghetto residents.
We went to a place in the ghetto where it was sparsely occupied because it was only land and it was called Marishein (470).
You know  the giving up your whole place  the ghetto  the brick factory.

I mean there were  one of the first people that my father found killed in the ghetto was a close friend of his named Roman Kroms ztyk who was a very well -known Polish artist.
A nd the reason why he want to or wanted to join the ghetto police force was that the ghetto police had double rations  and he wanted to bring the ration home.
And if we succeeded by clandestine methods...my father succeeded or you succeeded in the...from the ghetto  you...Altestenrat to get serum  it was always given too late.
And whoever survived the ghetto is a testimony that Vilnius was very well run as far as the feeding  the hospital.
Well  you know  as much as I dreaded going to the ghetto  um  actually in some ways  it was a little easier for me because my friends were there  you know  I was not as isolated as I had been at home  when we had curfew and I could see my friends only at a certain time  and it was dangerous to go out anyway  but still we were uh  I was closer to my friends  so um  that somewhat compensated for  for the treatment so  so you know in  in  in every little room another tragedy played.

Uh the synagogue was in a section called the ghetto which was the real ghetto  the type uh that  uh the word itself means  you know  where the Jewish were kept  but this was right outside the public square so most of the Jews didn't live there.
Evidently they had to report to the German authorities how many Jews they have in the ghetto and they had to  to give exact numbers.

And we -- And couple weeks later  they round up all the Jews from the city and around the city  suburbs and they put us all in this place and surrounded us with walls and a gate.

It wasn't really let's all survive  at that point and again I think because of Wallenberg...the ghetto was undermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute  but I think because of Wallenberg we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids and a lot of fighting  but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that liberation couldn't be too far off.

It was the ghetto  which was an area that was totally enclosed.
So  we decided to run and we ran to a ghetto in Tarnow  which just had an Aktion.
Sometimes twice a week from the ghetto  because they needed food.
We organized also in that small ghetto some kind of resistance against...a few of us.

And so when you were in for forced labor  were you living in the ghetto?
He begged me that I will come here and I will bring you back to the ghetto.\

And we set up the ghetto pretty good  the doctors -- the doctors set up a sort of hospital inside to handle the sick people  and everything was working  organized.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 16 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Weve got to reload. (
We had  during the war  when we kne w that they are going to take our apartment away  that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto  we had neighbors.
Not precisely but one day we got a decree that Ghetto is being liquidated.
And of co urse the test came when I came across this one document in this It was the a collection of documents from the Kovno ghetto police.
It pass just the ghetto and it was from one Christian side to the other.
>> Bill Benson: The question is how did you walk out of the ghetto?
But the ghet -- but the ghetto mone y functioned inside the ghetto  right?
With so little  whatever they had -- with so little  you know  they stood out and they couldnt and the Germans had to bomb them out  in order -- can you imag -- in Warsaw ghetto  with so little.
They would raise  they would kill the drivers and take They were escaped from the ghetto.
Q. But you're saying in the Ghetto  y ou really didn't have actions and all sorts of reprisals against the people and roundups?
So my parents could put in my name and that's how I got into the ghetto.
They filled the ghetto with droves of Jewish people driven out from surrounding areas.
We had to move from th ere and we had to go to the ghetto.
Do you remember any circumst ances which were around it  cause you were in this privileged part of the ghetto  and how did that work?
And when you go t to the ghetto did anyone ask \ Where's my mother.
He was sending me people  the most important people in the ghetto yes.
While we meaning my--my parents and two more brothers  myself slept in one room in the other room.
Everytime a German pickup like this came into the Ghetto  everybody ran because you never know when they're going to catch up  but I was a little from far I could recognize these were airmen.
But this one  she said to me  I -- I -- I -- no  we going to sleep  because we had -- i-it was already in the ghetto  and we were -- she went to the house  and she told her -- she had a maid  and she told her maid to tell my mother that theyre going to sleep.
And then when I went into the kibbutz  the kibbutz pa id part of it.
Instinctively  you felt that you had much more chances outside the ghetto than inside  you know.
I -- I -- I was very eager to -- to learn  and my girlfriend had a -- my girlfriend formers teacher -- former teacher  was giving lessons  and -- but she was in the -- close to the ghetto  but not in the ghetto proper  just -- I think close to the ghetto.
As time went on in the ghetto and it was quasi-quiet.
So  when th ey liquidated the Ghetto  what they did is they took the Jews from the Ghetto and send them to a different so called camp.
So that gives you a picture of what the Germans -- how my parents felt about the Germans.
When the S.S. when they became the head of the ghetto.
The younger one and the daughter were not  and they were hiding out in the ghetto for a little bit and all the Jews there were so scared of their own well-being  of their own survival  they were ready to to uh give them back to the Germans  give them away  and the son did escape and uh really became a hero in the in the partisans  but we don't know for sure whether they survived or not  but that was a very good example where what do you do for the good of the community.
Some were -- but I were -- like I told you that my sister went to a family and she want to pick up someth ing to eat  and a son [indecipherable] went out through the other door and bring the Gestapo and she was arrested.
At that time that our team had just found when the Germans left  when the Russians came and the Germans left Lodz  the ghetto  they left all the records there.
>> I visited the synagogue in Budapest  downtown  beautiful  giant synagogue.
And during the tim e of the ghetto  in this school were located lots of people who came in in the ghetto  and in every room were 25 - 30 people.
Youre in the ghetto  youre in this building  youre not going out  youre not getting much food  and then what happened?
I suppose after the ghetto we were put into cattle cars.
And another about our  that is where I married   in the ghetto  again  we were very young and da ring and so we  yes?
To go out  outside; in the ghetto you could do nothing.
What was the two brothers that came from the Warsaw ghetto to us?
I don't know exactl y. Because uh  it was much harder on them  whereas the Jew from the East  a Polish Je w family who had always had a hard life  where lived in a ghetto maybe and who was poor   and didn't have all the rich foods  he was able to resist much better in a concentrate  for a longer period of time.
One would be the first time when we came from work  when I saw the Judenrat  the 12 hanging at the entrance to the ghetto.
And Gens told the leadership  the resistance leadership  that if he doesn't gi ve himself up  they are going to come and destroy the ghetto.
And this woman  Vera  risk of her life  and sh e went there -- she we nt -- and next day she brought my boyfriend Josef the le tter from my mother  and he brought it in the second ghetto  and telling that my mama is alive and she is together with my father on to -- in the [indecipherable].
>> Bill Benson: Were you in there with your whole family?
There was a -- a sickum  what they called  and there was a doctor  a fellow who I knew from ghetto  who -- he did one year to graduate medical school from -- from Italy  but he was only a shop.
You had to learn a lot really fast in the ghetto.
So when I speak about us as young girls in ghetto  they try to -- try to bring this to the previous saying  that oh yes  I was once young  and how did I got into the situation?
They put us -- and have to go back to the ghetto -- and they march us back to the ghetto.
Part of the ghetto yes  but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was a big bridge.
Germans came in and they said that they re going to have a ghetto  theyre just going to have us together  just for the duration of the war  and then they planned a ghetto and then they made the ghetto and Which is near where?
In that city ghetto they took the last ones off us.
But in the meantime in Auschwitz  you know -- I dont know  Im going back and forth.
And we have a very beautiful synagogue in the middle of Budapest  and all the houses around it became the ghetto.
Uh  which I follow up a little later  the reason my father knew what is happening in Auschwitz is that he was getting in ghetto by short wave radio  information from England  London  which was hidden in ghetto.
In other words  I wasn't taken immediately to Germany  but to this transit camp which was still in our ghetto.
Did you think when you first got that that the ghetto had be en cleared specifically for you in therefore you wo uld be safe?
So  there weren't a lot of beatings or anything like that in the ghetto?
Because both in the Ghetto Uprising and in the Warsaw Uprising soldiers used the sewers to travel under the city  some of the entrances were open.
Then we were told that we will have to leave our apartment and to move to a section which was designated as ghetto.
So did your -- did anything change about your living conditions once this became a ghetto?
The -- the ghetto in Pruzana  would -- how is that prot ected or fenced in -- I mean -- I know what you mean.
I don't know how it  whether that is customary or was still possible at the first uh at the in the first stages of the Warsaw ghetto to write communications from there  but at any rate a letter reached me in St. Louis from the Warsaw ghetto in which of course it was a very guarded letter.
What was that like as compared to when you were living in Warsaw?
Also during the period of the fr -- while I was in ghetto.
I just didn't eat by myself and I brought bread when I ran out of the ghetto.
End of Tape #2 27 Tape #3 At the end of the last tape  you started to describe to me the fact that you and your family were taken away from the ghetto and driven to the other  the second brick factory on the outside of the town where there was a train waiting  you could see that there was a train waiting  but before you tell me what happened with your father  mother and brother  tell me what you knew at that time about the fate of othe r Jews that had been either from your town or in the region  so what could you imagine might be awaiting you at this time?
Building has to be a ghetto by the first of June or whatever it is.
>> Bill Benson: During that period that you were in the ghetto were you able to get any schooling?
By liquidating the ghetto  there was a lot of people which they belonged to uprising group  and many of them digged holes  bunkers to be hidden and also I was in...I was involved with a group which we digged a bunker  a big bunker...a bunker about 50  60 people in it.
So  do you even as a child begin to feel that your life is getting more and more constricted  or you have no- Oh  yes  not only this  but I was at a ce rtain point coming to this  even going back before the ghetto when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios and other things right after the occupation  and we were not permitted to go on the sidewalks as Jews.
AR: We hid many books when we moved into the ghetto.
So  how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the ghetto.
take out the children from -- from the ghetto  to save them.
Here the sign says that Jews living quarters  no entry  thing like that.
Some of them were even arrested in the ghetto an d then let out.
Those items were on the Black Market  but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some middle man in the Ghetto.
And whose -- in the ghetto  were there -- were -- was anybody working during the day?
I was working  you know  in the -- in the camp.
Because every small...not don't speak about the the commisar or the deputy commisar who was responsible for the ghetto was himsel f a murderer  so a murderer...the the first 28ruler of the ghetto from th e civil authority was the deputy commisar of Kovno by the name of Jordan   and why the ...he write his name Jordan  but he was just a terrible guy.
In the Lodz ghetto they were rounding up children too  weren't they?
An-And did they tell you where they were taking you when you l -- were l-leaving the Lodz ghetto?
The man who was in charge of Lodz Ghetto was named Chaim Rumkowski.
When you were in the Warsaw ghetto  did you hear -- L -- Lvov ghetto  you mean.
This was a terrible...the most terrible day that there was in ghetto  and another day that I think I should mention... We have to uh end the interview.
He was in a -- because he came from the ghetto in Plaszow   or whatever  a camp there  and they brought him to Auschwitz  I think they -- I dont remember anybody from there in Buna.
And they have posts -- post  lets see  every couple hundred to so -- or 300 feet  a post and there is look -- see in -- hi -- l -- can look  see whats going on in the ghetto.
Schultz  at the time when it became already very  very difficult  and at a time when it was known that Obersturmbannfuhrer Goecke 30 is coming to liquidate the Kovno ghetto -- and Goecke was known by all Jews that he was the liquidator.
We did have some elderly teachers in the ghetto  Jewish teachers.
When you left your ghetto  was it easy to get out that night?
The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of Siaulai.
4 \ Ghetto Administration\  which also oversaw the activities of the Judenrat (German).
And he came to our house even  after that  and once after the war  at work  and once even they asked  ﬁOh  if there is something wrong  if youre see -- know something is wrong in the ghetto  come to us  stay in our place.ﬂ And the officer pretended he did not hear it  I remember  what he said.
AR: Number 1  the uh--the dep--prior to that they deported many people  the ghetto became very small and it--I think that they sent people out to Estonia  to Latvia and elsewhere were very often and eventually it became really a tight--eh uh--uh I don't remember how many thousands of people stayed but it was a far cry from how we started.
Now one day there were no more letters from the ghetto.
Did it become more important over time or did you lose  did you lose faith in God because of what happened or... Many times  when I was in the ghetto suffering a lot  I used to think  \ I don't think there is God because if ther e would be God  something like this wouldn't happen to my little sister and  you know \ .
I was petrified  and I didn't give away the hiding place  the hiding entrance  I marched back into the ghetto  or he threw me back into the ghetto and that was the end of that.
There  we were told we are going to move  we are going to live in a new place  and this was the ghetto.
They forced uh these Jews from the countryside to come back to Budapest and...those who had left Budapest...and they concentrated them in the old ghetto  which could support ma ybe two  three million p eople...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people  not fifty or sixty thousand people  and so there was this black  terrible hunger.
And so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a ghetto.
Now  this group used  once in awhile  us ed to come in in the ghetto  and find out and told us what is going on.
And even though in the internment camp was obviously not a ghetto  there werent -- but still  you know  you -- you -- your -- your freedom was gone again.
My brothers and I we went to Krakow  because we were going to move from this small town to Krakow.
So I told them that I was probably the last one  I was with a sister and brother together  with them  and they supposed to go also  to run away because in ghetto  nobody was left around  only a few people  these people what I met  and I was lucky that I met them because otherwise I wouldn't know where to turn and probably I would be killed  some place or in ghetto  whatever.
more -- I worked until the fall  when th e man who managed this dining hall told me that he was designated to become a member of a council of elders in charge of supply and feeding and economy  in a ghetto to be created to hold all the Jews from the Czech lands.
And what I rememb er  you ma -- from time to time the Germans were coming to the -- to ghetto  and everybody was so afraid because you know  German al -- always brought the death with them.
Because certainly you had talented people in the Warsaw ghetto and they had work shops  that they ran quite differently.
But in the area I was living there was Jewish people.
We were fortunate that my brother's apartment was in the ghetto  so we could move into his  so he had two rooms  so we moved in in one room and he had one room.
At the same time  Lithuanians were came in  the trucks  the Ghetto with trucks  and they are going from house to house to make sure that everybody was out and whoever was left didn't walk out  they were to kill them.
>> Bill Benson: What was the food conditions like for you?
So would he be -- have been considered part of -- not the Jewish Council itself  but part of the administration of the ghetto in some -- Mm-hm  yeah. --
06:27:32 We were the ones that didn't believe in defe nding the ghetto  because we thought the most it would do is kill a few Germans  but otherwise we'll all be killed out and nobody will survive.
The ghetto was completely enclosed by a high fence that was reinforced with barbed wire.
There were various soups around the ghetto where the people who worked the factories were able to get a soup.
Few later  a few weeks later  an order came out that all Jews have to get ready to be moved from their apartments into specially designated area called the ghetto.
We tried to get out Joseph Elman 21 [date] Page 21 because we had already ten men about and our organization was already outside the ghetto  in the woods.
So he would come into this -- to -- to -- into the ghetto  was still wide open  and my father would do business with him  you know  by trading  and then in some ways helping those peopl e to -- to get money to be able to buy things  and also  of course  trying to make some money for himself.
And then we find an apartment which was the last apartment before the ghetto was liquidated  which was a house on the border of almost out of town which was the borderline  but the end of the ghetto.
From the ghetto there must have been about 8 000 - 8 500 maybe  maybe 400 people came back all total.
But in Czestochowa it wasn't so terrible  there was no wall against the ghetto.
I was in -- in the ghetto for over a year  I would say  about 14 months.
And I even had the idea -- I was toying with the idea to ran away from the ghetto  to escape.

And if we thought that the...the ride from od ghetto to Auschwitz was bad  this was even worse; because this was in the wintertime and the train car were open cars.
For example  people would pour milk down the drain-pipes to the ghetto part.
We took grandpa's diary  selected sites we wanted to see; for examp le  where his house was in the ghetto.
The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it 40 seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the international ghetto and take them to the old grand ghetto and deport them.
This is a list which I told you  they gave it for the Riga ghetto in -- in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 109 November the 20th  1941.
When I have to leave -- not when I have  when I was allotted to leave the ghetto with all the ammunition and everything  at March 1944 at night through the gate of the ghetto  so at the gate of the ghetto were some people who were staying there all the time  all the -- even before and after  including they were some policemen  and they knew we were not going as it was reported by one of us that we are going outside like a team of work in the woods  but we are going to fight with partisans.
But most people came to power  came to di -- lets say we create d a sondercommando  was created in ghetto.
Before the ghetto was formed  you were already taken to go to work; is that right?
At a certain point  the Ghetto was turned into a concentration camp?
So these were voluntary ghettos  and there the Germans just drew a barbed wire around the district  and they had the ghetto.
You had described ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 that right away .
And as soon as they get out from the ghetto  I should escape.

He thought Rumkowski  with the policeme n  that came in those boots with those hats  the ------- from the ghetto  they're going to make it up big.
I don't recall exactly what it was  but I do recall that there was one very talented poet who sort of made little ditties pertaining to the ghetto and put them to music and sang it for us and making fun of our lives  yes there was some.
When I came Interview with Henry Greenbaum December 20  1999 24from the factory they did not take us back to the ghetto  we went right to the marketplace.
But they couldn't concentrate them in a ghetto because it would have taken too much time.
I I saw the the the the picture of all the people frightened to death to be in time not to remain there after the...it was just...I said this scene I must put on a drawing  and then I didn't find Esther   so I run to...there was one young...the youngest painter in the ghetto.

So  you did talk some about your brothers and then after the German occupation in March of 1944  you were moved into a ghetto.
The Zionist organizations  and I am talki ng mostly about their underground organizations because there were many organizations like parties  but they belong to more adult people  but talking about the youth movements  the Zionist youth movements of -- in the Kovno Ghetto  we are talking about three main organizations.
I remember this as a child  and in ghetto  she wa -- a ba -- baby was born.
And he was guarding the gardens in the ghetto  where we were growing some potatoes or something like that.
No  it wasn't that well organized and the elimination of the Ghetto and the move to Kaiserwald brought a halt all of that for a while.

She told me in the ghetto  and you knew -- you knew probably that she had [indecipherable] I dont know how its in -- R: Yeah  but even when people had it  not everybody could kill them -- S: No  no  I -- I think that she was a brave woman  because even with such difficult times  so -- a small amount of people committed suicide.
Next morning people started tearing down the signs of the ghetto [indecipherable] district  and the Japanese arrested them.
Before the time of the ghetto  were you considered a picky eater?
The ghetto police us to keep order in the ghetto but otherwise only special actions took place  the Germans didn't free from the ghetto that much inside.
so they -- >> Bill Benson: So  Marcel  because I know you have so much more to tell us  tell us now about being forced into the ghetto in the fall of 1942.

And here  maybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has been formed and of their functioning  that they were able to provide everybody with what little it was.
With this  in this time outside from this children home  becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people didn't...certain area what will what will be the ghetto  but the ghetto was already opened.
You know  little bit more -- the same story about the life in the ghetto  before the ghetto and all the same and I -- and -- and -- and about my parents and -- and -- and they were especially interested about the partisan  Jewish li -- Jewish -- the activities  tell me.
Most of the people were t aken out from these protected houses not to the ghetto  not to the railway station  not to be shipped to Auschwitz.
What happened was that they kept us in a ghetto until they accumulated enough Jews to put in transport.
01:29:00 I'm sorry to stop you  but I want to talk a little bit more about the orphanage before we talk about the ghetto  if you don't mind.
You see  if we would have connections with population  the rest of the Polish population it was a different story  but the ghetto was divided.
So  did you talk about the plight of the Jews in Europe?
Tell the Germans that you would like to attach those buildings to th e ghetto area.
Uh  there was one area which was a main square like where the gate from the ghetto uh was uh.
And Monday was a big sign on the door  that all Jews  women  men and children  has to stand outside the ghetto  in line  because we are going to be taken to a other concentration camp.

When you talked about the sm all ghetto and the large ghetto?
After that I had another one till the end of the ghetto  and when I went to the forests  in the end of -- when was it?
And there -- there was -- they decided to liquefy 34 the ghetto  and just leave about 50 000 people to do the cleaning wa -- to clean up  or something like it.
We returned after awhile to the ghetto to find that lots of  lots of people were taken out.
>> Henry Greenbaum: Well  from the day that we carried over the dirt  filth  from the ghetto to the slave labor camp because they took away the soap.
And at that point the Germans decided that this was a small Jewish community so there weren't that many of us left.
And they were just -- and the Germans had bombed the whole ghetto and they were just digging out the ghetto.
Did you witness any beatings or killings or suicides in the ghetto?
And I point out this thing that happened to me in the ghetto.
From inside there were the uh employees of the Jewish labor exchange who us ed to to arrange the exit of the laborers in the groups from the ghetto out to outside to th eir places of work and they were...had ways and means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German  and so they keep uh close... close an eye and and they pass by  take part of it and give them as bribe you see  but nevertheless something left  and in th is way people tried...tried not to starve  just plainly...very plain words...not to starve.
So -- Did -- did you -- have you heard -- wh at did you know about concentration camps at that point?
Here we see Erika reading a magazine in the Cernauti ghetto.
I ha ve seen them in the Warsaw Ghetto but I have never seen this  when you put all these elements together  under such circumstances.
Do I really need to explain and to tell the value of food in the ghetto when there was such hunger?
So my father was there  and my mother was in Warsaw.
But not long they liquidate the ghetto  so I had to bring my child on to Auschwitz with my sister together.
The Ghetto which was drowned in flames  left footprints that destroy wisdom.
I was in the small ghetto where the peopl e were working  but we can see the flames.
If not him not one person would survive from the Lodz ghetto because it would be annihilated in '42 they want to do it.
Some of them still left  they were liberated there  too  but its not like the Kalisz ghetto  only some  because a lot of people there in the ghetto.
But the worst part was when we were herded into a ghetto.
And of course she had also very little to eat  but a little bit more than in the ghetto  of course.
And was it in the center of town  or was it on the outskirts?
What they did is they went into all of those small towns and they made all of those people go into the woods and dig graves and then they threw them in the graves and shot them all.
There were very few S. S. men or guards in the ghetto -- I mean we were just sort of like in a steam cooker -- we were left to cook by ourselves.
There were announcements that we better go to the ghetto or else they'd be shooting us.
Even in our ghetto in Lublin  the situation was not as desperate as in Warsaw.
And when you came into the ghetto and you're registering there are almost 200 000 people  right?
That was September  and the anno uncement of the ghetto  where the ghetto would 35 be  and that by April everybody will have to be there  moved out.
You worked in this place  you worked in that place  those papers were good  these ones were not  and one never knew for sure  well  is this the final liquida tion of that particular ghetto in this locality or not?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 Marcel Drimer: In the attic.

I think I forgot to tell you like in 1942 we had a hanging in the ghetto.
An d they start to organize groups to go out for work on some places where the soldiers are  on gardens  on some plants  on some -- somewhere to work and people went out -- some were work ing inside the ghetto from the very beginning.
And you would spend your next three years in the Warsaw Ghetto.
A little girl with uh with a name Ira Berman was bringing me little sculptures she  that she did in the ghetto.
So internally theres -- there s ghetto police  and his wife -- -- okay. --

You know  we -- in -- the funny part  our own people from our ghetto build that camp.
>> Bill Benson: What was it like for you and your family when you were forced into the ghetto?
Where and how they were killed was not known at that time because we were moved from our City to the Ghetto  and yet everybody was disengaged from his everyday existence  a new existence  accommodations were very meager.

Were you able to do anything for fun or recreation while there in the ghetto?
All the Jews have to go to the ghetto towards the ghetto  and this time even my mother say  ﬁWhat you going to do here?

The fact that my mother had a sis...a brother in the ghetto and he said uh bring every...all the stuff here because when you're going to go  all you can do take is a valise.
And from different boroughs in the same day  they bring the people to the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: Even though you were in so -called open ghetto  you could not freely move to where they were because they were in a separate open ghetto?

When we came into the gate  I was the last one.
Yea h the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of other places.
Sometimes we saw this small group of Jews out of the ghetto.

Interview with Agnieszka Holland 5 Yes  and other ones stayed behind and + died in the war + except the one sister who survived and she escaped the ghetto in peculiar way.
My brother and sister were  mind you  they probably were hungary so they left the ghe...the ghetto and they were on the road from the ghetto already on the bottom  and the ghetto was not watched anymore by the Germans.

Lots of things which was happening in the ghetto  lots of details I really dont know  because  uh  I do recall that before the German invasion  life was just s normal as it could be.

He says  \ It happened  he couldn' t stay outside  he went inside the ghetto.
So if you were to walk down a street in that ghetto  it was full of people?
Well...so so at that time.. .at that time  when they liqui dated the ghetto  the small ghetto  they took thousand men from the ghetto and they liquidated to the 9th Fortress  so I didn't 63have any more in '42...it was...in '41 in the beginning I have to say prior to the aktions on on human beings  on life  they took...confiscated all the belongings and they were...when the ghetto inmates were ordered under threat of death to give all their gold  their belongings  their silver  furs    post stamps  collections...whatever valuables  and there were two stations in the in the ...near the Jewish committee where the Jews had to bring bring all their belongings and wherever they...while making the searches inside the houses  each other  and sometimes on the sp ot killing them and and this brought about the people to run and get rid of their gold  to get rid of their silver  to get rid of their of their of their furs  you see  so we didn't have any cameras anymore.
We are going to ask you again as...as directly as you can to tell us the procedure that you went through...uh...with Havier to obtain that safe pass and how you then find yourself through the ghetto experience back in the Spanish safe house.

I remember when I was board ing train on my way to port Gdansk to go to Sweden  the messenger came and gave me  I be lieve it was a battery or something  you know  battery for a torch and said  \ You have to take it  this is a report  the story of the extermination of Jews and of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.\
My cous ins  aunts  uncles  my mother's sister that was in the big ghetto they didn't have much more.
It took time  but in the meantime I asked Gros what happened and I was telling him the story because I didn't know what's happened in Tuchin  what has...so he was telling me and I found out the truth  that after when they burned the ghetto  my...when I was running through the woods  my father  my sister  they were stayed together and some twenty other people what work ed in the factory and Gros himself went to the bunker.
Like I said  my mother's sister  my grandparents  cousins  they were all in the big ghetto.
And I know if I will catch  the next thing that will take me to the ghetto.
Well  actually I personally have no experience of the uprising because we were fortunate enough to leave the ghetto maybe two weeks prior to the uprising.
As I told you  the dwellings in the ghetto were very old and there were mainly secret...many passages and many rooms that men used to put very heavy commodes or a big dressing...uh...piece of furniture and camouflage the door and behind the door there was a little room or a cellar or a attic and people used to just sit there all the time when the Germans  the Ukrainians  or the Lithuanians used to run to the ghetto and take anybody.
Yeah  you wanted to ask me about -- About the ghetto.
So even my father who was employed in the ghetto had to go out--outside.
Well  in ghetto  I was not very long because I had been taken from the street on the 28th of February uh 1940  on the 28th of February 1940  the Germans had a -----------  which we call  which means they came to the streets  and  and just surrounded all the people that they wanted and then shipped them out of ghetto into different camps  and this happened to me on the 28 th of February 1940  which they call it the-------------  in German  the ------------------  which means the Bloody Thursday  where a lot of people got killed and  and transported at that time.
And after they start to evacuate the ghetto  to take to Majdanek  to Treblinka  and the peoples they start to know they kill these people.
And th ere was maybe about 10 people  they laying outside of the ghetto.
And I knew on Yom Kippur in 1943  a transport came to our camp from Graben...from Auschwitz  and among the women that came were women from our ghetto and they were different.
We stayed in the ghetto  I think  a couple of months they came to the ghetto -- after the couple of months  this was a regular living.
How did you manage to get in and out of the ghetto when you went to visit your family?
I left the ghetto in 1944 and my pare nts were still there.
To own a book was an act of defiance  was considered a capital crime yet all over the ghetto people had secret libraries.
They was in ghetto  in Ch and they was killed in Ch ghetto.
Now  many people were able to escape from there  and earlier from that -- From the -- -- city ghetto  even from brick factory  and when I first mentioned it to my father  actually we were in our apartment yet because the first question came up.
So you did not go with the entire family when they went to the ghetto?

And there was a small number of people who were deported from the ghetto for the purpose of working in Germany  or in the territories.
But at last  in last minute  in th e court  one of the -- well  clerks  law clerks told my father  this judge who lives in ghetto  one of judges who lives in ghetto and who is in the same situation.
From then on  people who became ill  first they stayed in their rooms  then there was no room in the rooms and you'd walk down the ghetto street and you would see people sick  or dying  or dead  and there was a committee within the Judenrat who was in charge of burying the dead.

Somehow they managed to get back to the Warsaw Ghetto  to Treblinka.
You tried only -- I tried to avoid always not to work for the SS  not to work for Gorajetski  because he was ending up taking the men into the camp  which I said th-they never came back to -- to -- to the ghetto.

It wasnt like -- it wasnt like being in the ghetto  you know  that every week it got a bit worse and more people are dying and -- and people are dying of starvation and what ever else  of illness  and you know.
It was very important for me that they in their leisure time could have talks about Zionism   about Israel  about the events in Jewish history  sing Palestine songs  so I came to some let's say understanding...we didn't sign any contract... with the the communist lead er in the ghetto who later as I said they had also their own underground.

But later on when it was already close to evacuate Krakow and Schindler tried to organize a larger group  we knew that people who  either who liv ed in ghetto or previously who had some means to get on the list  I never -- in Krakow I was quite already  what did you call this then  Muselmann.

At that time 2 days later  the ghetto was set afire.
The ghetto became more and more less run by the Jewish administration  and the Germans had more of a part.
The front is coming closer and if you don't provoke the Germans to liqui date the ghetto he has a chance to save the Jews in the ghetto.

And when the Germans came in  they threw us out of this apartment in that ghetto.
But  we used to get together with friends  you know  and since our ghetto was not closed ghetto  it was an open ghetto  it means that part of the town wh ere there was a large concentration of Jews was  got to be a little more crowded with the fact that there were newcomers coming through from territories that were incorporated in the Reich  and also the few who lived not really in Jewish sections were forced to move out and to move into the designated ghetto area  and this is what happened to us in the 40s.
I took my family  my mother and three sisters and we went out of the ghetto and we stayed overnight in an empty house.
Sometimes people fainted dead away  in these lines  but we had no choice  you see Ghetto Lodz had thousands of people  not only from Poland  but they had people from all over Europe.

No  those who were in the house  they were allowed to stay  which is obvious  I mean  anybody who would have been tosse d out would have had to go to the ghett o. And it was  to most people  it was clear that eventually the ghetto is going to be annihilated.

Well  I oh uh I know  uh  uh  we all were in the ghe tto of Krakow  and by that time I was already married  and the ghetto of Krakow comparing to ghetto of Warsaw was not as terrible when my mother could not stay  when she stayed with us in Krakow during the pre-ghetto days  when ghetto was established  oh  oh even before that uh people who came after September  1939  to Krakow  who were not uh before that then  had to leave the city  and they could choose  uh  any city or town within the gen  gen  general government  which wa s not the Deutshe Reich  the uh German Reich proper  so she chose to go to Warsaw  and for a  uh maybe twice I went to visit her with a special permission.
A. The Ghetto was very  very bad  and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything  if they heard about a good job that was outside  that the Germans took you away  they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were Sam Spiegal 12 May 3  1995 going to take you to a concentration camp or somewhere else.
And what happened is that my brother  and my father   who were in Kovno  were placed in the Kovno ghetto.
So f 1940  everybody got to move into the ghetto  and the ghetto was closed.
But then then it was yeah  and I wasnt in in the I was in the ghetto  yeah  and always in the ghetto they they catch people in the street  and they kill them.

When Teresa asked you whet her you felt privileged about being on the last transport  did you feel privileged in terms of your whole ghetto ex perience  given the position that you had in the ghetto?
SB: Let me ask you about the liquidation of the ghetto.
We are expecting the liquidation of the ghetto a day later.
It is ont a complete diary documenting all the events in the ghetto  but we compiled the collection of documents  the orders received by the leadership to preserve evidence for the future--evidence about the prepara- tion  preparators who were responsible for conditions in the ghetto.
So you were working at the time when the Germans came in.
When the ghetto was taken out  the destruction of the ghetto  what do you think happened the next few days?
21 The ghetto formed shortly after -- shortly after in either -- it had formed already in April  and the transport stopped in the very beginning of May. Oh  so you were only in the ghetto for a short time?
But I always thought about Israel  I remember actually in the ghetto  I was arguing with a friend of mine about Jews living in Europe  in strange countries and I said  \ Strulek  if we will survive  if Jews will survive   you should go to Palestine  that time was Palestine and build a country because you will always be guests any place else.\
We had to falsify a card  put them in  and some of those people also became employed in the ghetto estattin in in the ghetto factories.
In the same time  we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of the train and we went back to the ghetto.
But you were outside  a nd you got out of the ghetto.
One of theŠword got to me from one person that arrived back from the ghetto into the concentration camp that he saw my brother trying to run from one line that he was in to join his family and he was shot on the spot in the Krakow ghetto liquidation.
They just -- I am -- they just came into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons  they ordered a gehsperren  which means  you know  a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take all elderly people  they would take children  and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide in the apartment  they would be shot.
But in the ghetto was a few people before they made the they called us.
That he found a work brigade that worked outside the ghetto.
01:11:49 Well  that was basically when you  when you think of the ghetto as a substantial section of town  the forced labor camp was basically one street that was surrounded with barbed wire and  and other or maybe two streets.
I met in the ghetto of Czestochowa  when I came back from Treblinka.
Did -- did you find it  I dont know  disturbing or odd that the difference between the ghetto situation and the rest of occupied Warsaw was so different?
And we -- when we understood that we cannot go out together with the organization  underground organization  cannot leave the ghetto  we started to look for a exit  how to run.
So my mother didn't know what happened to us  and she s ubsequently went into hiding for a few days in order to be uh out of the ghetto so she should be uh  uh reconnected with us.
We were hiding in a house outside of the ghetto  and the next day on November 14  1941  that Aktion started.
So anyway  so we went there and we went back to Warsaw.
That was where you were in the ghetto and then there was the massacr e that you survived there.
The Germans surrounded the whole rest of the ghetto what was there and they lit it up from all sides and hardly some body could escape from it.
Later on  uh  after this uh  uh  uh original period of time in Krakow  in that factory when the ghetto was established  he decided to uh have his people his workers live on the premises.
I was lucky  they  they  they gave you to certain uh working groups  and I was with a group of people that uh  went out to the railroad station  unloaded the coal  or unloaded the uh potatoes or whatever it was  and bring it back into the ghetto back and forth.
Some work -- he was telling us that he survived somehow  I know some way and from the little village and he was wandering and they caught him and they put -- the Germans caught him and drop him in into the ghetto.
I noticed in the petition that the letter which he wrote a big R initial by the head of the ghetto.
Im receiving a m-monthly rent for my broken health  but now there is a class action for the slave labor and I filled the papers  and I hope that I will be able to -- after all  I worked in Lodz ghetto for a few years  in a -- is -- not factory  but this was establishment.
They selected a group of people who would stay in the Ghetto and clean it up.
I already knew what medicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his  and I bought in the Apotheke more medicine so I got a pass that I am in Gesundheitsdienst  which means a health service  that I could go out from the ghetto if it's needed  which was very helpful.
JL: Uh  well  we moved in--a couple times during the ghetto stay.
I didnt know any person that did escape but like I mentioned before  we knew in 1942  early on  that the people -- they take out a few from the ghetto and they tell you like youre going to a shower and they give you soap and a towel.
The street she lived was supposed to be part of the ghetto.
And he use to go  sneak out of the ghetto somehow and he belonged to the Partisan.
Among others  these four ladies; and they told me.... They moved in the meantime from the part of the ghetto where there was no water into the part where there was water  into a home owned by a fellow of the name Goldfarb.
But this is -- this is as far as my -- was the worse than in the ghetto.
So I could have been among them  just miss -- you miss a day or two  you wind up -- beca use fa -- the ghetto  you know  after the evacuation  even you -- you were hiding in the ghetto  the dogs [indecipherable] most of them  oh  unless those who -- those who were hiding outside.
In fact  to go from one side of the non-ghetto area to the othe r side of the non-ghetto area they had to go through a street  which ran right through the ghetto.
He accepted us with warm arms and right away everybody wanted to know who we saw  the last people that we saw in the ghetto.
Just like administration in the ghetto  there were two women and they were Czech women.
And whatever else you could find or trade or people that use to go outside of the ghetto and deal with the gentiles and the give away a piece of a sweater or a uh--or a uh a garment or uh jewelry or whatever they could find for anything for a piece of food.
And you know start getting the Jews again disappearing  getting the Jews.
You know  when we were taken to the place where all Jews wel -- were already for the night from the ghetto  we were five of us  five.
Um  so here every time  you know  somebody slowed down a little bit on the march  the SS would use their rifle butts and kick them in the rear to turn them on until we finally made it to the ghetto.
He was allowed to leave the ghetto and report to my father  and to Leist.
At the end of the ghetto  I was also -- I was also swollen.
Frania  who lived in another part of the ghetto  but then he r husband had been taken away  sh e was with the child and she was with her sister and her husbands sister-in-law  this woman left her baby in the ghetto  she ran without the baby.
It was like a...like a river of people earning the way to the ghetto.
It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go out from the ghetto  you know  with the Germans to work.
In my eyes  he was not the despot  the demigod  as people made him or said he was  because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski  no matter what he did  the ghetto would have liquidated in 1942  completely  without any resistance  without anybody I believe  without me being alive today.
You see  all around Warsaw   all the suburban little cities  had to go in one place  in the ghetto.
How about on your -- But  from the mothers side  I have -- I have -- I have a grandfather what still was living in the ghetto and my grandmother passed away from other side.
And when I was in the ghetto  I used to go there to a Czech woman.
We tried to main- tain inside the ghetto some roots of a life.
But he went to the ghetto from the first da y to the last.
No  I think it was the consent of all of us that we dont go because  and that Briesen factory went to the Warsaw ghetto.
SB: And um can you tell me how different it was in a concentration camp from the move the ghetto?
When we went to the ghetto  this President...this President Shelpelski left a daughter  a married daughter from the 5th marriage.
How 17 my brother had this opportunity to escape we did not know for many years but afterwards we found our that as we were being taken from th e ghetto  instead of going out to the ghetto  he went back into the factory where he worked and since it was a Saturday he crawled in one of the machinery and on Sunday when the factory wa s closed  that's when he got out.
I think that is the critical issue both in terms of ghetto  in terms of what  what happens in the ghetto  even when they closed the ghetto there was still enough food somehow brought in  but then suddenly there is less food.
And all of a sudden  it was maybe a month before the liquidati on of the Wilna ghetto  yes  and we in the partisan organization of the ghetto  every night some people were sleeping in the apartments whose window go out -- outside the ghetto  little  little pieces  and they have watch.
And  plus I blame myself  because if I wouldnt be there -- if I wouldnt be there August the third -- second  in -- in -- in the Lo-Lodz ghetto  I w ould be here -- I would be fighting them.
The story is that he died on the way  was in Warsaw ghetto  they were brought to to clean out the ghetto  and so and then the way to au to Da-Dachau ach ach Dachau   there he died.
You want to go back a little bit and just -- and just mention something about the contrast o-of your life from when you were in the ghetto to bebefore  your life before the German occupation.

But once in awhile hidden away some place we would discover a piece of jewelr y or something and then even though we had never gotten our own clothing in th e ghetto there was a clothing depot set up that -- where we issued our clothing and these things were used to bother on the outside for food.
Warsaw was a bigger city and a lot of Jews  not a lot  some Je ws were living on the Aryan side but not in the Lodz ghetto because the population was so small.
At that time I was looking for people coming from Lodz Ghetto  because I  they start liquidating the ghetto in 194--  but there were transports coming in before my father came or my  my mother  so I used to  you know  what's  who is coming  what is happening  and I was interested at that time  and I knew sooner or later my father's going to show up if he's still alive  and this is the way I used to go up looking for them.
That's all what it says  in German and in Hungarian  and yet you constantly  this was a passport  the people were Swedish citizens  no.
When I was still with my parents  even in the ghetto  I was not only I was an only child.
She  when she escaped from G ora Kalwaria  she went to another ghetto in a small town on the other side of the Vistula river.
But they told us again  take your blanket  take your dish for food  we are leaving the ghetto.
I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the Ghetto  tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe.
But then we had the ghetto  we have four ghettos  divided by the river. {
But when it after three months  four months  they say that you gonna sit in a ghetto very soon.
Then at night we used to heard uh  you know   it was...we were right...right close to the entrance to the ghetto.
That was after they took us away from home into a ghetto.
Of course  this was the Nazi but this is what they said  so in the 29first three...after the third day of the ghetto  this is what we learned and what is ghetto all about  because we didn't know what it was about .
And the Germans that were there  they kicked them out of the houses  so they could house us.
And then we got to this place  and there were more trucks.
When the police was around the ghetto and he was worried  frightened}.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 10 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: JL: Uh  not by date.
Wa -- once you said goodbye to them in the ghetto  you did not have any more communication?
Oh yes...well  you see  so uh fortunately... unfortunately from the beginning we were not...we were not conscious of the great danger of these children because we never thought that they can take children and kill th em  but when the the aktion of the 4th of October  1941  when they put on fire the contagious hospital in the small ghetto with the patients inside  with the uh doctors and with the personnel  medical personnel  all of the them  they were put on fire and they lead...but before they put on fire this building  the adjacent building was a children's home  an or phan's home  and there were approximately five  six hundred children so they took them out from the building in the broad...in the courtyard of the...of the contagious diseases hospital and were just plain put them...I can never forget the picture.
So  y -- whoevers can escape -- they knew already in the ghetto  their -- it -- it co -- you know  when the group was established  now -- later on  when we got established  so it was a problem to get -- how you get arm and ammunition.
That evening when I went back to the ghetto  I suspect that I was the first person who notified people inside the ghetto that that had happened.
Got the hard life  a very hard life in ghetto  yeah.
Another one I had of a similar nature was in 1993 when I happened to be in Warsaw with Vice President Gore i-in which Gore and the Israeli president at the time  made a speech a-at the memorial for the -- the Jews on the 50th anniversary of the -- of the ghetto uprising  which was celebrated in Warsaw  and I just happened to be in Warsaw at the time  not for this  but Al Gore and so on  so I was with Gore.
Our own the a a Jewish because it is full with Jewish doctors  the doctors who lived in the ghetto took care of that.
I remember duri ng the time of famine in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1941 that the children would just go in groups on the streets  after the curfew; I think the curfew was 8 p.m. But it was not dark yet during the su mmer months so they would walk on the streets barefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms and beg for food.
So we -- yes  well this was in -- a -- right after everybody was taken away from -- in 1942  they started in with us and we were taken out of the apartment and we had to move in a mini -- it was a mini ghetto.
This was also in conjunction with the burning  and with the of the small ghetto.
And she wanted me to read from his archive  this story from day to day  what transpired at Warsaw ghetto.
I was very sick  and after living in the ghetto over three months all of a sudden I just felt an urge of getting out.
SB: Tell me more about the changes that you noticed in the ghetto.
We didn't live in an official ghetto  as they did in Warsaw and Lodz a nd places like that  in Poland  but for all practical purposes  once we wore the star we might as well have lived in a ghetto.
You know  we got the wagons  we put our stuff on the wagon  and we went to the ghetto.
Tell me about those first days of the ghetto  would you?
What was disheartening to me was that this was a ghetto in which more then 20 000 Jews had been -- had been shipped to Treblinka from there  including my grandparents.
So that time I about two weeks later  a proclamation from the from the Arrow Cross party and the Parliament came that you have to move in the ghetto.
But what was inside the ghetto  we didn't know because it was a wall  total isolation.
In fact  there was one girl that I got to know in the ghetto.
So she said  like for example about Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 173 said theyre going perp she they they give the date  exactly date what they come and kill the Jews from the gi left the Jews in the ghetto  for example.
He came -- see  when we were in the ghetto  they took us to the ghetto that day  and before that we were entered  there was a girl by the name of Atteckata (ck) was her name.
I want to hear a little bit about how the ghetto came into being  I mean if you remember what life was like in Lakhva and how long you were there before you were confined.
We were going through the sequence of wh at was happening in Vilnius and -- and in comparison it was chaotic to what was happeni ng in Kaunas as far as the ghetto being established.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 >> Bill Benson: And your entire family was in that boxcar with you.

And there were ways to slip out where the work group or work brigade as they were called that worked outside  outside of the ghetto and with the knowledge  it was usually best that with the knowledge of the group leader  one could slip away either to do some trading  bartering  get food.
When  for instance  the International Ghetto was built  I'm sure you heard about it  it was called the International Ghetto  where not on ly the Swedish but different other legation who had imitated the Swedish success  Swiss  Vatican and so forth.
SB: Um  after the Big Action  the ghetto--the ghetto sort of settled down and there was a period where there was relative routine.
I have a photo of where we lived before we were all forced to go to the ghetto.
But they escaped from the ghetto and Tosia picked them up and brought them to Czestochowa because where could you run.
They created papers for us as if we were member s of the ghetto so we could live there.
>> Bill Benson: Once you were in the ghetto  did you continue working in the ammunition factory?
And was your house in the ghetto at the time or did you have to move?
In order to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who would come into the ghetto to catch what I'm doing.
Are there any sights or sounds or smells today that remind you of your war time years?
You kn ow  some of our ghetto inmates still had some  I don't know how they managed to get instruments unless they found them in -- when they got to the ghetto.
When did you  in the ghetto  realize where those transports were really going?

So like let's say  in the beginning of the town was a ghetto  and then nearer Tanko   nearer Shull   was the other one.
This was our main object  how to save the child and being that the Jewish cemetery was outside of the Warsaw ghetto  we worked out a plan together with Pela that we would put the child to sleep with that friend of ours who put her to sleep  gave her an injection  and 8 we arrange a funeral for this child in order to get her out of the ghetto.

T-a-d-e-k} I got acquainted with Tadek working outside the ghetto in remodeling a house for a Gestapo man.
When mother would come up to stay with me for a few hour s  she would uh tell me stories of home  of of the wonderful things that we had  the wonderful times we spent together  pretending that um  the family was still alive  where she already by then knew that the rest of the family that was left in  in the ghetto  um when we left for Botsohov  they ha d a liquidation of the ghetto then  and uh  they were all taken to Treblinka  all of them.

So  the warm sweaters and the coats that we left with them because  once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto  we met with Polish people at work  and if we knew people who were willing to take a message to them  they have seen to it that something was sent to us  even in this slave labor camp in Starachowice  even after th e ghetto  you know.

We are very much afraid we that somebody will see if the ghetto burn to ashes around and that we bought everything in the rucksacks and we went out.
They took out the Jewish people from other places and they put them in there.
To me it was a step backwards to move to Great Neck  which is kind of a gilded ghetto  and I prefer Washington for that.
And these are just things that were happening around me  personally  that I saw and felt the first week or two or three  I don't know  before the ghetto was formed.
And next day  I heard that the -- again there's no more ghettos -- so ghetto still was  but again they took a lot of people to the concentration camp.
And we can do it only if nobody works with -- only was a Jewish policeman at the entr ance of the ghetto.
They filled the ghetto with people driven out from surrounding areas.
Were there ways that the Jewish Council was especially helpful to the people in the Underground?
And that was May 11th  after having me in the brick factory from April 19 until May 11  we jump on the truck  which used to carry either food or bread or something between the ghetto and the brick factory and we got to the entrance of the ghetto and the driver said  these three have permits  my mother and my brother and I and the police who was standing at the ghetto entrance says okay and through back yards and back ways we got to the house where Grandmother was and  which was across the street from our original home  but our original home was outside the ghetto and the road was the separate border.
And I was a good soccer player and I had formed my on team uh with a group of--of boys and--and--and--and--and we were there were other teams formed and we were playing even uh games for--for uh championship of the ghetto and my team won Video Tape No.

If you get the permission to practice outside the ghetto in the little community  because there are no doc tors around here  uh we...you you could uh you could survive.
We didn't know what was going out without the ghetto...out from the ghetto.

And they didn't accept these people from Ghetto because they are Jews.
Speaking about--but burning  I have to tell you something that has nothing to do with the ghetto but I saw it when I was in the ghetto.
And a lot of people from the villages were coming to Starachowice already in the ghetto to look for work  but they had to come somehow  maybe they were brought by the Germans  I couldnt tell you  but I know that we had an Arbeitsamt  which is a labor bureau  whatever you call it  where people were co ming and asking for work because they knew from the other places that only the ones that will work will live.
So they organized a ghetto hospital so to say in my Temple.
But one of them  the older one  wenald was killing in ghetto aktion action.
But luckily in our ghetto  they did not ask for a certain amount of people to give them out to kill.

I want to tell you...in the ghetto I perhaps the only Jewish committee that worked together with the underground.
Even if we would like to stay outside of the ghetto  there was no way to do anything  there was no people that would take us in.
But from me you wanted to know about  about uh cultur- ally in the ghetto.
A Jew doesn't even know how to k eep a rifle how to fight with a rifle.ﬂ So  we had Antisemitism was pretty strong and we had incidents where Antisemitism was almost like in the ghetto because in the certain time –.
In the ghetto there was the Kleineverstaten and the Klei- severstaten.
>> Bill Benson: At some point you were forced to go outside the ghetto  I think  to dig... >> Susan Taube: That was in the summertime.
And ghetto I pass by a ghetto I had one loaf of bread.
I mean  Jews lived in other towns in that area  too.
And I follow her up from Krakow to ghetto  from ghetto to  to concentration camp  and then we were separated.
And this was his greatest and most horrible heartache  when one day he arrived home  because we had these safe houses  what they called the International Ghetto  what it wasn't  it was given to us and not bought  by Christians and Jews who didn't wanted their houses and villas on both sides of the Danube to fall in Russian  in uh  German hands.
And then we stayed almost like two years and then the order came one day  October 27  I remember that vividly that day  October 27  1942  two years into the ghetto  couldn't go to work three shifts  the night shift came back from work  they kept us all in the ghetto area.
So 1944  there was a big notice put out in the ghetto that anybody between the age of 18 and 50 must assemble in a certain area and to bring warm clothing.
And I dont know what happened to my mother  I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps  but she might have been shot in the ghetto  because they would just shoot left and right.
Just after the deportation  as you were describing it before  where were you and what happened to you?
Gestapo  you know  the police  you know from over there -- the German police -- they was looking for the people.
We had to leave the ghetto at night and tell the people how to get out from from th e job that they working.
I'll take you you have a cousin living in the ghetto in Czerwinsk.
And that began in the story of a in in  I think a ghetto in Frankfurt   Im not sure  but it Interview with Richard Peterson April 6  1999 18was new then  but we began reading about it  so we were aware of it on the matter of matter of what it was  what they were.
And then again was Aktion in the ghetto  and ghetto was smaller and smaller.
That was in France  then  like I said  I got the job in the Toyota Company  which helped me get a pass out of   out of the ghetto.
What do you recall of what happened when the Germans came in and being forced into the ghetto?
I would say I spent more than 50 percent time in ghetto than in outside  because it was safer for me in ghetto than being round up in -- in the town for labor work in Germany.
15 Hans Biebow (1902-1947) was the head of the Lodz Ghetto administration 27 Once  once when we first arrived.
And from this side of the ghetto nobody survived  n obody.

In Ghetto  after I wake up  if I ever sleep  is gone for the lines for a piece of margarine.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/PNINA TORY page 19 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: people and he told  asked him he said look my sister must go out in town  so please take her.
As soon we registered to work  they made a old ghetto and a new ghetto.
I placed myself on the ruins of a house from 1939  I am looking at the walls of ghetto.
B Well at that point rumors  before the  before there even was talk of the ghetto we heard about people in the city who had been abducted from their homes  by willing Lithuanian so called partisans who also ran- sacked the homes.
They knew exactly how many Jews are in the ghetto  because everybody wants to get food  and the rations were very small.
And altogether she was telling me that I should go to ghetto like all those ugly Jews who are walking  we saw them going through the village to ghettos and she said I should be going with them and I should die.
They took the photographs that day of several trains  several towns  several ghetto s that emptied into it.
We thought maybe they had taken them into a camp someplace else  but that they were killed?
So they were they looked for a Sonderkommando   and they took a number of of people and of Jews from the from from the ghetto.
There was  when the ghetto was finally  in 1944  liquidated  there was underground left 800 people.
I remember one time when my sister and my mother  when we got into the ghetto  16 my sister was very lucky to obtain a new job.
Oh  well  this is when the Star of David was the law when the ghetto was established.
Empty  but signs -- signs of streets that dont exist and signs of bunkers where the -- the Warsaw ghetto fighters came out or went into the sewers.
Now this was already in 1942 because the ghetto was established in 1941.
Our ghetto was on the small part  it was a very small section of the ghetto.
He made this because he has had a feeling that somebody not make this the practically way  and uh so he become to be a a living  moving connection between the several uh several uh I say houses...uh children home or offices and these children homes get permission to remain for a certain time outside from the ghetto  and what Komo take is who was the person who was looking after the house  several houses  empty houses that is good for this for uh   enough place for to make a contract with the owner to rent and this was Otto Komo's work and uh these homes was very very short time full with children  and the these homes was very uh uh not uh not together  not in a certain uh part from the town.
Were the Jewish police in the ghetto good or were they not good?
Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember  but befo re we came to the ghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset  you know women were wearing corsets  and it was like a bone  like a plastic bone  she pulled th is out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them   so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or what ever.
Lets go to  did you see the ghetto after it was liquidated.
And he could -- his wife was Lithuanian  his daughter was Lithuanian.
Even the nurses from the school were take n out of the ghetto for work to the hospital  18 even to the German hospital.
So  the question is  \ Why don't you ta ke in more people or why do you have to be secretive?ﬂ Yes  if a group of 10 people or five people or one person goes out from the ghetto  let's say he is caught.
AT: When  according to what I thought was important to tell the from the ghetto.
The German Gestapo was there -- Interview with Alan Kalish October 24  2003 47 In that -- -- in -- in the ghetto.
He stood up and Dr. Elkes stood 16 and close  not far away from him and when there was a special hardship for a family to be...to be apart...torn apart or some...or fo r reasons  there was a man like who was a veteran Zionist leader and so on  so he asked this man is needed...w e needed a carpenter for the...for the building of the airport and so on  and he could rescue maybe 10  maybe 15  maybe 20  but he stood on his legs.
Q. Was there any religious life left in the ghetto even underground?
And it certainly doesn't build up your morale  it doesn't strengthen  it doesn't add to your stamina  it doesn't anything and then one day he says run to the gate  there is a truck going back to the ghetto  jump on it as soon as you can and you are going out.
On the other hand it was so close to Warsaw that all the people may have be en moved to Warsaw.
And when I came to Budapest the ghetto  of course was...I...we...we didn't know that there was a ghetto in Budapest.
One was that some people from Lodz Ghetto killed him when he arrived.
My sister could go to Brazil before we went to ghetto  when somebody gave her papers.
If you have a more questions about the ghetto  I will gladly fill you in.
I think in afterwards we were moved into the uh part of the ghetto which was the major part.
But there are no woods around the Wars aw ghetto or around Warsaw even for that matter.
There were a couple of revolts in some camps  I believe  small  that the peop le were able to get some guns  some ammunition  and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt.
When it came at night we left from there  we left to go back  they didn't go already to the ghetto because they heard from the Polish people too.
Tell me a little bit about the ghetto becoming an official concentration camp.
And yet  he and I  both of us  worked outside of the ghetto.
We move to the area which was ghetto about two months a year.
We had big workshops that worked eighteen hundred  mostly women who could not go out of work from outside the ghetto  a nd there were a carpentr y and tailorship and and plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing  cleaning...all for the German army  but we...and so so uh the German supervisor of the ghetto used to come to the Jewish committee or he used to come straight to th e workshop.
I used to go home to the ghetto because I brought -- for the man  he was like a German.
They dragged her into the 20 ghetto and they took out the people  the person in the room that she liv ed with.
A nyway  there was a lot of panic and chaos in the ghetto at that point  and a few days after my sister left  my mother came home from work and she says  \ It's time to go.ﬂ And so  she made me dress in my best clothes  and  again  I still had that coat with a few sewn in coins  and I put on my high-top shoes  and she got dressed and whatever she felt was still not threadbare  and she made two little bundles  one for myself and one for her.
When we first went into the Ghetto  we stayed with my mother's brother.
25 Q. What I'm saying was it a sp ecial release in the Ghetto?
I thi nk by the time we went to the ghetto he passed away; uncle Heinrich Novomirst(ph.).
A nd of course those people  almost all of them from that transport were shot in th e forest near Riga  the ghetto there.
So we arrived to–.O h I should mention that now  shortly before our departure  ghetto uprising took place and we saw through our windows how Germans were systematically going from one building to anothe r dropping napalm bombs into the basement to be sure that entire building will catch flames .
What was it like to see again  the townspeople who you had -- you know  you had been put into this ghetto and -- and herded off.
Henry Greenbaum: Well  it was hard for the ghetto after a while.
And my two brothers and my father  we didnt know for sure  but then we met a gentleman that was in the ghetto  a neighbor  and he was behind them in line  and he told us that they went the wrong way  so there was no way we could find anybody any more.
There was a curfew for everybody but Jews had an earlier curfew.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 34 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: ny all along  because Poland and Lithuania and all those other countries did not exist for 200 years  they were al occupied by the Russians.
Then I saw -- well  jumping back when they liquidated ghetto  I was -- that was 1944 in August.
When ghetto was starting  some couple which were Christia n and Russian and Jewish  they could choose the at least the wife could stay outside.
All the children and all the elderly  everybody  driven to the nearest big town where they set up a huge ghetto  not just for our town but the townspeople  the Jews  from all over villages and towns.
27 So you didnt experience any -- they -- they knew you were Jewish?
We had in the ghetto even Jewish people...I don't have to tell you  if you are in this kind...they working...they were working against the Jewish people.
Coming from a big house and from a normal living situation coming into one room in a ghetto area  that was very  very hard to take.
So uh the Germans ordered that all...to bring all cats and hounds in from the ghetto into one Jewish ancient synagogue  the most ancient synagogue in Slobodka  and bring all the cats so people brought every cat .
If one day it was announced that Zlota  Hoza  or Sienna  or a part of a building was no longer in the ghetto or else was now included in the ghetto  it seemed as if directing energies to ward \ defense\  was the most important thing.
We did also in that small ghetto organized like a little restaurant where people  you know  cooking  buying this that.
They build like walls  and that it was a main gate and another gate was for the head of the -- of the ghetto  special gate  a small gate  but he had the keys  an d he could open and walk out  but he couldnt.
So  we turned around  and we built our own shelter  because I had two days time approximately  which the houses in the Ghetto  there was a big field  like farm land.
And...and then this is how he went all the night long until they...they came to the frontier and then they let him off and he could come back.ﬂ T: Well that again is... E: This is what he told me when we were in the ghetto because in the ghetto it was not only a relationship started  of course  when I was...when he was elected of....... But we developed a very  very close personal relationship that I never before experienced in all...in all my young life that time.
Now  the next thing that happens how does a ghetto operate?
They caught this particular one and uh I was one of the 2 ghetto witnesses uh of who he was uh but I never talked directly to him.
So you see  there was a Jewish...Jewish worker group...worker...who worked at the railway station in Kovno  and we the the head of this group  usually a group of workers...in in the terminology of the ghetto it was a brigade...a brigade  and the head of the brigade was Silverman   who was a member of the underground  so we called him and told him to listen.
Before the ovens were 30 working  and before it was beautiful organized m echanized  they used to get people from the Ghetto.

Did you notice any difference in the way in which the Romanians and Hugarians behaved toward the ghetto and towards the Jews?

The rough time was with the Nilosh   with the Hungarian Nazis during the ghetto.
So this is what I call...when I talk to some people where they ask me about experiences  I don't talk really like a ghetto  because a ghetto is a concentration of certain people that  ethnic people and so on  and I don't call this a ghetto because being without food  being without clothes  being eliminated constantly  thousand  ten thousand  five thousand...and then buried practically alive in a 5 portable crematorium...you couldn't call this a ghetto.

So  within minutes he called from upstairs  as it turned out a re vered  gentleman by the name of Jonas Turkow  a famous Polish actor and director before World War II  who as it turned out was a friend a my father was with my father in the committee for underground in the Warsaw Ghetto.
At that time that we star ted to live in ghetto  I was ev -- aware of everything whats going on.
And we didnt get that much food  and the food was mostly split pea soup  which reminded me of the ghetto  which was the only food there.
I had an abortion and I was...after that had to go to work  bleeding  and go to work and I was working and uh after one year they made another ghetto.
I wish I could remember details  all I know is I went through the wall  which was not very far  the wa ll of the ghetto.
of the ge -- how it come to the ghetto befo re.
When I  we left the ghetto  Gusti and I...Gusti was the name of my first wife...uh Mr. Singer was was still there and the Germans had...he had his wife and his child.
So here we have my fa ther  who is working outside of the ghetto.
Uh...Then...uh...I remember my...that Polish policeman came one evening and he said that they're going to close the ghetto.
That young man and I were walking out every morning  and we were waiting to be to be  we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside the ghetto where  where eventually we would have had something to eat.
The ghetto  I think  was about 2 600 and 800 people there  and whoever was still a little bit alive  they ran and I was running.
I was bent over on all fours practically  carrying the big sack of coal back to the ghetto.
During that transport and during the gathering of the ghetto in the marketplace  the word was that about 1 000 of the Jews were shot.
It started actually -- see my -- my father had diabetes  and had a kidney st one  and -- in the -- in the ghetto  he didnt have neither diabetes  nor the kidney stone.
Is there a po ster that says Jews have to be -- Oh yes  it was on poster  that at such and such date  all Jews have to be transported -- transport themselves to the ghetto  to -- a-and says what streets there were -- you know  w-what quarter  that means.
When Singer came back into the office  he would write or have us take notes and eventually  he produced a tremendous amount of material  b ecause the chronicle of the large ghetto is not all Singers.
Except for the physical exertion  cases when she would take me to the ghetto in Czestochowa.
We went to the city of Lodz  moved in with my aunt.
H-He was  you know  there was a group that came out -- Im repeating the same th ing you have already  on the videotapes  a group of Jewish boys and girls came out just days before  theyre prepared already  weeks before  to leave the town  because Poles didnt have a ghetto.
And if Soviet partisans  it's Communists  so again  so they felt themselves very strong in the ghetto even to be a Communist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians because several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to 33 kill them.
Were there other ways in which you thi nk there was a kind of a -- using the word discrimination is a har -- is a st range -- strange word  but that th ere were differences between the lives that men were leading and the lives that women were leading in th e context of the ghetto.
I stayed in this ghetto till th e last action was there and the Ge rmans surrounded the whole ghetto.
Human life  as I see it  was very important to everybody in the ghetto.
And she experienced the ghetto  and she was Interview with Yehuda Adam 30 liberated in about two days later  I believe  than we are.
I didn't mention before that going into the ghetto you couldn't have a bicycle.
And trying to get my uncle  who is still alive and his family was intact  from the ghetto.
Well  actually he never really wa nted to discuss his life in the ghetto  or his life in Dachau.
There wasn't enough food but I remember because of my grandfather's connection  because he lived in a village  you know  and a lot of people worked for him  he would constantly send a non-Jewish peasant over with food  but there came a time where they wouldn't let him through the ghetto and we were practically starved and there were no facilities to wash  you know.
He worked also in ghetto as a fire...in fire department  which I knew him like I knew my father.
Nu  that was beginning to part of the winter time we live in the ghetto  and its begin...maybe that was in February.
And then what was it like for you to go into the ghetto?
So two streets were blocked -- were -- the actual road was outside the ghetto with barbed wires.
9 >> Bill Benson: Late August or September 1943 you were brought back into the ghetto and what you said to me was  we kind of knew what the ball game was then.
>> Bill Benson: Was your entire family moved into that ghetto with you?
When the Germans came into the ghetto  we just ignored them.
Wenn die Mal probies das ghetto [geschitten ]   dann ein Kugel in dem Kopf.\
Many of these people were taken from the ghetto to the slave labor camp and did not survive.
And how is it that they wouldnt have been in the ghetto?
So this was a problem  because the ghetto was -- you know  like I mentioned  was surrounded and it was patrolled all the time with -- with police and they had the -- for dogs  Germans and collaborators.
And I found a there was a date when they ar wh o they were  their profession  their date of birth  when they arrived in the in the ghetto  and when they left the ghetto.
And I thought that this document in particular  because it was treated not very well Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 7 in the Holocaust literature Actually only one historian who was excerptexcerpting from it and writing about it; I thought he had a very wrong point of view  even though he also came from the Kovno ghetto.
Now  let's go back to Lodz and the ghetto and the timing.
So there was  you know   like a government in ghetto.
And they appointed a new leadership of the Ghetto police  which I believe was also disposed  the second one was disposed  I believe  based on my memory.
And this was in the middle of Mins k  in the city of Minsk   the ghetto?
So  the Wilno pol ice  who had no idea  kind of whisked me away from them and brought me into the Ghetto and put me into that jail.
So they had to live on whatever they gave them in the ghetto.
That was their first transport to Auschwitz  to the concentration camp  first transport.
And probably they fix the road in the Ghetto not because they wanted Jews to have a better road  but because they wanted this road passable for Germans in case they come in trucks or cars in the Ghetto so they can pass and collect the Jews whatever  as the case may be.
So  probably on the whole  the whole ghetto and concentration life was easier for me than for some of these people.
A gentile should work so much to bring people out of ghetto  but he done it.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/IVAR SEGALOWITZ page 9 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Tell me a little bit more about the training and organizing for food.
And...uh...that af ter this became the activity when the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated....the activities of.. .uh...the underground was how to help people in hiding and how to help people in their...in concentration camps and contacts  and there was also a thought in those days si nce we know that they are Hungary...this was 1943...that Hungary Jews are free.
Things had to go  for instance  for the bread was outside the ghetto.
That on them leaned the economy of life in the ghetto.
My father was part of a very small group of the ghetto police whose business was to try to save the Jews.
People 11 from Sosnowiec  Bdzin  and other... Dbrowa...uh...were moved into the ghetto.
when you were taken fr-from the ghetto and you were -- And then we stayed on the other side .
The father  like I told you there were six or seven people  I think there were four brothers...I went over to the father and I told him look I went down to the ghetto.
M y uncle found out  you know  speaking to other people  other immigrants -- well  others who had to leave their homes  and found out that some soldiers could be bribed and they would take us over across the river to the Ukraine  a ghetto which was a concentration of Jews in one place.
To the Jewish people  Then in a couple months   they take us to the ghetto.
And in the ghetto my sister was very outgoing and very smart  very talented  what she knew how to speak to people.
The other side there was the ghetto  the free  but we have to pass this fire.
I'm assuming that this picture was hidden in the ghetto because I don't know how else where else it would have been.
To receive the rations  we had to go out of the ghetto.
During the day  th e Germans didn't bother  I was too young to be in a work detail  and at that time they ha dn't cracked down on the ki ds for execution  so I had the run of the ghetto  basically I could go where I want  I could do what I want.
And  from there  well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto well have to move to a ghetto which is in a part of Libau  a section of Libau that I did not know very well  and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of 43  we were as signed to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse  the toilet was a few steps we had to go about five or six steps  right off the entrance  rear entrance of th e building  and there including the kitchen there were one  two  three rooms.
In the ghetto of course  the situation was disastrous because we had to share - in the ghetto we were assigned a room to share with another family.
But you had gone to school before in the ghetto  you said  in the enclave.
You were born in 1941.What were you told about what happened when the Germans first came?
Now  our group  considering the way we were armed  its unbelievable  having -- because I -- I -- y-y-y-y-y -- in -- come to think of -- I was mention  in -- in Warsaw ghetto  it was so rough to -- you know  it was so rough to smug -- to get arms in.
Uh--uh--the only problem was in ghetto  in the street that we live was not paved.
So it was the easiest thing to take these people to take over the management of the government of the ghetto.
This night we got orders to surround the ghetto with the German police and to take you away.ﬂ And I didn't know to kill on the spot  but to take you way.
After my parents came  after a day  the whole ghetto went in flames.
I did this later in the concentration camp  but I didnt do it in the ghetto.
But I have to tell you that there was a cultural life in Vilno ghetto.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 16 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Ok  and within a few days everyone in the ghetto knew what had happened.
He came to mine father and said [indecipherable] before the ghetto [indecipherable] broken a broken [indecipherable] not from his house.
He was in action in Warsaw  in the ghetto and he ran away from the ghetto and he came to the woods.
And they had to be at the ghetto exits  entrances  to guard against anybody leaving who was not authorized.
And once there were Germans right next to us because they were occupying the apartment upstairs from us where that family had fled already.
One day in the ghetto together was much safer than to stay an hour on the outside.
A. Because we didn't want to be closed in in the ghetto in Warsaw.
You talked about what things were punishable by death in the ghetto.
SB: Tell me about the--there was a time when everyone had to assemble from the ghetto.
And I believe against this  and probably other commandants too  that as long as he can keep the Germans out of the Ghetto there is a chance of saving one  two  five  twenty Jews.
And I think late in 1940  I remember  the ghetto was organized in Minsk-Suwatki.
Not only were we isolated  when the ghetto was established  it was a problem both for the Christians and Jewish people in Warsaw.
02:50:39 It was hard for me to separate myself from th em  but on the other hand  I was  I was exhilarated  it was a chance for me to get out from the ghetto.
Of course a lot of Poles were coming in to work in the ghetto.
He brings me there  it is right at the border of the ghetto.
Now when you described a few minutes ago some of your work assignments were those during the ghetto time or before?
Before the ghetto was established  and well get to that  did you see your Jewish friends?
No  no  there was no ghetto; it was too smal l a town.
We were in the ghetto but  but we were in one building that used to be a hospital during the ghetto time.
The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they demand.
Because when I  the first time  in 1940  to the end  did try to escape from the ghetto  save myself with Polish papers  the problem was circumcision and I remember my mother saying  why do we need this  how many Jews would be saved if not this?
And then -- now there were two -- two sisters  and we met them  with their girlfriend in the -- in the ghetto.
And the German soldiers were in it when they came back and they ruined the whole house.
That was the last time  when I saw my da d  that was the last time  about a month or two weeks before the liquidation of the ghetto.
I was assigned a job in the ghetto in the food department.
Was it a Jewish  a nonJewish mixed neighborhood or was it predominantly Jewish?
And my father came over to visit my my brother and myself  wanted to go back and all of a sudden they closed  they closed the ghetto and he was stuck.
He was one of the leaders of the Vilna ghetto and the Glaserman was the leader of the   so each one sent to his man in Vilna  and luckily the next day  he brought letters from them.
So in in the meantime  I was trying to get closer to her.
I see many Polish and Ukrainians  no  Polish and Germans  right there watching the sewers and th e top of the sewer comes off and Jews from the ghetto trying to escape and theyre being shot on the spot or taken aw ay.
AT: There was a note about that from the 15th of  of August everyone has to be in the ghetto.
But as a person who lived in the ghetto from the very beginning to the very end  my assessment is that so it was hunger  so there was deportation  so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow  we knew what is happening.
I decided  well whatever is going to happen is going to happen to me and my parent s and when I returned  they were already in process of setting up ghetto.
We understood they were the two Jewish bakeries that they could only bake bread for the Jews.
So how many people  let me just go over  when you left there  when you ran from the ghetto  how many people were you with?
They were never found and I think that Lithuanians who uh turned the ghetto upside down for  uh for gold and jewels and they found whole  whole uh big uh jar with papers  that they  they got angry and threw it away or tore it  tore it up and they  and maybe it's still there.
I had no idea who he was in Hungary  and uh but our happiness in the Swedish house did not last for an awful long time because uh finally the Germans decided that they're going to invade the Swedish houses  so they came in after a while and rounded us up and marched us to the ghetto.
You cant risk -- thats what he was trying to tell those people  I cannot risk the entire ghetto because 20 or 30 of you would run to the woods and leave me with a whole -- thousands on my hands  so that you are going to be free.
And there was a organization  I know  because my mother knows her he she wasnt pa-part of the organization  but her good friend  this doctor I talked  Dr. Bridges  who talked with the Jewish doctors about  you know  the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation  his wife  and other  mostly from Catholic organizations  made a a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.
And when they went to a ghetto  they would just kill all the Jewish people in the ghetto.
And so from there  one fine night they circled the ghetto  raus  raus  raus  out  out  out.
So that was two or three days  and then they sealed the ghetto.
So...uh...i nstead  they took my father  the rest of 3 the children to the ghetto and they left my mother home with me I should die.
Food in the ghetto and trying to bring food in  can you tell me anything about that?
Where we lived before the war was actually where the main ghetto was set up.
Now what you're seeing here is my permission to be a nurse in the Ghetto of Theresienstadt.
He said  you know  don't think for a minute that you will survive this ; we will blow up the ghetto before the Soviets arrive.
Youre caught within the Jewish ghetto at that time  that is within the area they designated?

And do you know  was your father working in the ghetto?
So every morning the man would go out -- by the way  when we arrived at the ghetto  they took our names  ages  gender down.
They came in to the ghetto and they said whoever they caught in the ghetto to o. Even in the ghetto  you could hide some.

Now you know  I mean  I've looked through the Kovno ghetto diary by Mr. Torey  were a lot of other people keeping diaries as well?
And what they did is what they what they did is they instituted a they built a bridge from the large ghetto to the small ghetto  which was also surrounded with wires  and that was always under military supervision.
B:An upper bridge I recall went over the highway  over the street or highway which was not part of the ghetto.
But at that point  you see  that was later to be a ghetto but at that point it was just an area.
They were moved to a ghetto area which was behind ... the old town  the Jews used live there before  was a gate entrance.

Now  tell me a little bit about the conditions you were living in in the ghetto.
In the very beginning  there was like a -- not really a hospital  but there was one room  and there was still one doctor in the ghetto  and somehow they obtained some medical supplies.
That they were meant for death because  you know  there were previous sel ections in the ghetto.
And the small ghetto  and they liquidated the big ghetto  and we were in this time in the camp.
You could take only what you -- when we went to the ghetto  you could only take with you what you can move.
As a matter of fact  I was once -- I got sick from a friend  and there was a -- one guy from my city  from Shasnich in ghetto  and he came  and obviously there was no place to sit but to sit on the bed and he s-sat on the pl -- on the bed where I was sleeping on  and after a short time I heard that he got sick with typhoid.

But before the house was designated a clinic   if anyone in the house were to be liquida– were to be put into the ghetto  would they have gone apartment by apartment  or would they have taken the entire house?
Also from Orcencia  some weapons were smuggled to the fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto.
And by the time they finish up I worked a week a week I said to myself  I am going to the ghetto Ill Ill do something.
All I can tell you is that if you couldn't get out to work  the next time they came to shrink the ghetto  you were one of the selected people.
So is there anything else you can tell me about how the small ghetto liquidated and -- Everybody out on the street.
02:47:57 Because after a while...you see  if a ghetto was big and the number of Jews was large they couldn't take them all at one time  you know.

And they took advantage of this and they really ber -- th-they were terrible  they were worse than Germans.
So its fear of your neighbors who themselves were afraid of the Germans?
Well  in the ghettos we already used up most of the stuff  but we have been successful taking out of the homes where we were taken out  into the ghetto  had to share it with others.
Sylvia only recently began speaking about what she went through in the Lodz ghetto and is now speaking in local schools including Montgomery College.
And of places in the ghetto  design ghetto  of the houses  house numbers  street numbers etcetera  where -- where people were sent.
The rich people are in the same ghetto that I am.
And still my father took the chance and took the family  Malamed family  Benyamin Malamed and Irena Malamed with two young sons took from ghetto with the housewives what we ha ve and transferred to the Warsaw Swedish Embassy.
And...uh...then they establish a ghetto and I was...they grabbed people to make the fences.
I knew him as a doctor  and I knew him as a...as a head of the...the ghetto.
Those are the people who were able to escape  hide and they were able to survive and they who lived in prewar Poland  thats were people who were able to Did you have friends who were in the ghetto?
I know because he still had it in Wilno the ghetto that he managed to hide.
But eventually  a few packages of clothing came back into the ghetto.
And two of them were from our town  and the rest of them are from the vicinity we all 10 were from the same ghetto.
She got papers just for herself and her son  and father was very active in the ghetto also being a custom tailor.
I got authorization to stay in Chernowitz with my family and so after three  four weeks  we retu rn to our apartment  wh ich was -- was vandalized and so on  with -- d-during our stay in the ghetto  and we started to live in the ghetto  in the -- in the town.
So we went to the Judenrat and we [indecipherable] th ere  and with the last group we went to Rosa where they -- where all the people from the ghetto was there.
Actually one family that had a lot of our possessions and it was a big risk because they would smuggle food to us in the ghetto.
If somebody came in  let's say what it was a Aktion against people  and they took him into the wagon and someone had business in the ghetto at the same time he didn't know because nobody knew  it could happen  1  5...little more  maybe a little less got in in the trap and they couldn't get out...go out for no money at all because whoever was in Treblinka  there was no way out.
So tomo rrow they came to the ghetto and they told the story  the German.
So when there was a ghetto– Ghetto was already open and second arrest by Gestapo was I was across the border to ghetto many times because we buy some small part of the machinery what we own and before the war all the supply was in the ghetto area and we was forced buy something because we cannot work with this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto.
In in the ghetto thats how I survived  because of that.
So  this picture was taken before the war  before the Ghetto.
11 This was a group of army officers  and Manny Siegel from the Joint  that came to our ghetto area.
I was an artist in  in full creative strength just then and I took my  I took my things with me into the ghetto.
And -- and observed and of course -- this is well known  the ghetto was totally destroyed by the Germans after they captured it and -- and then the Poles completely leveled everything that was left and then built sort of a worker's apartment in a style which I call 182 Socialist Modern.
A lot of other people escaped too but we went with that buggy to Kolomyja and thats where we stayed in Kolomjya  that was that time  yes  more or less normal life because the ghetto was not easy.
There was no less punishment than that  but the non-Jews  the Christian population  had a right to go in and out from the ghetto at will.
People came from the ghetto still when the ghetto was there and they had something  some valuables  s-something  they robbed them.
We had essentially no contact with the Jews in the ghetto.
But there was a lot of these hiding places  and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in ghetto  that a lot of people were safe this way.
I didn't see a good German where I was  but I won't go into it  and they took these people and start them marching them to the Nitenfort  and we were still remaining in the ghetto.
Probably was th ere and then... But we dont know if he was even in the ghetto.
I understand three Jewish people living there  and the Nazis had -- wa -- after the occupation of Poland  requested that they come to Bochnia  a larger city  to a cer -- bils -- or a certain portion there wa -- became the ghetto.
So all of it was already one and when they got the Jews from all the towns and from the big cit y  from Siget they formed the ghetto in what used to be Czechoslovakia.

But the Germans didnt come to our house  and it was see  then on September  first of September then  they told all the Jewish people to go to get -- to the ghetto.
They were liberated from the ghetto by the Soviets in January 1945.

Then they move us 24 to start to go to the right and they move to the right  and certain three  four lines away from the front and I said to my mother get in the back because  you know  you find out you are going to the right side  and then we walk in the ghetto.
So  when the Judenrat -- we had -- our house was in the ghetto  yeah  yeah.
So What were your thoughts when you hear d about the second and third selections in the ghetto?

Meanwhile  my father  my mother  and my baby sister was born while they were in hiding.

They brought in bread to the ghetto like a piece  a few ounces of bread they should give everybody you know like they used to 9 come to bring the bread  to take the bread in the committee  like they had to give something like a few ounces of bread a day.
It was going -- because Hitler or the Ge stapo let them until August 15 we got to have a ghetto created.
I also wanted to ask if you knew anything -- I -- I was reading about in the s -- back in the Salonika ghetto  there was a doctor who escaped.
Anyway when I come back to the ghetto  I didnt went into the ghetto.
In the early stages  where it was still permitted to go outside of the ghetto  a great deal of Jewish young men from Slobodka ghetto -- it was easy to go to Jonava because the highway was there.
And he was di -- he was younger than me  or -- three and a half year s. And he really didnt remember  you know  too much about what happened because he -- he was very young  and during the occupation  where we -- we were in -- in ghetto  I -- I had to take care of him  and we were very close.
So when you mention the cemetery  if some body died in the ghetto  they actually had a proper burial?
No  there was nobody -- yes  th ere were some out of -- we found out  we we re told that out of 34 000 Leucoline Jews  who had lived in the Leucoline ghetto we re all murdered except for 4 000 young men who had occupations that were important to the war effo rt.
We still stayed in the ghetto and uh...on day and it was March--it was March the 27th  uh 1944.
When the Lodz Ghetto was formed at first  you still lived outside the ghetto for a while  didn't you?
And before the ghetto was closed completely  we run away from the ghetto -- from Warsaw  and we went to Krakow.
And we went through Poland  but I heard that all my family perished during the resistant in Wa rsaw ghetto.
>> Susan Snyder: At this point by 1942 you're living in a ghetto.

There was a point in time the ghetto was liquidated al ready and now there were rumors that the concentration camp is being liquida ted.
Did you realize that your cousins we re forming a partisan group  or did you just say  I want to get out of the ghetto and go to the woods?
And my mother figured the best way to get out of the ghetto was going toward the river.

So so here is Walter the first person who says never mind what the historians write  there was at least one bike in the in the ghetto.
You see  there was...the Warsaw ghetto had a different picture before the first expulsion and after the first expulsion.
Was there any guarding  or any police service inside the ghetto?
So that's how my parents cou ld fill in my name and I could go in to the ghetto.
A lots of people have been caught when they used to go out from the ghetto  a lot went to the woods  a lots of people once went to a little town  [name of town]  was 40 in one place  and they used to go at night time  no?
We have  I have few close friends  very close  we were all very close  we know each other  but I was in a much luckier position  uh  uh much lucky b ecause I was a professor before the war  and I was teaching in every Jewish gymnasium in Krakow  and lot of my students were in ---------  and they were a very  very close friend  and I tried to help them as much  and they were trying to help me  and many times happened that they helped me i n  in  in  in the ghetto  for example  one of my students was a  in the police  in the out there  he asked and beg the German to let me go because I was already in a transport to go  and they let him uh  the to the-----------this is a very important person  and he  he let me out  but you see  the  the  the  the respect and love was tremendous.
And like I said  it was on the left side of the -- and the ghetto was on the right and the gates were now moved around.
13 Chlodna and Sienna were streets within the confines of the Warsaw ghetto.
Rumors began to in the ghetto that eventually the ghetto will be liquidated.
I just remember that they were forced to go to ghetto.
Well  I have to tell you that around the ghetto there was nothing  which is plain fields  for miles and miles to a house and it wasn't like you could run into a building or something  there was nothing there.
For us the best thing which ever happened  but you see  when we left our parents  we left them in the ghetto.
And you have a cousin over ther e. You'll be able to stay in the ghetto.

And what happened with me is I marched into the little ghetto and I met them.
In January 1943  when they started liquidating the ghetto -- it took them four days  so on the second night  we couldnt get through the -- we had already  you know  the ammunition; the were prepared.
Did you go out at all after the ghetto was liquidated?
From ghetto Lodz who came in out of the ghetto we had 1 500.
Which it was that it was shameratsyer  that it was a youth organization belonging to the Zionist organization  and th at spark kept through me  it was the new thing  just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto  and become a resister  and fight the Nazis  this is how it was  the new fighting that it became in me  and I assume in the rest of the guys that are war with me  because when people reso rted themselves to go on train -- to a -- rooftops  and on the steps to go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable] on their shoulders  and speeds of the trains maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour  maybe 60  ttimes 50  doesnt matter the speed.
Do you remember when this order came to report to the ghetto?
Did they know that -- they knew you were Jewish from your I.D.?
Yeah  this was one of the main feelings in the ghetto.
They don't like us because we're Jews but they didn't like them because they were inferior.
Especially those who worked at the uh well the had the--the--the gate police who worked at the gate of the ghetto and of course there is that they would  some would ask who ever brought some stuff in  they would ask for--for a--for a--uh piece of the action.
On this particular ambush  we  all right  Fritz remain wounded but he  they took him back  you know what I mean to the Rachen  but this is to the Rachen ghetto at that particular time aware of partisans that was over there  but it didn't do much good.
The family on my father's side  they mostly conver ted before the war an d nobody  or almost nobody went to ghetto.
Of course  then there -- we came to the Warsaw  first contact with the German.
And he was in the ghe tto and he was never deported out of the ghetto.
So there was male female relationships throughout the ghetto  and I would think  yes  there were friendships either way.
Take her with us and well bring her over to the people from the Warsaw ghetto resistance.ﬂ That time I went with them.
My father was very sick; and so I got back to the ghetto  eventually.
At th at time  at our little room in the ghetto we had had my mother father and my grandmother and a a unt  she was a cripple.
So we went to him and we told him we didnt feel well and wed like to go see a doctor  we actually wanted to go out and see what happened to the little ghetto.
And my uncle...they start to talk about the ghetto in Warsaw  so my uncle decide that he wants to come to live back in Tarczyn because he was from Tarczyn because he got so rich so he went to live in...in Warsaw.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: Do you remember -- once you were in the ghetto  do you remember your life there in the ghetto?
Thats was not good for Christian [indecipherable] ghetto  must move other ways  because all time be losing proposition  because if 60 you stay  you know  where everything is  you are satisfied  if you must move you lose all contact.
So the little trading I had in ghetto from   I advanced it in Landsberg.
They had an area a -- the main street  the -- the ghetto  two or three streets shorter  till one da -- this was all -- yes  till it was summer 42.
Yes  their isolated but painful... As I said  we are belonging to the Mes-ada which are only survivors and a lot of them from Lodz  who went through the Lodz ghetto  and th e best of friends and they would never have accepted me if I had been that brutal floor dancer  gigolo.
Even within the ghetto you couldnt m ove without having that patch.
It was maybe  maybe a fourth of the size of the main ghetto.
He became -- he got a job of being a -- ad -- administrator of a -- of a part of the ghetto  its a couple streets.
And then we used to go in the countryside to load potatoes for the ----- and the ghetto to enter the main involving the park  no?
And then...then we couldn't go a nymore with the train so...because it was very dangerous  so we started Jawisowice kitchen and Jawisowice was already a ghetto.
So on that day  we left the protected houses and we moved into the Budapest ghetto which by that time was built up around the great synagogue of Budapest  beautiful big building  completely restored by now.
And in many cases they thought they were helping the Jews.
Uh  people were again being taken to camps  but what happened in August  and now I understand that  uh  we were  there was  there were orders post  orders posted all over the ghetto that on a given day  and it was in August  I don't remember when  I remember it was a very hot day.
In the ghetto  I had a barber coming every day to shave me and when I needed to give me a haircut.
What do you remember taking with you wh en you went into the Krakow ghetto?
>> Bill Benson: Sylvia  before you went into the ghetto  if I understand correctly  the family went to Warsaw.
I would like also to mention that the the 500 intelligentsia  the people that they took out right right Interview with Abe Resnick September 22  1994 49 after the ghetto was closed  we found out in the next few days  that those was the first 500 people that they took to the   and they shot them all.
How long did it take before the Germans put all of the Jews into this ghetto?
But all of these years you spent in the forest  before that in a ghetto  did you ri -- did you ever think youd see that day?
He was the commander of the -- he was known that the when-enever he came the different ghettos  that he was the liquidator of the ghetto.
And he  when he saw the Germans coming  hes supposed to throw out a hand grenade and we all will go out in the streets  fight the Germans outside the ghetto.
It was sort of f -- more in a [indecipherable] Socialist Labor Zionist  you know  there were different -- different groups in the Zionist -- in the Zionist area.
And we had a small suitcase which I was carrying which was carrying the family photos.
How were you able to get some education while in the ghetto?
He used to bring in certain news from the outside  because he was on the outside  into the ghetto to the group  I guess.
I think wa -- from the beginning  were -- when the liquidate the ghetto  they -- they -- they knew that people were hiding.
And she  and it was interesting that peo ple who were escaping from ghetto  they either tried to be in countryside which was easier to hide.
I was le ft all alone in the ghetto  a teenager  15  16 years old.
The only good thing about the ghetto is the whole family was intact.
They stayed away from us and that was one way to bring weapons into the Ghetto.
10 000 of them came into the ghetto  this was January 4  and by then the ghetto had 70 000 people.
The ghetto I think was fairly loose and a lot of Jews from Minsk-Suwatki  I think managed to mingle with Poles and get away from the town  according to various villagers.
Were these the clothes you had with you from the ghetto?
Behind in the 76 000 that number and one comes over to me and asks me where are you from and I told him and they said oh tell me about the Warsaw ghetto uprising and I told him all that I can  how we were fighting in there and he brings another two guys  he brings over and the one asked me where  I told him what are you doing.
They took him -- that's why -- you know mostly the Jewish policemen was working with some German police  you understand.
The ghetto was -- when they left  the ghetto was something between like 2 and 250 000 people.
Irene was with her  I was not in the Loder ghetto.
When  when you went into the closed ghetto  when the ghetto was closed  were you in that apartment sharing it with this other person or -- No  you mean if I lived with him before that?
Did you hear about concentration camps in other places from people?
She crawled through the holes and the ragging and a lot of food and she helped us to going into the Ghetto.
Can you tell me a little bit more about the Ghetto  what you all did?
But he had the whole information from the [indecipherable] ghetto and he was the one to send constantly with messages to the ghetto and get to the people and give them the letters.
End of Tape #1 13 Tape #2 Okay  I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Minsk ghetto before we move on  what you can remember about the daily life  or what kind of work you did.
That is how we were actually saved  because when the Germans left  they completely destroyed the Ghetto by fire and by bombing it and by all kinds of things.
Yes  I had one girlfriend who visited me in the ghetto.
Anyhow  during that period  from the time that we were eli-eliminated -- expelled from that main street  until such time as they formed -- the Germans -- the Nazis formed a specific area for a ghetto  we changed apartments three times.
The children started to move away fro m--what I call the Jewish ghetto  self-imposed Jewish ghetto  and move out a little bit to suburbia.

Ghetto  a ghetto  what it really was is that they came and took an area within a city  and surrounded it with barbed wire  all built walls  and concentrated as many Jews as they can in a very confined area.
It wasnt a sheltered existence in my own self-mad e ghetto  whatever ghetto that is  as many people do.
When we came back  the ghetto was all together change d  we couldnt recognize the ghetto.

So then on October 13 th  1942  the ghetto was encircled.
They took us from out everywhere we lived and we had to go to this hospital and stay there and we were there for a few weeks.
They were mostly young women who had finished matura either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in 40  and they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms  gray with an orange band  and it was a police corps that lasted probably eight months.

Uh I remember quite a number of people who would...wanted to get out of the ghetto  wanted to escape.
Evidently we left that summer but the ghetto was still left on for a while.

The ghetto was not what you consider a ghetto here  just an area where people live and are kind of segregated.
I joined the [indecipherable] the Warsaw ghetto resistance organization in New York  because for awhile we lived in New York  in Manhattan.
So was everybody in the ghetto forced to -- The hanging were on a little -- not place  but a -- a little marketplace  other than this Balutski rinnek.
That's when we...that we heard...it was all over the whole ghetto.
You see  it dragged on and that's why when all these news kept on infiltrating into the ghetto  we listened to it  hoping but somehow it sounded unbelievable that Hitler is being defeated or he is losing a battle because he is so almighty and look what he was doing to us.
>> Alesia Fishman: So from there you worked in the fields for a few weeks hoping that you weren't going to be deported but next came the ghetto.
Had you been allowed to bring any of your belongings into the camp from the ghetto?
They gave us things out when we came to the Ghetto.
Can you tell me what the conditions were in the ghetto?
When the ghetto was liquidated  we all went into that same hiding place--the whole house  you know where we lived.
Oh  so the ghetto was liquidated Oh  its like it wasnt like they were it wasnt like they were transported to a camp outside or something.
Q. Did you have to hide him while you living in the ghetto?
That's why the Zionist organizations  they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth  where as this one was mo re individualized  by themselves.
And I was looking which is the best one to go in in the ghetto.
One day in the ghetto time  I was already working on the airport and we were digging ditches and doing some other thing.
This was...all that happened shortly before the ghetto was set afire.
Yes  from the ghetto  we were all women out of the Lodz Ghetto.
I  I hurt my knees by doing it  but we came through the ghetto.
Like in Katnaf Tribonovsky  and  in Se ptember there was a ghetto already.
You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do.
They were  Ill tell you in a minute how they were killed  and that horrible death  but anyway  working in that part   in the ta-kosh factory we came home every day but then there were days th at we were not permitted to leave the ghetto anymore.
So  this passed by and they started moving us again  to a Ghetto.
I think they knew when we were there that the war  now looking back on it they didnt keep us long in the ghetto either.
This was a group of 83 partisans of Jewish fighters in the Uprising  in the  from the Uprising  of the Jewish Uprising in the ghetto.
By throwing me out of the ghetto  he had uh really saved my life.
And next day I went to the ghetto  and this brother  he was waiting around.
And was your mother working in the ghetto also  or was she home with you?
But for instance there was one man uh and he was a police- man in the ghetto and he did get his child and he went alone.
So -- but on the side was entrance to ghetto  but this was blocked by barbed wires.
I realize now that he passed away before the ghetto was liquidated.
All Jews from the surrounding from Krakow had to move to the ghetto.
Uh...I grew up in this mill district of Pittsburgh to the age of 7  then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I had to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill  and I completed my high school educa tion at High School  40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936  by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi.
Q. Back in the Ghetto was there any schools  was there cultural activities?
Both inside the ghetto  and outside of the ghetto  the adults  the priests  the rabbis  would tell the kids not to stir things up  not to form in a resistance  not to resist  because that would make things worse.
No  it was close to thousa nds in the ghetto to clean.
Then it was the ghetto and this is -- inside so beautiful  painted and everything.
After we left the ghetto  I had the shor ter hair than you  very crew cut.
So one day  they sa id that you can take in some wood  in the ghetto.

Okay  now lets see  we talked about your father and your mother and how  what happened to them once they went to Ausc hwitz and they were with you the whole time when we talked about you going from the ghetto in Uhzgorod and then on to Auschwitz`.
We did not want to come back to that ghetto  but where do you go.
He said  \ Well  I'm pretending I'm a Polish railroad worker and I have a lot of connections  I live outside of the ghetto  and I have a lot of connections with Polish people who hide Jews for money.
And there were rumors and whispering around that the Germans are going to liquidate the ghetto.
But through  of course we were interest -- we went -- I went to look at the ghetto and I had an uncle and an aunt and cousins living there.
But when the Germans came into the ghetto  the first thing they did  they went to the hospital.
Before the ghetto was actually formed  the head -- what they called the -- the elder of the Jews  it was decided upon  and it was Rumkowski.
70 03:49:41 So  as the ghetto was burning  life was going on as normal on the other side?
So  life was getting  every day  tighter and tighter  and coming back to the Aktion of the 1 500 men  till was quiet in the ghetto.
Because more or less that was like a ghetto where we lived already.
It was relatively safer there and that is what led us to believe  that when the order finally came for us to report to the ghetto that we could survive somehow and maybe wait out the war by living in Borek Falecki without reporting to the ghetto.
What happened afterwards  of course you know the life in the ghetto was a pretty miserable.
The Libau ghetto lasted in -- I think until 43  then the last few hundred Jews  mainly craftsmen and such  were deported to Riga  then they were put in the Riga ghetto.
The street cars stopped running about midni ght  and that's when they were taking us all to large Ghetto.
You told me that in the ghetto there were many actions where they picked people up.
So what I did  I went up as close as I could to the fence  and showed her to the German soldier there  that Im here on a mission from the ghetto  go to this and this building there  just to check on something  and I am coming out right away back.
They were taken to the small ghetto and during the night they were taken to one of the forts and liquidat- ed.
So some of the people  when they took the right action to go to the left  they took them to the--to the small ghetto.
And soon  there was  uh  and soon there was the ghetto.
My wife  future wife  stayed with her mother and father because the mother was catholic  she could  she didn't have to go  and I left with that transpor t uh  uh Vienna  it was  I think it was October  ‚42  and uh  the  -------us with a um  with boxcars to Ther esienstadt  that was a  a  a former military camp for  for us and so it's just  and they made a ghetto out of this uh  of this city  just like they did in Poland  made these ghettos.
But  I remember that we have -- because it was the small ghetto was very narrow and we avoid to go near the fence  so we made some holes between one court to another  or small entrance by putting out part of the fence between the court.
The women didn't work on that Saturday or Sunday or Saturday  and he went to work  and that man  that Lajzer ...came and that partisans  a lot of partisans  walked into that group to go into the ghetto.
And when they start to break into the ghetto and round up all the Jews near the synagogue  I tried to run ou t from the ghetto on the the same spot that I used to always sneak out.

Beautiful families  and and each So there was a there was a Jewish police force in the ghetto.
But before -- ho-how did you ge t to the ghetto?
I think on May 12th  we were being  we were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto under guard.
The ghetto was getting smaller at that poin t  we had moved several times already.
But the... the...the all the Lithuanians in the city spoke about it that a Jew in the ghetto brought about the release of a Lithuanian who kept...this is most remark able incident.
I: Do you know how they chose your father to be the head of the ghetto?
>> Nat Shaffir: The ghetto was established -- ther e were large houses.
But  I have to describe you a little bit  the life in th e ghetto.

When -- when the ghetto came into being  did you feel vindicated in any way?
At that time  I was alone already and living across the street from that factory becau se the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller  and at the time they accepted me in the Tobbens factory it was closing already.

01:10:40 How did your family prepare to go into the ghetto?
So therefore  I am saying  if there was a -- if there was a Warsaw uprising in ghetto  they were our troops fighting for Warsaw ghetto.
No  I'm talking about this ghetto where I was  I don't know nothing about the other ghetto  nothing at all.
And the fact that it was an open ghetto made lif e in that sense easier.
There were people  particularly one Polish aristocrat  I forget his name  that went to Warsaw ghetto and saw whats going on  and he went to Washington to talk to Roosevelt and to London and tell them whats going on in Warsaw ghetto  and they wou -- didnt want to believe him.
And at the time so  lets talk about now the escape from the ghetto and going to the Bielskis.
That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in the ....was it the Lublin?
Linkova Street and the Old City quarters were cut off from the ghetto.
I just wanted to point out that the Vilno Ghetto had not only just from Vilno.
And how that happened is that the Nazis finally decided they have to make a big ghetto.

So  47 Tell me what the last days of the ghetto were like?
And I'm gonna go back from the Auschwitz  you know  from the...from the ghetto.
I was all by myself  then I decide to -- to smuggle myself in -- into -- into the ghetto  Kalisz ghetto.
Nothing could encourage me more to dare and to escape from the ghetto.
They -- they started picking the -- before that even  people were coming towards the -- from the ghetto towards the marketplace to walk.
Because I got a Polish passport and I was thinking to go out on the Aryan  Polish side.
They... Tell us...excuse me  what...what happened leading up to the liquidation of the ghetto  so we know.
And in the very beginning of the ghetto  I was very avid reader and I read vivaciously.
So this was the atmosphere of the ghetto  that people hoped to be lucky and be at a place where their work will be needed.
Well  it was the first days -- we were able  the first days  to go outside  because the ghetto wasnt established  and go out and trade with the farmers because the stores were already -- the stores were closed under the Russians  to close.
When  the last time  just before we moved to the ghetto the first tim e  we had to leave our home  lock the door and give them the key.
And what the Germans did they said  ﬁNow we are going to form a ghetto.
05:48:02 We see people dancing and is laughing outside the ghetto walls saying the Jewish bed bugs are frying.
No  they were they were murdered  you know  right there  you know  the machine gun you know  th e machine guns were set up from from the theres a a couple of years ago it was a book written about the escape from Sarny   from the Sarny ghetto  and according to th at book  you know  it said they set up machine guns around them  you know  and murdered 14 000 people that were there  you know  so so D-D-Do you did they survive the 1 941  or was this ghetto liquidated pretty early on?
But she was also one of the few...Isaac Zuckerman and Miriam were one of the few Jewish 21 people that were able to...to get out of the Warsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive.
Half was standing in the Christian side and half in the ghetto.
And they know  they -- you know  they knew -- you know  Im Jew -- a Jew -- I probably know -- I was in the ghetto  probably if I know who was a policeman  who was this -- who was -- who was a collaborator.
So we prepared a special bunker for them  and when I came unfortunately when I was already on the cemetery  on my way back...it was only three days later...I uh some of the people told me don't  don't try even to get in because you you'll be in spot because th e ghetto is already on fire.
Meanwhile there was a lot of commotion in the ghetto  many more Germans.
01:28:09 Now he had to determine  where he put the Je ws to the ghetto  he had to determine a Jewish management of the Jewish people  so the Germ an Jews  his name was -- he was a man that was 72 years old at the time and he ran an orphanage in that part of the city  before.
And in nighttime  we found over there they gave us a shovel in the ghetto we dug holes  cat and dog (?).
O K. Then we lived like this in the ghetto and then later I was taken away from the ghetto.
H-How did you know that you had to leave the ghetto?
And I basically had a good aptitude for math and when I was at the end of the ghetto  I was proficient with math to actually college level.
Theres a -- the Germ ans have their administrative office inside the ghetto  which is not the most usual procedure in these ghettos.
And helped us to secure arms and to join us -- or to join the Warsaw ghetto in -- in a quiet uprising that could have changed history  could have  if the Polish resist ance that had enough arms  and was well or fairly well organized  mostly officers of the Polish arm y. If they would have joined the uprising  I wonder what would have happened.
If you came into Buchenwald  they find out you are a policeman in a ghetto  like I know from my hom etown people died there.
And when we went to the ghetto  I know my -- I cant remember what I said in my story  but I dont know if I even emphasized th at  but my mother kept telling us to take only  I mean  just clothing and only the dearest things that we wanted to have with us.

So he couldnt  and then they started evacuating the Lodz the city and they started the ghetto.
There was another time when we had to leave the village.
That area lived only three thousand  but they squeezed...so when we heard  we took it for granted that first of all five thousand Jews are coming to the ghetto and Dr. Elkes  the head of the Jewish Council  said we have to meet them as brothers  give them the feeling they are coming to brothers  so he ordered that the women should prepare hot coffee for them because the terrible cold...in January was the thirty...thirty centigrades below...below uh below uh below...thirty below...the most hard winter in the ghetto was 68in 1942.
The people who were in the family camps to those who were assigned in the various command posts  in companies  I would say that may be 100 to 120 people were saved of a population in the ghetto  for at least seven or eight hundred.
So that was the open ghetto part because only could go into certain area of the city.
And from what I understand  it was the one and only time you were in the ghetto after the wall was secure that is  people could not go in.
The Russians were very close  but before the Russians would get there  they would blow them up blow the ghetto up.
It wasn't like a real in Warsaw Ghetto because that was the beginnings.

Kapo was this  like internal police  you know  they always with -- you have a light -- large wooden sticks  and they  you know  tried to beat them to ord -- make some orders in ghetto for the Jewish people.
So in October 1941 the first transports were sent  five of them  a thousand persons each to the Lodz ghetto.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 Again we had a problem.
This is why we rose up in 1944  thats how all our brothers in in the Warsaw ghetto rose in 1943   because they preferred we preferred to die with our arms in hands  than going to the gas chambers.
I thought that I'm going to come to the ghetto  let my mother come to here.
They had two or three young people  they brought them in from outside the area  the ghetto.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 >> Bill Benson: And from what you know  as you said a moment ago  she was taken to a different camp than your father.
One could not go in without a sp ecial pass  and even with a pass... the story went around Warsaw that a Polish doctor  on the so-called Aryan side  whom a Jewish doctor called because he had a serious case  we nt into the ghetto with a pass.
Yeah  and additional  I got a lette r from my good friend who survived the ghetto.
If you survive  you-- you'll be able to come back  but it's going to be absolute ly awful.ﬂ Now  the reason why my mother wasn't there is sometimes that summer toward fall she was in touch with a Polish woman  a peasant Polish -- Polish peasant woman that used to come to the ghetto wall  and she 29 used to sort of give her items of clothing  it ems of jewelry  and exchange it for bread for  for food with her.
He doesn't provide specific details about what it was like in the ghetto or in the camps.
Furniture you couldn't take out there  but the Jewish people used to live in the Ghetto.
The only time they organized themselves and most of them time it was Polish Jew  it was in the ghetto of Warsaw.
But when I was in the Warsaw ghetto it was still the ghetto.
Were you still at at the time of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising?
From one place to another place  again traveled through Interview with Esther Fol November 8  2008 12Europe again  illegally  just like I did with my mother when my mother escaped from the ghetto and went and traveled  and somehow went back to the city  I think to her husband.
There was four of them like this and they used to bring the horses there  and they would bring the people from the ghetto and kill the horses and slaughter them and put them in the other place and cut it apart and give it to the -- there was meat and some of the horses I'm sure were sick.
When he came to...to the ghetto of Kovno  first of all he...he converted it to a concentration camp.
So  what ha ppened in the ghetto  that every month or two  there was [knocking] somebody at the door.
And then when these two children  the three people  but two of them children  come to  you know  to the Jewish hospital in Vilnius  your father sees them  is that already when the ghetto has been established  even in its early days  or is that before the establishment of the ghetto?
Because at that time there were very few children left in the ghetto.
From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working every day with them going back from ghetto to or .
And we were the first ones  me  my stepmother  my ste pbrother and my father  to crawl out from the Glost ghetto.
Can you maybe tell me more specifically what happened in Radom when you were in the ghetto and how your parents got out?
Well  I dont recall we were specifically talking about that  until later  when the Holocaust started and I remember once my father saying to the Germans  were offering  you know  for thos e who collaborate  you know  with them  offering the chance to be the first ones in to the apartments of the Jews that they that they deport to the ghetto.
This was after Germany had occupied If after the occupation  this is I am speaking this was during the ghetto  all right.
So you had food to eat  more than the average person  so what happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the ghetto into the ghetto works  they had a separate room.
Now was this -- was this kind of thing fairly typical of the Jewish community  the kids were going to a public school  not a Jewish school?
Did you know if there were any Jewish children hiding in this compound?

Besides  he didnt -- being a Jewish  he didnt have the -- the -- a level of secrecy he -- he would -- the -- really he -- hes supposed to have on his position  a foo -- over there  he -- hes supposed to have  but they didnt give it to him because he was Jewish.
Somehow my brother got a sleigh with somebody  and they took me out from the ghetto  and they brought me to the ghetto in Rzeszow  to Dr. Heller.
So  as long as that regime in the ghetto administration--the German regime remained as is  you felt safe.
So we find places in the ghetto where they used to hide.
Do you clean...the Doppler had a Ukrainian maid  but when the maid went away on vacation  I went over there and helped to clean and...but sleeping  I always sleep at Mrs. Niederman's house  uh apartment  and she always used to go to the ghetto for uh making dresses in the ghetto in Radom...they still had a ghetto.
Who were most of the people guarding the ghetto  guarding the work brigade  supervising these killings at the forts?

But a day later  on the 29th  thousands of Latvian and German police came into the ghetto  drunk  most of them drunk - shooting  chasing everybody out.
There was a section in the city where a lot of poor Jews lived.
I was just doing the work  and it did give me an op portunity if I was to go and bring water which was in the next house  we didn't have running water  and then they were friends of mine  the Poles  and I used to sneak into their house  and they used to give me a slice of bread which I could bring back to the Ghetto.

You...every every every uh day when I went from the ghetto to the stock commisar  to the government authority  it was approximately for eight kilometers  five miles  six miles.
Now  Jewish people that lived out of that section  were forced to get into that ghetto section  but they were not allowed to carry nothing with them  just the way they were standing.

His group continued to come every day to uh to the factory  and since I was  my job was to sweep the streets  I managed to sweep the street under the window in which he worked and so we could say hello to each other  and that continued for about four months and uh sometimes in late uh late '42  his group as well as the remnants of the ghetto that the Poles  all those people was the was their was the stamps on their ID cards and including some other groups that was still going to work from the from the ghetto  they were put on a train and shipped on to that farm on the in the east.
