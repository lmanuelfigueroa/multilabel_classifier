When they made the little ghetto  that was where the Jewish quarter used to be before the war.
As a matter of fact  before the ghetto  he told me: Look  the situation is getting very bad.
Now  you were living in the small ghetto  and very early in the life of the ghetto  the small ghetto was liquidated  correct?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 27 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: nobody but uh we wound up having uh pork  for example uh cause there was hardly any meat in the uh ghetto and from the rations that I recall.
Things started getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made the Ghetto in our town.
From what I remember  it wasnt  you know like the Polish Jews were in ghettos for years  but this wasnt a work ghetto.
We didn't have too many and there was also no time to socialize in the ghetto.
Now  t wo days later  after this transport left.... And prior to that  there were also surround...surroundings of...of local people  of the people in the ghetto by the Germans [ NB: razzias].
But  you know  people would look at those lis ts and also append their own queries about the whereabouts of their families  and who went where  and who is likely to have been in this or in that ghetto  or who is likely to have information about the fate of individual persons.
I was in Budapest for the last 2 years living without papers  and uh the SS  the  the Nazis came into Budapest and uh I wanted by all means to be with my family because there was nowhere that I could hide anymore  and I was determined under  under any circumstances to reach my mother  my sister and uh  whatever would happen to them  I want ed to be with them  and we knew already that there will be a ghetto and that uh  I cannot uh  uh save myself anyway  and I didn't want to save myself to begin with  I wanted to be with my family.
When you were -- one ques tion the museum had was  when you were in the ghetto  before you were sent to Auschwitz -- Yeah  yeah?
It wasnt the barracks  it was a little house by itself.
I knew if he was in this ghetto  if he's in this ghetto maybe  maybe he's someplace.
Thats when the mass killings started  and actually  the-they started -- the --the -- all the killings were in -- in the -- in the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania.
Did let me ask you a couple other questions about the ghetto.
Tell me some other things about ghetto life  before we get to that point.
We had a -- an old age home in the building and the people were dying by -- >> Bill Benson: And again  the importance here is that you're forced into a ghetto.
You will stay.ï¬ And the day after  they op ened a few more streets for the ghetto and we got into a very good 8 house belonging to uncle of Lottes where we stayed for the next  âtil the end of the ghetto.
My grandmother lived w ith is in Warsaw and during the time  wartime  she didnt get any letter from her daughter in Lodz ghetto.
And so  everybody went it was no big problem to go into the ghetto because nobody knew what is going to happen.
By that time I had to make the decision  should I take the chan ce and go with him to Vilna or I mean  I wasnt sure anyway but it still probably safer than to go back to the ghetto.
After the ghetto experiences and hiding  I sort of saved myself by going to school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat.
You know so in that respect  even though being in ghetto  they helped us often.
But I'm just tr ying -- let's go back a little bit to the summer of 1941 and how the ghetto came about.
Instead  the ghetto hospital sent a surgeon  accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers  including my brother Moshe.
And so my mother put on the men's clothing and took my sister under her arm and my father took me under his arm  and we marched out of the ghetto.
Mother left me with a family that provided us with transportation to the other ghetto.
He used to bring in from the food of the horses  he used to bring into the ghetto.
Because -- because we all lived -- we all lived in a ghetto.
And when a sondercommander came in  means something will be happening -- will be happening in the ghetto.
Was your family deported or did they die in the ghetto?
In January of 1945  the Sov iet Army liberated the 800 remaining Jews from the Lodz ghetto.
Now also  we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to told that the group came from the ghetto.
When they were hidden in the public washroom  they looked out of a little window and when Aron saw that Tadek is there  he went out to talk to Tadek and he begged Tadek to take another person.
But appare ntly all these things that the Germans put in operation to strangulate the economic life of the Warsaw Ghetto and to bring the demise of the Jews  didnt happen for them fast enough.
So  everybody was working and everybody produced something  and we produced and the Ghetto was getting food.
And then his wife  and they was taking them back to ghetto under guard -- I don't know how -- she run away.
The only successful hiding  successful survivals outside that I know of were very brave women who got out of the ghetto and managed to survive some in other towns.
I don't have to get...to the back ghetto now  because my parents and my sister are gone.
This was our luck  and in the morning the ghetto was completely empty  the small ghetto  and we could hear in the night the machine guns and the shooting  because the Nitenfort was not really far away from the ghetto.
Did you know where things were happening in other places in the camp?
Take her out of here immediately.ï¬ So then Aron approached Bauer  evidently while the ghetto was burning  and when Bauer passed by and saw the shooting and the killingâhe was a decent human being and that he was terribly upset.
There were ten people on the floor sleeping and as I was dressing I looked out of the window that was leading outside the ghetto and I see trucks  German trucks with soldiers  a whole column going towards the ghetto gate and as they were riding down towards the gate they were dropping off Polish policemen across the street to stand guard watching the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: You described that to me as a terrific birthday present.
The war was around the ghetto and we had we had to move to the ghetto.
When the school -- and that -- I -- well  my address in the ghetto was Berka Joselewicza 60 Brunnenstrasse 16.
And the whole world was being turned upside down and he hustled us out  the three of us  and this police officer from the ghetto  out to the street and on the street is this police captain's small Italian car  which is enough for three people maybe and inside the car is my father and he says  get in  so in gets my mother and the two of us  my brother and I sitting on their laps and he says to the police  the police sits in the front and he's at the driver side  the police captain  he says put your rifle on these  these are dangerous people  the least chance  shoot them.
Interview with Hannah Kalman May 20  1999 18 They were inside the ghetto  but they were we were they wa we got wires  so we got only the sidewalks and he was walking in the middle of this [indecipherable] the streetcars passed  yeah  yeah.
Maybe the ghetto they started doing about two or three months later.
Tell me a little bit about the ghetto life and the Jewish consul and all of that.
2) Bella in 1942 in the Sosnowiec ghetto with a friend.
Now  I understand [tape blank for an interval  then resumes] Were there people also working in the ghetto?
Did you know about a ny resistance being organized in the ghetto itself.
Later in the evening I heard about about the Jews remaining RG-50.030*0580 45remaining alive  following which days later  we knew that it was it wasnt true  that the Germans didnt leave Jews alive  but at that time but Rumkowski was del-de-delirious with happiness that that the chances that the Jews were and the other people in the ghetto Tho-Those were the Jews who were departed during the gaspara  right?
Oh  was terrible in the ghetto this time  was terrible  because it was -- there was a -- like a few different group of the people in the ghetto  was terrible  because some was pretty rich Jewish people  and some were -- most was very poor.
And I had some encounters with the ghetto police when I was there briefly.
And then I went to visit my  by then my mother and father and Uncle and Aunt and my brother and my sister moved to the ghetto.
It seems to me going back from ghetto to and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I cannot recall.
We realized it  we said to ourselves  from th e ghetto would be a good chance to escape  because theres just a picket fence and thats it.
At that time the ghetto wasn't so hard to get out of the ghetto.
And he  they ran into each other in the ghetto and he arranged for them to work in a factory outside the gates  which was supposed to be a slightly protected situation so that every day they would all go out to work.
The Germans didnt -- when the Judenrat was established  the Germans didnt went in in the ghetto too often.
Ther e was only as I speculate d already that was one chance that some German official in the Krakow Plaszow ghetto was handed a list of who is going to Schindler.
In many ghetto and also in concentration camps and killing centers  the Nazi officials regularly had a children's action to call children from that ghetto to murder them  to call them from the ghetto or from the concentration camp.
Yeah  yeah  we were getting -- we were getting around  you know  in the ghetto in the beginning  meeting in some houses and spend  you know  talking about a situation and -- and playing chess and -- and still -- you know  cards  chess and -- and try to spend the time  see.
And it was  the thing was  you see  by April the whole -- everybody in Lodz had to be -- if he was caught outside th e ghetto  he was shot.
Otherwise the ghetto would be a quarter of a million people.
So he went to the commandant of the Ghetto and he told him that he can't find his family  and the commandant from the Ghetto came and they found us and we were on the wrong side of the action  because people that were on the side that we were on  they went to the Ninth Fort  and everybody got shot.
So what was your next move after the ghetto  what happened?

And before the Wars aw burning my father and me  we took three families from ghetto and we found location  not me   my father mostly --was very good person  very good Christian  and took the Christianity for daily not only during Sunday.
Each morning a group of maybe 40  50 people gathered in the ghetto area with a leader.
