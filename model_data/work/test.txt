If they had known about Auschwitz  they should have been glad that I'm not being...that I'm going to Germany  to work  but they didn't know about Auschwitz and they wanted to get me out.

There was a foreman there  supervising the working women which have been work ing there for years and were very well suited for that job.
And  and then he said well you work for one day and then the next day you will go carry on.

There was really a shortage in manpower that I used to be with hi m in the office until very late to make sure that he concluded his work  because crossindexing the files and putting everything in place and who arrived and from where and who was gone and  you know  it wasnt easy for just one person to do it.
And  and the men had to go already to  work camp but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941  beginning 1942 or so.
I said  \ They supposed to take them to  to a job to work.\  \
And the Germans wouldn't let this go because they figured they hit the jackpot because they had right away people to get to work and they had people to start working with this munitions.
It had a uh some advantages  because I didn't attend  didn't have to attend uh roll calls; and I didn't have to go to work because I didn't have anything to wear.
We were marched in one direction heading toward some building where we were told that we're going to get...take a shower and we're gonna be given clean clothes and then we'll be taken to some place where we will work.

And then  what about di -- and then you -- you finished work and came back  and did you have supper?
No matter young  old  strong  weak  child  woman  child  man  doesn't matter  and we were in a camp like that  so it is a little deceiving because when we say we worked there  uh  because it was not a work camp.

And I say  Help us to get out from here to go back to Poland.
ﬁNot work makes you free.ﬂ And I taught to my ?

But in any case  one day I was allowed to go out to work under a one-on-one guard to dig an air raid trench  and I discovered where I was digging was obviously a field cemetery from the Swedish-Polish war of 200 years ago.
So and when he came home  then he was going to work there again.
I walked out of the group which went to work and ran away.

He could not be found in professions like farmer or work with his hands; businessman  money changer and so on.
And what do you do in your life?ﬂ I said  ﬁI did nothing  I was a student and I was doing some little work after that before the Germans caught me.
Did you stay at home then  or did you find another job?
After a while this job finished and this same German took us to an airport called Porbanek and  again  I started to work in Probanek.

>> Bill Benson: Henry  if I remember right  just before you were forced into the ghetto  you and your sisters went to work in an ammunition factory.
Was there a point that you became known and re lied upon for the work that youre able to do in the resistance?
I used to work at night  so I used to go into his office because if I needed a part  I went into his office.
Kotsuji  and Captain Fukamachi--who were very very helpfu l. They...they did a lot of work.
They so valued our work  I think  that after the war they presented us with the same medals they gave to fighting servicemen.
To explain a little 20 bit yet more about the situation  Lublin was at site where the Jewish POWs from the Polish  from the former Polish Army where stationed there  and they were doing the dirty work for the Germans.
And do you see people that you work with at the museum outside of the museum?
During the day  we had to march to the stone quarry  I would say maybe tw enty minutes away  and it was in a mountainous uh terrain  and uh  there they had to work  we had to work in this  this quarry carrying the heavy rocks  (cough cough)  and uh people died like flies.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: What kind of work did you do in the work camp?
And we were very lucky and he went to the authorization an d they made us that we could stay  but we 8 were not able  we couldn't work there because that would be wron g to take the work away from the natives.
He had already some machinery  but a lot of work was done by hand  by people.
We did not work for any Gestapo man in the ca mp.
We took that to the American consul in -- in Antwerp  his name was Leroux  and he was a very nice man  and I -- I spoke some English  and I said  ﬁI -- I want -- well work and we wont need any help ﬂ and -- and he believed me  and he said  ﬁOkay.
So every time he came back from work another one was gone.
And then  of course  I went into social work  and I worked with abused and neglected children.
And when I came to America I work with very rich people in the brokerage  all of them are millionaires  and one I told him that my mother always talk about Minerva   oh it was car made in Switzerland   it was 25 000 in America before the first World War.
He was a officer in the Soviet Army  and ...to work with us.
I would say that at least ha lf of them  because dont forget that we had shift work  that some people were going to work at night  in the evening  I dont know whether we had three shifts  I think.
And and that didnt work out  there was a a a man whose wife was in Florida  and they had two children.
And immediately I was taken off the work site  taken into the camp  report to SS  count one off from this work detail  they'll be coming in one short because he's coming in now and went to the  my clerk  block clerk  barracks clerk  who was a Pole who hated my guts because I always went to hospital and he hated that.

MG: The ghetto police they had it very tough because on one side they--I mean they were commanded to work with the Germans.
Four days I work and get me an envelope  I open up -- not in the shop  but I go on down there in the street -- I open it up  I see I got $21 and a few cents  not even 50 cents an hour.
But really didn't work out exactly they way we want put up a resistance in the ghetto.
So I would  you know  a sk whether there is a need for somebody  and they would come to work.
The first sign I had about it was when I had to work. [
And once you went down maybe 12 inches you know  it was easier to work.
But the law came out with the Nuremberg Laws  no non -Jewish young woman under the age of 45 was allowed to work for Jews.

And we have people coming to work with very large  outst anding loans from undergraduate and law school.
>> Nat Shaffir: The people that couldn't work or that the Germans did not think they could contribute anything to their society.
Actually they didn't care  all they wanted was people to go to work for them and clean up all of the work that had to be done in the farms.
When I was with...with my brothers  I sort of managed...you know...uh...certain time in the day when we got around after work  7 o'clock  8 o'clock everybody had something.
And I got really terrible grades  and and the more I think he tried psychology on me  but it didnt work.
The next day we heard that the Germans blew the whole airport -- was ready  the airport.

In fact  they were talking maybe I can work for them in the in the fur factory as a runner  as a you know  th gopher  you know.
They would have to send out someone else to work with me.
And I would go there maybe on the weekends or in the afternoon.

So he they started this newspaper  and invited to to do the main work  Jonas Patronas   whom I knew Okay.
I hope you have a challenging and meaningful visit to the museum.
That woman wh o is now fli -- claiming her work?
I thought I better ask for a parish and have an assistant who would do that work and then we can continue the work for the poor.

Uh he was he was called up and he was glad to go because in the beginning it was not at all clear what was happening to people that were being called up for uh work related uh for war related work in Germany.
And do you feel that the volunteers work pretty well together  or that sometimes there are frictions and tensions and No  we we we seem to be a very homogeneous or at least a very not necessarily homogeneous group  but we seem to get along very well together  and we havent had any great co any conflicts with each other.

And otherwise  when ever they need somebody  you know  at the museum  they always call me and I speak for -- for the people who start to work there  the new people  or -- so I speak to them.
And  actually  the Germans did not  as much as they did in their own country  take over the Jewish businesses.
After a days work  if they were pleased  we used to get a loaf of bread  a loaf of black bread  pumpernickel bread  which was more than you can imagine because  who could consume a big loaf of bread that must have been  if you really -- if you look at it  that would be probably a four  five pound loaf of bread?

We were afraid the -- because some were sent inside Yugoslavia to -- to work there for them.
And in Sweden  we made very good money with our work.
I'm just trying to envision you doing this work and how it might have been different for you as a Jew  as a woman  doing this really very  very dangerous work.
And we learned a great deal and I think had a lot to be proud of in terms of what the community did and the role that we were able to play  because they could never afford it  that sort of legal work  help.
I was working and after work I went to the dentist and I had to have a tooth pulled.
And now my mother says don't worry ; everything will be ok ; they'll go to work ; there is a misunderstanding.
And then I stayed for a few weeks  to work there. [
So I dont know  I find -- I -- I -- I got different jobs.
My husband we thought would be safe because he was permitted while in the ghetto  he was permitted to work outside of the ghe tto in his pharmacy.
Once I told Doreen Warriner that if it were possible to do it I would try and do it and knowing that when I came back to England I would have to go back to work  the thing was to arrange the se t up in Prague which could go into operation should I be successful when I got back to London.
But in any case  we were walking at night and sleeping at daytime.
They said they need to to to make order to divide between those who get more bread and those who get less bread  and they killed ten thousand so this that we had no confidence whatsoever and we made up our minds no more response to...and then they tried...they started to grab people from the street  and they could grab three hundred because most of the people from the ghetto were at work outside the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the people  so they took these three hundred and brought them to the place  to the democratic square.
By periodical selections in Birkenau  whenever ther e were transports  they used to weed out the camp population  those that could no longer work separated from those that could.
He took me on another place  where all the people already  old people work when they 70 - 60.
The life was work  and you came home  and there was also -- we were not able to use electricity very long.
After a few days they were sent to another camp and then to Auschwitz.
And as I said  there there was disorder but not...but not 17 because they wanted but things were...had had had had...were were in a rush and and and and had overwhelmed them  so uh then I found out that we...it was...we...it was organized in such a way that people  that parents were advised in Berlin and the Jewish communities outside of Berlin and also under the rules and regulations  they had set already with the with the...believe it or not by cooperation with the with the Gestapo  under which the the had to work  that uh uh the Jewish communities  the the welfare agencies uh and agencies had to select the children  which means that the child ren...the parents who got a way of assist of this project  made an application to the proper Jewish communities and then the social workers  the local social workers  then checked the...if the conditions we re right and and then they they made the application.
The other thing I want to mention is we had to march through the city of when we marched to these places  to these work places  and one day we were attacked by the...by the Hitler youths.
But my  but my  the compensation that I got from the work that I did was helping people.
And I work at the McGuire Airforce Base one day a week at the terminal helping people  space available in the families.
So Germany invades Poland   and then what do you -- you stay at your work?
Once we got to Brussels  she couldn't really work le gally anymore.
d We have and we have othe r work  metal works and we was .
The only person that let us overnight was this worker that used to work for my husband's father  and they put us in the basement full of coal and potatoes and ev erything that people put down there  and we stayed overnight  the three of us.
So you went out of the Ghetto every day to work?
You didnt -- you -- you all had to work in various places for a long time -- Oh yes  yes -- before you could do -- Oh yes  and -- and I thought  because I had this degree in -- in th -- in English literature I was going to get some wonderful job.
What kind of work did your father do at the time?
And she had to go to work  come to the United States.
No  we did not work  productive work like going out in an ammunition or in a painting factory or whatever.
We were trying to convince the people because it is an American tradition that you work in your own community.
I was not looking for work at this time  not in this stage of the game.
They liked me and they felt that they could use me for purposes because they did have a lot of German prisoners and I could help them in interpreting some of their cases.
We -- we had a job to do  we were there to do it.
We work uh in the... Farm... And I got a telegram that he is there and we should wait for him.
And I didnt realize  you know  that you have to work  even  for a living.
One time  at work  a German there always were Germans  SS or Gestapo coming came a very handsome tall young fellow  once again Heil Hitler a nd they start to look once again our way.
And then when all the people was...you know  there was screams and yells and the...the...the tragedy was that the...the men who was capable to work  they couldn't go with their wives or with their mothers or with their children.
I had all of Manhattan and Bronx and Brooklyn and Staten Island and Jersey and  tied up and they thought  we'll work him all over the country.
So one of the girls told to the other girl  \ Can you  after work  do a night duty?
Anyway  we went there to took over the st ore and I work for him til -- til -- was 1950 -- 54 and -- til 1955.
They... I could live only in the village  in the village near Vsetin about twenty kilometers where my wife also lived with me and I could work only as a worker--manual work  yes.
If you got sick in a camp  you were sent to Auschwitz.
I started with training workers in the various homes  with my newly acquired wisdom in social work.
After work nine  10 hours a day  cause I wanted to get more hours [indecipherable] .
Eventually they did take us in and uh we became uh the slaves of uh Auschwitz  those that could still uh be useful to work.
People had to live so many Jews  young people to work and they have to work for the Germans.
My sister was like a...as a nurse at the  at the hospital and she did a lot of  uh  illegal work too.
A couple days I stayed in the camp and then I went to work back  because you were afraid.
We still used to  by his demands  when I would come from work and we used to sort of talk about the Torrah  a little bit here and then the other.
And we were crying  we were asking her and didnt work.
Warsaw was already...on the western front...Warsaw already was surrounded...was under German occupation a nd in 1940 in October they began to uh work on the Warsaw ghetto  build the walls...about between eight and ten foot walls with barbed wires on top of the walls in Warsaw...broken glass  uh pieces of glass cemented 5 on top of the brick walls.
I dont know if this has anything to do with this or not but while I was here in Washington  I worked in a place  in a rest aurant called Duke Zieberts and on the way to work one day I hear on my radio that George Lincoln Rockwell is going to be speaking on the mall.
Uh  everything was rationed by that time in Poland  so it was very important to have the cards  and if you didn't work  you didn't have the ration cards  and my mother probably started to work at this time to  I don't remember where she worked  but I know she was working.
For three days  I couldn't grasp what was going on; until I realized that I'm in a factory of...in a death factory  where we are just as instruments being kept to work.
So we fooled the Germ ans  oh you got a big stomach  you -- you still be able to work.
And to put me in that bag and then when my mother would go to work with the women you know they had to file out of the ghetto to go to work  she would carry me out that way.
That was the worst part was during the the slave uh labor work in Germany.
In a day the partisans started to work  and the Russians came in.
And so  uh through Fritz we we got a letter in the right format saying that my dad had done work as a teacher for the for the Jewish Council  and uh was the was the famous commander  infamous commander of of that uh particular operation  let my mother go.
So  I didn't have any money per se and I asked Mr. White who was the owner of this electrical company if I could work some overtime to get some extra money  which he did and I worked there for a number of weeks.
We were then liberated from the camp after three months in there and allowed to live ther e  and again I went to work in vineyards  etcetera.
I worked in the office  you know to go alphabetically  but I wasn't really the one who went out and took the people out  who put them to work.
>> Bill Benson: When he left you  where were you at that point?
When you say your sister was work ing for a food factory  was this now something under German control?
And we got into his place  and we told him the story  and he kept us  hiding  uh hiding  but later he used us as to help him work  and this was uh  I don't know what to say now... Tell me how big an escape it was.
After six weeks I come out and we start to work again.
They played when you went out to work and when you came back.
In your work I know you worked in private research  you were never able to find out what happened to the rest of your family?
But we...but that time we already had something to eat  you know.
So there is no need  in my opinion  for so many editions  for so many work with it in– I dont know  I dont know.
The woman who used to work for him  the maid  the housekeeper  she knew that monastery  she talked to them an d when he was closed in the house  she went through the roof and went into the house and put him on clothe s from her husband who died.
Gen--somehow they--the adrenaline begins to work as you get more slank and you carried--carried all this that location.
They gave us clothing  as I said  they asked us to do -- we did work in the ki -- we kept our own rooms up  I mean the beds -- I mean  there was like a dorm.
I know that my father and a few other Jews decided right away to form a coop  some tailoring co -op and engage people in doing some work.
RJ] I worked in Cardiff  Eastmoor  Card iff  GKN  Geskin and Nettlefold and  er  I got called up in September 1940  which was rather a mistake because I had a reserved occupation er  cut a long story shot  it was  I had my call up papers but erm when I went down to work to see about it they discovered that my form that I had filled in to say that I had a rese rved occupation was some typist put it in the incoming mail instead of the outgoing ma il  no record of me at the labour exchange - so I got called up.
But th en we found out that the mother was in so-called Shonin's block where they kept people supposedly that weren't able to work anymore and they were kind of sheltered.
I managed to work again on the outside  again at another electrical company.
My mother tried to; my father ha d to work on Shabbos because on the weekend people had money.
They were bringing in -- oh  excuse me -- they were bringing in people into these camps at a certain number and the camps could only ho ld a certain amount  and they had to go ahead and get rid of that amounts thats goi ng to be displaced.
And hes from Montreal  and was raised very Jewish  and theyre much more receptive to the fact that I work in a museum  that I try to spread the word by giving speeches about my life.
When one time came and so he said  \ what  you will work?\  \
But Interview with Clarice MacLeod 11 July 15  1998 we did do some work on some of the patients that were there as far as -- well  we called them patients  they were really prisoners.
So from -- so that wa s a -- a -- obviously a total loss  and -- and then my father tried to make a living  you know  or bl ack market was a -- was the -- was the thing to do to try to  you know  scrape up a living and get a work permit  everybody had to work  you know  my -- my brother worked for the railroad do ing some -- he was mechanically inclined so he did some locomotive repairs  and -- and I we nt to school  you know  I went to -- to a school and -- and then I -- all of a sudden the -- the Uk raine became the foreign language.
It looked to me that it's a safer place  even if we had to work very hard.
We wait for him here.ﬂ And we waited until he got back from work at 5 o'clock in the evening.
When they came from work and they had a piece of bread and they found it and they killed you for this.
You should have died in the gas chambers.ﬂ I was in Germany 3 weeks ago  and I met with some Catholics who work for the Central Committee of Catholics in Germany. (
I went to Munich I start to work  to ma ke some money.
I mean  nobody could unders -- you know  nobody knew that na -- I mean  they were -- the Au strians welcomed the invasion  what they call invasion  with open arms  and there was -- I s -- I presume now  looking back  there was a lot of poverty  there was a lot -- there wi -- you know  people that didnt have -- there was no work  so -- and the Austrians isnt  by nature  are not very pri -- used to be -- not a very productive person.
In this time  when we decided with my three friends  to go to work  we went to work  they send us to work .
So  and I had papers from a church and I had those papers but you're going to work every day and all of a sudden one morning they came in and they said it's everything   they didn't let us go to work and it's   you know they clean out and we all have to go out of town.
And as they walked out  they the Nazis came in and took the other children.
A. Yes  I went outside of the Ghe tto to work.
We work for the German for the Wehrmacht and we do this and we do that -- you know  speaking German very well.
What was your life like there  did you work or go to  or only go to school  or . . .
I mean  I think he was wi lling probably  if I asked him something  but in Germany that was really a girls work and a wo mans work.
I said weve got to go out and work into a satellite camp where they haven't got extermination.
And all our stuff at home was made out of her work.
I saw hooks on the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 ceiling.
And she is very in touch with Vilna  with the people who work in the museum  because she is she has friends over there.
The way people shopped and the way you lived and what you did and because we had missed our education  it was hard for us to make a living and not knowing the language either  you did menial work  whatever was suitable for you at that time.
Well  fortunately I was brought up wher e we had maids at home  I mean  they weren't uniformed or anything  it wasnt ﬁUpstairs  Downstairs ﬂ but I was used to having somebody around to do things.
Till this day  I regret that I couldn't study more than I did because I had to  to work to sustain myse lf and my family all the years after the war.
Could you explain what that was  and what that work entailed?
So you didnt do no work in in the concentration camp?
So  what were the other resources to survive  then to work or stay with other families.
The only pay off was I could 18 take as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work.
So then later  the next day they started to take us to work.
And during outdoor works  the sun made such an nice -- such a good work  the sun and margarine is giving you such an beautiful tan  yeah.
Because if they know  the Russians would  a few weeks later  two or three weeks later  the Russians came and took us to Russia.
But yes  the entire time I was working at the Interior Department doing secretarial work and th Interview with Lore Schneider August 14  2003 25-- the Interior Department was walking distance to the campus of George Washington.
Where you want to work?ﬂ You know  we you get extra food if you work in  in the camp.
They put them for alt -- you know  to do all the kind of dirty work in the -- in the garrisons  in -- you know  all kind -- in garrisons  or in the villages  in the cities and -- and they replaced the Germans -- you know  they did the work for the Germans.
They were staying day and night at the gate and controlling the people who come to work and again and back  especially the people from Arbeitzant   it was a work department.
And I started then very soon I I worked  but I then after work from Wilson and company went to the evening school at IIT.
What are your thoughts  were your thoughts when you came to museum?
One time  I mean I could go on for days  one time there were three fellows who made their way from work  young fellows as a matter of fact  and they trie d to escape.
I thought that my work the last period in-in my in our own business  where I was (excuse me) very much involved in new developments in our area (this microbiological testing)  that I would want to continue with it  because I could see there is a lot of need there.
>> Bill Benson: And you were able to go and place that.
There was not any work for us to do other than bundling up clothing from people who they murdered  whether from other camps or just from Flossenburg.
Well  he came there to the embassy where we were in full work trying to issue those papers I told you about.
In France  in the early 20s needed people to work in the mines in northern France  to work in the factories  things like that   so they were letting foreigners come to do the work that Frenchman would not do.
He was almost -- You could almost call it stalking me  he would sometimes show up afte r work and I didnt like it and eventually  I think he just left.
And I  in this sense too  I see my work for the museum as as possibly indirectly contributing.
And then I came also to Zlene where I should work by the Battah factories  like a soldier. . .
So you have a lot of feelings about your work with the museum?
And they approach all the governments in exile  the British governments  and try to work on them.
But it took years for us to reconcile and regain some kind of emotional balance alth ough we are outwardly very  very well balanced  but the whole coming to the United States  tryi ng to work  trying to get degree.
Auschwitz had a subcamp  a labor camp  where they made ammunition.
So -- So did he start giving you more work because you were successful?
I saw some people from far away  but I didn't pay much attention who they are  but they did look to me like they're civilians  Polish civilians  work in the mine.
He had to work as a labo rer  physical worker in scrap iron.
She  people were sent out in to ammunition factories to work and so on and they were mostly killed.
I was able to do the practical work in the hospital - on the wards.
We lived in the South end and we didnt  some people through his work would come and look us up and so on.
When we first came here  she had all these books and every night shed come home from work  shed be exhaus ted.
Yes  the prisoners had to do most of the work  but it was German supervision.
My sister told me that my mother was trying to convince a Polish speaking French custom guy to let us in  but it didn't work.
They just used them for their dirty work  that's Felix Horn 42 [Date not labeled] Page 42 all.
And we looked out and the buildings all around were destroyed.
I went to work for them  eventually  in terms of my Jewish commitment.
Bu t a proud moment was when the statute came through on the fax in their big things  one of the staff members brought it to me and said \ Here  this is your work.\
And to convince them to slow down  don't work  don't get .
Also was a lot of work around the house  also like washing clothes and cooking and all that.
I went to complain to them  say I don't want to go to work at the airport  maybe you can do something to reassign me to work someplace else.
Did she work with your father or was she a homemaker?
So my father was called up to go to work and he didn't want to go.
Money I dont have  protection I dont have  I have to work hard.
If somebody was not capable of carrying the work  they were useless to the Germans.
So they went to work first  and  then we went to work.
And I started the -- the -- the system  and I came to the conclusion that it will not work.
Walter  Walter Verhane -- see  in Holland  that -- the -- the young man  who between 16  and whatever  older  26 or so   were sent to the camps -- not the camps  to the -- they had to go work camps  yes  work camps.
The Jews were located like in a--I would say  a ghetto.
I begin to work  you know  in this time it's after...it's called...it was a war.
But I work only six months in accounting  because the boss came to me  he says  listen  youre too smart to work in accounting  go to statistics.
After this   Hitler starts sending Jewish people wh at been born in Poland and went to 3 Germany for jobs -- this is before the war  everything -- and there was many  many Jewish people that come to Germany to work.
So he sent him to a factory  which was a textile factory.
If you were surrounded by German SS  you had a fairly good chance to get back to work -- back to the camp in the evening.
You are driven because you are driven because actua lly  because you are driven physically by whoever supervisors the work because you have to make sure that everything is done on time.
In 1943  one of my brothers was involved in very important war work.
If you  if  if I could go out to work now in a potato commando and bring home some  and bring back to the barracks potatoes  I used to share.
But the ya -- the whole life that the memory is work ing for me til now  thank God  that I-I think it has a positive make-up -- po-positive feeling fo-for me  and positive way for my life.
And I  well because of my work on the Jewish Transcript  San Francisco took  came to Seattle and fetched me and made me come to work in San Francisco.
He went to Australia  and I stayed there  again [indecipherable] a job  but I was looking to work at my cousins there.
He is now truly retired  although not entirely true because of the work he does for the museum.
Did some work but it was not already as extensive as it was in Auschwitz.
There were guys...people that just could no longer work  the older people that could no longer absorb that punishment...they just laid down.
A-And what were you do -- what kind of work were you doing?
We were actually all set to go on the trains to what the Germans euphemistically called work relief  in Germany.
Oh yeah  I got yeah  I work for this company  you know  the Schalhor.
We all though t that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come back.. But the whole thing was to trick us in  to trick us in.
Dont forget  she was with her husband through the time  so there was two people de ciding  and they couldnt keep the three boys together if they wanted to go to work.
They want to take him in in in the crematory and work and and I told them when that happened  he should he should say the same words and he went  you know  and it just happened a day or two later  he were in a different group  but this guy used to go around groups to group  just to do this thing to beat up people.
And she work for the mu -- superior  the Sister Superior which was in charge  and it was Sister Budnofska  Tekla Budnofska.
And they took us as work battalions -- military work battalions  and treated just like the -- these con -- co -- con -- convicts  see?
If you talk right away they see you and uh you get you get hit  so uh we we just have to uh work.
Was your mothers family how did how did your grandfather support your his family  on your mothers side?
Most of the time I fell asleep  because I had to get up 5:00 in the morning and work.
And not everybody could out of the ghetto to work places.
So that was all fine while it lasted and it was a big help  but.... It was a rare opportunity because very few  if anyone  had been able to work in a foreign country in Europe during those years.
So  people still continued going to work  even though there was no school.
On the front of the camp was a placard  Arbeit Macht Frei  work will free you.
And I knew from my work on foreign policy  that thats a very time consuming business  and you have to get some grant money to spend time in archives  but wasnt it about time that these things were utilized?
I was assigned in a quarry  a stone quarry  actually  and was very -- pretty hard work  but it -- in the evening  after eight hours  or 10 hours  I dont know exactly either  how many hours we worked  we could go home and sp end with our family at home.
Under what circumstances and when were you taken from the ghetto into a work camp?
I went there and for this  because I was with him  this work released me from going to work on the roads or something and I worked with him for over a year in this ambulatorium.
I was roped in to go to that airfield on my vacation to work there.
But eventually I got the job  you know  the one the one Jewish friend  one of them came back.
And his brother was in the po the post office  he work in the post office after the war.
And I told the men  ﬁDont take it  even if they want to give it to you  say take some off.ﬂ Well  it didnt work  so I -- I came to a concl -- I -- I was very -- it really bothered me  all this food being wasted.
So I -- I want to thank you for the work that you do.
So a guy used to pick me up all the time  take me back to work.
The only time we got we knew we wer we heard the story about working  we thought maybe the Germans will take us for work  and grandfather used to say to us Interview with David Halivni June 13  2014 22that  you will I will help you will work for me.
Our work camp was destroyed and they ferried us up to Oranienburg concentration camp  back to the concentration camp.
So we didn't have anything to do  so what are you going to do with 200 -some Jews and no work?
And I remember my father had to go out to work  but...uh we were surrounded by barbed wire and by soldiers with...with pistols and guns.
So you didnt work or anythi ng there  any [indecipherable] 36 Oh no  in Auschwitz I didnt work at all.
We went there to the people  they're called Sokinote   where they're giving specialty places  you know  office where they're giving fair to work.
I think he made some contacts in Chile and I think some work was done along those lines  hoping to get to Chile.
02:33:01 28 And I recognize a woman and she recognized me  50 years later  she was one of the women that work in the union.
And the District Commissioner of the Lake Province of Tanganyika showed up next day to assure everybody that they uh they would continue paying everybody for as long as the war lasted  if necessary  but urging us to see if we couldn't find some work.
So also the Russians  they didnt and they couldnt care less.
No  they want me to st ay with them and not work.
So I said -- looked at her  I said  you -- you know  you crazy  because I -- this man never came into me  I [indecipherable] he doesnt know me  cause the othe rs -- officers work -- came in for work  he never came in to work -- for work.
It didn't  you know  and then we go back to work half an hour later.
The Germans gave them the orders  but somebody had to carry it through.
Before we knew it  they had again demanded the group to go to work in Germany  and so everybody scattered around again  having found whatever hiding place they could.
>> Bill Benson: And tell us about that  because it was a terrible stay.
The camp were Gusen and from Gusen I understand in Gusen the...there we went those to to work in bomb holes but they bombed already  and uh they took...one time I were located...they took me  you know  working for a farmer and uh I was working with...they took thirty people.
Oh yeah  they were f -- they were fair to me  because -- because they -- they appreciate my work.
I picked myself up and I came into work one day to the kitchen.
First we had to transport in the beginning this was a work force to repair the tanks and we have to move these things and the equipment and  of course  they took the young men to move these things.
Then they tell us that we have to go to work.
Do you think that the people you were workin g with to get out of th ese work permits  do you think they were operating independently or that they had had some help and instruction from another organization?
And when we opened the gate  one gate it had where the Gestapo came into in and out bringing out the people and one gate is to the side where you went to work.
It was a very  very sprawling farmhouse  and -- and th e domestics that we had all went to do war work  so they -- there we were in the country  my mother was an invalid  so I was looking after the house.
So this is the only thing  my husband took the work and the only thing what I said to him  I said  \ how many times we have to get through everything  to start from the beginning\ .
There were 2 000 of them in Regensburg  not under UNRRA auspices  which means they needed everything in the world and we had to work there.
Did -- you had a Jewish government in place a nd you had Jewish police in the ghetto.
All this people that were taken out every day to work  were they really being taken out to work?
So then you know its  the Germans were awful but then the people who came back out of the concentration camps  many of them when they went back to Poland  the Poles killed them .
Did you have to work in the tunnels  or were you given a different job?
We put a big closet  you know  and cover part of the wall and [indecipherable] because she couldnt work.
My understanding is that the family was opposed to the marriage and they sent her off on a grand tour  and the few pieces of -- of her work that we have is mostly ‚25 - ‚26 - ‚27  Vienna  Italy  France.
The time flies back in a hurry because it's when you work for a certain company you continue  you need to expand your experience and I worked for General Instrument since 1952 until 1960 I think and at that time I recall that I got a call from a friend of mine who joined the Ford company in Philadelphia and he told me that there is an opening for a project at the Ford William Loew 32 Company to do some design work and I felt that this would be an opportunity for me to join that company plus gaining some more experience in electronics.
He knew everybody  uh old prisoner  and he knew most of the old-timers who work in various positions around the camp  where they could uh  uh come up with uh  with the ite ms that the SS would like.
he laughs) Then for some reason my father knew a man before the War he did him a big favor  he was one the head for the work agency  you know?
There was really not much else  a little work and a little study.
And he said  ﬁThis time well want you to work in Berlin.ﬂ And I went to work in January ‚46  in Berlin and I stayed in Berlin  I think  working in Feldifing.
On and off they would come again and take away so many hundreds of people - whoever couldn't work  whoever was elderly  whoever was sick - never to be seen again.
Occasionally  the accountant when we walked to work a Yiddish POW contingent I see.
This is tape number three  side A. And we were talking about your work as a volunteer at the museum and -- and why you do it and the lessons that have been learned.
How ca n you feel  lets say January  February  you know  youre co -- you work 10 hours  wintertime I was working 10 hours in a quarry.
He was staying in the barrack  did not have to go to work.
My mother used to say  ﬁIts much easier to work with your brain  than to work with your back ﬂ which I couldnt see at the time.
Did you -- did you do social work in Greece at all?
And that -- I don't know what -- what to do with this bridge work  but finally  I did the following thing.
It was a ghetto set up especially for -- Yes  it was a ghetto  just exactly for the German Jews and the European Jews.
I mean  you -- you understand th at  because he has -- he has work.
I div -- I start to work with him in the [indecipherable] room  yeah.
And I think Julius Chambers we nt to Charlotte  I think we had some very serious discussions about civil rights work.
Yes  we did work but I don't  I remember that after th at  after Auschwitz  I no longer worked on the outside commando.
Like I said  a 1 000 women were picked out for this work detail.
You stood for roll call  and then you went to work?
But you see  the reason I dont remember exactly  because even when I stepped down  I was doing just as much work  cause That can happen.
And was your house in the ghetto at the time or did you have to move?
But Alfons would tell me  many days  if somebody tried to escape or work coming back from their work  outside the barracks  they all had to line up there  and they had to stand there until they caught this guy  and then  no matter what the weather was  if it was snowing or raining  or whatever it was  or heat or whatever  they had to stand out there in the street until they found them.
Because I don't know if you know  a vineyard is taking a lot of work to...to maintain it  to keep it.
If you don't have this  you get beaten very uh very strong and this was P for marked for Polish and I was one of the two million Polish citizens that was taken by force to Germany to forced labor camp and uh was all over in Germany  our people was stay over there work.
How was she involved in the rescue of Jews  or how was she involved in Ona −imaits work?
UNRA was the official relief organization and we were -- whatever we -- we were called  we supplemented the work of UNRA.
Some were sent to concentration camps  some to work on the farms and factories in Germany.
And I was supposed to go a German island at that time to very dear friends  who were Jewish  and uh  it didn't work.
Uh I must say from Lauerhutte we also were sent to work in combination.
Even that was too much because the capacity  the work capacity was was nil and so he proved to the c ourt that certainly should not be kept responsible.
Commando  which was handling uh all the processing or receiving of those to go to work had to take apart the clothes to see that there's no valuables in it  and uh  some people were even kept for it  they are told that they should have their bowel movements because they  they must have found before and the people have swallowed some valuables  some rings or they told a story that there came one group  I think they were Dutch people  and they had gold  very thin dollars because dollars was almighty  but and uh they swallowed it.
But it showed after them that afte r 2 years of that kind of work that I was better off than the others because they got more bread  but they died too from the hard work  and I somehow survived.
As I mentioned although officially Marcel and Ania are retired they do considerable work as volunteers with this museum.
On trucks they took us to work from building to building to pick up the stuff.
And I said ok thats fine with me and I stayed there two years and I did some more work.
And on this way going back to -- to this camp in Zazel  where we were once marching back from work to -- to the camp  we saw houses  lit  with people living their normal life.
Dad was quickly warned at work I do not know by whom.
And because they wanted Dr. Atlas to continue with the work  we prospered with it.
The punishment was that I was put to work outdoors  and that was already uh fall  but the weather was very bad  uh  working outdoors in the rain and the cold  but it was good for me because I was able to cook outdoors  and I was able to take food for my lady  hot food  you know even if it was only water  but it was hot  so my punishment turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
She was a rabid...uh...she wasn't exactly anti-Semitic  but she just loved Marshall Petain  and she just ...uh...and she just didn't like to have three strangers suddenly descending on her and she was worrying about all the extra work that was going to be and so on.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 28 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: dear friend was in that work group.
And I went to   to work in one of the factories  again a cousin  where they taught me how to work a sewing machine and so I was making some money there and then I finally met a young man  an American born college graduate and he somehow talk ed me into going back to school  because my family wanted me to and I still saw school anti-Semitic in everything the way it was back in Europe  so I didn't want to go back.
I ate it up at once  because I had a bad experience with my men that slept with me  because I was a terrific worker  I always told to my you always a group  that we slept on the same platform try to avoid to get beaten up ﬁDo as much as you can.ﬂ So  we work to please the contractor.
And above all  there was the work of organizing assistance  and thats what we focused on  immediate assistance  because streets were blocked by the German tank  few da ys  and they were looking for young people  for young men  ital -- and for Jewish people  and our job was to work with hundreds of other ch -- young children  women  men  to be the mobile te lephone  human telephone from block to block  and the German are blocking the Immocatcho  they [indecipherable]  the German are blocking such and such a street.
You know  if somebody couldn't work or was sick  you know  we  we all tried to  to help the other person  to pull them through.
01:57:20 02:00:04 Tape 2 Q. Why don't you -- let's just describe a typical day of work.
Well  one...uh  we were uh  pulled out of that duty for uh  two weeks  a week or two weeks work in guarding a uh  large military prisoner of war camp.
It was hard  going directly from work to school every evening from 6:15 to 10:15  followed by a long trip home by bus and subway.
And -- and a lot of people who came  who werent that much older  maybe 10 years older  they already had to go to work and they already had to struggle  they could never go back to school  you see?
I decided I go to the military warehouse and apply to be a tailor there.
And that was to me very moving  you know  this one dollar was the best reward I got for 25 years of work [indecipherable] Did you go back to your old neighborhood  or your old home?
14 Everybody has to work and I had to go to the field again.
And to await the decency I knew that it would not happen  so I got up with an early start and showed up for work.
And then another work that I was doing was  to this day I have no idea what it actually was  somebody said this was something in connection with ammunition  and it was a  we were led into a room with long tables.
She told us  look  two things  either you follow me wherever he sends me or you say you want to work  you want to be in the working camp.
and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived  the Poles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans.
106*0143 24 That is correct  he was  right from work taken away.
And instead  for -- from the -- from six and then one  until nine at night  I used to be -- I used to -- I used to be finished by one oclock.
I went back to and resumed the work  but now I felt very strong.
Th-They were supporting -- they were -- you know  oh we had an incident  lets say  and that time Franka was with me  I think she was helping out because we had so much work  so she came to help us out.
I said to myself  this time Im not going to go to work.
That it did not work out so well that that was my private -- You had complications?
They establish a governor who work American governor and the Russian governor altogether  and they establish peace and harmony  whatever it is.
He remained in Auschwitz for about six months and then went on to another concentration camp in Austria called Mauthausen  a real hell hole of a camp.
And he came to visit us because my mother and we used to go on vacation and my father would come and visit us for a few days and go back to work.
I used to travel by myself  because Jake wanted to work.
BZ: Well  two years after I graduated from law sc hool  I went to work in the General Counsel's Office of the United States Treasury and th e General Counsel  th en Randolf Poll  assigned me to a fairly new bureau called Foreign Funds Co ntrol.
And you had to have sponsors to make sure that you'd be able to work and support yourself when you came here.
Eventually they forced my father to close his store and go and work for the government.
Wh en the water was brought in  we used our s - the sanitation was basically almost like before  but the fact was that it was a little harder to obtain it  you know  to -- to work at it  cause water had to be brought in  and -- and they had outies on -- in the backyard and what ever it is.
Oh yeah  and I also had to work in a garden.
And piece work allowed me to make more than one pound.
And then I heard the murmur  the talk among those that this another one of those round-ups for Polish workers that the Germans periodically would grab to send them to their factor ies  wherever it was  whether its in Poland or Germany or any place  to work in their factories because they were short of manpower  because everybody was in the -- on the -- you know  in the army  the German army.
He was under the Russians also  and he tried to get some government approved work  but they didnt get around to it.
Incidentally  my brother-in-law and I were both in the same unit  until we were separated and I went into all this other work and he stayed with the 95th Infantry Division.
Do you have any favorite memories of your father  of your childhood growing up  seeing him work  seeing your parents home and so on?
They would go from barrack to barrack  from camp to camp  to pick up the people that died at work  and those who died over night.
And their horses were my father was taking care of the horses in the as blacksmith to put them shoe the horses.
No more staff  no  but a woman Fenya  this woman who didnt sleep-in but always come in to work.
J. Because the -- I thought that they -- it was taken to the Arbeitsant  which is a work office -- Right. --
Of course  my mother also helped some problem some work  not for for herself.
I went out to work as a carpenter and being over there  who took me in?
Did found the Frenchman who had done a great deal of work on the same thing  and exchanged documents with him  and this was basically how it worked.
In the morning we would be escort ed out of the ghetto to the place of work.
What sort of work did y -- did you do before you started working with your father?
And t he AMF guy says how would you like to work for the AMF?
If he didn't like somebody or maybe didn't work fast enough  he would hit them over the head.
So when you wanted to have work done fast  as it happened that I was detained for one day being over there  so I decided at this time not to lose any more time.
So anyway...uh...2 days later  we heard that they're taking out 12...they're going to select 12 strong girls to..uh...the strongest one....uh...to work  you know  make those...uh...dig those graves where the soldiers hide.
You know  after a while  after that escape  after I have been liberated and...and uh some times  very often when I when I work at night in my studio  in my home  I sometimes remember...it comes to my mind all those things  and I laugh about it.
Well  I started immediately to work on his visa  and discovered he had a brother in Sweden.
During the time that– no  I went to the first grade  but after when we moved into the ghetto  nobody  I mean there was no work in the ghetto.
After you finish high school  you have diploma  you must work -- you must go to army for free  not for pay  for free for two years.
Tire and Rubber .. Department  and it was so that every day at six o'clock we went to make a little sport 15 minutes  then take a breakfast  went to the factory  working until two o'clock  take ahlunch  and at five o'clock it was finished with the work  and at six o'clock we went to school  every day up till ten o'clock at evening.
Im telling you  white short white gloves up to here  with a little stick in his hand and he turned t-to to look of how th-the th-the people looked  if they are able to work  or to go to the ch gas chamber.
But staying with that couple turned out to be a big disappointment  being that I had little in common with them and they must have realized themselves  that they cannot make of me a -- a future for that -- i-it wouldnt work unless I went for some schooling.
04:28:00 They say that after what the work I did in  in the camp  that I'm going to get TB and I would have to go to Switzerland to a sanitorium.
Originally he had trained to be a baker  to work in a bakery.
They were bringing people who were already weak  and they could not really work to the standards.
Well  you know  originally I re ally wanted to do social work.
And this was when I the first time when when Dora came home from work  the same day  she passed without looking  she passed into her room.
But you didnt have to work if you didnt want to.
So this was– when we first came to Auschwitz  we didnt have that.
We got to have also until September`15 a bridge made  and then they went to -- we went to work.
When -- when he lost the job  there was no context in which she could found -- find work.
But also realize that a lot of the work in education is very temporary  and that you dont I mean  every day is not a major day.
th-the building -- Yeah  when it was -- -- wa -- wa -- you did not work with them preceding the building? --
And we were approaching Camp Birkenau  they preferred it be called Auschwitz  and it had the famous inscription  which still I believed  until I got in  \ Arbeit Macht Frei\  which means \ Work Makes You Free.\
I am sure that the Germans took all the people to work.
Did the Germans come into the ghetto much  or was it run by itself?
Now some other people  they looked healthier...they were taken to another line...sort of to work.
And he said  ﬁGood for you.ﬂ Because my father went with horses to the forefront  where the Polish soldiers were dug in  he was doing some field work.
And you didn't feel that the Germans made it a little bit easier?
So they found me a job in a hospital where they used to bring the German soldiers  the injured soldiers.
She figured out  and she didnt work in the chicken house.
Went out to the Buna work -- we start exactly the same thing to build it.
So my brothers  I knew they work over there and I wanted to go see them one time.
Soon as I got out of the hospital they again want to put me in that -- so -- in that un it  and I said sorry  but I am s-still quite sick and I c -- Im not yet ready to work.
This was kind if a transition from the agricultural work into the Luftwaffe camp and this was a forced labor column.
It was so terrible work  you know  with this -- I -- I felt that I wouldnt last long really  at this work  its so hard.
They couldnt work  they were essentially charity cases for the for their families.
They told us of many of the people who had been persecuted who we re Jews  who and there was a lot of persecution  there were people who lost their jobs because they couldnt couldnt work any longer.
So for road work  for some other ple would be stealing food so they tried to separate food from people.
We stayed th ere for a few weeks until Bernard was able to find work already as a Pole.
I came home from work and I got the order so I went there to the house.
And we said between us  as long we could work  maybe they gonna keep us alive.
As I say  I dont speak to anybody at the museum except the people that I work with.
So in your two years plus in Auschwitz  basi cally you had this job and you had that outside work?
And this costs this time  80 zloty  and fellow who work in the bank  like [indecipherable] or fellow who work in the post office  take only 200 dollars mon -- monthly.
My mother was still talking about maybe she should get up to go to work  she didn't know.
And she came in to that woman  and told her that she was looking for work  and if they could use her.
We were kept under information of the -- everything voozes -- voo -- who -- who were sending out  townswas people  that going to the cities to work  the German need people to work  and they cant afford to  and we dont have the work here  but they have the work in Germany  and so -- but nobody knew -- I wouldnt say nobody  I didnt  maybe some people guessed more than they knew.
And thats when I started my volunteer work and I went to work -- I look ed after her and I went to work at the Canadian Legion Services club on Princess Street  which is the main street in Edinburgh.
He was the only one in the family who actually got a permit to stay in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0077 23Greece  and to work in Greece.
And in 3rd Army...there was a 12th Army Corps group headquarters  in Wiesbaden I think  they wa nted me to come and work with them  I remember that; I got a letter from the General as king me if I wanted to be transferred to his headquarters -- it may have been Colonel Denson 9 who dealt with that  and I said  \ Listen: I don't want to do his work any more than I want to do yours  I want to get out of the Army  that's all I want.
This is the building company that they send us to work.
But since I came and h e knew that I didnt try to shirk work because the kapo was with me  he gave me a couple of days of what was referred to in German as schonung  meaning rest  at the sick bay  which was barrack no.
This is tape number three  side A. And I had been asking you about your work at the Holocaust Museum and you told me that you do some public speaking.
And validating someone  myself or my work  wh ich I had completely devaluated  because of my lack of memory  that maybe thats what has enabled me to give all these talks.
I went back and I refused to work  but I still have my little room.
And they had to clean up the street and -- 118 and work with old people or something.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 They were doing the work  killing people every day  every day  smelled that stink of burning flesh.
As typical as always they uh uh put in  they never did their own dirty work.
The people who were actually in good standing without any conviction  who were not convicted and people who were able to work were eligible to enter the United States.
And you get your own things th at you have to live through and work through  but I didnt have the hardship that they had.
>> Bill Benson: And they came there and obviously lots of other kids.
Those that worked  those that were able to work were taken to work details.
Okay  Paula  you do this Paula  that  and and I had to work in the chicken house before school.
And I was turning back to my work  the secretary came back in  and I thought maybe that it's all over.
A Block Elster had a little more privileges than the others  she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsibl e. And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of ti me or how many miles because I had no way of measuring  but I know we worked snow  winter  sunshine  it didn't matter.
So instead of sending my mother to work  work means to dig the graves for other people  I went.
And then he told me everything about the work  becau se I knew only my little part  and I didnt want to know more  because I thought  if you are arrested  and they start torturing you  you cant say Ill keep my mouth shut  you cant say that.
And so that -- that weighed heavily with my father  that Auschwitz was in Poland and others  may -- five  six major death camps.
So went back and they had this  the SS went back to the work -- to the place where they worked  and tried to find -- to find out how come they dont know -- they didnt know that they escaped.
And once we'll get here  we'll work and we'll give him back the money.
Therefore  for the time being  the ghetto was not erected as yet  that was not talked about as yet  but they always must report every morning to their assigned places for the assigned work there.
Probably I did  I dont know  we got a meal in Kabelwerk  the interesting thing was that the first time  I always ate kosher and when I started working in Kabelwerk  they served us meals and it was the same meal the Gentile work ers got  so that wasnt that bad because it had a lot of vegetables in there  I dont remember about meat now  maybe it did.
At one time they took us to like work in the fields.
And  and I see  I see how we the deterioration which starts with the economics and then it goes in to the mentality of people and the crime  it's all part of this  this  this ultra-liberalism and I cannot stomach this  I can't handle  I think it's wrong  you need to be more conservative  the liberalism is not goi ng to  is not going to work the way this is designed for this country.
I mean  we had to work  so we made whatever we could.
Well  I tell you  my older daughter graduate d in social work.
Because what they are going to do with children  you are going to send them to work cam p. And she managed to arrange that  and -- and that was when we met this Father Caesar  he al so escape from Warsaw and he supposed to go to the man monastery  which was somewhere else  but she changed his direction and he went with us to Kostovitz.
But it is really  truly a great piece of work  so I was very pleased when we were invited.
It was really camouflaged as work rooms  but by the time we reached this number of people  there was not enough room to sleep on the floor  so they build these multiple actually three story Bunks?
The only thing that I was afraid of in - unless other women experienced it in Auschwitz - that if you were sick and had to stay behind on the bunk  and you couldnt go to the outside  to work  like in the marshes like we did  that they woul d come and drag you out and they would do with you what they wanted to do with you  whatever that meant  but I guess that meant probably more of being killed than– Yes  but you see after the Auschwitz detail left  and barrack had to be emptied  they went thr ough the barracks to see if anyone was hiding because sick people who couldnt make it to the roll call– So if they found you  they took you whenever they took you  but that was never  ever an issue  not with me.
My mother finished commercial school  and at age 16  17 she had to go to work because both of her older and younger brothers had to be given money to continue their studies.
The Jews are still going to work in the Third Reich and maybe they are not going to kill the people in the Jews in the Third Reich.
In the summers I used to work [indecipherable] I was playing with the idea of going back.
One would be the first time when we came from work  when I saw the Judenrat  the 12 hanging at the entrance to the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: He moved on from you at that particular time?
He told me if I work for him for two years I can take over his practice.
So he came up  he left Albert  he came up and I give him work.
That that you start first yo ure you you work  as well as going to school  at that newspaper.
My mother had a brother that was in New York already  and he got us a room for three dollars a week  and we went to work the day we got there.
The man  and I know a little bit about pharmacological work because my husband was a pharmacist  I use to help him  he is delighted to see me  he says.
My father only got permi ssion to move to Berlin under the regulation that he would not work in Be rlin.
Gideon and his son who also volunteers his time and expertise here at the museum are currently collaborating on several computer projects concerning how to restore degraded images.
I dont have that Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 18 Okay.
But goes on and on  but I wanta just tell you  it tells...uh...it tells us that in Dinnerworker  were an island surrounded by waters and forests and there are Jews from all the world that work very hard and are constantly freezing in the cold weather.
But you know  as young as I was  you know  I -- I realized  you know  you dont take people to work that are disabled people  old people  women a nd children.
But of course they also tried to convince us again of the advantages of communist system  whic h didnt work with us at all.
Tell me about -- oh  between the time that the girls were first taken in November and questioned and then they were rel eased  when they were released  did they also go back to work?
Did you know some of the peop le who went on work details?
And certain places  you know  you work so  sometimes  you got an extra piece of  you know -- there were some Germans that werent too bad.
And she got ma rried here and she she work for a company where they take care for the actors.
I'm a tailor you know I work in the day and somebody's not  I make the production for him  for the man to be alive.
But that time  I mean  you were young  you -- this was part of your job.
He also wanted to go to school if possible  a nd I was supposed to go to work.
And I think we see in my work here in the office  we do a lot of work  we represent parents of kids who have special needs and the schools tend to  they dont want to bother with them so often  unless you have a very committed teacher  whos going to work with students like that.
And the program  the Western Kentucky program had the grant a few of years ago and they just could not really find the workers and we were  by getting together with the people in Texas  the paralegal from Texas came up and who helped– who helped to do this project  did the outreach work.
Then they made a brigade to go to air...air...airport for small children or for small child ren to go to work in fields.
They were sufficiently well off for my mother to have one or two household helps  because in those days you didnt have dishwashers  and you couldnt go to the gr-grocery store a nd get prepared food  so it was a lot more work to feed four children and a husband.
Were men and women essentially doing the same type of work in the camp?
So you couldnt  even if you found a job where to work  it wouldnt help you because the British were very loyal and they didnt want you to be in trouble.
Backpack and how wonderful the blankets  and my grandfather saying  \ Do you think you're going to go to Poland to work?
He used to work in Los Angeles in a French restaurant.
Or they had a day care center for children  and the towns had to go to work  and they had the children and dropped them off and they never could go outside.
Ho-How did that make you fe -- uniform s for the Germans?
How we used to walk to work and we used to recite this poem because there is so much truth and so much pain and so much injustice asking  \ How come this injustice was done to us.\
So  I told him that Im going to work there  and that was okay.
And -- Did you see your parents again  or did they come to America ever?
This job is much easier than to go and work in a factory  a metal fabrication factory.ﬂ I was th ere with him probably two months.
Only thing I saw this: I saw at that time  one night they took us to work there  and they had bundles of clothes to put in the same trains that took the people; they put in all the clothes there.
And how  how do you suggest we might work toward that?
I -- I -- I -- it was more entertainment that work  this school.
The Germans naturally give the order they shall take the Jews for work.
There are parts of this that will work and I'm going to have her read it afterwards as a safety. (
We jolly well could pick up our own Jews  the SS didnt have to do that dirty work any mo re.
And so I'd registered with all the students for mandatory work in France.
Were going away next -- in a few weeks  Ill -- but we -- I have a fax and I have a telephone  I have a e-mail now  so we -- I can do the work from there.
Well  anyway so we came to the place where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work.
So Pop had a hard time finding work and  in addition he got sick.
My mother did not work  because in those years  and according to our -- our way of life  a mother should not be working.
And there he sent there Yi dden to work on the ground  to work on the ground.
People who stay in places who dont have to work  they dont want to work.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 15 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: good thing because a big hunk of uh the population were occupied with that.
And this was going on until we cleared the outside mine  made floors  made a factory  and then -- and put in machinery  so they started to work  for this daily  daily hard work.
And there were other people working there but we found out later on were Dutch people and French people  not they werent -- they were in work camps.
I was 16 years old  and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work.
He was the brain o-o-of us because it came a mo ment that we didnt have any more money and my mother was delegated to tell him that we dont have any more money and Socha said  oh  if you dont have n-no more money  then we cannot work any more.
Then my brother told me to try to tell those people who used to work in the factory that we will pay them 2  3 times as much [as] whatever is allowed by the law.
Because they were going to take them for work in Germany.
Uh so the fear was there  very much so and tried to stay out of sight as much as I could in the workshop and--and--you know try and keep up with whatever work they gave me.
So the next day she decided shes not going to work.
There was a lot of interesting work to be done and useful and perhaps important work to do on behalf of low-income clients.
Mama comes to work for my ministry  Ill he -- make her a head of administrative si -- admini strative de-department  and Ill keep Mamas dossier under key.
Tell us a little bit more about who was there in this concentration camp  where it was a stone quarry  where you had to work very hard cutting stones.
So you could go out only accompanied by a work detail.
So he told me that from here's information that now they will finish us all off  and he would advise me not to go back to go back with the column of slave workers  back to the ghetto...only after work  he will arrange that I will be able to stay in the office on the railroad and the next day after work will dispose of my and to go to with him to .
People often ask me why did I want to go to the camps  wh -- was it some voyeuris tic reason  was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors.
We ended up in some of the worst neighborhoods of -- of -- of Brooklyn before we finally found a place  but -- and my mother had to look for work.
The two women who gave her work to do on the side  and after she came home from labor  and in exchange  they would give her food here and there.
>> Bill Benson: Of course  you were the man of the family.
In one of them you had to -- you could go there if you agreed to work as a lumberjack for two years.
And  sometimes they wouldn't get to these people for days  because it was -- there were so many of them  and there was a lot of work to be done.
And then when the war was coming to a close  the Germans decided to evacuate the camp.
And we told him the story  it's not going to work.
I want to make -- to work towards a doctor degree.
So you gotta send out here -- do something  you know  he was really pushing us to -- to some point that you couldn't say no  was -- so he says  you gotta send out people to get arms  or to do some sabotage work.
Anyway  originally we went to work the same place in this mill.
Go to work   go to work  but I want -- I wanted to study.
You  we used to work 14  16  18 hours a day  I mean  into the night  just the men took care of the helping to unload  the people empty of the belongings  and then you had to pack u p  and they had to ship it to Germany.
My son David  and Beth  they work for the state -- for the -- the Def-Defense Department  the pentagon.
And so now UNRRA was designated to work as the agency of the occupation forces in Germany  Italy  Austria  running these camps.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 33 By that time I had done a lot of things.
Only his mothers oldest sister knew  who wa s into underground work herself  and her youngest brother knew.
A lot of work -- he was in the building area  the building business  and he build up th-the Negev  the desert  all the way to the Dead Sea  kibbutzim and so on.
He says  ﬁYoull never work under the name of Joe Friedman.ﬂ Well  I wanted to keep the same initials.
If we don't work  they're going to take us to the gas chamber.ﬂ So anytime there was work for volunteers  we volunteered.
Im also in a great profession  that I can go into seminars -- Im a social work er  I have a Masters degree  and  you know  go into seminars and talking about different issues  it was great -- great for me  because I could s -- find out  and work on things that were concerning me in many ways.
I understand a little bit about wh-what happened with your father in terms of work.
And in the morning when they would come back from work  we would give them the bed and they would go to sleep.
But that time  I mean  you were young  you -- this was part of your job.
And once we were in there  we had to assemble outside  the commandant talked to us: You are here not to party  but to work.
>> Bill Benson: You had been gone for two years already.
Besides you had to wait...it was not so much the hard work and the lack of food  but you might have to wait two years  three years  before you get a certificate  you know  to go to...it was then Palestine.
Eve ry able -bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to 60  had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the Jewish community  and later on the ghetto community government  administered.
Well  that was -- I missed holidays like with my family  and -- but other hand  we work late  we always together  with Julian  our children  and we had friends  a lot of fri ends.
How many months did you work with the War Crimes Commission?
I was beginning to work and I was working until begin the war  1941.
My father at that particular time was afraid continuing with the work that he was doing over there  so we decided we are 13 going to go to the forest; which  this going to the forest would build up the future later  serving as a base  that I knew the roots of how to escape from the ghetto  although we didn't do it with that in mind  but it turned out to be  yesterday's bad things turned out tomorrow's safety and so on.
And I dont know where he died but I know that he lived through I guess work camps  concentration camps  til the end.
Of course  it doesnt always work that way with our kids.
No  you did not work when you got stuck there and you couldn't leave the coal mine because you had 1500 feet to go up by elevator.
All right  now well go back to where we were  which was going on the train to Auschwitz   but you dont know that youre going to Auschwitz.
And we were there for six weeks  but my father had to work from four oclock in the morning til eight oclock at midnight at night  and many milking and doing all Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21  2015 75farm work.
They dont want to work  and I suggest you execute them.ﬂ Of course  we never delivered the letter.
It wasnt easy and there were different work in the factory.
So he said  why dont you come work for me over there  New Jersey ?
>> Nat Shaffir: First of all  number one  they forced us to sometimes to do some manual work in cleaning stables.
I am going to take you and you are going to work hard.\
So I worked there  we open up the cleaning store  my husband was in the cleaning store  and that s the work  I came to work in the store  and I worked til 12 at night to keep up the thing.
And I went to work for him five days a week  from town to town by train in Holland.
Just be good girl.ﬂ We didnt have food  but the German didnt bother then so much  so my mom went -- she le ft us alone with some other older people to watch  and she went to work.
So I approached somebody in charge of work deta il  of the -- the -- one of the women of Ravensbruck  an German political prisoner  to help me to stay indoors  and if she could  arrange something.
And occasionally I would go Istanbul was another Interview with Charles Stein June 8  1999 63one  and occasionally I would go to to Bucharest and to Moscow   because to talk to work with our own people  the embassy people  to find out what the governments are up to and how they are handling because they were handling some of the guarantees to the local govern ment that they would be going to the United States and once they got out we tried to get them to to Israel.
What was it like to work for an organization that printed German army magazines?
And then he was given a choice wh ether he could fight with the pa rtisans  he could work for the partisans  or they would allow hi m to go into an area that was al ready liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over  they said.
It was in '44 I think the Hungarians Jews come and it was a couple thousand and then all the kapos  all the they were chasing them to work from four to eleven at night and they were not allowed to see doctors or anything.
There was a balcony off from it  and beh -- and then came the childrens room  so-called  where my sister and I slept  and I had my desk and work [indecipherable].
Well  at that point of course  we had near where we were  we had Ebensee   the camp.
So I went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh machine factory and uh then this uh possibility came about.
In Poland where the where the Germans were from the beginning  they put people to concentration camps  to arbeits lagers but where the Russians were  they abused older Jews  all the Jews were ninety percent under Communist  they are Jews of the old Communists  and they they very rarely took them to camps or to work  but they were mass murdered.
My father told me  ﬁYou better go and be with the group.ﬂ Since I was new in that c ity  they ask me what kind of work I could do.
And they guaranteed that the people who did the work of cleaning up the forest will return  that they will not be shot.
You have to know where not to go  where not to stand  the same thi ng when we used to go to work.
Allis on said yes  she remembers that I used to go off frequently with this former Hungarian Jewish Brigade leader  and that we would work there.
And what was your wh at were you doing in the office?
So they been going around and killing from house to house 3 and looking for the one they didn't have certain papers or they didn't work or they been...or children or sick people and they...uh...came to our house.
Others wanted to work  not really for money but to work for food.
There was a Block Alteste  and there was her assistant  and there was a Shreiberin  who was a secretary kind of  who was counting the people in the morning when they went to work  and counting the people in the evening  and they were all old-timers.
But th-they  th-th-the gas chambers were full  so they --they didn't want to wait hours  so they had a transport to -- to take the next day  you know  for work.
Could you begin by saying when I was working for the SS officer Doppler... Oh  when I was working for the SS Doppler  then I started to work  and I start to work in the kitchen.
But he did go to work  went to work on a bicycle in Cuba.
We heard these talks somewhere along that we will be treated well and work for the war effort and families will be together.
What it meant for you to be involved in that kind of work?
So in the meantime  I I of I just I I was without work maybe maybe  maybe two months.
And when we had Poles as supervisors for our work  they be at us like the SS did.
And on my way to work I was listening to NPR  National Public Radio  and they mentioned that Hans Lipsky elec ted to be deported instead of going to trial.
ﬂ He made a false paper in German  tied me up and everything else  and I'm able to go back to work.
Yes  sure  I was too young to work in the ghetto.
When they got older  they didn't want to stay home anymore and work for my father for free so they went to the city to look for a job.
We just sold it  because my husband had open-heart surgery and a stroke and he still work in the same deli.
Youd work six days a week on the peasants ---  on the farms?
And was struggling first to defend it from inside  and then I saw more and more that this didn't work.
When you're registering people  there are clearly some elderly people and there are kids who probably can't work.
And they would take us every mo rning out of the ghetto  to that place where we spend the whole day  and in the evening they would in the af late afternoon they would bring us back.
And then there is another person  I don't recall his name  who was in Canada and went to work in a nylon factory  for stockings  became very wealthy  and he escaped.
HENNY GURKO: Life called us  and we were all walking happy and sure.
Work for everybody  houses for everybody  food for everybody  and my question was  at what price?
I think -- when we were talking  and you were asking me abou t the recent work that I had done  which I call the trassiteration and translation project with the archives of the -- in the Holocaust Museum  it was -- End of Tape Four  Side A Beginning Tape Four  Side B You dont -- Oh  let me ch -- let me see.
Ive had the friendship of so many wond erful -- I discovered after the war that I was working with all the top people of the Committee of National Libera tion  who  in their turn  were so helpful to our work for Amnesty Internationa l development.
My oldest sister Faige had low fever she went to work every day.
Went marching every morning to work on the main station where the Americans 02:26: would at that time bomb every single day the railroad.
Because he had difficulties to work and get...reached a quota of  uh... We worked first in  uh  for a while in a factory  where they made some  uh  steel wire fences.
So  my mother we nt to work on the farm  on the on the land with my father.
Yeah  and then I stayed there for about -- I stayed there about maybe four to five months.
Usually  they wouldn't let people work there more than a few days.
In fact  I was a conscientious objector during the war and worked on the land when I was called up  and had in the mean time registered with the Quak ers as a volunteer for any work they wanted me to do.
And she did get out of bed  and she we nt back to work in the hospital wher e she had started before she decided that life is not worth an ything.
So then I did some work  my mother was working; so we got by.
When you cut the potatoes out of the ground  you have to pick them up into these baskets and I tell you it was very  very hard  very hard work.
So then they gave him freedom  because I know that he say that he had to work.
But it was a job  I got it through a Jewish organization  as a matter of fact.
And then  in the end they said  ﬁWell  where does she work  we need to speak to her  and its very urgent.ﬂ And he had to [indecipherable] where I worked.
If I had told them I am Jewish  they would never have trusted me with that ty pe of work.
We were taken to Majdanek which was a nothing camp but occasionally we would go to work.
Now  that day  he was ordered - her father was ordered to  to dig a grave  and of course  it was like  they called him to work.
There they lined us up after work  and they beat us.
Now  in--nobody knew whether these people would survive--whether they would actually go for to work or whether they would die and there were a burden on the council was to uh--uh to actually themselves uh be the judges of who should live and who should die.
That kind of the way it work s. You hear about somebody who is somewhere and then you go out there and -- and the amazing th ing was that -- I mean  I was what  22 at that time  23  and you go out and talk to a -- a family  you never see them before in your life  and you say  hey Im here to -- to help you ge t away  and they go to -- go with you.
My mother went to work the next day  found some housekeeping job.
We work ed on it for six  eight months  when she received a Fulbright scholarship to go back to Oxford and study there with Dr. Krebs.
And that was perhaps the second overt sign of antisemitism that I...I felt; the first  of course  being in the Olympic Games itself  and  uh  not being allowed to run there and not being allowed to work out  mind you  at the New York AC.
O.K. The Buna work  there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from different European countries.
I knew from one man who saw him that (End of Side A  Tape 1) Leningrad and just I want for my work  to my work  it was close where the Germans were.
I don't want you to be busy with any social work.
So they came to him actually for more than just the dental work.
And how are you -- h-how do you view Raoul Hillbergs work?
I liked to be outside  doing all the work outside  you know?
I mean there are some things thats so imprinted that my mother went to work for the day for a lady who had a toy store.
Now if you have saved uh some bread from the day before  then you're lucky and you'll eat that uh that piece bread before going to work.
But before...uh we...they determined if we're going to be sent to a work camp or where  we were forced to strip naked in front of a...a doctor or somebody.
No  my fathers work actually  I think he had some work with German firms  I dont know what happened there.
Well  its interesting that you ask that   because its now that Im finding out  through some of the work that I have done for th e -- for the Holocaust Museum  about my parents backgrounds  and very slowly I -- I have found out  that especially in my fathers family  they were very prominent.
My fat her made behind the cabinet a place where when they went to work  all of them  I had to go into that hiding place and stand there.
So  so long they had to run for punishment  and work  till they dropped dead.
The reason as far as I know was that we didn't pe rform at work.
And we saw this and then the  the camp got organized and what happened  how do I got survive  so I would work in a lot of things there  I was hauling water.
And there they make their first experiences  and by that they are working for the establishment of the greater German Reich  and thats not only that negative element  and later on you know everything in that [indecipherable] resettlement in [indecipherable] affairs  and it didnt work  but then something like an overcompensation down there  work very hard and honor -- at least -- at least  to implement the Holocaust  they did it.
So they wanted to make sure that for the next time that this happens that I would be prepared and I would be among those who would be selected to work.
Didn't have any work force where they could get them for nothing.
We 26 worked in this camp  and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed the ghetto and there was not any more work.
All I knew is  you know  that -- that  you know  that I have to work and I have to get an education and thats that.
So the ghetto administration put up a rule that these people who worked ev--on those easy jobs should give one day a week to work at the airport so the people from there could be relieved  you know.
This is tape number two  side B. So we just talked about your daughter.
And so he came out to see me to describe the film he was planning to make on Nuremberg  and he thought that after my Nuremb erg experience  I would be the logical one to write and work with him on the film.
But we did take care of the widows and the orphans of .
They did their work  they organized some camps for the children to be hidden in  they  they were fantastic.
And he ha d been imported by the Argentine government to work as a -- I assume as a consultant or something like that  in the Argentine Air Force.
And so my mother would sl eep in the bed  and I would sleep on the couch  and -- and -- Did she work?
My mother and father were related  they were cousins  second cousins who were assigned to marriage at birth and it didn't work out but thei r subsequent marriages worked out very well and then we all became good friends.
Remember I said I walked out from the appel and go out  they  they choose me to get  to go out a nd they keep me there  because they left in the ghetto 300 people to do work.
His group continued to come every day to uh to the factory  and since I was  my job was to sweep the streets  I managed to sweep the street under the window in which he worked and so we could say hello to each other  and that continued for about four months and uh sometimes in late uh late '42  his group as well as the remnants of the ghetto that the Poles  all those people was the was their was the stamps on their ID cards and including some other groups that was still going to work from the from the ghetto  they were put on a train and shipped on to that farm on the in the east.
Like now I have to do work with the lady whose letter I showed you.
Now  an open ghetto was what that meant is that we were not allowed to leave the area.
This gate was open to let out this working brigade in the morning to go to work and to come back.
When you are a refugee you have to work to survive  you didnt come with anything except the clothes on your back.
One of the policemen  the Polish policeman  we gave him five thou I gave him 5 000 zlotys because he promised that he will let him that he will work.
So this whole scene was made by the doctor in order not to be under suspicion that he is on a high holiday...on a high holiday  Jewish high holiday freeing prisoners not to work.
Although they gave me work basically installing antennas on a roof which was okay at the time  but I couldn't see a future in that and I told them so that I would like to work on a bench repairing television sets  which he did eventually and I was repairing television.
Uh  after this  uh  we  we went every day to work  and the most work what we did was assorting clothes  and Beep. (
In the morning  they came about six o'clock when the people are going to work and they right away they took them to the trucks  so how did you know?
And after the war  right away after the liberation had started to work.
Its true that that that meant more work for the women  but the tradition of that  I guess is so ancient that it it isnt a thing where you had the feeling that theres going to be a feminist movement saying let the women sit and talk  let the men carry the logs.
My mother  because they knew  they had lists of all the Jewish community  and my mother  who as I said was a knitter  and knew very well how to work in that area  they said that she would be the chief knitter for the mayor of the town  who was obviously German.
So one of the lecturer s there  who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin  told me to come to work for him  and then I can work on my thesis there  which is what I did.
Not but then we thought where is the nearest brigade  Jewish brigade work place and we went to and he put a  got safety there.
I go into work  and I get the – work with a guy Š Supervisor – Zosen [sp  ph?]
As he had a house in Munich and he brought them into his house  and that became their headquarters cause they had no place to work.
In the evening -- and by -- incidentally  I earned 50 cents an hour.
It just was a very nice atmosphere in that place and made it easy to work.
At that camp  in the better camp  work was hard  and food was the same  but they didnt beat so much.
He said  Well  these were people who were mostly immigrants  mostly Jews  Poles  and they were put to work at something very hard.
We had to move from there  and we had to go to the ghetto.
The Jews were not allowed to work in the same office where the non -Jews worked  so they built him a little shack in the field  where he kept his things and slept sometimes  instead of going back to the ghetto.
The same kapo for whom I worked earlier returned from the Auschwitz sick bay  where he was confined with typhus  and was given a new work crew to dig foundations and help in the construction of crematoria three and four.
And the the managing manager of this came and met me one morning  and I went around with him and I wa tched him work one morning  what kind of equipment he us ed  you know  and see what you use  and how you do it.
A lady from Washington D.C. by the name o Mrs. Freedman  used to work with her mother.
I used to read German papers and tell her whats going on in the world so when she would go to work she worked for a German firm  she could tell them  and she was well informed.
Now  when -- I wanted to work  I want ed to earn some money.
Faster than we would die working on [Inaudible] >> Bill Benson : Because the work in the ammunition factory was so dangero us.
And he did he couldnt work  he didnt have a work permit.
Well  I I says  I can work with some machines  you know.
They were saying that we were going to work in the commune and we'll be very - very happy.
And I start to work in the hospital in the ghetto; doing very simple  very routine test.
And my daughter ruined her shoes on the boat  I had -- we had to buy shoes  and then the rent  and some food [indecipherable] Joe had the job  a nd I started to work too  in that little town.
But I was I was such a hustler  because like even before the war  when daddy was dead already and there was no food  and mama couldn't support  I was able to go to work at the plant; sit a presser all day  and by the end of the day  we receive one one you received one zloty  and one zloty brought one bread and a smoked fish.
So when I finish my work  and everything already finished  they didnt bother you  as long you finished at the coal br igade .
My mother was part of this underground movement and during the day quite often when she was at work  my house looked normal.
You describe for me the time for you and your family in Czechoslovakia  before World War II and the Holocaust  as a time of hard work but also a good life  one in which there was a sense of safety.
So against my father's best wish es  I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and spent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture.
And this fellow  one of the fellows with the uniform  the stick I mentioned -- I found out later he was called a Kapo and he was doing the work  what the Germans asked him to do  to get people moving.
And I used to go to school at night  night school they had them years.
As a result we always got...I got always the worse work.
And who did you work thro ugh to get the papers?
And I noticed it wasn't special  to do case work with the Russian immigrants.
Tell me about the Polish welder who sabotaged the German work.
In my own work in the British records  it is very clear that in 1940  thi by this time  the Duke of Windsor   because of course  he had abdicated before  and George the sixth was king  and his wife  the Duchess of Windsor were  if not very strongly pro-German  inclined in that direction.
So -- and I had one of them  when we were marching to work  he passed by me and gave me some dry bread  put it in my pocket.
>> Bill Benson: And you were able to go and place that.
And a guy from that installation approached us and said  ﬁWhere are you going?ﬂ Now  we had a name  so thats where we are going and he says  ﬁWhy you going there?ﬂ And we says  ﬁWell  we have our place there  we used to work there and we going back to our position.ﬂ And he says  ﬁWell  I have a problem.
When we moved we were again with different people and ag ain there wasnt enough room to sleep us all on the floor so we had to build like bunks so there were three in a row stacked up.
I came on a Wednesday  and on a Thursday  I already had a job.
Of course  this was how we divided the work  that Raoul Wallenberg  he we nt and saw everyone.
And in order to get a little bit more food -- and of course  my father had to pay some money -- that I should work with my father in the bauleitung  the building.
From there I started to work  to make living  to help our parents.
Whether there  you went to work  you came back  Nesse Godin 77 December 14  1995 Page 77 you went to sleep  next day you could be dead.
Even there  there was so that because our work we were living  we were working in the same cell.
Even if they were just laborers  they still went to work in the morning and they still provided fo r their families.
And we found  you know  that if they needed to work  they worked  if they could come  they could come and I kept -- and I had a flat salary and it was really very nice doing it.
I had one officer assigned to me who was specially doing human rights work.
>> [Laughter] >> Bill Benson: You knew you were about to leave.
He--the policeman stayed and the SS man--they brought a lot of SS people and they stay and watch for us what they need to work.
So that if I went to a dentist and I had work some done and my teeth were bleeding...gums were bleeding  then I had to wait--make sure that the bleeding stopped--before I would leave.
I couldnt do any -- I couldnt go to work because I was beaten up few times in go to work  so I s -- gave up to go to work  because -- my friend -- I have a -- I had a friend in the neighborhood  Tanchim  my friend.
So many Germans come through and they were well organized  well organized.
It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people  and because we could work so efficiently  we saw the results in a very short time.
They could disappear and even if they caught  well  they would ship them to Germany to do hard work  labor  you know.
I said  \ I would be glad to work in your office and get a raise.\
Interview with Alan Kalish October 24  2003 66 Auschwitz I. Work building?
What -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 69 And your work now? --
Theyre knowledgeable about their work  whatever -- whether its professional or othe rwise.
She didnt have to go to work  and the story that I have to read is kind of describing of wh at life was like in one day  because I called it ﬁOne Ordinary Day in Auschwitz.ﬂ So  anyhow why Im talking about it is because by then this Sonderkommando had uprising  one of the crematoriums was damaged  and the Nazis came to the conclusion that most of the gas chambers should no  most of the crematoriums should be dismantled because there is they dont I mean  the front is so close and they didnt want to leave any evidence.
All this time before being deported  and espe cially after the Germans arrived  was your father still able to do his work?
And we had to coll  uh  collect in there stones or something  and all  we walked by one of the  the uh German woman  whatever they were  in uniform  and um  anytime you had to bring this in and come back  and you walked by  so I thought she looked very nice and young  and I said to her  uh  \ This is good work we are learning here  we can use it when the war is over.\
Here he had to  with out the language  to work for somebody.
After a year or so  I realized that if I contemplate entering college  I had better buckle down and take my high school work more seriously.
Then we started working again and going back to the factory and work again.
And you work mentally with the patient and physical  which makes it very difficult .
And during that time you were made to do a lot of very difficult jobs.
Was after work  we were there  and I heard they had brought Gizzy Fleischman in there  okay?
They are going to be alive and free and now we have to work for Israel.
And that's this thing what had happened the following the day when I came to work -- do we have enough time?
And ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 many were.
But some how girls made copies of this poem and many times we used to walk  you know  to work a bit and we used to recite it.
Well  it was interesting to work at the military government  you know.
Later one day  he came  and came friends -- one boy from work -- and Joe jumped under the bed and then he came from under the bed.
So you're outside of Munich when the war ends  and how does your work change?
And it was all residential  so there was no commercial activity going on there at all  which makes the presence of what was going on in our house even more puzzling  because my mother work ed in the house  in -- in two rooms of our house was this contore or -- or office  as she would call it.
We give away and one day I come from work I come in the house and I see my mother and two sisters dead.
There -- but also  there were always political discussions  and invariably  we found -- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to work.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about arriving in Auschwitz if you can.
Because they had to go to a commission; they had German doctors and they really needed them to work.
You have to deliver the goods so holiday time was not only a joyous time  4 it was also a stressful time because that's actually when my father had to work the hardest.
We would like him to come and work here.ﬂ So that other Karp said the only place that we are going to have available is when we get a blacksmith.
Uh there were assemblies for work details as far as I can remember--remember.
The people going to work on the airport or the they call this.
He did well  and he was very proud  an d he ca -- he hid his report cards in the war because he was very proud  but he only went to the sixth grade and it had nothing to do with his ability  it had to do with that was the fact of life  he was the youngest child of nine and he had to go work.
They gave us some camp money for the chores that we were doing over there and I don't recall the work that I had done for them  but I do remember I used to get some printed some type of camp money which William Loew 7 I have it still.
And back -- once she was 16 she came to live with my aunt and went to work.
I mean  even when we had maids  I -- I di -- I was small when we had maids  you know  and I dont remember at that time what she was doing.
I do volunteer work under the Retirement Service Office on Post at Fort Knox.
My my real initial involvement in charity work was in 1949 I was then kind of general manager of the Richards  ex-Richards circuit  now Paramount  and Leonard Goldensen again who had a cerebral palsy daughter asked that we in our theaters cooperate in fund raising and I got a trailer to run on my screen  but I couldn't find anybody to make the collections so...because it was Mother's Day that Sunday...so instead of continuing to seek people who said no  I can't go because it's Mother's Day  I called a meeting with an ad for the cerebral palsy parents in Orleans Parish  and they came to the meeting and becau se they couldn't leave their kids alone at home  the kids were with them  and I saw thes e kids and I have to tell you that it wasn't Dachau by any matter or means  but it was a h eavy sympathy factor to see these kids that just didn't have appropriate treatment  didn' t have appropriate diagnostic work  if the diagnosis was right they didn't have the discip lines to do it because it could have been dental  it could have been orthopedic  it could have been any number of things  and they just didn't have the doctors for it and not only th at  they couldn't diagnosis it  so I kind of fell in love with that  and in short order I took over the organization and then I became the president of the Cerebral Palsy Associa tion of New Orleans  subsequently Cerebral Palsy Association of Louisiana  then Regional Vice President of the national organization covering the South  and during all this  I would travel to different cities and I would meet with interested people and parents and I would get them going.
But the churches  the schools  any institution  I think should work together to make sure that people know that these are human beings  these are not some alie n group that is here only temporarily.
He needs me because you know  I work with him  and I take care of money.
If you miss a day of work  you get less food; because the  the  the place of work provided one soup a day.
It was hard work  every day  12 hours a day  work ing every day  busy working  trying to do -- make a living.
And  they were supposed to keep an order  and of course  when the Germans used to come and whatever they had to do  they were using them to do what - what should I say?
They selected us you know  and we went there to work.
It was a concentration camp and this was supposed to be a work camp.
You can imagine how she was crying when we were leaving her  but anyway I left her there and I traveled for six weeks  back and forth from that particular town wh ere there was the lumber yard...I didn't work there in the lumber yard already...I was afraid to be caught and what would she do in the hospital and the child in sanatorium.
I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put together a motorcycle.\
You know they felt  well  they are going to take the manpower and they are going to work them   or they are going to do things like that.
Is there anything else that you want to say about your work or the situation  your motivations  your church  any of this?
Then when it went a little bit better  they did took somebody to work there.
I know that the plan to have Jews emigrate from Romania did not work in pa rt because of German objections and Romanian objections.
So  it was I was the nurse going from one to the other  but the cases  as they were coming along  there was a lot less to work with  and there was no advice from a doctor anymore because the doc tor wasnt there anymore.
And then we were trying to get a little bit of potatoes.
So I washed my face in the kitchen  and I ran for work.
My mother did and as I said I went to work at 14 myself.
You talked about trying to get out of Lithuania in the very beginning when the Germans came in and how you were able to get horses and buggies and all of this  even though it didn't work.
When we came home from the work  we used to take the bodies  anybody who died  and we used to go dig in the ground  but I don't think we dig two feet to bury people.
The retirement age an d I think it may still be today  still recognized  when youre 65  back in those days  when I was a youth  that was automatic  65 y ou closed the book  no more work  you retired  and lived the golden years.
Now the the that is un a very bad position we were in because I  it was quite clear that these adventurers we  we tend to want to see people in terms of good or bad but that doesn't always work.
The reason I didn't work long...three  four months...the reason I didn't work long is when the people came in from the Ukraine  from all over  and I was afraid somebody would recognize me  so I stopped working.
>> Bill Benson: And as you said a few minutes ago  you did come back to Paris because your father felt he needed work.
And there was not much left that we could do  other than ou r daily work.
And did he work with one particular German if in official in particular  or with many?
The older boys were taken away to work first and then the mother and the young daughter went out to the store that was on the street and they were arrested.
I was thinking to go to school but there was uh very difficult in 1951 to go to college especially I don't know...was no no English and uh first I have to work and start uh...so uh in 1956 I was uh married to a girl named uh Dorothy Goodrich .
Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28  2015 7 Now Dad  I think when I was five years ol d  then he moved in here to there  to live with us befo re we work in Wolkowysk   and my sister says that I when he wanted to ke to hug me  I would run away.
We did hear music play when the transports marched in and out to work.
Those who worked in cleaning and and in the Gestapo building  they should all in their places of work and the name of the place of work.
But when we w ere marching to work or home  she tried but What were the march  can you describe the conditions  what it was like to march to the factory?
He had - he had german shepherds  like he took us to work.
Certainly as an occupying powe r  it cant work in the long run.
I mean  the order doesnt go out  you dont get -- dont get work  you sit there and twiddle your thumbs.
But  because of his looks -- he looked younger than the age of a person that was sent to work in a German factory.
So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what she told me  they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work  some remedy that they found  and I survived.
And if I work I would go to an office to have ala work  not in a factory  because we didn't got factories.
We were 40 on the table  I was the only work overtime  I didnt go home.
And now I went into Berlin actually twice a w eek to maintain contact with black market sources to obtain food and so I made it a poin t then always to take the bus and people saw me at the bus stop and  of course  I pretended to go to work to my factory.
Hasharah   the pa they were preparing th e young childrens to be to work.
And I started to work there  and I work there until 1961.
It wasnt so much the work as it was the demeaning atmosphere.
So my father arranged with the guy that was guiding all the laborers out and into the ghetto  he bribed him.
And I went to work and I worked for a half day.
In c onnection with Stalingrad  and the aftermath of Stalingrad  uh  more of these SS men were sent to th e front  to the  to the  to the in order to the Russian front  and  the Germans and the SS build a guard  a chain around the factory so that we were not watched completely by the SS guards in our   our detailed work.
The others  because it was early like must have been 4:30 so the girls still didnt come back from work.
And I knew in Israel I would have to work much harder and that the climate is much more  you know  its wa rmer and hotter.
And as she was dying in the last days  she told her son  Peter  that you have to follow this up fo r me and work on it.
1 500 people in one barrack and dead to live everybody had to be counted out the same day and then we go out to work.
My parents started  they were very poor and they started to work very young.
I got to work in a business that lived off the Germans and I had to put suits inside out  you know  the inside ou t. I made so good money that time that I could have--I was out of the house  I could take care of my mo ther  a widow by then and she had a stroke by then  too and my little sister and my younger brother.
They have terrible work  and they work all the time  you know.
Everybody  ex -- a-anybody who wasnt able to work  put into a work camp  they -- they -- they eliminated them.
We're going to work but we're goin g to have good condition s. And it made sense because they want us well  that's what we thought.
I had a very good life in many ways  have good colleagues  good work I love my work  I still do.
It did not  it went very well  you know  the  the uh in between something happened because as we were driving  riding toward that uh gate  all of a sudden from nowhere we sighted a commander  uh Fritsch  and he knew all of us because we work in the same barrack where he had his office.
I was working  and they were looking  and they work with their machines  and trying to fix it.
My father went to work as a printer  and my mother continued working as a as a ha t maker.
Now since I knew that Jewish people can be sick now for three days  as soon as somebody was not able to go to work -- prior to the point of course  if you couldnt be able to -- if you were not able to go to work  they took you what they called in the -- into the Lazarette  and they shot you.
and diarrhea and we should be assigned the convalescent  which was a much lighter load and let the Germans work there.
You needed a lot of effort and work and initiative and dealing with authority and all that  that was general knowledge.
So  those are Jews in the Ghetto and then there are Germans outside.
We the parents used to tell  be for lunch  but where you go in summertime  what you do we didnt work  you know.
My work  as I said  required providing food  clothing and shelter.
I mean the kind of feeling  well yeah its nice that a Jew made it  is doing such nice work.

maybe we can find something else and by some fluke  he found work in a private school in New York city  that dealt with emotionally disturbed yo ungsters.
Do you think because you were a furrier that this bought you time because you could work well for the Germans?
So we had to work to eat 03:18 and everything  but they give us a pass to a good restaurant.
I mean  this is a massive legislative  administrative body of work that has -- that has evolved out of this.
so this work detail was working near the camp  near the Krema [crematorium] on the other side of the wire fence and Ebensee had it's own Krema after a while and we were digging huge pits 04:45 for storing potatoes and beets for the winter and the SS who was in charge was probably a farmer in civilian and he was not so young  he may have been  I don't know  in the 40's and he was not particularly mean.
And in this -- and then there wasnt -- they didnt make enough money or anything  it was somehow or other  some body in the family advised that my mother should go with -- they should go to work as a couple for a year and put some money away.

So I uh I heard it's hard to know after all I was six  seven years old it's hard to know what I remember and what I'm reconstructing from what people tell me but I think I was very well aware that my father was uh having troubles with his business and where these troubles were coming from  that he had to do double bookkeeping and work out tricks with his friends so they could stay on in business and make it appear that he really was not.
I mean Im not always proud of everything everybody does  and you always wonder  but– So I think as we  both Jean and I  got involved in a lot of educational advocacy work  that we sort of knew we were here.
Germans engineers  Germans architect  all the Germans was -- and we was just  we made just the dirty work  the hard work.
In the morning  when I used to go  like to go there to work because I could find a lot of food  all right.
They put a wall around the ghetto  and we had to move to the ghetto.
What Im trying to get a sense of  is how did it work inside of you when you see this?
I did everything  works -- worked in factories  and work -- cleaned stairs  and worked every -- I -- the only thing I wasnt  I wasnt a street worker.
And I came home to tell my husband that Im going to possibly you know  I I interviewed and theres a good chance  that was the end of my married life  and what have you  and he says  no youre not  youre coming to work at Brody Printing Company.
From inside there were the uh employees of the Jewish labor exchange who us ed to to arrange the exit of the laborers in the groups from the ghetto out to outside to th eir places of work and they were...had ways and means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German  and so they keep uh close... close an eye and and they pass by  take part of it and give them as bribe you see  but nevertheless something left  and in th is way people tried...tried not to starve  just plainly...very plain words...not to starve.
I work I was still working before before the [indecipherable] camp.
Then when we went to work  in that place  for the SS men  one day I heard that when we go back  there is going to be massive killing of all the ghetto people.
So when I passed with the group to work  I saw mens working.
And in Poland I used to work as a social director.
I had to go to work  I found some work  we again did some sewing in the house  with mamma.
And only later on did they try to put us really in places to work.
Can you tell uh a little bit about the work that you did there in the factory?
>> Bill Benson: Eventually  through the help I think of someone you knew you were able to get out of that job and work in a kitchen.
From the hospitals  if you were there more than a few days and you couldn't go back to work  you just were eliminated.
Theres so many of those people  either in the Service or in the law  because she s in the work that shes in and because of our interest in education  weve just met so many pe ople across the state.
Any kind of work  building an d how you saying  th-the fil-fil-filds field a work an-any kind  only to work.
But there again...the goal was to...if somebody had to go and work in Poland as it was held up to us  they would...let's first send healthy people who are not going to suffer too much from the cold there.
You know  they ha d -- they -- they had a -- a responsible job  make sure  because the Germans and a ll the  you know  the branches  they dealt with them.
My great uncle -- oh  it's hard to believe  when I think about Germany so highly civilized and tremendous  advancement in industry and so on  well  the little town of Holoratz in the Schneeeifel  my grandmother  my father's mother  like most girls in the town  were sent down in the valley to work as a maid and possibly to fi nd a husband.
So  he founded we called a resort  a factory  a place to work.
When you were 17 or 18 you had to work to survive.
We had -- So you were living in the old factory bu t they brought you some where else to work?
That's all I got -- started up with the police  and they say not to go to work.
Well  they didn't do any day just work  I mean from   uh  they  they did factory work  they did work out outdoors  they uh gathered the uh dead bodies to be cremated.
T hey hope to use this technology to improve the usability of faded documents in the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 museum's work.
I met...I met him the year before  but I  uh  I had..I had to work uh besides going to school  to finance it.
That I dont know  but there were peopl e who were taken out of the camp  put on a train to outside to work someplace  to factories  to farms  for During this time?
And immediately the next day I came to Krakow and I start to work because I had to fulfill this  this– later on he was released from the hospital.
So anyways  he became acquainted and their doctor and they told my father the day our familiar visit  Hungarian office and their family  I think the officer sort of liked them better than his own family and he told them that he knows his wife was looking into a Catholic charity to look for a place to work for her  you know  like a maid.
So I remember there were 2 American officers that were in charge  but the day to day work was done by the day to day work of being in charge  I mean  was done by an enlisted man.
Did you have to go to work again the next day?
So I knew Russians at the time  so I said I was from Minsk  cause I didnt want to go back to Poland.
When my sister was selected to work in a light bulb factory threading filaments  the inspection was among 400 nude women.
Also made and couldn't work  you lost your...you had no strength  so I was there for about two months till we finished.
The people who they didnt choose to take to the work camp  what happened to them?
Now  when your fathers off of work  is your mother still working?
So he told me  and he said  today will come a German and take some people to work with the kitchen  with potatoes  to wash it  to prepare food  I dont know.
Now  while in the ghetto  there was always -- every day  everybody was taken to labor to work  different kind of places.
We walked together to the factory 'cause once I got into the factory in Schleeben  I was able to sit on a bench and let the work go through me.
We stopped along the way  to work on the railroads  but to work on the railroads  we had to move railroad tracks  long  heavy railroad tracks  one area to another.
And so we we nt back to the conservatory  he enro lled me as a pianist accompanist and gave me right away work to do in a certain room with a choir  and told me at five o'clock we meet in front of the building and we go home.
But the work service did other things  too  which is not really defined.
And then one morning as I was getting ready to go to work and she was already downstairs and I was coming down from my bedroom and I heard some horrible moaning of pain.
But it didnt work so anyway  I got the job .
I think I was also  not only a professor of music  but I was like a mother or aunt  and I think that they were also  they work and they laugh for this  what they did.
A nd he applied to Kent Social Work School and thats when he wrote– I could give you that  I mean just for your own fun.
Interview with Wolfgang Price 40 May 2  2014 Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington?
But because he was an electrician  they needed him  so they let him work.
But Joe  every day when I came from the work  I found the big card  paper with the letters  big letters  boards -- \ Buy a Boards.\  \
What what we have to work to stop not never again the same.
>> Susan Snyder: Did you find a place to stay  then   in the ghetto  find jobs  work?
While those people had at times had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work.
And there used to be Jewish police  you know about that?
Now  when you arrived in Palestine   what port did you Haifa .
It took us a lot of work to arrange that exchange.
Then I will work  thats also a good experience  a good opportuni ty.
So that lady wa -- she was in the -- our chief  you know  at work  our boss lady.
A nd we took work out to [an old factory ]...factory to sew blouses.
Bernard found work by the Germans because this was the best place for him to work.
And then I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself.
But they said to the Germans  we need Dutch people -- we need pe ople to work here  we need laborers to do the work  why dont you send some busloads of those prisoners every day?
When I started to work for the Schulte fam ily  I pretended that I don't understand a word German because it was very rare that Poles knew German.
The people who lived nex t door to us would call him at work  my uncle  my pretend uncle  but then they stopped calling.
And when people sat down to have lunch at work  I would take my two pieces and I would eat my two pieces of bread.
I had a feeling because they took us off from work and locked us in the barracks.
That all  they mostly think  that they selected people that able bodies go to work  and women with children and invalids  everything goes; they liquidate.
You didn't have a chance  you know  so you try to survive...to feel  you know  strong and be that you are able to...to move and able to work if you wanted to live.
And then I had some luck because I was put to work on a farm in Birkenau.
One of your major publications after the dissertation is related to your work with the captured records  you published Hitlers second book.
But she left a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 message.
You finished school  you had this two year commitment  and what -- where did you go  what -- what kind of work did you do when you finished school?
One evening...one evening I came home from work and this was around 6 o'clock and one lady who lived on the same floor because I lived in an apartment house  she run...she was waiting for me to come home.
And one day we were told to get ready for work and we were marched to the railroad trestle  and we were put into a transport.
You don't want to work  but you want others to work.
The Hanak family  with Mr. Horace Hanak  his wife Greta  and their daughter Vera  they survived in Theresienstadt  because he was maintaining the water works  or work -- or works -- worked on the maintenance of the waterworks in -- in Theresienstadt  and the Germans needed the water USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 11 for themselves  is where three people.
I have such strong  good feelings towards all the people that work in the Holocaust  whether they get paid or not  because I feel n-not only are they do -- especially the volunteers  they are trying to right the wrong by coming there and working there.
Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later.
I would pull out -- some points out of it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0028 68 and say  where work is concerned  it goes by ability  who is able to do what.
He got from Neftalin two weeks leave to work in the bakery  which meant he could eat as much bread as he could absorb  but it also meant that his bread ration was not needed by him during the two weeks.
And he did some effort work  and I transferred to work for him.
The reason being that people  uh those who are um... who are um...who are uh assigned to do the cleaning would uh clean up the rooms where we slept; and they themselves would then join us and go to work with us.
And you you call you do your work  and you come back after a days work  whereby you have guards there  and they constantly changed.
And my father -- oh  my father had a -- with his friend they opened -- they bought a delicatessen on Sheridan Street  which lasted -- that was when I was 12 and 13 and my mother then went to work there.
So  one or two of them did  and one in particular  I told him  \ Look  everybody says that it's no point  there is no point training women because they have children and they don't work.
And I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm.
And suddenly now that you bring that up  the only job they we had to pay back Je wish Federation  and I remember hearing my mother saying you know  I know now that all these do nations that we give to the Jewish Federation  maybe its different now  and they worked they were able to work in the delicatessen store.
In the main -- in the main camp of Auschwitz .
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 31 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Are you rolling?
The  the  the um   director of the factory came without his pin  was an  that he belonged to the Nazis in a blue suit  blue  elegant suit  and he thanked us for our work  and uh  he told us we had to wait until the International Red Cross would come  and pick us up and bring us to our countries.
Do you have any interests or hobbies  or pash -- passions  outside of your work things  that you love to do?
Y ou see  even if you were -- if you were of a mind to run away  it was -- it wasnt going to work.
One on one side or like barracks or like places that work  and one on the other side and in the middle was like a big  big street  and we walked to the ghetto works and we walk in.
But even by marching to work or doing your chores that you were ordered to do  the sidewalk was forbidden for a Jew to walk on.
And then uh in part uh during the undergraduate work I uh worked as a uh uh a foreign correspondent to some Czech newspapers and did some work for the Ministry of Agriculture in Prague.
And you were living amongst a lot of German Jewish refugees there.
Whatever Father was doing in Majowka  she was running the office there and the work usually I mean  the assignment of the work came from the Je wish management  came from the Judenrat which was very  very helpful because at least  you know  we had more contact with her  and it was easier to maintain the contact be tween one camp site and the other.
To improve the workers conditions  so So then there were two of them left to work for four people  basically.
>> Laura Green: Can you tell us a little bit about how your mother's work enabled you to escape at that point?
I work so many hours  my nights were Interview with William Luksenburg 25 very short  my days were very long.
And in the large Russian cities  you 7 could work at day and study in the evening.
Not when I started to work in the agricu lture  no I had the [indecipherable]  I brought in the vegetables  I smuggled them in my bra.
So  how do you Interview with David Halivni June 13  2014 67leave a child.
You take no notice of them  cause we had a rough idea of what was happening with the couple of radios we had in there see [DL] Was this man an SS officer or was he... [AG] He was a normal German officer  cause when our boys landed in France  Jerry used to put on a ‚music while you work on in hospital you know  you used to have music while you were working in the hospital  and they forgot to switch it off  and they said ﬁthe allies have landed on the coasts this morning.
Did you experience any  sort of blatant anti-Semitism after the war?
Most Germans just wouldnt want to work in that  and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could produce.
I changed that 7 somewhat in branching out to a more secular orientation  I did -- but when doing something in the -- in the -- in the synagogue where lifestyle or lifetime events t ook place  I had to work with a mashgiach under -- under religi ous supervision  per se.
And he need the people to take care of the and the priest  previous one  on the in the church  stated that cris Christ said muts pray and work and pray  something like that.
And he gave me like full charge  he says  ﬁYou can work overtime in the evening.
No  I decided I wanted to see what's going on before I decided to work and then of course I ended up in things which I didn't want to do.
And later on my sister and I and my two aunts  whom we met there  were assigned to work at a place where  again  nobody ever told you what will happen but we found ourselves in a place that was immediately next to the gas chamber number 4.
I knew that I knew how to work with people  and but I never thought of myself as doing anything special.
We do have a middle class  no question about it  but its not easy to work your way up if youre in a poor strata  to join the middle class.
Did you come home from work and find he wasn't there?
At this ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 28 point she told me.
We were part of  of uh  of the work  the work schedule as far as we knew that those things were sent to Germany  the clot hing that was being separated  the jewelry that was sewn into people's clothing.
Did she get No  my mother was getting release from work.
She says alright  so I arranged immediately a meeting of... meeting of the committee of the of the underground at my private dwelling and I ...there were two from the underground that said alarm if somebody comes in and all went to to work in my...because they were in my dining room where all the members of the executive of the Zionist underground and in addition Dr. Elkes and Garfunkle  yes  and uh and uh Dr. uh Dr. Shapiro was there.
ﬂ By that time   he could still work in his company.
They brought him back from whatever work Battalion he was in.
>> Bill Benson: Do you recall arriving there and what was it like for you to be in that infamous camp?
You know the older you were the less that security blanket can work.
Instead of allowing the remaining survivors there to be liberated  the Germans decided to evacuate the camp.
When there came no transport  we had to work in the woods and clean the woods.
So I really -- I mean  on ce I was here  I felt a -- you know  I -- I had people to fall back on  and then I started -- I started to work as a trimmer in a -- in a millinery factory because I had a friend whose parents had a factor y -- a hat factory in Vienna  and they were working there  so they got me a job there and I worked there.
I remember one day I didn't know anymore where to hide her and I was leaving the room to go to work and an idea came to my mind to go down to the basement.
I saw the gas chamber before they started to build because I was there and was doing some work there.
12 We were to work just an electrified fence separating us from this gas chamber.
And we used to go out and -- and do the job.
I say  its no problem at all  we have we have always worked together where we could work on one piece of rush work where I start on the right and he starts on the left and we meet in the middle and it looks like one piec e. What more could you want?
I had to be with another family to -- this was only through my work and ability whatever I could do to help those families this capacity of course I wasn't paid much  almost nothing.
When you would take down the histories of refugees experiences  on a daily basis  were you surprised and shocked from -- with what you heard  or did you go through a sort of transformation during your tim e with this work  and -- No.
I never  ever -- we had curfew in the dormitory  so I could only be in the library to 11  but I couldnt work -- you know  I couldnt work in the house  because I just couldnt be in that -- in that -- it was a tiny room  with -- you know  but she was on USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 174 the upper bunk  I was on the lower  you know  bunk beds?
And the following day when they took us to work  we saw the smoke coming out of the chimney and I put two and two toge ther and I knew exactly what was going on  that they not around anymore.
It was a lot of work  an awful lot of work  but I loved every minute of it  because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to do it.
I wanted to work because I always wanted to have my own money.
Before the ghetto was formed  you were already taken to go to work; is that right?
And a lot of young people  like I worked in glass factory had what they called arbeitshein  means a work permit.
Even if they were just laborers  they still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families.
So how did that work  being a part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at the same time?
So finally  my husband couldnt ge t a job  so somebody recommended the [indecipherable] work he does  a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning store.
But so we then stay with our sponsors and literally the next day  Father goes to work at Cherriads lumber company  although he doesnt know how to be a carpenter  or whatever its on and I go to to work for Butlers Specialty company  where there is the mean owner  not I I mean  he he he thought I was scum  but he also was very mean  I remember  because he was I was not used for to people who were really disrespectful to elders.
So he called me in his office  he came to me  I went down from that cell in his office.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ABRAHAM RODSTEIN page 17 Interviewed (early May 97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: AR: Yes  yes we cou--we--we--we ate food.
There was a pl ace called Bilanie; there was a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment  paints   and maintenance things for aircraft when we were supposed to work.
Hermann Goer ing  they called it like  his institute  his work.
But I say  if he Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 80wants us to work more  then he has to give us food.
And uh he was a great artist yes and when  when he came he wanted to work and he went to the  to the uh committee of the elders and he said look I will draw you your  your posters.
And as we were sitting at a table  around a table  my brother had a Yiddish newspaper  daily -- the yi -- Jewish daily  and there was a ad on the pape -- in the paper that they are looking for a y -- they are looking for a young man  you could make right away money  not difficult work.
In fact  it was a union route  the selection of the men who were going to work.
After work there wasnt people that lived in the area you saw.
How long were you in the village all totaled  before you went to the work camp?
Well  then people heard about his work and they came with requests  you know.
In the first place they had some Nazi uniforms  the German uniforms so they could disguise themselves to do their work  and they would leave them in their underwear and tell them -- tell them that the farmer caught you with his daughter so he made you run so they could save face.
The farmers come with food  with everything to the city  exchange for clothes  for equipment to work on th e farm for appliances  for stuff like this.
It wasnt tremendous amount  but it was e nough  because I went to work  you know.
No  I did get there  but this letter and the request for work was only for me to be able to travel  because otherwise I couldnt get out  being Jewish  I couldnt get out of the ghetto.
What -- what sort of -- two questions  what sort of forced labor  and was it every day  or was it -- from the -- with the way she just said it I got the feeling maybe it was just occasional  or -- No  this was work here and there  as they required and as they -- as they rounded up people.
So that these girls came back and they didnt work  they had no professions.
I my self and one of my buddies who happened to have woodworking as a hobby be fore the military were given an opportunity to work in one of the local cabinet shops on military materials -- exercise equipment  I guess.
And he was able to earn a little bit of money that way doing that sort of work.
First  the work that you did was very dangerous in the munitions factory.
And I started again  and  and after three  four days being in bad areas where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat  I lined to work for the Third Police Brigade in the center of the most luxury area in  in Kovno.
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 56 To work  yeah  you have to go  they they there wasnt any transportation.
They weren't going to leave parents  and they had no place to go and they said  \ If I am going to die  I might as well die right here.ﬂ Many people such as my father believed it more or less but they wouldn't go because in prior times there had been false alarms and there was a great deal of l ooting and people were afraid of losing their few possessions because really you were not going to have a chance to work or do anything useful to gain more possessions.
You can't go to work  you got to go to the infirmary.
And while you were in Auschwitz  did you have a job?
We knew nothi ng and we knew that one day  some day  we would be deported  but we thought that it would simply be a work camp  where people have to work.
So I tried to find work in a -- a laboratory  but for awhile I couldn't and eventually I did find work in a -- I was accepted in a laboratory and my husband -- my fiance  who eventually became my husband after the war  and to say good-bye to my mother  who lived with my sister and whose -- she also had no papers  but that's why she was not in our hometown  she was with my sister and was with Mina and she showed them my picture. [
And I rent a place  and I knew what to do  and I got the all the I was I was getting work from people what they got stores.
The council of Jewish women in clee -- in Syracuse  where we lived -- well  people knew that I was from France  that I had done some underground work  or had worked in camp and -- I mean  th-there was some general knowledge  but I had never  sort of really going a -- I think that once sisterhood asked me to participate in a program -- they will have other people who had lived in Europe and I -- I must have sa-said a few word.
Ma -- I think my fathers days were so full with his -- with his work  and with work for the courts.
And were they handling original films  or did you make work copies?
So that and she went to work  she was working with the other women in [indecipherable] manufacture  hard working.
I almost dropped dead  cause I thought Id be dragged to jail for taking away a work from workplace from her  you k now.
Page 10 At work  in the metaleines workshop  did pe ople talk about politics or military issues of how is the war going for the Germans or th e Russians moving  fighting back  or the Allies  the Americans and the British?
And because near us was a power station and this was like you know at that time radar didnt work so well.
But I never -- I didnt take anyth -- because I was working very hard at a -- in the business with my husband and I felt I didn t want to do anything that would -- well  would -- train for some other work.
As Ive said  if you were unable to work  you were either left to die  or you were shot.
From the local German work ers  which were also hit sometimes.
Can you remember at all what was in your mind that kept you going  or that you were striving towards?
We were given -- we were given work  you know  then we had to work.
Edwarda Rorat 38 February 25  1996 Page 38 Marching with the red flag and wearing green shirt and red tie and of course doing the social work  that was the part of my organization.
Well  then  my feeling is that  only people who are able to  to go to work  and even then  it depended very much on what the demand was.
I was young  and I would do some work in Schindler's own house  so I had uh a matter of fact I could say that I walked out from camp a healthy boy.
When I went back to work for the American government in Munich  I saw daily this business about well I didnt know what was going and I said Dachau and people told me they didnt know what was going on when the railroad tracks led right into the concentration camp.
And on Shabbat  people would come over and -- and  you know  they'd -- my grandmother woul d bake stuff on Friday  make challah  and she gave me a piece of dough and I could work -- work the system.
Because what they said  the people who work in the Zonder Commando mean s the people who burned the people after they were gassed  the Canada  the people who worked in the transport commando  they should never see the world because they is witness to the history  unlike us.
And finally I told him  I said  ﬁLook  I would love to work in a kitchen for you.ﬂ I didnt want to work for him at all  but I told him.
Whether they went to work I doubt very much because we have never seen or heard of them.
Very smart guy  and I went back there af ter the war  after I came home from -- from -- from the service  I went to work with them ag ain  and I -- I was -- I liked it  and I wa -- I was probably pretty -- I was good at it.
I will work with you a little bit  and he came and in his jeep he brought things we hadn't seen for for days and for years and for ye ars...not only K-rations but also packages he had gotten from America and so and he gave us  my friends and me  and he became a close friend of our s from this day on.
When I came Bergen-Belsen I says  well now  now were not going to do any work any more until we settle in.
So  they send me a work order that I was supposed to work in the hotel.
Now  see the Germans  what they did is they put garrisons in there.
>> Rae G oldfarb: In the ghetto  in order to not to be taken with a  in order to be taken to work  she had to get identification for both of us.
indecipherable] And there was an instruction during the day  whoever didnt work and had no working scheins  not to walk the streets.
I have done some work  some articles on war crimes tribunals and so forth.
But we all  you know  did all our work  practical work in the hospital  and the hospital of the university was by then at that time completely run by the Cat holic nuns.
This is tape number two  side A. And you were telling me about your second daughter and her work in California.
And at that time  when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno  I was already  well  a young teenager at that time  I was mostly  well almost 13 and 13  and I began to understand  you just don't talk about things of importance during the war.
Then all of a sudden  all of a sudden they decided they needed people to go to work.
The tailors were home tailors  they took the stuff home to sew it and bring it back to us  and I got him merchandise  I got him business from Vienna  and from Stuttgart in Germany  because I knew perfect German  how to write and I wrote to the Chambers of Commerc e  and these people didnt have labor  but they had some materials  so we are fini -- we were finishing it for them  and the tailors from the little villages around  which did the work for us  they were very grateful to me  and were bringing me illegally food  like butter  eggs  chicken  whatever.
Otherwise I I these very much routine  and its its pleasant work  but its not not terribly challenging  shall we say.
Often during the time when the men were at -- at work  this Gorajetski used to come into the ghetto and circle two or three street  take all the women out into the -- into a place  and ask for gold.
>> Bill Benson: How did you come to the United States?
Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't  I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the au thorities.
And then I got drafted  and I return  a-and -- and then it happened that we were work ing on the first field trial of this first ever new telephone exchange  what has take n Bell Laboratories biggest department of 400 people  six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess  Illinois.
When they took my father  they said he goes to a work camp.
And the word got around - first of all  able-bodied people were taken anyhow - but word got around that if you work  you have a chance to have a better life.
A friend of mine  Ruth Gay -- I dont know -- you probably know her work.
They sent them the front  they needed people to produce work  so they just took some from Studthoff and that's where we got to and worked in an a mmunition factory.
We were -- we were two -- there were the -- the -- the -- the real nurse  then -- it was a man  the doctor an d myself  and we had really to work  you know  [indecipherable] morphium Schwester  morphium Schwester  because he was in terrible pain.
And in the morning we came to a place -- later on we found out.
All around the area  they we -- just went out and whoever was loose  they brought them in and put them to work.
Didnt work  so -- oh no  I wasnt going to do that  no.
So you see  the...already from before the ghetto  they were rationed...Jews were not allowed to appear before ten on the markets  open markets  because let the Lithua nians buy whatever it is and whatever the rest  were taken to Jews  but then we were now forbidden at all and this order of the 10th of July  1941  Jews were forbidden to appear in the open markets to buy from nonJews  to hire vehicles from non-Jews  to use help of non-Jews...absolutely.
the car was fixed  but he had to work at it  he had to do a lot.
Then he decided hes going to go to Social Work school.
If you work in the kitchen  you could eat all you want.
She had come to Holland in the early 1900s  first to work in a restaurant  where Papa Madna happened to be the manager.
Nobody wanted to go to this commando  but I think there were thousands of prisoners who had to work and thousands of them were dying and so that  these were the three main camps.
All of them under and over went to the crematorium but my brothers were 14young and healthy and they could work.
And  of course  just like Germans did this type picking out  the people didn't want to go.
Also  women were working on the premises in camp  you know  cleaning the barr acks  taking care of the laundry not personal laundry  but whatever  you know  the kitchen stuff and all that  and for example  later on  when I stopped going to the factory  to the brick factory  and I was helping Father quite often  he used to send me to work wherever there was a shortage of people.
I -- I -- I knew only -- the demands were ve ry well known  that they need more and more people t-to work.
It was hard you know like for to send to work because not all the work places were good ones.
Only an old friend of my mothers showed because there was nobody else  and my classmate  and we went for thr ee days in a hired car to Goshen  upstate New York  because we had to get married on a Thursday because we had to go back to work on Monday.
I went into the toilet  threw out all my pictures of my family  of my brothers  whatever I had with me  my parents  all documents under the name of Tenenboim  all my passports  and my documents th at I had and I had to destroy because I was sort of a deserter from this pa rticular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim.
But me  they di dnt take -- they didnt tell us to come from the house where I lived then  but from the factory  becau se I said they were going to take us to Germany and were going to work in a metal fa ctory there.
So one late afternoon after work  my brother told the guy that I arrived  I came here the other night or last night.
And when we came  lunch 29 time  I took the container  brought it to the kitchen and went back to work.
Uh  in that same apt where I lived with my aunt a nd uncle  one night after work in in the um beauty shop  I came home  and my aunt and uncle were crying and were very upset  and they told me  \ Lily  we have to leave.\
As this is going on  and I think back to a couple of people at the unive rsity  who were instrumental in talking with me about these things  and these are program s that some of the courses had practicums attached  in the field of social service  in the field of social welfare  in the field of social work.
Not panic at all  but but but uh let's say uh they waited and nobody know...knew what is going...nobody knew that it's want to be dea d  so maybe it's harder work.
And then  before I even had time to turn ar ound and feel that oh my goodness  what am I going to do with my life now that the children are going to start school  Jim said  \ We are starting a busines s.\  And so when my son went off to Kindergarten for half a day  I went off to work.
And so my older br other works for the pants factory there  and I work f -- and I was working for the uncle.
Yeah  I want to work in Arad because I was already married  I finish in '51  but since '50 I was married and I said I want to work in Arad because my husband lives there.
By other people who during the day beat us  tortured us  spit at us  killed us  and then went home to their wives and children and dogs and played with them and ate their 9 dinner  and they never even gave a thought to what they did as what they considered work.
I came home and started to work over there  and after a couple of months I got sick.
So many people were killed and moved to camps but some will go by and together we've taken.
Uh  and--and so uh another time they uh took uh several hundred new people to uh Estonia to work and--and my sister and her husband and her husband's mother uh went to that area and so this was the last of our relatives in the ghet- to.
Then he started to  he started to look for work do work.
You know  the German Jews in at that time  and down there  they were not poor.
But here he is among Jews...you understand  and she said  \ When Shier comes home from work  she will talk to him.
End of Tape Three  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 49 Beginning Tape Four  Side A -- your Holocaust experiences?
Did you work every single day  or did you ever have a day off?
So I think -- one day I hope it might happen that we work hand in hand on everything.
Interview with Edith Langer 54 Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington?
Work and my parents  my friends  and the same...I'm...and the  4 mine age  not was...in this time  take me to the army.
Now  Auschwitz was a large -scale death camp and a fairly large -scale work camp as well.
And once he let me work on the premises and I used to put gravel on the ground and I still remember I had my  my short in the  shorts and a halter because it was summertime and I worked on the premise because we had to shower every day.
And she said  \ You know  mom --\  she my wife baby-sat for her one day because she was doing some work and her sitter was out.
And I immediately a two volume book on the definition of Aggression which spelled out the background of all of this and this became a classic work on the defi nition of Aggression.
And then we left Knoxville and I had -- I had the use of the university lab to do my work in and then we came to Knoxville and I no longer had a lab to work in and so I decided perhaps it was time to switch from doing metalwork  which required gas  which I find very hard to -- to keep in my house  which psychologically was very difficult for me to have a gas tank in my house. [
I had the experience because during the war  in some concentration camps  I work in a machinery place.
Among the people who were arbitrarily arrested and shipped to Poland was an elderly couple  Grynszpan  who  and the Poles  of course  claimed they didn't know what to do with all those Jews  so they put them into camps in inhuman conditions and they had lived in Germany  I'm not sure whether in Berlin or some other city  anyw ay  they had a son  Herschel  whom they had sent to Paris to relatives because it became  Berlin became too oppressive  and he lived with an uncle in Paris.
DL] You talked about the wir eless  how did that actually work?
So -- then -- so I come there  and then -- and theyre stuck in the work  and they couldnt make them  and the master comes up  and his eyes  you could see right away  hes not a friend of mine.
Uh eventually we were taken  the ghetto was liquidated and we were taken to uh a uh work camp in Wolanow; and uh there we stayed from 1942 'til 1943.
And then I spent a lot of– so I did that.
He goes to work in a hardware store as an employee.
So did most people I mean  did most people work in the mines or have  you know  family members work in the mines and then also the support functions to that?
Shed come home tired from work  she would make dinner  she would clean up and then I had the audacity to tell her that she couldnt run the water to wash the dishes while I was doi ng my homework.
so another voice answer  \ Yes  these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai  \  a certain place where Jewish use to work there  hard work.
They they were already allowed to go not not to work.
And any more education after the masters or I went for a few years to Catholic to work toward a doctorate but I never did get my doctorate.
They did an incredible amount of this kind of spade work.
So when you speak of charity work and so on  it was through the community.
But the work assignments that were  lets say  by the Germans to direct certain squads of people to do this kind of work  [indecipherable] repairs  or the what they call  the platform repairs  or or is cleaning up the stations  you know.
As I told you  twice very bad es pecially the one when he came to the lazaret and it would you think it is here sanitary we're called which means horse and the other one went with us with this group to work for the front  he was very sharp.
If you dont want to work  you dont pay the tax  youre in trouble.
A. I did the same kind of work  you know  cutting stones  pipes  things like that.
Oh  I have some nice  fond thoughts of my elementary school because in the fourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I was a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one  in the work that I was doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general class  because it was such a mixed group.
Yeah  definitely my parents -- What kind of work did they do?
And that was outside the ghetto  or inside That was part of ghetto then  yeah.
>> Bill Benson: While you were in Poland -- you had left some of the family belongings before you went into the ghetto with somebody who said he would take care of them.
It depends who one talks to  it depends how its reconstruc ted  and it wh-while theres a lot of good work  at the same time there are things that do come off wrong.
He's getting in the way of my work  and instinctively I replied that you call this work.
So I began my work with the Hidden Children  and in a ki -- in a sense  I found my community.
He mentioned to him that I know ther e is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that comes here every morning  I used to work nights on the machine.
He did not go to a DP camp which was the standard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution Agency and his job for them was to help people find housing.
We better get back to work  and I checked with Horley Airport to find out how we could go back to Munich by air without spending too much money.
We feel strongly that we need to do whatever it takes to make sure things do work out.
He...he did for me a favor and he talked for me to...to work in his place.
After that point  they just stop and... However  even though I did all the preparatory work for the test  the teacher felt that it would be too risky for me to actually go because you had to go to the...uh...you know  nearby big town and you had to fill out forms and you had...uh...you know prove who you were.
Otherwise  we would be shipped to Germany to forced labor camps or to work in factories of the German war machine.
And and I liked my work because I was with people all day  talking to them and trying to help them and whatever I could in my capacity.
They took the men to work loading wheat into trucks---without pay.
So afterwards  when I got out of the internment...uh...there was an episode and he re I am not absolutely certain about the...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events  but I know that my sister was evacuated to Spalding and I managed to be ther e. I managed to be for a few months there  working the land  because I was then at th e time on the war essential work order.
You got up in the morning  you went to work  you came back in the evening and uh the only thing is that and that we realized later that we were all together and we still had our own clothes and if it rained as in next day  you could put on something else.
I went back in there and told her the news  what happened.
But there was also effort -- The Jewish -- they were out of ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: As I recall  you told me that because he was often injured and hurting because of the work  that the foreman was somewhat easy on him.
And now  she took it over when it was dying and now she -- its in every state  and that she gets grants from Congress and also from toy companies like Mattel to -- to work their program.
Whenever she comes down here -- she was here recently and she did a lot of beautiful artwork and have it in -- and she gave me a lot of her work.
And we were put to work there in Puchine in one camp and then the next camp.
And from then  I had to go back to Poland  I went back to Poland again from there.
he was old enough  he was put in some work activity  like messenger.
I mea n  what you got left  you should make -- make it as comfortable for yourself  b ecause hatred just doesnt work.
I had to work 12 hours a day  and one week during the daytime  and the other week during the night.
They took us for work  from the barracks  just to drag wood because you have to remember that Buchenwald was carved out from a forest.
Let him come to work.ﬂ So  on that wintry day I went out to work with Herschel  and we were working with about five people  and what we are doing we were remode ling a house for a Gestapo  a private home.
They needed electricians  so I went  my friends and we did some work.
My father was working  I was working  my sister was in school for a couple of years and then she got some job to work.
It was uh... whenever a wind came up there was a lot of dirt in the air and we had to work out what we were going to eat every day.
Although Elizabeth [ NB: New Jersey]  where I lived  was not very far from  uh  from  uh  New York City; so I went to the factory in the  uh...and I work in the factory for a year and a half before.... And later on again  I went to Germany on the contract with United States Government.
But the work c ontinued  and during the whole war period the JDC programs continued.
The housekeeper brought a box of bonbons  and she said that I am a very nice boy  but she wants she wants to note that shes a very busy person  and she doesnt have any time away from her work.
The Germans had made some concentration camps work in weapons factories  being making bullets  for example.
Because if anything had happened to them  it ha and we saw  you know  also  other people who hadn't be my father had been told by his father  its very nice you want to study medicine  but remember  you dont really need to work for a living.
In the morning took him out  had to go back to work  you know?
In my  in 1937  at the end of 1937  when I was employed in a private engineering firm  the the government  the embassy made the govern ment came to power  K ovan Kuza and our company gave us every mont hs by the end of the month a note that this is our last month of work and say on January 1  38 I got a note that  that my employment will end January 31 st  38.
It says exactly that we are working under Department B or some of 34 them work for Department A  plus the Swedish Red Cross.
What you did after the war (the war crimes work)  how important was that for you?
And your mother  did she work or was she at home?
That were to clean    in the morning we had to  before we went to work we had to  to clean them with some kind of oily liquid.
And my mother knew that it would be very difficult to separate me from Mima  so she decided that Mima ought to continue to care for me while she and my mother went out looking for work.
Was there a fear during the day that you might be hurt or that when you came home from work something might be wrong with your family?
So she began to work alone as a worker in her own establishment.
So it wasn't going to work to have three Jewish children living in that home now.
I -- I was just doing my work  I was not -- Are you surprised that nobody said anything?
They didnt beat us  and they teach us how to work  and Im thankful for it.
So when we came there  just to run away from the bombs as a matter of fact  our house was destroyed at that time by bombing  you know.
Interview with George Kadar 45 April 24  2000 Contacts were not possible  so you --people were leaving the camp to make work somewhere  and having met women  of course they sto -- th-the -- they so -- Mrs. So and So  and Mrs. So and So  but my mother never had been mentioned.
So he had a girl from the ward  he took him there  he helped and so he didn't work no more because of this.
And so he went to teach at Purdue University for two years and then he went to work for as a consultant for Mazda and Ford in their emission control.
Yeah  I also met  that is very important  a male  in fact that was already on th e first day that I started to work there  a male  I mean a man a few years older than I  his name was Hans Fabisch and we became really extremely close friends  it was my first close friend since I lost the one whom I had in high school  who emigrated to England.
41 That we knew because we saw the other pr isoners going to work every morning and coming back every evening.
He couldnt understand why people who were family men with children would want to go home at the end of the day and not come back and work at night or work on Saturdays or work on Sundays.
And when I came out  I was on what was called half-time  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 88 meaning I had a work tolerance  supposedly  of four hours.
And then I went back on to work  like a a young secretary and later I I was working.
And of course there is this group of people sitting and asking me  did you get paid for the no  this man  this captain says  but she work for the Americans  she work for the CIC.
They were wooden buildings  not very large at all  and they had --these were just for sleeping  and they had bunk beds  as I rememb er it  four high with just a few inches between each two bunks so that you --you just knew --the re was just no way a --a person could turn over in the bunk.
They they realized that they have to remove those people from Lebanon because they had they had an agreement that they wont work.
Uh  and uh  if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got less beatings  you were able to do it right away  and if you had a team  uh  sometimes we had to work in teams uh loading lorries and we were two people or four people as a team and all of them spoke German.
But some men were gathered to send to this town  and the other things that happened had to do hard labor in the street work.
12)] And this is a certificate which says that I was allowed to work there during the war  which permitted me to go to the...back and forth from the Creche to the Schouwburg.
Did you work for this lady the whole time you were in Denmark?
So when you -- when you heard this -- Into ghetto  that means we were go -- we were going into the ghetto.
So  the one on the left  I think that the left meant that they went to death  and the right went to work.
We went to work in the ghetto  we called in Werkstaton (SP?)
That was a company and he was doing work with them.
And I -- and he -- later on  when he had finished his time to learn  he went to Nitsa  to the Riviera and to Francesbath and Karlsbath  these are baths in -- in Czechoslovaki -- to -- to work.
So we stood first my sister from the...from the...when we went from work  then I  and my brother from other place  we met over there...uh...in...in this place where we told we will meet and we we nt night time over there.
My mother continued to work with the Quakers and in 1941 in the summer through these connections I was sent to a summer camp at Lake Annecy which was very pleasant for me  the food was good and so on.
Every day when we came from work  I was going to her and I developed very big...very big sores on my legs  very bad circulation  and she would help me.
You know  I was a greenhorn just off the boat and in order to get the job as an upholsterer  I had to buy a hammer  a magne tic hammer  which you put into your m yo u youve never obviously you have never done any upholstery work .
And so they picked them out and put them to work; and the one who couldn't work  was no use for them. (
Pause  drinking water) So that was the beginning of establishing work camps which was supervised by the German army and it was that if you were a...first of all there was a...a...uh...order out that every humanbeing...every male person at the age of 12 or 13 has to work.
So this is personally my -- my feeling  but I have the highest regard for the museums work.
A nd he was -- he was the one who was called up USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 6 to go to one of those work camps in -- in -- in Germany.
We were given a loaf of bread  a pound of bread probably  a week.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 30 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: was glad to accept it.
Albert's work took him from France to Cameroon in Africa  to Morocco  and then eventually to the United States.
He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he with his family that you see you could get out of the if you uh had a place of work  if you had some working permit and uh that you can put  get out to...and uh he had two sisters and they had two sewing machines and they were willing to put one in a shop to secure a place for me  which was an incredible sacrifice.
I cannot  confront him; and  and I was just worried that what am I going to do when  when he comes  back to this place to work.
Some people that went to work were lined up at the gate.
Uh uh we observed the holy days certainly uh and uh especially during the holy days we saw the families and and friends and then uh my father and after the war as a veteran became active in the Jewish War Ve terans uh uh movement  also doing social work for needy uh veterans and my mother  blessed me mory  joined the auxilia ries there and so we all...and my sister certainly was al so active  so we were all active in in one kind of Jewish affairs or the other  but there was one day or one evening when all this...when when we assembled around the uh the uh family table and that was Friday evening.
But other people who were unable and who had to work these hard  you know  labors just couldnt possible survive more than two  three months  and those who were emaciated were called Muslim man and the were - they lost all will to life and they walked you know like in a daze and you could - with one finger you could push them and they fell over and never got up.
Do you remember some of the other projects that youre that you had to work at?
Went in the field work  had a shoot out occasionally with some people who were robbing and stealing.
So I left that job and I we -- I went to work in New York.
You didn't want to get sick because if you got sick and you couldn't work  they had every months transported  transports that picked you up and you were gone and never heard of again.
He -- she -- she said  ﬁWhos Uncle Sam?ﬂ ﬁWell ﬂ I said  ﬁhes the guy I work for.ﬂ And then she said  in getting more serious  she said  ﬁIf youre a citizen  are you willing to pay taxes?ﬂ I thought it was a stupid thing  I said  ﬁYes  off course.ﬂ I said  ﬁNot be willing to pay taxes  I dont think I can get to see.
Were they people in -- in the -- that lived in the neighborhood  were th -- with work?
The German would ge t hold of that one with the four parts  so we could never use that machine gun  and that  everythi ng was like this  I mean it was  it was really  it was pathetic  you know  when you  when you realize what  what really happened and how badly organized we were  but we did a tremendous amount of work.
Yes  my -- I grew up the religious family  but that was a way of life back home  my dad  we didn't work on Saturday  went to synagogue  my mother would prepare all the foods on Friday.
But I said  \ You just\  she should just do what I ask  because it worked once and I hope it will work again.
Without him  we could not stay and continue to be in Horinc; because we would be we  were stateless  so what he did is he used to send his dental work to Nyiregyhaza which was a big city in  deep in Hungary.
>> Bill Benson: Just Faige and you left in the camp.
And then I was on -- in the -- in the countryside for a week  and then back to work.
Somebody had to go to work  and somebody had to stay home.
We are living the territory and the Germans supposed to come here.
And then in my dance class -- I went after work to a dance class -- I met a fellow named and he had a friend who he told me could get me false papers.
But again  we had people who were working for us who didn' t come out of the social work field at all; teachers  for exam ple.
I dont want to get too technical about what that work is.
So  he went from one to another  from one place to another and people really stopped pray except the old people or what the kids and went to the work.
And she turned around to me and said  ﬁYou are going to work here with me.ﬂ I stay ed in the kitchen with her.
You have to get a piece of bread  you have to work.
And did you work can you tell us anything about the correspondents you worked or not the correspondents  but did you work w ith anyone in particular for colleagues?
And I couldn't work anymore  and I couldn't get up anymore.
They told them that they were going to a nice place  secluded  and you will be able to work until the end the war.
And when I got there  we ll  we had to work in the concentration camp  we had to open graves  pull out gold teeth and the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners  German prisoners and they were completely out of control.
For instance theres some Austrians who work there in lieu of their military service.
There were a lot of Jewish Polish families living there in Zaremby Koscielne  and she went to look for work  whatever.
A few days we ate there and then  you know  we couldn't eat it.
I recently listened to Malas Symphony  and I enjoyed it  but it was it was hard work to listen.
We work for the Germans in a camp  and we run away and we are going back home.\
The -- the people who used to work there  they were no Hitlers.
So I'm going to...I'm relying on you to he lp me fill in  you know  points that I should be asking or should ask differentl y. I think I'd like to go  if we've  if we've covered this  to go on a little bit to your work in the Hague Agreements  just to mention it and what your role was.
I dont think that any nation can suddenly say were going to have an international trial and -- and se t it up -- it wont work -- it -- Do you think there should be a permanent international tribunal?
And they were usually either in the maids  or couples  man and wife would go work for some [indecipherable] family  and he would do the yardwork  and she would do the home cleaning.
Work  co ming home  trying to -- after we came home we lined up and got our soup.
There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they dropped dead and they send us more and more a nd more people.. I was in the lager 4 which was I was in lager 11 which was   and we work on Commander Morris.
And I told him whenever he retired  I says  but one thing about Dad  why  none of your sons are gonna work as long as you did at one job  beca use we were all too old for  you know  to get started on it.
Well  we got to the office  everyone was called in individually to this offi -- to the office  and declared what you goin -- what you expect to be  you know  you gonna get a citizen  you gonna become 58 citizen  and you can go to work  you can work or we will get you work  well -- you wanted the governments protection.
The deception was  first of all they came there  there somebody came and told them that they go to umlois  which in German that means to  uh  uh  no  disinfect  disinfect their clothes  and to go to work  and uh  they have these baths they have because it goes --------------  some thickness around  so they kept in  and also what they did is when people came like from Holland  they gave them postcards and to write back to their house that they arrived here  and it is nice  and they go to work here  to see these  and the people that didn't come yet  when they get a note like that  so they had a hope they come to work here.
The policy was that for -- to interview these youngsters and see what their future plans are  and send them to units where they could begin into that line of work.
And that was tho-tho-those guards were to protect us from wi di from  you know  getting advantage from us  but didnt work much.
We are not getting any more food  its already three or four days  were not getting no food  we didnt go to work no place.
And my mother said  We can't stay there all the time; we have to do something  go to work or find An d that same day -- we came back on a Sunday.
Some of them they didn't want to have the sin on their own conscious because he has to work on Saturday.
Those that did the dirty work  from rounding up Jews and certainly those who did the killing  there was no indication of any touch of sympat hy for the victims.
You have opportunities in this country  and if you are willing to work hard  you can do things.
After the initial uh impact of having uh entered the camp  we began more orderly performance of our duties and uh uh in my case we uh some of us were debriefing the inmates as to uh their experience  what...how they were treated  under what circumstances they did this or that  whatever the case might have been  whether it was work  whether it was uh uh food  whatever.
16 Did your mother work  continue to work after she got married?
We started to teach people how to ride on tractors  how to do 52 farm work  while we provided this farm work for free.
Then  at these cons truction firms  since they did a fair amount of their work in the naval port  one -- they -- some of them actually saw the executions.
What -- you know  what kind of work you were involved in  cause I know they -- they were trying to accomplish a lot and also what -- what credentials you had or what experience you had for the kind of work that you would be doing?
At a point I asked him  \ Listen I will work for you  but you must pay me every day.\
So they keep coming to the ghettos to whatever  people they could get to work in the factory.
This was a German  and they felt  they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews.
I knew -- by that time I knew how to work the land  how to milk a cow  how to raise crops  but after the first year my father started dealing in cows.
They had to be fingerprinted  they had to give me a picture  and at the same time that work was a front for intelligence work that I wa s continuing to do.
I eventually went to work [indecipherable] to make some mone y  go to Israel.
I didnt know him as well as Singer because he worked in the office  but I didnt work for him.
I had leave and when I got back to work  I was assigned a well  I was told that I had a choice of assignments  but my my first as-assignment would have been with the new office that I had originally pr created in that the inspection report that Id written.
And I was with other people finding out after a while that they were the ones who were supposed to go to work eventually  and uh  that was the reason they looked comparatively young  I wasn't young at all.
There was a German American who lived in Munich who did all of the work so we found out about it and hooked on to them.
And that was our outlet  you were as king me whether we had ---this was our outlet  to get a pencil and paper and write or  you know  number work.
Only place I started to work a little bit was in...in Buchenwald.
So I was beaten back  beaten from the work back to the camp which was about a good kilometer.
He had his staff work on all the applications whic h were necessary so that these war orphans  war widows  and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various government offices for the support to which they were entitled.
So the firm that he was work ing in  which was tell me again  it was First Galena Samochodowa .
I think that they had so me -- some form in the -- in the main offices  in the SS  I said -- because I remember when -- when the other Rapportfuehrerin told me  go there to the -- to Lagerfuehrerin and say that the telephone doesnt work.
Food was  again  only a piece of bread in the morning.
Now  in the ghetto  they bring us back in the ghetto yeah  but what happened?
And I worked there and learned I would never again work for a physician in my entire life  that theyre total pho nies and what not.
It was me who directed them what to do and how -- like for instance  when I had to go to work  this mother  the Germans looked up and mother got old very suddenly in the ghetto.
And do all the dirty work or what they had to do.
But things seemed to have moved along where people mustering every morning to go out to work brigades and coming back at night or working at the workshop where my father uh subsequent- ly--my brother subsequently worked.
Plus we had to march in all kinds of weather to and from work.
And  so we didnt have to move  but my father my father work ed I said in wholesale  retail/wholesale  and they called themselves grinszpan.
The Polaks could say I don't want to work for you  what are you going to do to me.
And then the other important parts of this square: where did your mother work?
There were some of my friends were taken to work in...they called it the .
I  all my career both in the United Nations and teaching has been on how do systems work.
My job basically  if– had I stayed  the office  the lawyers who worked with me and for me as Chief of the Criminal Section– after  the way those thi ngs would work is that when the FBI goes through its investigation and prepares a report  those are usually turned over to the United States Attorney for prosecution or for determination of whether a crime has been committed.
Her husband was a physician  children doctor...took this little girl in this box and covered her with the heads she should survive the  you know  the Germans what they came in to watch us work.
After that they grabbe d me again to go to work  and we went to work on the de-- on the railroad depot of Ja nowska street.
The next morning  I went off with my friend to go to look for work and I was captured.
I ha ve to do something  I have to tell you thank you.
and you had a sense of -- Yes  yes  yes. --
We had no business being seen together.ﬂ USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 121 Because she looked very Jewish and she said  ﬁWe had no --ﬂ she was not on our underground network  she was doing some ot her kind of work.
Before that death camp  when we were sent out to work  they made contact  somehow.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 25 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: yes.
>> Bill Benson: Before long  they made you do very hard labor.
And as we are standing there along this  on this road  what was left of us after the sorting and the selection  as I said  there may have been  can't possibly tell the right figure  I mean it may have been 60  it may have been 80  it may have been 100 that was left all the work  all the men capable of work and many of us were kids like my age and my brother's and suddenly  out of nowhere  SS appeared in helmets and with submachine guns on both side of our column and one of them goes towards my brother  how old are you?
How come did you get an offer to work in Japan?
I will have a choice of where I wanted to go to work tin Germany which I thought was a good idea.
Jewish people  they are ready to work  they are resourceful and they dont sit and wait for manna from heaven to fall.
That's the time I was working for the Hungarians and we took the train so we were working in the railroad but the railroad we took all the tracks off and we send them into Hungary so there was a few children  three or four children we were working and that was the uniform I was wearing at that time when I did the work over there.
Th ey they had no choice  and I didnt want to leave  so they left me the way it was  and the exemp exemption to do something like this  to work for the boss  and to work for the union.
I used to go from high school  from Jefferson High School  on the s ubway an hour and a half to go to ORT to work and back  after school.
The people who come to wor k. They brought people to work  to bury the people.
But the other oberfuhrer 18   he was interested first that the work is running and secondly that organize the valuables which he always wanted valuables. ( )
Did he work in precious metals  such as silver and gold?
>> Bill Benso n: So Mr. Dudek and the other S traw M en  they get the job but then they would basically sub it out for a whole lot less money  no doubt  to actually do the work.
I would work in the lumber yard as a laborer there  and then  my wife with the baby would be there  I would took a room  and --from a peasant -- p -- the pe -- the Polish peasants  the tiny little room  you know  with the w -- iron stove -- st ove with the pipe  and it -- one bed.
Bring one to work one day so I took th is tin of bully beef to the works and he borrowed some bikes and three of us and Beaver went done to his cottage and he made us a big stew. [
I mean he would do his work an d liked his work in a very exacting way.
01:25:30 Now if you had to live on that  you couldn't really live there; but because we work with this  clothes  separating the clothes and the people came -- they always brought with them -- you saw -- they couldn't take much with them  the people what got sent on the transport.
Little -- we were about 20 of us  and we used to go out to work every day  and then come in.
Because I can only say I c ould not have done all this work alone.
Yeah  this was  and then they put us in a ghetto in Helm when they make the ghetto.
So after I didn't have to work anymore in Shiltz office  I start to en list with to somehow finish my education in the business administration and I met a Valerie.
We tried to believe that they came to work but we never heard from them anymore.
And so I spent a year in New York  and then I was called back to Cleveland by the Jewish Welfare Society  offering me a job of training volunteers to do Big Sister work.
She -- She -- She did work here  also  as an -- as an accoun -- as an accountant for America National Bank  even.
The Nether lands start mobilizing and I thought that since I am a ta ilor and most of the people in the private market  they started to work in the black market be cause a lot of things--imports were fo rbidden.
Now  for reasons which I don't recall  I went to work but my brother stayed home  and also my wife stayed home at the time  and they made my wife and my brother to carry out my mother to the bus.
til 64  it was the big time of my international work.
And did you ever receive any compensati on from Germany for the work you did?
In our house the German language was one of the languages spoken  because my father used to work with German companies  and after Hitler came he changed a little and went to other companies in England.
And in the morning when they would come back  we would give them the bed.
Makusha ran the I.R.C. office in Munich  and they did a lot of rescue work.
Once you got to a certain age  you had to work in war effort kind of things.
It's hard to adapt and I once again went to start afre sh and to find work.
you and your family  that you didnt think of leaving the No  because I felt that I was strong enough  and my brothers  that we could take care of the families  as far as work is concerned.
I don't know where to work  where they went to work  to Warsaw ?
And I would do that in the -- in the store  in the office. [
I was the only one to work in a printing place.
I mean  when I went by subway to -- to work  I only saw the burned out -- the big synagogue burned out for [indecipherable] see  theres an EL there  going past there.
By the way  I did a lot of volunteer work while the kids were in school.
As a matter of fact  looking back I realize how little time there was because uh very soon an order came that we had to go and work in uh in a shop  sort of factory thing sewing garments in a place called .
You will work  and that's it.ﬂ You know  it was a lie  what you cannot...you cannot believe in that.
And were your parents active in Jewish community affairs that you knew of?
Okay  I want to get in there to Warsaw ghetto  th e only way I could get in there is with a group of people who went out to work for the Germans  they used to take uh Jewish people every day outside the ghetto to work.
And came to my group  and ordered me to go back into the work group.
I was always trying to keep them safe  which doesn't work.
And there was one that got the paper every morning  and in it we saw that where I used to work went up in flames.
And when I came out  usually I had a bus  but sometimes  you know  I had to work til 10:30 or til 11:00 because you cant leave a b -- a hospital without somebody else being in the lab.
My mother  at that time was not very active in doing art but she did some commercial work  some paintings.
Tell me about what they both did  your parents  i-in their work  as much as you know.
So  I don't know how I persuaded my father to let me do it  because he didn't think something like that I should go work in a factory  after all  but I said  \  I am not going to go there.\
And so we lived with in the in the camp with this and we were taken to a labor camp  to a labor to a factory to work.
So  the work was heavy  but it wasnt forced labor  like I said.
I went to the pottery to  to draw people at their work and then I noticed that they were doing big uh containers and I decided that in a big container  my pictures would be well protected when I put them into the ground.
W-Work detail -- work detail office  not work -- Well wait a minute  but when you spoke to me before -- Ah yeah  [indecipherable] no  no -- But you distinguished between arbide zychen  and arbides deenst.
The next day I just crawled out and was back on the job.
I recall distinctly being in the barracks  nobody went out to work anyplace and ev entually after many hours  Schindler arrived back from that appearance before some authorities in a total drunk state.
And he involved me in the work  and he -- he is -- he became the chairman of their human rights committee  and made me a member of the -- of the committee.
There was some talk that this resettlement for work  which was taken out -----------------into other areas to do...hard labor  but nobody really knew up to that point that there was going to be killing people.
That was in the -- that way  but we had to work very hard  then we got food there.
I went to work carrying the bags of a jewelry salesman.
I went to work  I was a lathe -- lathe operator  worked a little here  a little there  you know  what do you want  you were 13 or 14 or 15 years old  you know.
And then I noticed that they would single out especially well dressed women t o...uh...do menial jobs  clean out lavatories and work on the streets.
Like they send them to work  theyll finish the work  theyll be back.
And after three months af when he said this I moved back to Jerusalem   and I I had several I mean  I went from like a year I worked for a s a publishing company doing graphic work.
And I ended up handling grants  and I kept screaming  ﬁI trained to be a secretary  not a bookkeeper.ﬂ Finally got the stuff on the computer  and it was dou ble work  because the computer did not communicate with the accounting department of Case Western Reserve University.
Then later I went to New York and had a position with the National Refugee Service  where I led a division for social and cultural adjustment  and at the same time studied social work at the New York School of Social Work  and got my diplom Then war broke out  and I decided I had to do something about it.
Their recent work in the German laboratory led to a breakthrough in the processing of faded documents and this is now the subject of three U.S. patents and one international patent.
She was sick  but my father was getting out to work and my sister was working and the children...I was then 12 years old...13  12...I was working in a shoe factory.
So there were inevitable  and there always are  I think  tensions  even in organizations today  which are well known  where the base is held perhaps here  and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the world.
But they had run away a few days earlier because they'd been going to work  to the field  to work with the Germans.
If you had a friend who was a Christian  he or she could take out a license to do business and under that license the Jewish person would work as a worker for th at person.
But I said  \ I would rather do the counting out  the Lager office work.
So they say  a new sc hool of social work is opening up in Adell-fy ( ph) and the Dean was with honor in Au stria and he wants to give a Jewish scholarship to a displaced person.
Q. I think you should A. See  because everybody took this differently but most of the people who went through it they either take it with a smile and say hey I'm going to work and I make a life out of it  like I did.
They coming for short time  you know  like those guys don't want to work on a farm or do some something wrong  you know  and they give them for the...the y give them for the few...ja il for the few days.
Interview with Michael Lin February 27  2000 68 When I left the army  I didn't go -- want to go to work right away  so I went to technical school.
I dont think so  because of my continued work on this subject.
He started to work by a relative of ours  shoemaker  which he was a good one.
I work a half a day at the muse um on the floor and it gives me a chance to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 81 interact with the public and other volunteers and thats a great experience.
In the morning  we just went to work in the kitchen.
Because if you don't get enough nourishment and all you do is work.... Unfortunately I was in my growing stages and that's why I have so ma ny hang ups right now  I think.
But then the German found out where the parents were hiding the children.
But I met him  perhaps se veral times  when he came to town and was speaking and again everything -- people to follow him and to leave and be -- to accept the fact that theyre going to be shipped to Germany  a nd convincing -- trying to convince people that that is -- that they will surv ive  they will have -- they will work under completely different conditions  that they -- they will not die out of hu nger or disease.
And she was very much influenced by her maternal uncle who was one of the leading architects of the A rt Nou veau style that was very fashionable in Hungary  so she did a lot of decorative work.
He said you know you shouldnt have told him this and he fired and I was punished to be sent to very heavy work and  and the SS told him that I  th at he should watch me that the heaviest possible work would be assigned to me.
I wanted to sh ow you [speaks foreign language here] [speaks foreign language here] I: He has history  I'm trying  wa nted to prove you and to show you that I'm trying to condense historic write ups and work into   into simple diag rams.
Because  with the exception of very few Jews  most Jews were not part of the landed type of work so that owning businesses and professions is what they were engaged in.
We couldnt believe theyre going to -- ready to kill the Jews.
But that was for being in an American serving in the Flying Tigers and in the 14th Air Force and doing my work in China.
And what was the name of the pr ison that was near your fathers work?
He does a lot of work with the ozone in the air.
That's famous for steel work  so they worked at that time of the war  they built airplanes there.
That respect us  that support the work that we do and this is very important.
And what I started to realize is that th e work we were doing at that time was not usual work.
And I rented the place by a lady and and she told me oh  she can work for me.
I guess what Im trying to get a sense of  was there something about your family life  certain values you grew up with that in some way prepared you or motivated you later on to do the sort of work you did?
She also tried to offer ourselves as Poles to go to work in Germany because  you know  she felt that the Polish people recognized Jews much easier than the Germans but they didn't take us because my sister was too young.
And -- Your family worked on -- There was nothing to work  there are no jobs for us.
So we did a lot of work on that when suddenly s -- al l around the Great Lakes  a large die off of seagulls were washed off o -- on the shore.
What did he do in Boston   what was his work?
Probably German wanted to have also their money  or something like that.\
Then I got back to work for the American army and this like this.
Maybe I was a little more selfish  or a little more thinking of whats going to work whats going to work for me.
I still -- I still work there  you know  not -- not from nine to five  but f-from -- Where is it?
And that  in part they may have done it anyway but your mother knew that that was somehow– might  might work that th ey might get attached if they– I dont think that– No?
This went on in that place  this went on in that part and we all went to work till they didnt pay us.
Well  I -- I-I -- there was no hope of emigrated through Israel  there was no hope  so I went to the -- to the directorate of -- to the -- and I had a-an idea  because it was autumn  the end i -- they want men  but they didnt want women because I su -- I suggested to the Hanhalla that the -- the dir-directorate -- because they would [indecipherabl e] allow [indecipherable] to take -- take our 38 girlfriends without -- without their having work  because they agr eed to do it  there was the only Haktarah because they to -- they agreed to th is  because I found the three -- three comrades who had ra -- women  because one was married  one.
You know  somebody could bring a paper back to camp or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had  but uh  we were able to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away and so we were sort of informed.
who do volunteer work  like speaking and helping the children and teaching children and doing li working with homeless and so on.
Nazis took my wife  her sist er and brother to Germany for slave work.
They want to bring -- they found each other  they want to bring up a safe on first floor  on the second floor  all that kind of work.
Well  since I was working half time at the Jewish Social Service  actually I would go -- I would work one evening for him  and I would s ee four or five people  once a week.
After twelve hours  they took us  not to work  just to Birkenau  to a block.
And after 1933  in particularly  after 1934  when my father's partner which was his brot her had a stroke and could no longer work  my father remained with two companies which stayed with him until they could no longer employ him  due to Nazi legislation.
Then we were supposed to make our way to the railway station to go to Berlin on the train.
No you did your four years in Seattle and then Ok  then I went to work for a year.
The only work that were do -- the only work we had to do was carrying big stones from one of the camp to the other side.
And th-there was a hand laundry  you know  they had kettles there  and they boiled the laundry and they scrubbed the laundry  we did too.
WZ: And what kind of work th ese judges did as lawyers  what their backgrounds were.
Oh  the conditions  oh  I'm telling you  you have t o  I had a person that was very close  and she got sick  and she went to the \ Krankenstube \  to the sickroom  and we never saw her anymore.
Anyway  he said  ﬁIt will not work  but we have to show that some people cared.ﬂ And I knew then that he did not count himself above this err -- among the survivors.
They killed them to show them that you must go to work  its no holidays.
This way  he used to come every other day back to our work and we did the same thing.
We were made to do kitchen work which was unusual in a tropical country at that time because...not that there was anything wrong with doing kitchen work  but at that point the Governor made us do it because it was degrading.
So little by little we started training centers  but that was all middle class  for middle class because it was quite expensive and and mothers began to go to work  or they are forced  they didnt have husbands  they had died in the war  whatever.
And Buchenwald I mean as horrible as Auschwitz was but I was on the farm  so that wasn't quite so bad.
So they said  on person was sitting  like a heavy man  he said  \ I have all of this work  I can't give you no other one  I don't have it\ .
They fixed my leg up and I went back to work in about a month.
Now uh then one evening when I was doing this work  the man who was in charge of that relief operation came to me and said  listen  I have just received a call from the head of the uh central organization of Jews...the name was the of Jews from Germany  which means the representative of the rights of Jews in Germany...his name was Otto Hirsch .
Yes  in trouble  because not that he cannot there there were no work.
That's how the underground was able to communicate and work together.
I could work there three afternoons a week and I would  they gave me a scholarship of 150 dollars which in those days was something.
He had one in his hand and I had one in my hand.
And one day  I must tell you  when we came  so we told to this  there was prisoners  Polish prisoners  who 16 had division of the barrack where you should work  yes  so we came and told we are sloshers   here  we are blacksmiths  .
I found out that there's other people...there're work outside on the plant.
This was the most intense academic work I had ever gone through.
So  to come back to about my story  when I -- so I  as I say we still were able to work at the farmer  till one day all they came the restrictions Jews couldn't work at farmers.
And a lot of Americans have gone there to work  young people  too.
Did they live in Auschwitz too and then come there from the morning to work?
One tiger was in work -- good working condition  the ‚nother was defected  because he has a fuel -- if I remember exactly  fuel pump was defective  because I was mechanic that I was interesting what is going on.
I don't know now  it's too long ago  whether it was  probably a both combina tion of him and the Jewish hospital in Hamburg  somehow a combination  I d on't know how they work ed together and he came out.
At that tim e however  I was working for a company that was important for the war effort and they [indecipherable] want to rele ase me  so for six months I was not released  but after six months I was -- the position was still held for me and thats how I got to work in the Czech government.
13 Did you think you were going to work somewhere else?
So I went with the others to work in the coal mine.
Comparing with ghetto  it was ba d. Comparing to the other concentration camp  it was not so bad  you know?
But to the French melise   especially  that was the French collaboranai  colab...borationist uhhh–.paramilitary work that was under the Vichy  and they did the dirty work for the Gestapo  in fact.
And people were put to work digging ditches to defend themselves against -- the Germans against the Russians.
But there they showed the concentration camps and things like that.
And just when the ghetto was formed  this was part of the ghetto.
And then I started to work at the YIVO  29  you know  because of the director of the YIVO.
Immigrants weren't allowed to work and my mother was so proud that there were kitchens that you could eat free food  so she went a couple times and when she got to know that this was charity she was starving to death and she wouldn't go.
And she said  \ You are going to work inside and help me and scrub the floor .\
An d they start to organize groups to go out for work on some places where the soldiers are  on gardens  on some plants  on some -- somewhere to work and people went out -- some were work ing inside the ghetto from the very beginning.
I was with the Anti-Trust Division probably  maybe a month or two a nd then I went to work for the Civil Rights Division.
And he lived on the same floor as...in Antwerp where an uncle of mi ne lived who had escaped to Spain and he stayed in Madrid because they asked him to work for the Dutch consulate there.
I got in the little town  there was a little village.
In the morning  everybody has a little job  something to do.
So  they got on their feet  and no sooner Hania returned back to work  and everything was well  I came back to Majo wka  and my father took sick.
We got to work  and we also had a pla ce where to sleep.
Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 45 It well  when when we were started to work after  when we got back to Germany  in the end of 1945.
We had our Saturdays all the time  everything was closed by us  we didn't cook  we didn't clean  we didn't work all day  we didn't do nothing  this was a quiet day.
And some of the children started to work and took the stones and brought them to the other side and other children knew that they were in concentration camps.
On Interview with Esther Fol November 8  2008 20the side I did a little Hebrew teaching  I was not allowed to work  but I did on the side  teaching Hebrew.
But after the war  when he gave me a proposition  he said you know what  I mean what is that  you work in the soup kitchen.
I said to him  \ Mr. [Stank ]  if you don't mind  we have a lot of labor here which have no work.\
Tell me about the work you did and how involved he was in  in any sabotage.
Because seeing that effort work and flourish in the small to wn of Gastonia gave me some real thought  idea about the fact that we can do it here.
Maybe you can say the name one more time  but also a little bit more about the work that you do.
And I didnt like that kind of physical work  so I made it my business to get into the office within a week.
And a lot of places even the owner was Jewish  he said all his employees are non-Jews  and they dont think it will work out.
And I started to work as a bookkeeper  you know  cut my teeth on this.
Can you describe for me some of the different kinds of camps that existed.
We had to work in on fields  make a gardens and be physi cally strong.
You know  that my work for him let hi m go furth further and further  you know.
And then Monday when I came home from work the phone rang and my daught er answered the phone  sh -- she says  its for you.
All he need is the four years of practice  and then he can work Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 122 he can treat me.
He was upset and anyway  so he  the cousin  had to go to work  he left us in the room.
We had to work in the fields to clean the fields from debris and planted potatoes  etc.
--------Was a lot of Jewish people went to work for these factories  and they had places there  they lived there  they slept there  matter of fact  a lot of them  till the Ru ssian came into Poland  I think a lot of them were safe  there was just like  Pietkov was very lucky by having those 3 places where people worked there.
It wasn 't Geneva Convention  they were entitled to work but different procedure.
And my friend  Nick Flannery  who had done th e Carroll County case with me  a wonderful lawyer  who  when he left the Division went to work for  in Boston with the Center for Law and Education  which was the legal services support center for education cases.
But we were standing there in the inside the barbed wire and we looked out and there was another guy and I. It was a Sunday because on Sunday we didn't have to work.
The adults had to register for work  and the children had to register for school.
A few day  I lined myself up to go to work.
Even the gentiles  they're obliged to learn Spanish because they couldn't work in Solanika.
I was thinking maybe he was taken to work  maybe he was killed in the same day  I didn't know anything.
Q. Were they able to find this type of work in the United States in 1936?
And she said  ﬁLook [indecipherable] let your mother go  because if she comes with you  theyll make he r work hard  like you.ﬂ Mm-hm.
And they said they were going to go to work  and sit around a campfire at night.
So wh -- when -- the German spies  so when the Germans were ready to invade Poland  it fell like a ripe apple  because all this underground work had been done by the spies.
Wa s a very difficult job because was in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 55July  its 1968  very hot summer and I work ing on this building  remove this old broken pieces  and come the police.
I will work here for you on two machines.ﬂ Later on she married my uncle because she said she liked me so much  she wanted to be in the family.
He was a good speaker  you know  telling how much he cares  telling how much work he puts in -- into survival  and do the best for the population  and we should believe him and trust him.
I'm going to speak to some of the other farmers you helped in the past.
So  I registered again as a welder  and that raised my hopes that if I had a chance to work as a welder  I might have a chance to survive.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
No  to work at night in order to go in the daytime to school.
A monk escaped from the back wh ile the gestapo was in the front and was able to warn Father Bruno who kept a small apartment to do his work in Brussels.
Now  when did you get the medals for your work in the resistance?
She told me she would spend all day assembling one radio tube  which was the work that she was doing there  and at the end of the day she would disassemble the radio tube  put it in a drawer  and then start the process all over again the following day.
I work with psychiatrist  who gives me manuscripts about post-traumatic stress and so on.
You go to work  boy meets girls  you know you don't have much to live.
At this time we already had some money from working  many hours of very hard work  but we worked and we had some money.
And th -- they stayed in Vinnitsa  and when we moved in -- in 1946  we -- we moved from Brailov to Vinnitsa  b ecause my father had another assignment for -- for work.
The commandos  potato commandos  in that commando and -- they find work for you to do.
Only on Sunday  so Sunday we used to work  we used to do things in the house to help the parents  to help do things.
I personally think they have it too God damn good  they should go out to work better.
We had to work in the night and in the morning  of course  attack came.
Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942  the universities were closed  and I couldnt go on  and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens.
One of the Ukrainians recognized him because he used to work -- my father was like a supervisor in a factory there in Lemberg and he recognized him and he said to his friends  he says  hes a good guy  let him go.
I mean all the Jews  mostly tradesmen used to work there for th e SS sonderval   they used to call that.
We had to work double to help them to to survive.
A middle fever  you could go to work maybe or not.
Then  I worked at the Hebrew Academy with the lunch program for over 10 years  plus doing other volunteering work in different places.
I was just trying to figure it out in relationship to the work that you were doing.
Yes  they were very affectionate; yes they were strict as far as school work is concerned  as far as manners were concerned  as far as - Did you like school?
Thank you very much for sharing your story with the Holocaust Museum.
When we got a loaf of bread  it was like about this size  a square loaf.
Thats something you earn a living  you accept the people who work with you.
I work in the kitchen when this maid was back from vacation.
Did your mother work or did she stay at home the whole time?
So they want me to go first there and fix the TV  and it was lunchtime  so I said  ﬁI get there  I gonna make him fix me lunch.ﬂ And -- and -- and the girl in the office say  ﬁYou cant eat at a niggers.ﬂ So I say  ﬁEvery restaurant you go  theyre work in the kitchen.
He send me to a place where to work  and we have to work putting holes in the wall  like you know  thos e stone walls.
So I really pay attention and thanks God by gosh  somehow I I did my work the best and I fini shed some of those stones most of them on time  getting better and better and I become professional stone cutter  and that's probably was one reason...as a good stone cutter  you know  as a low number...1623  those kapos they somehow somehow they they like you  you know.
We didn't have to do any work so I bought a Playboy Magazine with an interview with Michael Nichols.
Considering the situation we didn't have to work the health was pretty good.
What was the -- was there an advantage to work ing outside of the ghetto instead of inside the ghetto?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 59 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: I don't know from several countries.
And many of the wives of the peopl e who were there on internship  did some work at night.
I didnt know why you had to go to work if you had hous ehold help at home  and you have money  why?
And yet and yet  as you descri be  it sounds like quite important  not just work.
Was there ever any talk between Rum-cof-sk i or just other heads of departments questioning or thinking about phi losophy and moral aspects of the work and the ch oosing and...?
So got a few dollars that time  for so I went to work for him  he was someplace in in Brooklyn  and you had go travel from New York to Brooklyn  if you dont know you you know  you dont know your way  you dont know the language.
He said  youre not supposed to work on Shabbat  not you and not Daddy.
name was Klein  was extremely kind people  very understanding  and I liked to work for them.
We can work as slave labors  but not in their private homes .
So she said her name and I said  we have here a relative  who work there and there and there.
Used to come from work  go shopping  to prepare and cook.
When you were growing up  what did your father do for a living and your mother  what was she doing?
I work from when I was 12 until I was 18 and I was born in '06  so it must have been in '25.
>> Bill Benson : What was the labor that you were forced to do?
And he want  he didn't want  they wanted him to work in the Library of Congress  he didn't want  he finished English and French  Hebrew.
So  I was proud of that and later on when I had to go into hiding in the north  I had to abandon all that work I did in the south  I told the director of the seminary  I said I have to confess something.
52 Yes  well then  I mean  this is something you get in all -- with most survivors and something that you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my present day work.
Not humanitarianly-wise  but to insure the fact they could do the work they were going to do  huh.
But when I worked in a separate group  Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group .
And we used to work in the ba r barracks  you know  there was okay  here here how what Auschwitz was.
We were very shortly put to work outside the camp  carrying very heavy stones.
I went to work to the camp and I took my father with me --we were working with bridges for a German company --Langert was their name.
I learned to work with the tractors at that time  and then we  with a hundred other Hungarian  young Hungarian youth  most of them from my old organization from Hungary  we received land near the Jordanian border by a town called Afula and started our ow n settlement.
Because if they know  the Russians would  a few weeks later  two or three weeks later  the Russians came and took us to Russia.
So  you know  when I work in ge -- in Germany  in the machinery place  I was a prisoner  but everything has to be  like 30 minutes before quitting we had clean the machines  and I -- I came in here  and its the biggest mess I every seen in my life.
And he asked me... we conversed in German  since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German than English and he said  ﬁHow do you like my shop?ﬂ And I said  ﬁWhat a nice  nice  cute place.ﬂ He said  ﬁWould you like to work for me?
Of course there was nothing in it and I asked everybody if they came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at everybody who marched out to work.
I was not a dumbbell  I didnt have to wo rk very hard and I brought home As and Bs  without any sweat.
So that gave them also -- people that he would call to be in this choir   it would give them a few hours of respite from really  really hard work.
And...then uh  in the beginning of 44  they said they need people to work in Germany in factorie s  and whoever wants to go out of the ghetto can go.
No gray hairs yet but if this work keeps on uh  there will be. (
I had two bedrooms  and I was so happy  and I was planning to go to work because I couldn't  then my daughter went to school and I was planning to go to work.
And and she was a registered nurse  and of course  during the in Poland she didnt work  because my father is an officer  made very good salary.
Well  they came  in Auschwitz you mean to go to work  they came  I have to mention one more thing before I get to that.
Well anyway when the gestapo then would jump out of these wagons and go into a building all they had to do was ask for documents and they were able to pick the Jews out and bring them in.
When I was 15  I was allowed to go to work.
In 72 I came to Washington to go to Georgetown to work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe.
This is tape number one  side B. Lets go back a little bit in time  back to Lienzingen  Id like to get a little more information about that work camp.
We are ready to do any work which helps the whole community.
The German guards would form two lines: One line with the young people who could work  and the other line with the elderly or people  children who they felt couldn't work.
Then shed get to Manhattan and take it all off and put on some work clothes that she had at the factory.
And I was arriving about nine o'clock in the morning for breakfast.
With soup and a piece of bread every day  work in the coal mine.
They sh ould do the work in a kibbutz  you know.
My mom was only 54  considered too old  I guess  to work.
And then when I went into the kibbutz  the kibbutz pa id part of it.
Well  ne xt day  I was out to work in an underground airport.
I came back in May of '47  was discharge d  and I now had a G.I. Bill  so I promptly went to school  found out that I was still able to sit on a school bench and then went to work for Westinghouse in Buffalo.
You work  you try to buy things on the black market and ma ke do that way.
If somebody was absent and the a mmunition could not you cannot stop this [indecipherable] because everybody was doing his little bit like in a like in a car factory  you know  that you everybody does the same work The assembly line.
I was listening and I told him about the fact that I wanted to go to Palestine and that many of us  even those of us who co me from so-called...uh...homes that were more affluent really wanted to choose this life for ourselves and that I understand where he came from and understand his circumstances that...that many of...of friends of mine  people I know have chosen a life of work on the land  hard work.
Then they start marching and leaving us fairly alone  on our own till they established a headquarters and a Gestapo  They caught to work.
And one of the hospitals in Paris was Hospitale(ph-French) St. Antoinne  and I happened to work in the X-ray Department there.
And uh in Auschwitz itself an incident that uh only many years later I could comprehend what was happening to me when uh the same uh kapo had uh brought one day to uh her barracks and uh during the daytime when everybody was out to work she had uh commandeered a uh a young attractive woman to wash me up and uh talking nicely to me that it's important to be clean and uh that girl carefully washed me and fondled me and then uh that kapo took me uh on her bunk and uh tried to arouse me and uh as a nine year old boy uh lying beside her  on top of her and in any kind of position  whatever she tried uh must have have been futile  futile but uh that was the life in the camp for this poor woman. (
But when you were in Shargarat  did you see people going off to work in the streets?
you just began to talk about you work wi th the museum.
Things would work out somehow  sooner or later there has to be peace.
In other words  that we will be able to help create because  you know  since there are surrogate partisans so we want to be on our side and do our work.
And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in Washington who approached me and said  you know  UNRRA is looking for people to work in their program.
Of course at the time we didn't know it and everything that we could eat  we ate.
And then life still was going the same system like it was and the next day I had to go to work.
I used to work for him for th ree years to learn the trade and I didn't get paid a penny.
And when I returned from there home  I met on the street friend of mine from work -- two men -- and they had -- they selled also from the buildings the  the boards.
I think that the morale  up until this Cold War business  I think that Taylor could inspir e great dedication  hard work and he could rally people to the cause  without any question.
Did your brother try to start to work or was there anything to do?
But after a very short time  a decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a government institution  and my father lost his job.
So she decided to take a chance to apply to the German military camp -- you have the picture there -- for a job because she felt if she had an I.D. card  if they stopped her in the street or anything -- >> Suzy Snyder: She would have proof.
They took us in to the gas chamber...in the gas chamber before they gassed them.
I remember when I spoke for the very first time at a group -- End of Tape Two  Side A Beginning Tape Two  Side B. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 40 This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.
I wasnt a citize n so they said you can work because the N ational Research Council will give you a two year  theyll pay my salary which was not a few dollars  right.
On ly men  not wome n. We figured still  if they want men only it must be for work  but on the other ha nd  everybody to register.
MG: No they didn't because they were always told that they are going to work.
So and so  I heard that you have not gone last week and this week to -- to your assigned work.
When I work on any problem  I do it the same way.
One day we were coming back from work and was standing in the middle of the like a place  a big one  and they made pole to hang somebody and everybody came in and he said halt so everybody had to stand around.
And I want to work and Im very busy at work  and Im very happy at work.
My sister was already away doing work of national importance  and I was told that I had to do this.
break] Okay  before the break  we were talking about the work you were doing when the Germans first arrived  that you were in construction work  that you had to refurbish a school so that it could be a place that the soldiers had to sleep  and so on.
We dont have money.ﬂ So I said  ﬁForget it.ﬂ And then we walked out and I had my jo -- I had a job and this is how I started to work.
>> Bill Benson: Was your sister able to continue her education?
In Terezin  he was assigned to work for th e SS  to take care of their horses  one of the jobs  as a stable boy.
And on e day  they use to send people to work.
Toward the end of our...in  in Holleischen after a few times  you know  taking us to work there they bombed the factory  and  and then they would only take us to move stones and clear rubble.
So many  many years are -- many  many decades after the war  I wrote him a letter  and asked him exactly why he had decided to go to a work camp  and then he wrote back that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure for him.
Missing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week  and trying to make up  whereas the six hours  I mean the five hours that we had were h ard enough  you know  to try then every week  by the time you catch on  there you go  you're missing three or four or five hours of really important work.
And the man told me ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 the same thing.
By the time we got it of course it was cold.
The next day they took us to work to separate the clothes  and we're separating the clothes from these people what were shot.
Because the kapo was higher than he was  you know  and if he wanted me on the -- to work  that was it.
And from time to time there were selections  particularly these prisoners were sent out because they couldn't work but we didn't quite understand why that was.
I learned to work with the tractors at that time  and then we  with a hundred other Hungarian  young Hungarian youth  most of them from my old organization from Hungary  we received land near the Jordanian border by a town called Afula and started our own se ttlement.
I wanted to talk a little bit more about your Red Cross work first.
I think everybody should have civil rights and have th e freedom to do and work in a manner that America was envisioned.
Going to have a shop and the tailors and furriers are going to work for them and I was here.
Some sort of communal house  which again it was  you know  had to be kosher  and -- and it was very nicely organized  and all that  and of course we had to work and keep it clean and all that.
And then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans  he could work for the partisans  or they would allow him to go into an area that was already liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over  they said.
I wrote about that in this essay  the memoir thats at the Holocaust Museum.
With the work that your br other– (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) –its a strange way of putting the question  isnt it?
And she said it's not going to work because they're going to move us again.
I don't remember exactly what t ype of work we did there.
So they would take a number of people out in the morning  bring them back at night.
Of course  not minimizing the work of the people who helped us  all those righteous Gentiles which I will tell you about later on.
In lazaret it was a little better because it was not necessary to work  but they couldn't heal my leg because th ey had no medicine and I was there maybe a few 36 months  when the control always was there.
The combination of exposure; sleeplessne ss; total fatigue from hard work  long marches  and endless hours of standing at the morning and evening rollcalls; very little food and water; lack of medical care; non -existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings  which frequently concluded with the victim being strangled  contributed to a very short life span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners.
And which uncle did you work for af ter school when from Gerolzhofen?
Yes  one like whats growing out here in this And did you you were so young  were you put to work as well?
This didn't work out because 1981 was a very bad year economically both in the United States and in Europe  and since I was in this country before  that was my next choice.
And he worked  you know  whatever work they had to do.
So what did you think  as this young boy  be ing an apprentice  watching the different restrictions being made  and have to wear -- did you -- you have come to work with a Jewish star -- Yeah  yeah.
My wife used to work in a ba kery here  as a clerk  and a lot of times  people would say the same thing.
But this was a -- this was illegal work that he did at the time  right?
If his day came to g o to work  I went for him too.
What  what prompted you to go work in a German military hospital?
And he decided that I was going to work for him.
From my work with survivors in this country  I have seen that they pretty much go to a second -- through a second immigration when they get older.
But I ca n tell you one thing  which I know from my work as on psychology and in the department of Social Services  that I have found that its very difficult  often  not always  to talk to the children  and its easier to talk to grandchildren.
You know  when you started up on a string you  you really don't know how things going to work out.
Since my family was involved in charitable work and donated money to the orphanage  my grandmother decided that I should go to see him and ask him for some help because there was some sort of help.
But no  and -- and then of course  what was happening that the Russians are getting nearer again  so they took us to another camp.
Uh there were dentists among the survivors who would have been glad to go to work on that  but they had nothing with which Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
His father employed him  and he was able to work with his father and live outside the ghetto.
And um it seemed to work both ways that the non Jewish people were looking at us in that neighborhood as newcomers to th at neighborhood and everything was in good shape.
To a better place  to work  you have better facilities to live  and you'll have a better life.
Only in the beginning of the war  there was a -- what you call a razzia   and a -- a German -- German soldiers were going from door to door to find men to work in -- in Germany.
BS--Camera roll 18 is up) (8 mark) SB: So you could get out with a work brigade.
When we went out in the morning to work  then they  through the big chain of guards around on which territories  some prisoners like myself  because I had to go with orders to different parts of the camp.
There was more ability for her to get some sort of work in New York so she moved to New York.
So all the other clerical work had to be done by the prisoners  and the SS relied upon it.
Uh they put  posted all over be calm  go back to work  uh everything be OK.
Now I told you be fore that we worked in Ausc hwitz for the factory was building there  but that we never got a penny from them paid at whatever...that we just uh uh worked in order to keep...to stay alive  but that paid a certa in amount of money  small money 50 to the SS which considered us as and and and had a profit out of our work  so when I saw that statement in in papers sa ying that...and after the war when you had a West Germany and an East Germany  the of uh uh wher e the records had had been lost somehow and they wanted to register the stockholders and cl aims which certain people had against   so they published that statement and there all of a sudden I had a brain-st orm  and I said if they ask for claims to be registered  I think that we also...I also have a cl aim.
Th ere were few uh Albanians  for the most part gypsies because they use...used to use gypsies for th eir heavy work and for carrying and so on.
So big...so it was the anti-semitism that they all was afraid or there was special to the propaganda was so big that Gentile shouldn't work.
Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18  2015 37 Like  I can tell you my sister  when we delivered the work my m other did at home  they waited for us in that little town  Feidenhaus   all the kids waiting us already  and beating us up.
We became sick later  and I he used to work  and he used to help and was [indecipherable] told him  Louis Prowther is his name  he is now an engineer  he lives in Israel .
My father did not work as an artisan  as men that had skills.
First of all  a lot of time they asked for volunteers because they didn't want to work they went there  but they were not commanded to particularly shoot this one or do this one.
I work for the museum  I give money to the museum.
And they told them they're taking  their wives  they're taking them for work.
What was your first encounter with the museum before you went to work there?
Esther's volunteer work at the museum has involved helping to expand the museum's collections of documents  photographs and other items.
A lot of people  uh  tried to just get in to be away and to get some kind of a rest  and to be away from that hard work.
And suddenly all the ways were closed  and some thing seemed to maybe work  and I was the guinea pig  and [indecipherable] really volunteered to find out  and it succeeded for the benefit of them and mine.
And then one day -- And anything significant that you can tell us about the work that you were doing?
And I was everyday  when I went out in the morning from the work  I was running around the streets and look.
The reason I remember seeing it   every day we went to work -- by the way  the work we did  most of us worked on tunnels  building tunnels under this huge mountain.
We were building like concrete blocks  all kinds of concrete--cement  you know.
And as I came to work  I saw my boss and the rest of them.
And then there was another person there  who was in charge of us  and she had been um  a guard in one of the female um jails  and we sometimes had  and the work that we did  um  people who were  who committed some  some sort of misdemeanor or what have you  in jail  came to spend a day working with us.
So he  he has all his life been willing to  to work with me and let me know where he is  I mean thats been the major thing.
So we wont eradicate hatred  but we might work towards eradication of hatred.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 32 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (Camera roll 83  sound roll 49  Take) (21) EL: Yes  can I go on.
Im a little more laid back now than I used to be  but thats the only way I can handle my work load an d my kids.
And she was sewing  sewing  sewing all day just to be able to help my father make a living.
I used to work in the evening from four  four to nine.
Telford Taylor called me on the telephone and he said  ﬁBill  with all the work you've do ne  why don't you stay and help put the case into court?ﬂ And I said  ﬁTelford  I am going home  period .ﬂ So I went hom e  and I brooded all for the rest of the year and finally decided to sit dow n and make my contribution to Nuremberg  in the form of that article in the North Carolina law Journal.
But  I went into a train where the Germans were before.
Well  anyway  he  uh I was in another camp in and then a year later the rumors came  in 1941  1942 I guess  uh this was still the end of 1941  the rumor came that all the Jews are going to be transferred to camps  work camps in Germany  and uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed labor.
My grandparents and the stronger uncles were taken away to work.
At that ti me I didn't know they took us away  after they took us away to work  right aw ay to work  and they people what they took them that didn't took them out to work  they came for de ad.
And then  you know  we were so wrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family  now are we going to tell the children?
No  a little later  you know  to travel  you need you needed money  and so we had to work first to get it.
Well  we were marched off every morning to work somewhere  install trenches and gunnery placements or unl oad barges and do any kind of hard labor.
So this was at the lunchtime  the soup  and the soup was good.
So  I had money because I should never holidays  instead to go like holidays like all the children to spend a nice time I had to work.
Uh  but  uh  railroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people were not strong enough to lift up the rails  and uh  some people got crushed under the rails  and people fell down.
Then one day they called and they said  where anybody wants to volunteer to go work in in the underground factory building  a factory.
And lets see no  this is no  this was quite interesting  to get the to work with the profs and do things  and this is yeah  I mean  the things I said  which is something wa most universities make a big mistake.
But mostly the people were ve ry  very  very pale  or very upset  and ver -- didnt know what to do  get [indecipherable] get -- get lost  you know  a lot of people were left alone because a mother or a brother or a father we nt to work and they were catched up and they were taken away.
And they accosted me  and they ask me if I would be interested to work in the underground.
They beat us so much their ha nds no work any more.
Oh  no  no  I meant working  I meant -- Wor -- we work -- no  no  in -- it was in New York.
He hired the first black in Mississippi to work to manage his story and it was a woman and he gave land to both the Baptist and Methodist churches.
Because if it's not here and I cannot get to work  I have only ten cent s to go home.
Did you when you went to work in the morning  did you leave the ghetto area?
After they settled everybody in the house over there where we lived  they started to choose people for work.
My father used to work with somebody (12) Pharmacy  far away in the country road  we used to go with (130).
So  I'm ready to try to ma ke it work within its existing framework by interpreting the laws and by laying out new rules to make the Security Council a more democratic and fairer institution than it is today  and that is the gist of my thinking and of my new book.
DL] In terms of the makeshift radio in the camp  were you aware of the British having made a makeshift radio? [
They used to catch them  you know  and then to dig ditches or to work at bridges and then sometimes they used to throw them into the river and Russians erected many monuments so they took the Jews to destroy the monuments  and many of them were shot.
and -- but -- but still  I for instance -- people who knew my parents and my mother and knew that I am a -- a -- a orphan  they -- I -- I go t a Jordanschein  which was a paper which like  gives you security that you work and -- and you -- you get -- you like  have some security  but it didnt help.
Verk ah which I was in  did mostly ammunition work  bullets for 50 -calibers and what you call those heavy ammunition for anti -aircraft.
But...uh...little by little  I started to find out that...uh...Vladka is 19 so emerged in that work of th e underground.
So  they gave me a job in the kitchen  and the kitchen was whatever had to be done.
We socialized with the people we employed to work with us  and that most of them were wonderful people.
The women will work in another place  and the...the youngsters will work someplace else.
My mother and my sister were still marched to work every morning.
So  after that he waited for about a year  year and a half and he needed a work certificate to get a job.
One day   the work in that particular place of work to which I was assigned was to rivet parts of the plane  the wings.
I then got work in a small sausage factory which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees.
I wasn't afraid  but I was still...had plenty of fear and there were a whole group of Danish  young men going to out of Canada to do farming  farm work and...uh...I attached myself to them because I spoke the Danish language and I felt they were....The Danes...I owe...I owe the Danes a lot.
I used to do all the hard work  all the hard work.
Didn't want to some of them said wait for  you know  we begged  you know  to not to go to work  you know.
The family [indecipherable] had a family  and they said  ﬁYou are in America  and Israel is very bad now.ﬂ Peopl e didnt have work  didnt have what to eat.
And people had to earn a lot of money to send children to school.
So ac tually  he didnt have to work so much  and other people who were in charge.
As such  the Germans exploited his  his  the skills and employed him...they gave him a small room on the Wache  which is the  the guard station  a nd that's where he was treating  you know  taking care of the teeth of the German team there.
I would say mass and he could keep the money and I did work and he didn't have to pay for it.
So we -- they shipped me out to -- to work.
And when they took me out  happened to be a gendarme  you know  a police man  a German police man  whom I happened to work with.
Did Hans complain to you about the work at that -- at that time?
From Auschwitz   they send us to Buchenwald  Villestadt to work in factory.
They caught some Jews to work to help them build the bridge.
And your parents think that maybe if they get you into a German factory work of some kind . . .
You felt that you were doing something of such vital importance that the well-being of the world  you know  was inte rwoven with your work.
His prodigy should work as a -- no  that didn't go.
I was very fr iendly with a Jewish group who ha d work in an organization  but I never belonged.
And then cam e the rule that they were going to pay something for that work  but again  I was too young to get paid.
I realized what a dummy I must have been doing all the work and not getting anything in return.
And then I had a friend  who work with me in Europe   who live in Larchmont  Westchester  and say  David  dont look more  you come here.
We had problems for awhile  and hoping that the United States will help us  but -- moving away from families  but it didnt work.
Much later  but you did eventually come  and at that point  the Germans pounced on the Jews.
Well  first I had to work ve ry hard  and studying.
Let's put it this way  I've never understood Nazi Germany  just as I have never understood  I have never understood the kind of destruction that we nt on in Nazi Germany  almost the engineers at work.
My sister and her husband were still in Tanganyika  and they indicated that there was work for my father and they would be standi ng by them.
And older sister Mary  she found work for me in some bakery.
And what kind of -- were you able to do any work after the anschluss?
So I went to elementary school there  Essex  and had a job  I think I was 11  and work ed with my girlfriend Marcys fathers store after school.
But I definitely am interested in hearing how your Holocaust  when you say that your Holocaust experiences that had a profound effect on your subsequent work.
And we need to work together and take the necessary actions to prevent people from being murdered for the simple reason that they are different.
And then through the grapevine is how she learned that people working in electronics were very essential to the work effort  and that led to a different kind of work  first in Auschwitz  but then to a Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4  2002 16transfer to Reichenbach  which was home of the Telefunken factory  and there she was put to work assembling radio tubes essential for the war effort and for transmission.

Q. Let me ask you  sort of on a daily basis  what was your work like?
She was very sensitive for me going away to work and being al one.
We were sitting by the table and we -- we ordered some food.
>> Bill Benson : When you say they went to work  that was  of course  that was forced labor.
And then...then I got sick again  and I couldn't go to work.
And um  so we  we  we came to places where we were very short  some of them maybe with 4 weeks and then they got scared  and some of them was very  very lovely people  but they couldn't work anymore  they were so  so much afraid.
And your work for your own self  what did you -- I started importing business  because this is the only thing I knew.
And my work when I first started was sweeping floors and cleaning bathrooms and that sort of thing  but within -- when I was 17  I was in charge of a department and I had learned about import/export  because a lot of the merchandise which we sold was imported.
Anyway  it was work for  for animals and we were treated like animals.
Vorkuta pulls the last strength of your body  and thats the underground work.
But then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in the Ballet 1945.
They respected you and sent you there to do that work.
There is a place called shonen  it's a place where they put also sick people the way they should die  so at least  I went out from the hospital  I we nt to the shonen  and I knew looking the people  I say  if I stay there much longer  I'll die  and this  this is also it's a inner building feeling  a survival feeling  nobody talk with that  nobody had nobody to talk to  I couldn't get close to my father  but so  you have self preservation  so I had some w ooden shoes  and I ga-they gave me a kind of pajama just um from the hospital  uniform  wh ich is also striped uniform  and it was only 30 degrees below zero  over there in Czechoslovakia  but I decide I got to go to work.
30 03:12:40 Let me ask you; what kind of work did you do in the ghetto?
And the complexities for me like  you know  the only tool I have  you know  to face the subject of the work.
No  what I did  I finished high school  and then I went to a school of social work in -- which was part of the American college  its called Pi erce College.
And then at that farm you had to work very hard  but a pparently you had meals at the table with the family  the food was plentiful  the food was good.
She was officially like my girl  you know  because I took care of her and I watched her  but she couldn't be with us to do some work 28 Mordechai Anielewicz 35 or to live together in the quarters.
Being a woman  was it easier to do some of your rescue work?
I suppose they had an order from the Germans for forced labor somewhere.
I didn't tell them I was sent by the Jewish community to work but I said I came in to work.
But you asked me if my father got along with other farmers.
PAT LYNCH: Oh  we weren't supposed to work more than sixteen  but  or twelve  but I think that was about the limit.
I had a Latin teacher who I was very fond of  who was very fond of me because she passed me despite the fact that my brother was the one who did all the work and I did all the copying.
At work we worked like six days a week from what  I dont know  seven to seven or something  and there was nightshifts as well  which I didnt work and lunch time we used to get a soup and -- to keep us going and so on  and I had a very good man that I worked for  that he was the boss of the group of about  I dont know  20 or so.
I was married then  but to be where of the opinion that the only in danger are the men that the Germans might take them to work for the army  and therefore the men used to run away.
My husband wanted to work more effective and there was there was a lot of handicap in the meantime that they already wanted to bring in the children home in the ghetto.
We f -- I remember that when the Russians arrived  they assigned most of the partisans to the army  because the war was still going on.
They put people in lines and they decided  for example his wife Clara was taken to Belzec and gassed but he was a strong man so they took him and other relatives I do not know to work in the forced labor.
I couldn't even be with them because I was older and they thought that I looked good enough to work  and they were the younger and with children and the children were taken away and evidently to camp right away.
And once... after a while  we find out that we can go to work.
This is the tiles where I used to go down there and work with the kids.
So the mass of the people from ghetto was put to work in three different shifts  uh  the airport to enlarge.
The people that work  labor  would be able to feed their families that would be a tradeoff.
And of course  the -- our regime of our work time  walking  correspond mail  and so on  was like in -- in the concentration camp  but there were no pressure.
And so I say I I I was lucky that I I...we worked mostly uh mainly lists had to be prepared...I don't know what  and we were typing but then don't forget it was near Berlin  so air raid warnings came almost every night so when air raid warn ings came  we couldn't work so at least caught up somehow with my sleep and there I recovered slowly somehow and was assigned to a to a barrack where where I could at least find also a cl ean place and this this kind of worked and uh tried to establish some some some contacts uh uh especially w ith the wonderful people from Denmark who were also uh uh kept as prisoners there and Norway.
And that is something that when we consider that there was practically no help from the outside  a nd even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto  how difficult it was to obtain weapons  and you know  how very -- even for money -- I mean  people would  on the outside  w ould promise you weapons  and then you would come and youd find empty shells or you know  corroded things that didnt work.
So the situation turned generally grim  but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening  and some hope started to -- to come up  that the Germans are going to be defeated  and the war is going to be turned around.
And so  I think in a way that was one of my tasks  but why I spent so many weeks there  sleeping on the floor  and what work I did with Henry there  or with anybody else  I 26 honestly cant tell you.
You had to go through a rigmarole where you had to get permi ssion renewed that you could stay and could work.
He say  \ Where come the strong to us to work so fast?\
I'm not suppos ed to work  but...in the United States because I'm a student and I loved to work.
My sisters  of course  no doubt  were just as happy as I was  and Mother went right back to work as soon as she felt better  she resumed her obligations that was the community and the people in the community and so forth and so on.
And people were sent out to work like cleaning the streets and what other labor they needed.
And my parents in the meantime got transferred back to Vienna from that place where they used to work out in another state.
Was he having a hard time adjusting there  or was it just a function of the work wasnt exactly what he wanted it to be?
And then we went on the -- on the train to Berlin.

Jews could only work in groups and the people who had taken on these groups had to provide special facilities  special toilets and so  so that Jews and non-Jews didn't mix.
He didnt do too well wherever they lived  so somebody suggested to him that he could come and work with them in Split.
And what I found out later  that this was all the work of that commander.
So the people would 7 go  you know; some would go to the uh...uh to...with the wheel-barrows and uh spades  you know  to do the work on improving the roads or to the agriculture or  you know  or to the so-called \ Bauhof\  [Ger: \ building yard\ ]  where all the professionals were working.
And they central was in the Auschwitz I camp  in the main camp.
We give contributions to the Jo int Distribution Committee which is supposed to be doing relief work all over the world.
And they were looking still for young people to go to work.
For example one time I'm  one of my functions was to pick up the mail from the post office  and so I was known to everyone and they  at that time it was a village  today it's that part  that village is part of the town of Krakow   but at that time it was the village of Mogilla  and everybody knew me  and they were marching a group of Jews through the village to work at the nearby uhhhh military  German military establishmen t  and one of the fellows was somebody who knew me  and yelled out my name  and you know  I  I mean just unthinkingly he just yelled out and other people looked like what  what is it.
And then  they let them hang there for several days  and each morning the people who went to work had to march by and turn their head to the right  and they were forced to look at these poor victims.
When I was 14  I ha -- I got a work permit so that I could have clothes  cause I wanted to be dressed like the other girls and the only way to get it was to work.
So it was not a question of gettin g a pay or pay for the work.
I would love to know something about the time between work and sleep  how you occupied your -- your time during that time and were moving over to -- SE: [inaudible] CE: Well  [inaudible] -- side -- were moving over to side two of cassette one.
Well  they used to take us for work and go outside  you know.
Six months af ter that I had already requested a transfer  and I requested also to be able to work pa -- full time.
Just in case if something happens  then...uh...they are old enough to work.
And the same thing -- those camps are  you know  I want to mention  there was a lot of camps  UNRRA camps  they were especially for Jews.
Everybody actually  all the adults  the grown -ups were saying  Well  we can work  and if it's work  it's not as terrible as they anticipated.
I was making about $35 or $40 a week  there I was making $60 a week.
But we were able in the beginning at least to go after work  if we were still able to or something  to go to that barrack.
But anyway and that was the end of my espionage work.
02:07:30 There was Foehrenwald itself  which had been a work camp for German labor.
He went to Dachau and se -- and so on  but in Dachau he -- he worked -- I mean  he did not work  but his association was more with the communists inmates than with the -- the Jewish people.
So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the barracks.
Otherwise  we had an opera singer  and we had an author  and we had the fellow across the street was work in the library.
So I told her you know you stay with Shula- mete here and I'm going to work.
Okay  the -- the other part I would talk about now  how -- how you got out at the gate and where you were in relation to everyone else who was running and the mines and -- CE: Well  when we came back from work  when we c -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0014 41 SE: [indecipherable] CE: When we came back from work  we -- as I say  we walked normally like always  after working in a -- all odly way -- we went back and we came to the main gate  where we lived  through -- through here -- through here  over to here is the gate over here.
The next day they said   ﬁG o back to work.
I would be asked some questions and I would get the treatment that I couldnt sit for next two weeks  and back to work.
I never knew what work means because at home we were wealthy.
If you didn't line up for work  you were on the bunk  they would put you on the trucks and if the truck was full  they would take you to the outskirts of the town and there -- we dug those trenches when we were put the yellow Star of David .
Well  they made us sign papers that we were not to work and that we were accepted as refugees but that as soon as the situation will allow us to leave the country  we will leave  we will leave.
There was a certain aspect of that camp which was different from any other.
Some people ate it up right away because they were so afraid that that it might not be there when you went to work and you came back at night that somebody might have stolen it  the smallest amount.
I dont know why they took me  because I was supposed to work as a secretary and I never -- I -- meaning -- I say I never saw  I saw a typewriter  but I never worked on a typewriter.
Uh  when the Red Cross came in I said well  your job is to work with the people to answer their questions and problems concerning uh the location of relatives.
You had to be selective  but people did want to work for us and were really contemptuous of the  of the risk of life.
Well they telegraphed me money and I didnt say anything to the owner of that place where I was supposed to work but he knew something was not kosher and he was watching every move I made.
It happens that the rabbi's travel plans didn't work out quite as predicted  so here we come  four people and the rabbi and his wife with the wig  the little girl  you know  snotty nose  white socks  I mean  just  you know  from the ghetto  from Poland  this is how it looked to me.
I worked at least 12 14 hours a day  and when I came home  my wife was a real estate broker  she went to work  so a lot of times we only saw each other a few hours.
And the intelligence work  which is not very nice as allies  was to send people to investigate what was going on in the British  the American and the Russian sectors.
We decided to stay on  that we had a responsibility to work.
Did you get to know many Jewish families  how did that work?
And I dont know whether I mentioned it before  but the -- probably not -- that the administration of the camps was -- the highest echelon were the Germans  the SS  I think and the Gestapo.
This is tape number two  side A. And you were talking about your husband courting you  but while I was flipping the tape you remembered something that you wanted to add  with respect to your experience in Africa.
But when my mother went over  then the wife sent her home telling her that we have too many people and there is too little work and we dont need you here.
They're taking the young people to work and  uh  at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together.
But one time  one man came one time and no more  and they didn t give us work  no.
So that the if the if the printers went out on strike  he Interview with Brooks McClure July 7  2011 34would go down and work a linotype machine.
He was a big socialist  and one of those guys who couldnt work very well himself  but he was a he started a sports club for workers and all kinds of stuff.
>> Agi Geva: That was our daily work  to pick up rocks  take them up a hill and the next day to bring them back down.
She was never doing this sort of work in the house.
She then found a little farm somewhere  little farmer who had five cows  dairy farm  and thats where I went to work.
Treating and to work  treating and to work  no release anymore.
And did your mother have any help at home  or was she running the household entirely?
She kept records who went to work  and she was doing all the office work.
Is there  is there any one  I asked you this about your work at the New York Public Library  is there any one instance or moment or document or anything that  that stands out during your time at the Ho locaust Memorial that you came across that had a profound impact on you?
When you started to work after the schools were closed  did you have time for any play with your friends or reading books or belonging to an organization of any kind?
So what work were you doing in the factory  carrying cement -- Carrying cement and carrying iron rods and steel.
After that I got a job with Slovak Academy of Sciences and from there also I was able to come to the United States for fifteen months as a post-doctoral fellow to work for the Department of Biochemistry at Purdue University in Lafayette  Indiana.
I says  yeah  you come up to my place  and I get you work as much you Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 126want  he says.
And so pretty soon the maid said that she couldnt work for a Jewish family.
Oh  actually  I was only there for part of the time  then I got transferred to -- back to Copenhagen and I was working for an admiral  I was doing some office work for him  and then I got demobbed in December  that was the end of that.
Then you have to work your system...your mind has to start going around in a different way to look upon life.
I was used not to eat  because eat  the food was only bread when we got off from th e work  you know?
Then you began to tell us where you were sent  the work you were required to do.
It was a horrible time  and it was there in that silo where some of the women came from jails who had committed murder or God knows what  as punishment for a day  and they said they preferred solitary anytime than to work there.
And when I came down to Washington in 1980 to begin full time work  we were all of a sudden a st aff of over 40  each -- almost each of us with his or her own office  although I shared an office with two others  which reflected the status of the historians in that early period.
04:16:25 Well  see  everybody -- somebody met somebody from each group for them to work  one person to two people  they know it.
And but during the war  she had to work as a farmhand  in order to feed us during the war.
I wrote to his family after the war and his sister answered and she said  ﬁWell  my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because he argued with her  so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp.
Now  we were not to -- we were not allowed to work.
So  I had to work as a pupil and pay a farm to learn to milk by hand Uhhuh.
So  we survived as long as they felt that they can work us to death.
To use them  to put them to work as a factory.
And  uh  they felt she was young enough to work in the ammunitions factory and  uh  what happened...the other thing that happened with her was  uh  she was..uh..ready to go into the gas chamber which  of course  she didn't know was the gas chamber  and..uh..there was a soldier that was standing in the line to get her to go in.
One of them were was going out to work in a kitch- en in Kovno.
>> Bill Benson: David  while you were in Auschwitz  you also had surgery while you were there.
It's a difficu lt one to work on  but it was done.
Only then we started to work on the mountains of luggage which was loaded in to trucks and it went to the Canada warehouse.
Because I went to work in this printing house and the -- Th is is at the age of 15?
And for a while they were kept in the camp  didn't work  and they were not shot really.
And the work that I was taken to or was sent to was to sort clothing in a warehouse.
And this is my biggest pleasure  even if it costs me money  that I work  and it comes to me very hard.
And the same thing -- those camps are  you know  I want to mention  there was a lot of camps  UNRRA camps  they were especially for Jews.
They are doing the best possible work that could be done to educate  to keep the memory and to stay within the historical framework -- you know  without.
I need to work for my brain  for myself  for -- and I also consider my volunteer work that I do as part of my work.
And a bomb  I was with the typhus people  I got sick on typhus.
And they  my father was born in Iasi which is a bigger city also in the eastern side  but he found work in Bacu.
And t hey assigned me to work with AMF project  and I speak to the AMF guys and so on.
There were examinations and they seemed to work out well  but I did get a letter eventually...sorry they couldn't take me.
They kicked us out of the camp to go to work  and then locked us back in to sleep in the pigpen.
Firs t of all  the the Gestapo said that in ghetto are people who are working hard and there are people who are working less  and people who don't work at all  so we'll know that the portions of food for those who are working is not enough.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 32 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (Camera roll 83  sound roll 49  Take) (21) EL: Yes  can I go on.
We waited til the ha -- our president  our Judenrat president appeared and he says that the German authorities want some 200 people for different -- for different work in railroad something.
And we got tired of being cooped up in the embassy for work and for play and everything else  so she wanted when she asked to go to Russia  she wanted to meet the Russians  but she couldnt get out of the embassy.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 I said  What do I want to do?
That -- our relation didnt last long because we didnt -- it didnt work at all.
In the earlier days  I remember Oskar Schindler actually still doing some work.
No -- then I got -- 67 And -- and your job  what was your job?
Q. How old were you when you started to work for the German baker and did you stay working for him all the time?
And you left when you left to work  there come a commission from the from th e from this place  and they check under the bed though its clean  like the military they do here I dont know what they do here  you know.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 4 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: MG: Oh  absolutely  that was fault to work  to stay in the street and to clean the street.
What did your husband do fo r work to support yourself?
But they work for us  so I dont think somebody would go out and– no.
And for two years he lost his job  because once you apply to go to Israel  you lost your job  you couldnt work no more.
I just remember that they Mother had to work very hard as a lumberjack.
This is tape number four  side B. We were talking about one aspect -- not that one aspect  but I think you used the word  and I almost at the same time  that the work that I was doing was very rewarding  and I-I -- I think its very rewarding.
And and also it was a problem in the camp because they threw me out from the barrack because I was moaning from pain all night long and I couldnt th ey couldnt sleep and they f they felt that they are so tired that they just cannot take my  what you call misery and and sound  or pain  cause that would have ma de them more s what you call vulnerable to their to their work and because they were so tired.
Then after that I was  started to work  no  the first year we had no choice so we had to take  after my son was about a year  we took him to a nursery because we had nothing.
Well  you know  they had started to round up Jews and send them to camps.
We work in there  and I got smart right...right away; because I knew that we smuggled money in a brush.
I think that in the beginning  even Germans who were good -- really great people  good people  they did not involve themselves.
So I started to work; and again thanks to my knowledge in German  I got different uh jobs more or less...at least part Schreiber [Trans: \ scribe\ ].
Work for next to nothing and ruin Italian workers because of that.
Black bread and some ersatz coffee  which was imitation black coffee  we had that in the morning  early.
We hadn't asked about children  but they said  \ Take your children because they will be taken care of while you work.\
Enjay Vart  a new promising Polish writer and he said he he loves Sieradz  and if I need something for for him or whatever  he will he will go  but I didnt want to impose on him  because there may be a really a bit of work to sort it out.
So he had resources and when they came to Paris   well Im sure he didnt work or maybe  I dont know if he worked or not.
Thats -- SE: That you were all alone and he had to work there all alone  the big field and he was always in business and they put him there in the field from hundred acres and he had to work there all by himself  to weed between the plants and it was very stupid to do that  because he was very unhappy.
They start to take out people  you know  where they used to work  where they had  where they was reached.
And then went off to the coal mines to get work.
Interview with Wand a Luos Lorenc May 7  2013 52You know why?
Uh Norbert  tell us about the work now  pl ease  that you did in Bergen-Belsen with the   and would you repeat the sentence that way.
Either he didn't get much food  or he must kneel or he has penalty work and so on.
Meantime  my wife was working  my brother was working and I went to work for Bethlehem Steel.
And when I was - suddenly a lorry came  a Nazi SS arm -- SS man it was  sprang up and who was looking young and pay -- able to work  was taken out in that way and put on the lorry and brought to a labor exchange and there we were obliged and -- to sign a contract for six weeks  to work on -- on a farm in -- in -- in north -- in -- in nor -- in the north of Germ any.
My father my father as I said  my father had been recovering from a stroke that he had that he had su ffered  and my father was no longer able to work at all.
Also every couple of weeks they used to take from our work camp people who had to go to the dentist  problems with their teeth - the dentist was in Kaiserwald  and what he would do is when you used to come with a 8 toothache he just would pull your tooth  and when I heard about this I volunteered.
And what makes me particularly  actually angry– I have two or three acquaintances who are retired  who went back to work on a part-time basis  because they dont know what to do with themselves.
And uh uh so uh also what was a tremendous advantage  that uh when I worked with him I could work under a roof so that the elements...I was not exposed to the elem ents.
And they wanted us to work in an ammunition factory  and we did.
And  uh  the  the  the speed of our work was dictated uh also very strongly by the fact that uh  uh  we had to t-try to comp lete the job before uh  uh  uh there would be uh  uh this terrible thing called war.
And I looked at her -- you may not know it but part of my checkered past I did so me reasonably advanced work in logics.
She was allowed to express herself without fear of being pegged as one of the lesser students trying to work their way up.
I never work on any records for nonJews  so I dont really know.
My mother was saying -- she was in bed with my sister  I was standing by her  by the bed  and she was thinking whether she should go back  go into work or not.
In my group there was a miner  regular guy who used to come to work.
And the couple who was in charge of the work detail was a German  a redhead  freckled  with a horribly low number.
So toward the end you we ren't even work ing anymore?
The parents came back in the evening from work  and they didn't find their children anymore.
And then he asked me if I would like to go back to France  work with him  to get French sign language recognized in France.
From the board wh ere the suitcases  on the trucks...so we had always several size that are workers in that building uh used to work and uh this was also one day in the ghetto unexpected.
So this was this was the case  that I was able to complete the matura   and I got the work.
But his innovation was his fork in the road was that from now on the Jews had to do the dirty work.
That people they could work  but I can't even remember what they put us to work.
And then we stayed almost like two years and then the order came one day  October 27  I remember that vividly that day  October 27  1942  two years into the ghetto  couldn't go to work three shifts  the night shift came back from work  they kept us all in the ghetto area.
If youd like to continue telling me about your father  and his work in the New York area?
And from then on  the gates of the barr acks were open  and when you finished your job  your work  your assigned work  you could go with that family and move around without being accompanied or guarded.
Except they were all young  they would probably not go on to a camp  theyd go on to a work camp someplace.
And it starts snowing  theres no work  theres no food  nobody knows you.
So so so Im Im Im literally learning in many ways  because we are so assuming that in our self righteousness that what we Interview with Peter Masters August 7  1998 21do is absolutely the only way  and in a way it explains that when when when slavery used some of these very places as a source  and transposed forcibly people who did not have a work ethic and suddenly told them they had to work God knows what hours  that it was very tempting to say they are go od for nothing and lazy.
A matter of fact  a cousin of mine was...I put her in charge to work to wash her clothes  because in this way she was saved and she helped her.
Uh we uh the young...the men capable of work between fifteen and fifty  I believe  were...they were told to get out and all the others to remain inside.
And then they were...uh with all others  if they couldn't fit into work  then it was back to the extermination camp.
500 elderly and sick and a few hundred healthy and strong  men and women that were off on work but the Nazis took them away because they would fight them back.
Again  ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 29 some other people were living in there.
But Italian soldiers also had to work doing the same tasks.
So that thes e guys who escaped going to the front line ---- and I also discovered from the book  from Schli ndlers List  that all of these camps  the work camps  were really refugees fo r enterprising Germans.
SE: No  in -- in the -- wa-was on stove what was made in the -- did the -- but it didnt work very well.
I think they  they caught the people on the street  with the people  people for the desport  we didn't  we didn't really won't believe that it is for work.
But that was– I did some other work  I mean  other investigative work in the case  but I interviewed lots of other people.
And then they started  you know  by -- well  everybody had to work for them  and they had various jobs to do.
Now  you say this was within the ghetto the ghetto itself  but on the periphery.
For example  they initiated a rule that anybody between the age of 15 and I think it was 65 had to go and work.
And  uh  uh  just before the henchman did hi-is work  uh  one of them  doesn't matter who it did  cried out in a voi ce that  and we were as I say standing there uh with clenched uh fists and our uh  uh and  and uh talking about where's God uh at this moment  and --------------  by the way  has written about it because he was also there.
They stood these people up in the middle of the winter  which is pretty bad in Poland  not lik e here  and they took a fire hose  and hosed them do wn with cold water.
So his approach to the Germans was  we have people of every line of work  we can do all type of work for the German could use  and what a German population can use.
And we had -- you know  we had to work hard and study hard.
If they somebody di dnt finish grammar school  or had some grammar  first years of high school  thi ngs like that  they had on summer months they work on some building roads  or some thing like that.
But the early work was actually cutting the what was it  the grass.
Over there my vo -- they took my mother to -- to the work camps -- Okay  I just want to finish with the train voyage.
There were a lot of refugees who all werent allowed to work  and got into skirmishes because there nothing else to do.
He work at  I don't remember what they used to make from that material  but it was like  they were doing something from rags.
But in practice  it just won't work at this time and in this place.
And I marched to the forest  and I was cold  there was snow  and was horrible.
And then he actually did all the dirty work that the Germans requested of him to do.
My brother  they took working people -- young people for work.
And I went with my mother to work; and I said to my mother  \ Mom  give me your ring.\
So the Formatted: Font: Bold Formatted: Font: Not Bold Interview with George Kadar 66 April 24  2000 liberty was there  but the British -- not the British  nobody -- nobody knew how to handle th-this kind of -- of -- of -- of living -- living death people  so you can imagine that i -- I - if -- if you lose 50 percent of your weight  approximately  how do you want to oblige your stomach and your body to work?
Two machines  twelve hours by day and the other week was twelve hours by night - shifts - work shifts.
It was silly work only it was very  very difficult  very hard work.
Well  let -- let me ask you a li ttle bit about -- now  your -- your father and -- and his work  and -- and did his work allow you all to have a -- a comfortable lifestyle -- Yeah.
This was a -- you see  there was a very many kinds of Germans.
Used textbook  high school textbooks and after work  I locked myself in my room and I read many of the books that are required from high school kids to be read.
Homework consumed the rest of the evening and most of the weekend  and I still had to get up early to go to work.
Did you have to go to work  or your mother have to go to work?
And they said that because we want to run back to my mothers side  my parents side  they said  no  no  no  they go to work.
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 102 Yeah  yeah.
The political department was  you know  chief of the political was and -- but in the political department  you know  the clerical work was done by the prisoners and the camp itself  the compound itself  all the evidence  all the registration was done  everything was done by prisoners  by prisoners.
So you were -- you now had to work  and you felt independent.
And when we came back  we were told we couldn't go to school anymore.
It was not Polish  but we knew that i-in Germany there were many work ers -- farm workers taken from Russia  from Ukrainia  from Belarus.
But he didnt work  no  no  he was able to get away with it.
I expected three years ago that they wouldnt have any more work for me  but it seems they do.
You know  anything that you are doing agriculture  there is always work to -- they would put the field  and there was a Staabsgarten  which was -- they were the -- this was for the German population soldiers  or population.
They'd been overseas or one thing or another  and some of them that I'm sure could have done very good work had they stayed on left as soon as they'd made 18 their presentations and a lot of them who weren't assigned to make a presentation before the Tribunal immediately left  so that left the rest of us with more research analysts than we'd had before and a smaller staff.
The rumor was they're going to send us to the east to the Ukraine to work in camps.
Labor  it means working  so we will work  and the war will be probably few months the war war will be over.
So I had to go back to work  and I -- I had to choose a profession  because I didnt want to go have to work some manual labor or someth ing.
When we get up in the morning  all four of us  we had to prepare for work.
Social workers were being trained to work in children's homes in the United States  and I did my field work at Bellfaire in Cleveland  which was one of the top-notch child-care agencies.
Did you work  how many days a week did you work?
And after a while in '40  '43 probably  beginning of '43  I was taken to work in the uh the factory.
I says  she tries her best  I says  and she wants to work and she does work.
He was just...as long as he could work  and he was 42 very proud in his work  so at the beginning it wa s not so easy because I was not an accomplished welder  but I tried to learn from him and he realized that and I must say in all fairness  he treated me like an equal.
Because they figured you're more efficient and you're more good the camp will work  that they would stay a chance not to go to the Russian front.
Barracks with the same bank -- th -- the bunkbeds like you see in -- in -- in Auschwitz  and we had Ukrainian police -- there were three SS men  and the rest were Ukrainian police  and they took us to work every morning  and we had to go  and march and sing  and -- Sing?
In the evening when they came back from work  they carried him in already  he couldn't work.
I wanted to go back for a second to the opening statement that you made at the Einsatzgruppen Trial when you were twenty-seven years old and then have you comment on it and talk about your work for world peace  because it seems to me that those statements are directly related to everything that you've b een doing.
What they did  they send the people to Estonia and they work.
And they wanted me to tell them what I wanted to become  what life work I had chosen.
Uh anyhow  what happened with me I got uh I didn't uh  I I got in a barrack and I was told not to uh try to uh just try to escape  to work  which I did.
that they were to register  but they were going to take them to concentration camp.
To give you an example of how my husband work ed.
I probably could have gotten back my job where I used to work in that nursery. [
And I work for next eight or nine years for military district of Washington.
Thank you very much for sharing your story with the Holocaust Museum.
I took an instant dislike to him  and I would often work in the building on my ow n. I -- I -- Im a slow worker  and I often -- and I still do it  I work late and long  and I would often be in the building on my own and hed be stoking the -- there was like a furnace  an old-fashioned furnace where you burned wood to heat the boiler for hot water and so on.
I work hard enough just to make you regular  decent human beings and if its against the law  then you shouldnt do it.ﬂ I knew nothing about it and so forth.
A nd I went to flight school for a short period of time and that didnt really work out  so I ended up going to navigation training  which I liked.
And he said  ﬁYes  please.ﬂ He said  ﬁAnd can you do my sister  too  Rosa  sh e is so scared.ﬂ And I said  ﬁWhat about your parents?ﬂ Because I knew -- he said no  my parents say -- and this is really ironic  ﬁGermany is an -- an civilized country  and it wont be so bad  we probably have to work hard  and how long will the war will last ﬂ -- we all thought it would be short -- and then come back.
And the reason they all went into busin ess was not because they wanted to be business people  they were not allowed to work the land.
My sister went to work in a -- in the Catholic lady who had the garden.
But but were were but I feel good about it  Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18   1997 58and Jill does too  although she decided to stop the visitors service work for a couple of reasons; one  it was getting to be physically to diff hard on her.
Although the war was still going on  but Im not going back to work there.

But in the meantime  my Aunt Esther Bitton  my father's sister  used to work at...uh...there was a Portuguese soup kitchen primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of Lisbon.
That didn't work out because they decided because of my English I should be in third grade.
There were many other refugees working there too  an d I had to do the basic things  I had to pick up dre-dresses which fell down to th e floor by the hundreds   and brought -- did stock work and all that.
No  I said the dynamics between your team members  among themselves  the 35 or whatever  yeah  especially in view of what you just told me that there were DP people and there were Germans and then there was the Army  so how did all that work?

Did you think  when you left your -- when y our husband would go to work  that maybe you wouldnt see him again?
Well  with the camps  what happened to the people from the camps  like my fathers camp.
And also they took from the kitchen with them in case they need.
AR: As far as we knew  those people were sent to work in Estonia.
You tried only -- I tried to avoid always not to work for the SS  not to work for Gorajetski  because he was ending up taking the men into the camp  which I said th-they never came back to -- to -- to the ghetto.
I felt I wa s doing more there than I would have been if I went to work in a -- a hospital or -- here in the States or  you know  into one of the -- couple of my friends went into the -- like Sikorskys and different places  worked as industrial nurses  but I thought being an army nurse was the best.
Then they started to grab people to work every single day.
So I decided  sick or not sick  I have to go next day to work...you see  because we used to march  and they guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners  and I'll find out what happened.
And again I met a landsman 32  you know  and little by little  if you remain in one camp for long period of time  you get into a group  and you get an outlet a little bit to organize and to find a better place of work only where food was available.

My brother  like I said  didnt go out  out of the ghetto  you know.
That mean it was he organize  not organize but he take care on a certain group of people for the work  like a manager for work.
I started out by being the director of a day care center  where I chose not to remain the director  but to become the case worker  because I wanted to learn to work directly with children.

So  the first thing they said  could you work for me.
This type of work and daily marching out until one day at the end of 1943 or maybe beginning of 1944  already  an English spy pl aneŠI have to back off here.

And we started a wonderful relationship which eventually wound up that I came back from Japan to America  to get my citizenship  which I got and they offered me a job to work with them  these two friends of mine here  Allen and Abe  which eventually developed to become a very large company  Lloyds Electronics.
And they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work and hosed them down - they call it hosing dow n. By that they took a fire hose in the middle of the winter  and this must have been 1942  to 43 the winter  and uh hosed the people the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death.

And also dresses and I start to work in the -- in the carding room.
What were some of the other conversations you had with the prisoners while you were there?
And then this man that I was speaking about shouted who was -- he was actually a -- from Ukraine  and -- and they -- in the beginning of the war the Germans solicited the -- the Ukraines and give them -- you know  to -- to belong -- to do the dirty work  you know  and have sort of identifying clothes like a -- to make -- make us understand that they belong to the German army.
And that's where the workers ...uh...got into the camp and these camps  they were erected overnight and...uh...that's where my brother was taken to a work camp at the 1940.
And  uh  because if we were going to continue to do this volunteer work in Birkenau with those rocks  we were going to die  and  and we thought any job would be better than that.
I was of course involved in my own work at the time?
So he goes to work  and I  in the morning I take that shovel  put it on my arm  and go in front of the this supervisor house  go around  go home.
Do you or your wife do any work with the Holocaust Museum?

My late husband used to bring me  I used to work from 2 until l0 o'cl ock in the evening.
Well  I dont have any doubt that the history  that our fleeing from Germany and coming to this country and being grateful for the opportunity to be free here  has sort of moved me into public service work.
During the night  maybe they didnt have so much s upervision  or maybe they felt sorry for us  whatever  but I dont remember - the work was very messy  and dirty  and hard because  you know  the bricks were heavy  and we had to carry them when they were finished  to carry them elsewhere to dry them and then put - put them in place and so on.

They lived one life in which they paid homage to the Nazi party and everything and the trappings that went with that and they heard the stories about how evil Jews were  and yet they could live across the hall from a family of Jews and still find them as decent and honest individuals and work with them.
They didnt send them to -- to concentration camps  they killed them right then and there.
And at night when we went home from work  the guard gave it to -- there were two wome n. I think they were at least 250 or 230 pounds.
I have a very good life here and my husband ma de a very good living and we raised a wonderful family and wonderful kids and were really very grateful t-to God and to this country for letting us in to to do the work and we hope to be able to do the work as long as we we can go on.
And they -- they have [indecipherable] to work out their life as it is [indecipherable] them up  no.
Are there other things  either in terms of  you know  your career  work  f -- religion  other family issues.

Outside we were working just to make us work  to keep us busy carrying stones.
Nobody knew me as Emilie  only in school  and at work.
So  there was quite a congregation of people from that little town around and then there was one person who said I introduce you to the Russian commissar who is in charge of all the stores and his wife is taking care of children who have no homes and maybe somehow we can work something out that you ca n go to school  maybe find a job  and I had no place to go  I say okay I'll stay another day.

Alright  this is basically the 60 atmosphere  now also I should say about Siemens  coming back to that  I said already that we got no worker food ration stamps and even less than the general consumer  we got paid less than the German workers who did si milar work and I said we couldn't go to the toilets  also we couldn't use their cafeteria  we had to bring our own lunch and sort of eat it at our work desk and of course  we had no right to vacation time .
So we got married and I -- just after that in 1944  as I say  the Quakers got in touch with me and said they wanted me to come up to London to go to their training institute to work for -- to join the team that was to go and work in Europe.
That meant that they could get the jobs and work for the money and-- Did you understand as a child what was happening  that Roosevelt had set this up and that enabled your father to have a job?
So in the morning always you got the bread  in the evening you get the soup.
And it was quite fascinating and I really took the work quite seriously  and I said  \ All right.\
The next day -- next today  we go out to work and we come from work  we come and we sit and wait until the -- before the light gets out  just -- the signal started to whistle.
And I said  after three weeks  ﬁI cant go on no more to work.
And I had...I had a heavy coat on and I had those bundles and my brother had.... And when I came to Nowosiolki  they...uh...rounded us up and they made in threes or in twos  and they started picking out who is going to go to work and who not.
01:17: They had to go to Germany to work for the Wehrmacht in some way and they went into hiding  underground.
But if he want  he wants to work  do it in this way.
And so many people wrote me about it  told - Walesa was the one who said  with a -- if you -- not for you  we stay symbolic because not my work  its the w -- collective work of all my friend  I would not be there.
And in some way -- and when I think about it sometimes I say I -- because I became ultimately  after winding -- I -- I -- my first half of my career or first third if you will  was in youth work  organizing people in college campuses.
I had to go and I worked from the American Joint and my salary was twice what I had and I didnt have much work.

Thats when I did this kind of work  and selecting the ma -- the documents which I mentioned be fore  which they were able to u -- or supposed to use later on in the war crime trials.
Did the music playing when you went in and out of work too?

And then when it was -- it was typhus epidemic there  so he let many girls to sit on  and not to work.
And people that used to work for the post office used to congregate there twice a day  in the morning and in the evening  and they used to talk to each other and we could hear; they were all Poles.
I could work in these places  you know  as a waiter  I knew already the work.
In Dubrovnik  it sounds like yo u were working  you were working in the restaurant and you were doing this knitting  was there any other place where you did any type of work like that?

And that guy who came down  shouted at him  ﬁIf you don't admit the truth  that you volunteer t-to work for the Germans  you'll stay down here until you starve of -- of -- of hunger.ﬂ And -- and th-then he told me yeah  I mean he -- he -- by the way  he knew Russian also  that Czech guy.
85 Yeah  and all of these went to work in the Kuechenuhr kueletini evening kitchen  which was used for a two-week period for deserving workers on a coupon which gave them an evening meal  a little vegetables  sometimes a little starch  and something that looked like a hamburger  but it was round.

So that although my diploma didnt come til June of 48  in fact  I finished my four years in January  took a semester and a summer session in Albany   and then went to the University of Chicago for graduate work  because by this time  the G.I. bill led me to think of the possibility  not of teaching secondary school  as I had originally planned  and I had done my practice teaching in the ninth grade  but the possibility of getting a PhD and going into college teaching.
And I was sad about that  because I just felt I had reached the point where now Im able to -- to live in the United States  to work  to become part of it.
He was  when we used to work in the places  when we used to assort the clothes  he used to tell us to take a lot of like women need panty hose  need brassieres  because women didn't have brassieres   and all the girls was very hard to be without brassieres and panty hose.
So  they gave me some pills and they sent me to work naturally.
The day consisted of working ten hours a day  one day you didn't have to work  that was Sunday.
We were here approximately  doing pr etty much the same kind of work in the factory  and marching to and from and then one day in the spring  of course we didn't know what day it was because we had no cal endar or radio or anything  one morning when this lady  the cappo woke us up and lined us up and counted us and she went to report to the SS  she went to the barracks  because she was allowed to go there  she was the only one that was allowed to go th ere and she was going to report that we are all there and she couldn't find a single SS in the barracks.
I took care of all of you.ﬂ And he was very feeling low  in other words  for them asking  however -- may he rest in peace  hes no longer around  he said hell do the work free of charge.

After a few days they were sent to another camp and then to Auschwitz.

This was hard work  very hard work that Jews were not used to do  for instance in building...brick... laying bricks or in the barracks to to the the the men's rooms and the the other cleaning di rty things  so they said they need five hundred workers of academic professions for archives work  so people were so enthusiastic about this opportunity.
The uh people who oversaw--oversaw us were not the Germans  they were actually farmers themselves who essentially contracted us to work for--for them--they paid the Germans certain monies.

In the beginning they still kept their farms but  I understand that later on they had to give up their farms to the Russian government and work with them as co-hosts whatever they established at that point.
Our firs t indication of things to come was when my father didn't come home from work one day.
We did very good work and we were very marvelous with our research.
So a lot of young Jewish and young  non Jewish people  young people fifteen years old was brought to this factory to work.
He was in the Russian front line behind the enemy line digging trenches and doing this kind of work and this is the only brother that survived.
And since I was it was six day business it was  I getting up 7:00 in the morning til 7  8:00 at night.
I supposed to be at work at ten minutes to nine  because I had to take the mail around to different departments.
I always used to say when I used to stay there with my friends  we used to work.
And he made up his grou p to go to a work camp.
And then  if they had guests  b ecause lots of times  you know  in business like that you entertain a lot  so I had to work overtime.
The fourth Yom Kippur I was in a camp because Russia lost a lot of people at Stalingrad and in the war at all  and they started to empty out prisons...prison camps  especially those people that could not work.
So you made excellent work not out of love but out of fear?
Because we...our radios--uh  the 536  we call it--uh  would not work inside the building like they do today.
And because we were really set up to -- to try to stop the influence of the Soviet Union in western Europe   in every cultural field student in Europe   I became into contact with one of the greatest labor diplomat in the U.S.  Irving Brown   who got the medal of freedom  Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 86etcetera  for his work.
Although officially Marcel and Ania are retired  they do considerable volunteer work with this museum.
S: Well  we work in a registry  we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and theyre very important  not only in giving us their testimony  but in helping us to arrange  put in data  to scan images and to help us in a variety of ways.
He revived me  he tossed me a piece of bread afterwards and that's how my day of work ended and we came back to the barn.
You know  to publicize the work of Vandenburg and  incidentally  of Father Bruno as well.
I dont know exactly what parts he was making and why he was qualified for such work.
I I said  you know  I I dont think that thatll work.
BZ: Yes  yes  in 1944  1945  I went to London as US Treasu ry representative in London and my assignment was to work on the legislation which the occupying forces would enact in Germany  if and when they established an occupation governme nt in Germany.
Do you remember what your thoughts were  or how you felt about that?
Okay  now this is a shot of -- of my typical work day when I was worki ng as an apprentice  and when I was the Aryan Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn  and my work was at the sewing machines  sometimes it was away from the machine doing other things.
I kind of feel that I was more immersed in in with my family  and my work  rather than I I did not think about it unless it came up on the news  or something like that.
And as a youngster I never did this kind of work before and there I have to take the wood barrels and fill them.
Months later  two months later  and Did you have to have paperwork in order to get from Germany to Yes  and we had all the work  but it didnt work.
And and in camp too  there was ce rtain rumors going around that if you volunteer to go to work in Germany  you get more food  and you get better things  and a lot of people volunteered for it.
And before we had a chance to do anything again came a demand for people to work in Germany and everybody scattered.
>> Bill Benson: Morris  you were at the start of the work in September 1938  October  you were not 7 years old.
He organized the Jewish council whic h was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans used to grab people from the streets from thei r houses for work.
And so after a couple of years  Daddy in the shirt factory  lets see  in Spartanburg the place he worked was called  yeah– Dixie Shirt Factory is the mill where he went to work.
I see th ey were put to work from the jail.
First  I was sent to a  in Walstadt  was a seashore resort  and I was sent  I was sent to work in a  as a waiter  waitress in a small private cafe.
He hired me and he said  \ I want you to go to work fo r me.\
He used to work for the government  he was an engineer.
He had us work around his farm  clean up certain things.
So -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0075 75 And at -- and what kind of work is ye t to be done in -- in th -- your field?
Then I tried to work something out with an outfit in Sweden and by the time we were getting all ready to  you know  do something  then we got occupied and I couldnt get out.
So my br -- my brother used to raise rabbits for food  and he worked -- there was a shoemaker ne xt door and he would work there  and they would give him oats  and -- like oatmeal  and he would feed it to the rabbits.
And I said  its not because Im courageous  we work well together.
See here youre dying  but there you can have a potato  grow potatoes and that  but youll work  and its very good job.
My father  uh  was one of the few because he had had that heart attack and he was permitted to stay but he had to work in the  also in the nearby little town to fortify the river  in a place called Suhar  and uh we were terribly worried every morning that might be daybreak  4 or 5 o clock that he'd left because he had a heart condition  and we were afraid what that hard labor will  will do to him  and uh  my mother and I and some of my friends who few blessedly are still alive  um had to go to  to Baravitz to work in  in that uh  shop sewing.
And th -- you know  if you didnt work  you had to go to Janowska or somewhere.
Mostly it was a  uh  factories that  uh... that work on  in...in defense  you know.
The -- the thing that -- that stru -- has struck me always in my work in human rights is the different -- that some of the people who commit these acts have no -- no s-s -- I dont know  i-its not question of conscience  but if we -- j-just to give you an example  we -- we had one man who testified as a witness  had been involved in this  and we asked  were they tortured?
I wanted to work in some kind of a trade or business enterprise or that kind of thing.
Yeah  but he died  he di I hi I heard from him here in the United States when I came in 1960 in 1971  so and my sister told him that it talked to him  because he was from the same city from where we were  he was from Michalovce  Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14  1997 96and he said that he went with the same transport  and with the he came to Auschwitz  so he was a he was a tall guy  and he was much younger with my than my father  so they took him to Mengele too took him to the right side for work  and my father went a few  maybe 10 or 15 people in front of him  Mendele Mengele took him to the left  to the oven.
We had to come everyday these three kilometers from and to  to work.
And the man that owned the place  his name was Rubin  I will also never forget  he came and he said to me  ﬁWhy dont you give out the work?
Have you been to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington?
I wasnt allowed to work because I was a -- like a guest  I was transient.
So  what kind of work did they have you do during those three weeks in Auschwitz?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 22 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: the window.
It didn't work  because uh the Japanese were allies with Germany and they were occupying China; and 19 the...the sentiment over here was... Show us some of your other photographs.
But I am certain that if we had had the kind of nour ishment that we had and had been made to go to work everyday  people would have begun to drop like flies.
Because there was a lot of work in these -- in the offices  because USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0015 78 everything was rationed.
Somehow  some of the Jewish authorities knew all that and some of theŠin the process some of the former inmates or work ers for Oskar Schindler would be shipped out to Mauthausen and ... So as I explained before but to clarify  it would appear that the 1 000 people that survived in Oskar Schindlers camp in Brunnlitz (Brnenec  Czech Republic)  which was composed of 700 men and 300 women approximatel y  were no longer the same 1000 people that were at one time in the Krakow concentration camp near Oskar Schindlers factory but  in fact  were those that were replaced in the process of shipments leaving Krakow Plaszow into uncertain destinies and camps like Mauthausen.
You know  today if you send your son  or daughter  your child someplace  you check it out  whether its a college  whether its a work situation.
And...uh...this work intensified and I established relations with the various police forces  with the Hungarian Nazi Party  and I was looking for support  and it didn't matter where it came from.
They made a special booth for him because he was not allowed to work with the Gentiles.
a week  like a dollar a week  but my husband shouldnt know and come back to work.
So the system with the ghetto  it was -- they established a Judenrat  because before they do the ghetto  establish a ghetto  when they need ed work  a certain -- any kind of work  they used to grab -- oh  you had already wearing -- you were wearing it  that time  already  that yellow -- Star. --
We were so exhausted at the end of the day that you had to concentrate so much and to work  you know  that your mind couldn't absorb what... I think at this point we need to pause.
And then she had my sister  and also my father continued to work on the Lithuanian borders border.
But anyway  I -- I stop to work this  because I found a better solution for me  and a protection that I was -- it was so cold luft shutz heirbdidst.
When they come with trucks to work  it can -- this idea was from the mayor from Kovno  from Kaunas  came with a smart id ea.
To go to work  and then after working for a while with the Air Force in Libau  - Libau  thats where the was  the war port  where I occasionally went along.
We would have Frenchmen in Holland  and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them  the French would say  \ We were sent here to work in -- in Holland and for the Dutch -- for the German industry \  And the Dutchman in France would say  \ But we were shipped here by the Germans to work for the for the French industry.ﬂ I mean it was a total mix-up.
So in the beginning  when we were in ghetto  we have to go.
And then you somehow found out that the work that your mother had done to get you passage to America came through.
And this is the insert of this house where there was a management  and I work as a draftsman.
I was doing my radio work  and that was where we prepared to go overseas.
Well  I was a stock boy in a store for awhile  and worked for a company Standard Brands as a stock clerk there  and that's about all that I did in the way of work.
There is the Medical Technology  and then I did work for about a year and a half in Detroit but then when we moved to Fresno  I discove red I was pregnant.
My mother went to work  my father went also to do something.
3 And then after the bombing of Stanislawow... So so uh uh...you know  by the Russia everybody had to work  you know  at the...and he worked for the transportation company  Oscar Klatter  the guy that I...the the man that I I used to call him uncle  and and we got  you know  they told us that the Germans are coming close and I was at that time fifteen or sixteen years old.
Anyway  so  about six days later  they came to us and they said  ﬁOkay  would you like to work for us?ﬂ To my father.
Did you go out and work from there  is that what you did?
17 A. We used to -- we were very privileged work ing in the union.
When I came that day from work  I didn't recognized my mother  be cause after all I never saw her with black eyes  with a swollen face.
Interview with Wand a Luos Lorenc May 7  2013 48 Oh yes  of course.
One was a little ghetto  and one was the big ghetto.
Before we talk more about the transports  tell me again about the different kinds of camps as though I don't have any idea  I don't know what a death camp is  I don't know what a work camp is.
The Germans had dogs for guard duty and sometimes if somebody wasn't moving fast enough on the work site or if the German was in the right mood  he just gave the command to the dog and the dog flew like a missile and with one blow  the dog hit a prisoner  the prisoner was already on the ground.
There was no more more ready to work in this very simple work.
Afterwards they  all these work it was ad  administration and the  and the it was a order.
And we had -- now one day  I came back from work  and I was picked out to be hung.
I tried to 50 convince my parents to adopt a baby from there  but it didnt work.
Sunday  the blockova can help you to go one day when you don't work outside here.
There will be work there  that the trip will take uh three days and that people should take food along for three days which really silly because we had no food  and that uh what the climate is going to be and uh what clothing to take along and that everyone except those who have stamps on their ID cards  on their identification papers  are required to to be deported.
We wa nted first of all to keep the Zionist youth on a certain more  that they were not left alone  that their leadership is with them and that there was a hope  even the mere hope that the time will come and we will...the the liberation will come then then and we'll proceed with the Zionist work and go to Palestine to make a life th ere.
And I knew I had to build my family and build something and you cannot build when you work for someone.
I do remember that at somewhere around this time  I started to work  but I continued with my schooling.
Then when they took us through the border  it must be here somewhere in Germany they will need us on the west.
And I think he was quite fond of her and he was still able to go out because he was going to work in the factory  th at was after my father wa s already gone.
The other one  my father and one sister wasn't go od to work.
My sister had to go to work  my mother had to go to work.
Let me take you off this -- this drawing board and let me put you to work on the New Jersey turnpike.
We -- we had a job to do  we were there to do it.
I know my husband told me that he was liberated by the Russians and they gave them a lot of food and people ate too fast and some of them died because their stomachs couldn't digest the food  it was to the point that your system didn't work right after being so starved.
There were a group of men had to work in the woods and cutting trees; and they had a plan to run away.
We knew about it  but it was not discussed because we were preoccupied with our...with our immediate....with our own work and our own.
An d...uh...there was other children from that camp which we took over so it wa s twice...so the work was in the 21 underground of he lping get documentation and preparing...you know  trying to bring out children.
I we -- we -- Sunday  by law  you cou -- youre not allowed to work  okay?
And we had to go and clean and do all kinds of work.
Anthony: And your mother  did she work outside of the home?
So I was continuing to work in this store til 1940  when I went in the labor camp.
By then it was a big kitchen with maybe several hundred SS guards  and it required more people to work.
There was rationing and you had to do rationing reports which had to be typed a certain way 21 in order to get the rationing tickets to which we all were entitled to or the camp was entitled to  so there was a great deal of administrative work to be done.
And then we came back to Belgiu m. I think subsequently the men went to work again to that place in France.
They used our own people to do this work  and we found out as we worked there that every three months or so they actually killed these men and selected new ones coming off the train fr om various towns and cities  because these men could only work so long doing this work  and that they needed stronger and efficient people.
That's  that's what it was because we had to work with a shovel.
And he insisted that I was  uh  a time o ff from work  and I got some disinfecting  uh  materials.
All the jewelry and all the values the radio were confiscated and every day  there were men taken to work and they never came back.
Apparently cannot be changed  with all my edu cation  with all the work  all myself in that regard.
And then they took her  or she volunt -- she didnt volunteer  she not volunt eer  she start to work in a bakery to bake bread.
And there there were other families  but but if the man could work  then it helped the woman  but Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23  2015 36 those that didnt have the man  or or those who man other members of the family were in a in prison  lets say  it still it was prison within the prison  it seems.
Then I took a job and finished the rest at night.
Then I work Interview with John Krawiec January 29  2015 197in the in the outfit which repaired boxcars that railroad t railroad cars.
And all my documents in the United States  from the Soci al Security  from my work  from my taxes  from everything are under the name of Nick.
And went to work there in– well when I was up in New York I worked for  within a week  I had job  I had work.
A Polish employer of mine at that time  where I began to work as a cabinet maker.
He was assigned as a stable boy to work for the horses that belonged to the SS and he even lived in the stables.
The work that we did  the Kanada commando  unloading incoming Jews and then  after the Nazis sorted them  selected them  you die now  you die later  then we start working with the belongings  w ith the artifacts.
Her roommate  Dorothy  now Landsberg  was then named Shelton  was in charge of the speaking program  and for some reason she had h eard about John Doars work and asked him to come to Earlham to speak.
I get a call at work  Ernie  come on home  were leaving in a few days.
S-Steffa   who was the love of Ludwigs   and she was kind of his secretary  and did all of the secretarial work for him  and did the hhome caring help cooking  and taking care of the house.
But you had to show your I.D. work card or school card to get your rations.
And believe it or not  back then you could work and earn your room and board and tuition  which is what she did.
And the Germans  they were  they were interested in wo rk  in really work.
We were told to take work as laborers  as domestics and this sort of thing.
So mash -- So whether you were Je wish  or not Jewish  you werent allowed to work?
They picked the young people  the strong people to work and the older people  they finish them up.
Had the Germans assigned you to that task of cleaning up the buildings?
He had nobody to talk and in the hot sun and tha-- that what the work -- what he did from the way we came there.
And so the shock treatments didn't work  I was sent home.
And we had lunch of -- lots of parties and we had people in the neighborhood and people from his work and we always had a very lively surroundings.
I was a dummy in one way because I was only a work -- a hard worker in my life.
So -- and it was nice  there was a nice by -- bunch of girls  familia r also from the school  and it was nice to work there.
Was some rules  and one of the rules of the organization and on work on the fight against Germany is that one member has to know only other member they contact.
I tried a couple of times t-to persuade peop le to work in the Holocaust Museum.
Now your parents  I think  were embarrassed by your work  selling sausages.
He would see right away that the woman  you know  with my Polish  is not voluntary to go to work as a in labor camp.
First there was the ghetto  then was a smaller ghetto  then there was the camp.
A few days ago  when in the research section here at the museum  I found a little slip of paper that sort of relates to his work  and it has just his number as a prisoner  no name  then below that Pre mium Employee and a signature.
Q. Did you work in one of the factories in the Lodz Ghetto?
HL: -- as long as you had done your -- your work or whatever your assignment was.
Another trip  you know  twenty or a hundred...it depends how many they selected and sent to Germany to work.
And he said to me  \ You know you look very well  you look like an Aryan  why don't you want to work a little?\
So they brought this solution  and I was they went to work  my father and my uncle  and I was pouring this solution in her into her hair  and rubbing it in  and rubbing it in  and she it didnt do anything.
How has the Holocaust experience influenced some of the choices that you have made over the years?
Little  little distances  and used to look during the day when I came -- it was light  yeah  but at the beginning I even didnt go for a few days to work because I was washing the stairs and the -- and -- and the -- the floors and whatever.
In Rome and we were called in the German consulate and had the choice to return to the Reich or work as interpreters.
Later on around 9 oclock or so  10 oclock  we had to go out to the appel and stand up in the line and the bosses came around to take us to work.
He went to the Hague and I had a German friend  I had a German friend who knew people in the Hague who were not Gestapo who were army and somehow that did work.
If you couldn't work  you didn't go out on work details.
So I did  and thats the fir -- and from work they helped me to get the apartment  and I had roof over my head permanent  that nobody can tell me Im getting married  you have to move out  or you know  things like that.
So  this was  were  were for different camps  the  there was uh  like I say  there was mostly  you get up in the morning  you get your little cold coffee  you go to work  whatever it is.
You know that he -- After I had to leave their farm because the Germans gave orders at the end of October  that no Jew can work out of the ghetto any more  and I -- when I came -- before I came ba ck  she told me I should hide behind the farm  and when everything will quiet down  f -- I should b -- I come back out again and that we will kill a pig and eat pork and cabbage during the winter  then in spring the Mister will be able to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 30 work with us a-again.
He's very...not helpful because he is not uh a person who can work on the fields but anyway he's trying hi s best.
And we we were watched by Vichy police Were you and we did work early morning til ni evening  but but my mother mentioned there was another family there  a Jewish family w ith also with two children.
The first work was sorting the heaps of clothes  separating the shirts  pants  coats  and eyeglasses.
S-So but I didnt stay the whole time  you see  in Mississippi  I did work and to train them  and I would fly back to Washington   then go down again for a week.
And then a ll the work what the two of us did I had to do myself.
So my relatives then wanted me to continue either with the school work or learn a mechanical trade  or any kind of a manual trade.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 When I was with my mother  sometimes in public  not very often  we didn't talk.
The - When they heard that I can speak German  their -- their -- their chief doctor -- engineer  was a German Jew  right away he took me  just because I spoke German and because I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0039 41 knew the -- the work  too.
I got up at 6 -- 5 o'clock in the morning or whatever; 5:30  6:00.
And they have alr eady started to introduce these people in our department and they know already how to do th e things that we are doing  so I think that probably the time is imminent even that these deferments for work in defense plants are going to lapse.
You never knew if you went to the destination of your work if you'd return because they could grab you on the street and just cart you away.
I work at the -- I will be agreeable to work at the airport  they could le t me out from jail.
I'm telling you I was responsible for th e cutting room.
And you have to realize  you worked in the sewing factory  sometimes it reached a hundred degrees in the work room.
And we went from place to place to ask for work  and...uh...but there was always...they were looking for us.
There were mechanics who were work ing on  on the German trucks  and uh succeeded suffusion of oil or whatever it was  we heard the production blew up on  on the way somewhere  and I was too young to have had such mechanical knowledge.
We would all work together for all things that needed to be done.
The block le ader  he was the head of the block  and his helper  schreiber they called  secretary  or stubendienst in Buchenwald   would take care of cleaning the barrack when we go to work  bring food at the evening for us when we return from work  so we s the soup was there already  a-and so on.
At the school  I used to do good work and after the school I used to work.
But to work towards mitigating killings  to work towards providing sanctuary -- speedy sanctuary for people who might be the victims of killings  and that -- that is something that we certainly could have done more quickly in Rwanda at least  and quite probably in Yugoslavia as well.
They send those other ones  the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the dirty work.
So they used that and again the youth Zionist organization helped and the Jewish Elders brought younger people  some of my friends in my barrack.
Another thing was to see when you went to work  when you went to slave labor  who was no longer there.
I was called one day  and this was about the end of November 1944  and the men took my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on  because we didn't work.
We didn't know a thing  we didn't prepare a thing  th e community did not try to build up kind of work preparing us.
I work in a bookstore  down 10:29:09 End of Tape #10 89 Tape #11 11:00:08 This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski  April 8  1998  Minneapolis  Minnesota  conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number 11.
And so you were in Stuffhof and you did this work.
Well  but then two days later  I got very  very sick.
And just finished that and I was ready to go to work  and we were just married in April  you know  newly married  and my wife said to me  \ Do me a favor  I have bad feelings  I have a precaution alarm.
And weve been living here for about 10 years  and since Id done a lot of business travel  I went int -- went to travel school to learn the computers and Ive been doing that since we live here and I work full time and travel a lot.
When I got to work  I used to [indecipherable] a Polack or White Russian  my shirt or pants and or shoes  when he get some  to make something for soup.
I couldn't go to the university  because I was taken to work for the army in 1939--Novemb er 11  after the war broke between Germany and Poland.
They always went to the office  and then we have to come there and then go to work.
So I gave her papers that she works in my office -- she didnt work in my office -- that shes occupied.
They were told that if they voluntarily present themse lves for work in Germany that wives and children would not be bothered.
I was practically left handed  except that I was forced to work with my right hand  so I was twis ting with left hand and the Sister in laundry used to say  ﬁMaryla  dont twist like a Jew.ﬂ Because its different  left hand.
Interview with Inge Katzenstein October 17  2001 12 You said your mother handled the emigration work  what kind of work was she doing at this point?
My ex-husband was a very good father  but i-it -- it was more the roles  you know  I was at home  and had dinner ready  and the baby bathed  and all that  and he did a lot of stuff with her  because I think in our generation  I think that was becoming more of the thing  but they were the -- th -- they made the money  and I mean  you know  they had to go to work.
Because then  when the older kids and everybody has to work -- and I understand children who were very young had also to work  so that there was -- the schools were only in the very beginning.
Yeah  I was happy  I learn I learn lot of things  how to work and what to make  and I learning about [indecipherable] I used to I went in and I worked for Judy Garland  she got a TV show here.
After I came b ack from concentration camp  I used to work.
In the meantim e  also from the children's home  where my age wasn't 15  they took me out from that home and I had to work in the factory where they made -- receiving equipments for submarines.
Yah  we would sleep through  so they would give us a break and then we'd go on a night...on the day shift.
What kind of work did you do in the oil refinery  just In oil refinery?
So we heard the Americans are here   so it seems that one of the officers that was left behind  to watch over us  the captain went to work.
He was executive director and he thought that I should work for someone who was a Czech  because at the time Czechoslovakia was a member of the International Monetary Fund  which a -- it was just before the communists.
So  when we got into subsequent discussions  I remember some people I considered racist in the poverty program  saying  you know  wed come out of the building from work and there would be some news headlines out in the street  and they would say that Stokey Carmichael   or Rap Interview with Peter Masters September 25  1998 83Brown  arent they awful troublemakers  what have you.
I said  ﬁWhat are you talking about?ﬂ He sa ys  ﬁYou must come to the principal with me.ﬂ I went to the principal  and they showed me his work  what is he doing.
That we could just live on it and do our work.
Once those letters were writt en  the work to protect these people just got started because they had to be protected day and night.
Whoever couldn't take it was taken to the camp  to Camp Three and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they fell  just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was a change of people.
Naturally my father didn't have a job by then because the Czechoslovakian government wasn't there and they put him to work in the mines  in the salt mines  down deep in the mines.
And then it was only in the early `70s when I had some problems at work and I thought that it would be helpful -- I thought that there may have been some connection between that and what I had experienced in the camps.
I went to Pratt Institute  and got a degree in Industrial design  and started working on Madison Avenue  and then got laid off there  because they ran out of work.

And we would work in making c lothes  you know  like a manufacturer of coats or dresses or whatever  which was an absolute lie.
And in the kitchen  you know  they did work in the kitchen so we had contact with them.
If somebody had somebody who work ed in the kitchen  they stole.
And Ive met them over the -- my career in social work  a ll over the place.
But maybe you can tell me now about how you got involved with this group that was acquiring ID cards or work permits.
And that's where they lived and they came every day in the morning to work.
Again a new language  new habits  new environments  new requirements at work.
We came to our base -- and they send -- this was October  I think  1956  they send us to collective farm  to work on a collective farm  and we slept in a church  a former Interview with Michael Lin February 27  2000 65church.

They gave us a few days  then we had to work for them.
We just did what they told us to do  and then came all of the sudden the part in uh Auschwitz  when I went to Auschwitz  when we put into  I was put into the hospital.
They wanted me  and my mother-i n-law said  either you work for your husband  go in your husbands business  or I am not going not going to take care of the babies.

And that my work that I did is successful was very successful in that its a a [indecipherable] and well find a place and I feel in a way it will constantly remind people when they go there to visit  that this Jewish woman was a Holocaust what the Holocaust room  even if they will not have everybodys name  but somehow I feel with the videos and with th-the everything is going to be there  that it will be some in paying something back that I did not suffer.
That's it  and they were building that front area into the desert and you had to work on it ten hours a day.
And they say  \ Quick work you...they called us awful name...quick work anyway you go from morning late to the...to the ovens.

>> Bill Benson: At what point did you get forced to move into a ghetto?
And they ran a very progressive school called the \ Werkplatz  \  the \ work place.ﬂ She was a daughter of the Cadbury family of the British chocolates Cadbury family.
>> Agi Geva: When there were selections  they used to look sometimes at strong feet  at hands  at eyes when there was factory work in question.
And they were going from house to house and anybody left who didn't go to work or was sick or bedridden or old or a child they took in the busses and took to the Ninth Fort.
Regular days it would be in the morning and then again at six  at -- at a -- when work finished.
And he went to work right away to try to protect his comrad es that had been sent to Mauthausen.
So what made you be willing to do this interview for the Holocaust Museum?
So I remember two or three people in a couple of weeks start to become sick  start to  to  to go around a lot  start to walk  claims their equipment doesn't work.
Did they I mean  what kind of food were you provided with?
It really meant that I was doing a policy job of involving international matters that had to be adjudicated based as best we could on what law we had to work with and claims of other nations.
They were -- always made selections  who each went straight to the gas chambers  or sometimes they did select  but you never knew what a t -- they selected to take for work deep into Germany or whether you were selected to the gas chambers  so the block avdest always told us  don't el -- volunteer.
He didnt know who was at work  and he came a little earlier and he came down and he says  ﬁSomething horrible happened in town.
That document showed that afte r graduating high school in 1918  1919  she  during vacation time  did volunteer work in what they called Polish soldier home  which is apparently  I would imagine its a convalescen t home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war.

The escorts will take over and the baggage handlers had to do their work before to to handle the baggage  but you cannot come and don't...please uh cooperate and don't make our our wo rk more difficult.

Q. How old were you when you were working with him and how long did you work?
Graslitz we were in a jailhouse and our work consisted of piling stones from the top of the mountain down and up and down.
Some of them went to -- into farms where they were put to work  and so  you know  some of them had a harder life than I had.
So everybody who was able to work  the kids  the old people  the young people  and some people didnt leave.
She came because they make you work  half a day you work and half the day you -- you learn Hebrew.
And now Jill though  has left the at least temporarily the visitor services to work for the work for Marty Goldman in his office.
Now  eventually  you know  we got married and had children  we couldnt have a club  because it wouldnt work  because we wouldnt have time to go to a club.
They were -- because they were not used to work  because they were laying in a grave for two years.
With  a-at that time a boarding school  but I didnt go to -- because it was in Brussels  I didnt go to the boarding school  and this was an institution delivering a diploma in social work  okay?
Her fa her brother was a priest and she eventually went to work fo with him  or was his housekeeper.
So in the beginning  when we were in ghetto  we have to go.
Here's the camp  these are the tents that we lived in.
So when we  I think a lot of the cases weve done  the consumer cases  all the cases Ive made reference to  the black lung work  where its hard for  the organization wouldnt have anyone to assist them in these very technical fields without spending a great deal of money.
No idea that it would...that there would be...I did not comprehend at the time  but I know that when the Germans invaded Poland and my mother  who I'm sure was very smart  wanted to come to the to the United States  and we had one aunt  her sister   the only one  in Cleveland  so I ended up in Cleveland  but it didn't work out.
I remember a little story of a peasant from the Ukraine who came to work as a sort of maid  or I dont know  helper  and my grandmother told this servant to go and turn out the light in the dining room.
On this boat  at that time  came also people from all of these little work camps around Riga.
Then first I was work in the childrens store p art time.
I will work myself.ﬂ I found a little room and I wa s working  doing a lot of things and studying medicine.
A. The work camp was exactly if somebody w ould open a business of his own.
End of Tape Six 91 Beginning Tape Seven This -- the -- the tales you were just telling about going and trying to get work for your mother came after I talked about corruption in the ghetto.
The way they dealt with a human being  if they wanted to make us work  you dont go and beat someone to death or beat someone half dead  you know.
I think very ea rly in our discussion I told you that I was married more to my work than to my actual family.
My mother--they were all able to work and or gather enough food and whatever else we needed which was not a hell of a lot just to get by.
I stay home  I read hist -- American history or the Bill of Rights  I dont go to work on that day.
And it was considered that theyre not necessary because all the Poles are good for is going to be to work for the Germans.
The only other being was the horse in the barn and we knew day from night when the horse would return from work in the field.
Then when they used to come  we had breakfast and lunchtime.
He said we have to go to   because there's a big ammunition factory and Sam Spiegal 5 May 3  1995 we'll have to send a lot of people over there to work.
So he found out that there was a train of Italians who were brought to Germany by Hitler to work in Germany and they were going back to Italy.
Well  I found out that y-you didnt get everything for nothing  you had to work  too  you know.
And the important  working if hes in good enough to work  he had the privilege to work in very little star.
We looked forward to the day we go back to work.
Oh  you met the queen  oh  you met -- oh  youre going to Washington  oh  thats -- Well tell me more about your work with the Holocaust Education Trust.
Well  she she work in a hospital  and th-then things got worse  and she died when she was 55  I believe.
How hard was it to get from the ghetto outside the ghetto?
I remember at the end of the day on the Sabbath  they turned the lights on  and they would sit down at a table and they would divide the money they had earned -- they went to work for other people  and they divided the money that they had to pay the creditors.
And there were lots of transp orts coming in and some of them were sent out to work.
So he came always earlier to open that he should see me in the morning when I go to work or when I go home  because it was in a walking distance.
But later on they took they gave work and they  there was like the highway was wired with barbed wire but in one place was a bridge to go to the other side of the ghetto.
Irving: Eh–I told you my father used to work for a tanning factory.
When we come back from work  they rush us in the block again and the blockaltester came to visit us.
On the third day after my husband was in Buenos Aires  he asked my uncle to take him and he started to work.
So I stay all...all the time by the women's ghetto by the gate and was looking how in the morning  5 o'clock in the morning  the people...the men...only men's groups...only men's groups was going out to work  going out to work.
>> Bill Benson: So now both you and your father are forced to be part of these work details.
The Jews baked their own bread but to work in the bakery was a privilege.
And by -- when the others  I think  went to work  we were taken to a place called Bobrick  which was a very small camp  maybe 150 - 200 people  not very far from Auschwitz  but run by civilians [indecipherable] Siemens.
One day while I was walking from work to the ghetto  I was walking in the gutters and a wom--and I saw that a woman is going and she is looking at me and she is like keeping up steps--you know with me the same uh eh so and so I looked at her and then she motioned me I should come closer and she came closer to the curb and she said that she has some letters from Jewish people from the ghetto in Vena; if I would take it to the ghetto and she said that uh she would bring--she would be there in 2 or 3 days and if there are replies  she would bring them back.
First of all  because of the way Ive (you know) I-I operated  I work  I need something new  to bring in something new  in whatever Im doing  whenever I can.
Did you -- were you aware of local people in Linz coming there for any reason to the camp or to work or just to see it  or -- No  not to be aware -- daily.
And he says  go there  he is my neighbor   he might hire you.
Im still working on it  but first of all  I dont have a lot of time  and I -- for example  you know  I really thought somehow  that I was going to maybe slow down on my work work life and pay more attention to this  and then this thing came up with our son.
But in the meantime they assigned us in certain groups to go work in some of the general hospitals in England.
Yes  and you keep -- in fact  you keep it at its lowest and let it work.
And how do -- First of all  I didnt -- I didnt know whet her he was coming back  given his age  and -- and -- and -- and seeing that at the time of the arrival  the very young  the very old  or women with very young  regardless of their own ability to work or not  the freakle finger deter -- I mean  who do you expe -- how do you e xpect that -- wha -- what expectation do you have that a 14 year boy will appear capable of concentration camp labor?
But along with that I think was this constant planned reduction diet  which ended up in these people dying or getting weak enough so they couldn't work  and then they were put into these -- and this is my own impression I had when I left the camp -- they were eventually put into one of these three buildings there just to be there and die and be burned through the furnaces.
They -- they arranged that  and have to sign it  wherever they send me to work  Id be willing to do it.
They would leave in the morning and come back at night.
Also  which I might add -- right in the beginning they went to work and inducted all the men military age  like from about 20 to 50 into the Hungarian not Army but all the Jewish men  I should say  because they had mobilization.
And if I were not doing legal services work  Id probably be down the street with my friend Ned  and at leas t part-time working with him or working on my own  or taking in a few cases  because I enjoy doing them.
What did he do  what kind of work did he do?
Sleeping [indecipherable] didnt work  it was -- Italy was just a country in which a war had raged.
If they are bad -- th -- masters of their own destiny  how to raise m oney to build more schoo ls or better schools  dont blame on somebody else  who did their work diligently  its a -- must be done.ﬂ Well  he printed my article in the paper  no question about it.
Theres no medicine for that   you just go to work and its gonna go away by himself  you gonna work .
And so  I was being taken someplace  they gave me a big basin with warm water and soap  I could wash  and started work  you know  asking questions.
Well  then I returned to Philadelphia to my foster family and my mother then found lodging and uh was supported by the United Service for New Americans until she went to work for the United Service for New Americans.
And he said  you work for us and I just only by chance did he come across my papers.
When I was young I was hoping to be but it didnt work out.
The Austrians  the work what we did  it was not really for the Aust rians  it was for the American soldiers  they were living in Austria in the houses  in the apartment  and they needed some lights and all those thing  and we used to put them on  I used to get the stove  you know  all the merchandise  whatever I need.
They were getting labor done cheap by putting these Jews and prisoners to work in their ammunition factories and so forth.
So  too many old people under six months were in there  only those who did their day's work  did more than a day's work they could work and the others they just picked them up like they were nothing.
But I -- I said -- I saw that thats going to not work out.
The Jewish family  girls are not supposed to work which was very terrible for me.
And right after that  they made a Judenrat--an office  where you have to register to go work.
I myself was assigned to a work detail in late November early December  1944  to break up the concrete floor of the crematorium 3 gas chamber.
They paid them   they paid the SS a dollar per man  a dollar a day  75 cents for a woman and 50 cen ts for a healthy child  the child that could work.
And this is really where the young Je ws that were involved in the underground work were able to steal the arms and to smuggle them in piece by piece into the ghetto.
Whether work permits or other kinds of permits  you could achieve a permit to get out.
And after we finished the construction of this so-called housing  then they started to take us out to working brigades and work was a underground factory for for airplanes.
No  my I shouldnt say she didnt work  I mean she managed [indecipherable] Sh my mother  no  she did not have a job  she she was a housewife  like most Greek women of that middle class were.
Yes  but it wasnt enough so my father had to work.
He work s with the Gestapo  and I don't want to be around.
In the capitalistic system  we know there are different rates of pay  even for the same work.
When youre a small child  you kind of say  how did that work  you know?
Were a lot of people in your town sent to work in Germany?
And should go in this fortress  to be ready to go to work somewhere.
The Jews would getting to the and the policemen would guide them to the places where they work.

One of my sisters  Chaja   they drove in a truck one morning before I ca me back from work  the night shift.
These started to spring up now  today they would be called day care centers  because many German women were not exactly forcibly draf ted to work in factories  but they were strongly coerced and urged because there wa s a tremendous need  obviously  for factory workers because German males were in the arm y.

You were on separate commissions and Im not sure we have to mention them necessarily  but if you think about those last six to eight years  what do they mean in the context of your overall work?
Our work to which we were assigned was carrying stones from one place to another and then back again.
So  its hard– so I think they were very  you know  when I received some awards later on for my work here and that sort of thing  parents are always going to be happy with something li ke that.

No -- at this time there were not too many people were -- were sent to Israel to -- to kibbutz and so on  to work.
They needed so many  so many people to work  and they took my brother  also.
Just a -- so then he started his little spiel about  ﬁYou girls were not sent over here to do this work  you girls were not trained to do this work.
With his pare -- And what kind of work did he do?
So he finally found work as a carpenter in a factory.
We asked the Jewish Police what are they going to do with us?
Also in retrospect  could these people have helped hide hide the Jews  hide some of the Jews?
And so I had dreams which were quite different  you know  I have a story to tell  and I  I'm a fighter uh  I remember when I I used to walk to work and the SS was going next to me walking side by side  and I used to in German say  \ ---------------------------------- \  which me ans \ I have you underground  I will survive.\
In the hospital  they work for just board and room and since we couldn't get a room; the male nurses couldn't get a room in the hospital  there were the female nurses.
Because it was a labor camp in Auschwitz  which was the canal  so they selected my mother to work in the labor camp.
So yeah  what did what kind of job did you get  after you had finished school?
The first thing Mr. London asked me was do you want t o go to school or do you want to work.
I was when we went to work  he talks Jewish to us  you know.
Now  as I say  we had  uh   uh  permanent job  a permanent job  mostly was the kind of work  but when the transport  when no  no transports  they usually took us for work uh  to dig or to the woods.

And I wanted to make life for myself and go to school and I had to work and learn on the job because I wanted to be free and I wanted to be away from from everything.. Sandy: Tell me about the --tell me about the physical condition you were in when you were liberated.
But the Jewish people never offered to go to Germany for work.
I got lot of like this [indecipherable] I work for him.
So its four years total but it doesnt quite work in even years because it doesnt.
I didn't know what to do  my brains didn't work already.
They used to look through the wire around the camps and they used to see Germans going on buses  carrying little briefcases  going to work.
And its really a question of what is work in Biblical times  compared to what is work today  so I have no strong feelings on the subject.
And I get questions many times: How was it to work with George Stevens?
He knew that that particular morning -- he told me later on that he was praying to God that I should never come back from work.
So a -- a lot of your work really depended upon people who were not necessarily working in the resistance  but always supporting you.
And then I also bought the light meter that went with it for for two more dollars  20 more hours of o of work.
The Russians are here already why should I perform such work and she doesn't deserve it.
I didnt go to work  I dont know what had happen ed.
So she couldnt work for any -- she had to work privately  and its very har -- it was extremely hard to work -- to get a job in a private institution.
In since this ope ration start  underground start to work [indecipherable] people start to fight for freedom.
And I know in some of those raids they found some people who were going to work like 5:30  6:00 in the morning and they shot them  just ‚cause they were moving around and wanted to come to work.
And th at was that Id perhaps been hasty when I said I could never live in a country where these things exist  as long as there were forces at work that were trying to counteract the the the bad things I had heard.
And this -- this is work because you have to pull the threads out and then finish it.
Instead to go and work on the streets and clean the streets  so this was my job that Unterman assigned me to.
So  from what I understand  she used to collect the pieces of candles and bring them to people on Friday night  right before the Lagerruhe  you know  before people were not allowed to leave the barracks.
You were afraid even to go out into the street during the day because they would catch you all the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come home  so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could.
Or this is the days they didn't work  people did not work.
They needed a a woman who would um divide people to go to work; and they called Arbeitsdienst--\ working in charge \  or something.
And when I graduate from college  my brother wants for me to go and work w ith him on the .

You could get rid of them  if a flea hops  and you -- used to get them  you had only one shirt  you know   you had to wear that shirt at night as well  in the morning you got up  the fleas were in the shirt  you had to go to work.
But we -- we would go work in the fields on Sunday  and we a -- they always used to light us up  you know  the police  but no-nothing ever happened.
How did you decide that you would like to work there?
I was in prison  in my home town  two or three months  they scooped me up from the side of the street.
I said no  I have ten fingers and I I am 18 an accountant but as I have ten fingers...get me any kind of work and I was working as a laborer in the stock yard in the beginning  you know  and uh I wouldn't take any handouts.
I mean he was not a French citizen and didn't have the right to work unless he created work for himself so his old experience with Champion Spark Plugs  he found a garage where they had a spark plug cleaner which is basically a metal stand with a can full of sand at the bottom and you hook it up to a high pressure air hose and then you take a dirty spark plug and just put it in at the top and the air blows the sand into the spark plug and it cleans it out.
After I came home from work  they were so afraid that something would happen to us if we go out  that they just did not permit us to join any of these things.
And before the war started I had been involved somewh at with the Quakers and their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War.
And...uh...I think I...if I can remember at all  I di d leave that work.
Well  some people work on one side and live on the other.
So I had a way of going out to work which meant access to the outside.
So I go to the  you know  to the barrack to work things like a carpenter  and they give me a stick and they say  you make a broom.

Her work here consists primarily of translating ma terial from the Holocaust written in Croatian  Bosnian  and Serbian.
There was two there so  you know  this work  it was already -- I don't want to easy  but it was a little bit easy.
When I used to work and I used to give in -- I used to pay for the house  you know  for living?
So when we came to this  when we have so me work in Kanada  we knew that we would come there.
And how many people do you think were getting out   every day or every week because of that work?
And my -- we took work home for my mother to finish.
Well  its wonderful that you continued to work and to document these peoples history.
And then Im tracing back what -- the experiences and I want to eventually work up  but in the meantime  Im also bringing in the history of the Jews in Germany -- in Frankfort  actually.

My mother went out to work and in between she would fix up the -- the house outside  they made it look real nice.
Why did you decide first to work with helping to save the children rather than adults?

The SS  of course  it wasnt good  the SS and the the other G-Germans  but a lot of Germans were were [indecipherable] work.
Jerry stayed eight days  he had to go back to work.
This is  if they needed any forced labor or to do any dirty work when Germans moved in some places  we had to do the dirty work.
So as a result of that  I had to work to make a living and for the past 25 years  I've been in the same place.
And they used them to do their kitchen work and I think administration.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 29 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: And for the most part I did that well.
America has given us this opportunity to live and I have this feeling of gratitude and this is why I so much enjoy the work Im doing now which is teaching in nursing and retirement hom es.
I get the job immediately in the first week to work in the Afula Hospital laboratory.
I would mostly describe it as a work ing class neighborhood.
This is another list  and these were these went in this way the work.
These were participants in the Polish war for independence  in the 1st World War  and they awarded...they gave them parcels of land to to work and there were they were called colonies.
They really had work  and if you weren't fast enough  they beat you up  they give you 25 on your  with a whip on you uh  behind  and uh  we were sic k sometimes  we had fevers with 40 degrees  so you were not so fast  and they beat you up  and we  we didn't  we didn't try  we tried not to say they are sick  because they are sick mostly they told you that  that  took you directly to the  to the gas cham ber.
When I say I continue to work with them  the work finished probably after a -- a few years  I think  after about four years  but I continued to see them  and continued to work with them for a number of y ears after that.
We still didn't know what work means to the Germans and what work means to the rest of the population.
And for three days I ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 didn't see nobody.
And thanks to the man who owned the hotel  I got some work in the recruiting office of a gold mine in Mwanza.
And so I Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12  2006 35graduated from there and then I was to ld that I had to do work of national importance.
And there was a manager there  assign you to work  the one that is didn't have job.
So I got selected to work on the highway there  you know  and then we got we got already that time we got SS.
The kibbutz was also very well organized  th is was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock work.
Can you tell me a little about the kind of work youve done in the United States since the war?
And -- But I worked hard and then I got a job at Johns Hopkins  also in a secretarial area and I was promoted and became supervisor of their outpatient clinic  and that was very nice work and very challenging and interesting.
After all  soon er or later you  you  you were destined to 33 Special Jewish detachment assigned to work in the crematoria (German).
>> Bill Benson: And you were able to go and place that.
Oh  it started I guess right after the war  after I was liberated  because we work hard  we slept  we didnt have enough hours.
And when I got better after two weeks  I noticed that I didnt have any shoes  I dont know what happened to ‚em  my shoes  and I told the girl  I said  ﬁI cant go back to work in the kitchen without shoes.ﬂ So Paul Lepitre stole some mans boots and sent it to the camp with a friend of mine.
It's protection not in the word of a mafia  but if I know that one of the people is working in the office of work  Arbeitzampt   or he was my teacher before or maybe a neighbor or maybe a friend or relative somehow  so go to him and ask him  \ Here I am  and it's very hard for me to work in this lousy places.
So its the -- a certain amount of work each week .
I was sitting in Zurich   doing the work of the Holocaust bank accounts  when suddenly  clic k on my computer  there is a email that says  I knew your father.
But in the Sunday  I arranged with one man around work... factory that will bring food from village  bring him food to the store.
That time they went to that factory where I sometimes went to the basement where the women work before  re member I befriended myself with that superintendent.
And one morning they picked up and they both went to work and they never came back.
So he starts some  some kind of work in car repair in my small town.
And if I tell you I used to go to work  I had ten cents to go on the subway one way.
And Im wondering how much that -- those words stayed in your mind  and influenced your -- your work  after the war.
A : Well  I would go into the market and  you know  I would work on the floor  help train the salespeople.
There was life like a little community in uh in the camp  because everybody have to uh work how...uh wherever he wanted  in the kitchen or in a guard  because we have to guard the camp uh just order  you know  like self uh self-organization  and we go out to uh German town.
We wound up  in this tre k  in San Francisco and couldn't find work there because they didn't want to hire somebody just arrived  you know.
On piece work  I was making $300 a week  at that time was a lot of money.
And I remember I used to work with a Black girl in my -- in my job that I had  and we were working in the business -- business office of the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital  and every time she would he ar me sigh -- sigh  and why would I sigh?
Did a number of people get sent home because they were not right for this kind of work?
Well  and from there I went to live in the kibbutz.
But we were main thing  we were free to leave the camp.
Di -- how did you know what work you were going to be -- wh at work you were assigned to do?
Our group  and as would say of the group  was not turned out to work.
And I went to work and they put a sack of potatoes on my back and I fell right away  and I saw that I couldn't work.
You know  so we came back to town and some Jews finally unfil you know  came back.
And sometimes I was taking her  I was driving her to work.
So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman  and I went to work there where the conditions were much  much better.
But there were also many people who got money from the Germans if they would tell them where the Jews were.
You had to go through the gate marching  and you have to take your hats off and you have to look  you know  to the band and they counted  and it was right outside the camp where we worked on the work gangs.
And we used to one day at work What sort of work did you do apart from just cleaning the Cleaning the bricks and and moving dirt.
And at work I never talk to anybody about America  about my intention to leave.
Yeah  because it was his accomplishment  his pride and joy  his his child  I mean  this brainstorm of having a kitchen for deserving work ers.
My father was -- by the time that we left Hungary  he was no longer in territorial Hungary  he and his group went into Ukraine for similar work.
So you go back to the apartment but theres no work any more.
I mean  you know  he was not physically he was not ready to do this  to work like this.
And then there was que they talked a lot about what type of work and everybody was sort of it was also a new experience for all of us to have to work.
She had such a small stick  a thin stick play  and she used to complain that her stic k is too heavy for her  and we used to laugh that this is heavy for Alma Rose  and we use all equipment  we have to work and so -- so -- and she played beautiful.
2 means only the work by dead people in the gas chamber.
came back from work  we saw the gallows uh uh erected at the square where we ha d our our our roll call  and we knew that uh that uh...we didn't know exactly what we saw...three gallows awaiting there  and then we got aware that these were these three friends who uh who uh obv iously uh uh the order was...who who could not be saved and uh we all had to stand there at attention and the atmosphere was terribly tense because most of us knew them  apprecia ted them  loved them  knew about their courage and their dedication for fellow  for fellow inmates  so we were absolu tely down and depressed  and then the spectacle began.
And even though your father didn't feel as strongly about it as your mother did  he was willing to go along with your mother and work to get the three of you out of the country?
I sign ed the papers and I got my brother Yonas work so a lot of people got work in my little business which I was very proud of.
I don t remember where I was dragging it  maybe putting it in one pile  taking to the other pile  everybody had to work.
We kind of felt that this is what we have to  and this is how we have to work  and its going to be all right  and the Judenrat really  the people who were in the Judenrat were people who were leaders of the community before the war.
Some of them not coming to work they kill about 155 people that I remember.
The -- the ghetto was sort of the we -- the people went out to work and I start to go to work with -- they took us to one like  place where they collected all the peopl e  the working people  all the columns.
End of Tape Two 39 Beginning Tape Three Can you talk a little bit about how you began to work when you were in the ghetto?
In every town  there was a big ghetto  and later made it a small ghetto.
This was during the Depression years in the 30s 35  and I had to work to actually pay my way  buy my books  a nd pay my way through high schoo l. So I didn't have much time to be involved in the outside activities.
The  it  it  it filled gasps and it  it  I was  I worked together with actually with a lot of other people who had similar backgrounds and we  we were constantly discussing our work.
So we was on this block and we used to go to work in the morning  we used to wake up like four oclock  you know  and they give us some soup  they beat us.
They used to take out the men  cut their beards off  put them to work or drag them alongside  hooked them up to a truck and drag them alongside the streets.
So my father evidently decided they must have decided he should go and that he would work here.
But then after that  she really did not work as long as we were still in Europe.
He said  and then I stayed th ere  I went again to work there  and somehow I met partisans and the partisans t ook me with him -- with them  a nd so I was saved.
And he was describing a little bit of how the camp was organized  that Jews were doing all the work  they been paid for the work  and with this money they would get their very limited rations.
And then we started to work  we were picked up in the morning by heavy guard  twenty men  or twenty women.
I am very active in Holocaust lecturing and against prejudice; it has become really my lifes work besides my work at–my real work  I mean where I make my living.
She played mandolin and when they went -- th ey -- they marched out  so they would play for people who were going to work  they would come by block four and pick her up  and she would go with them and play.
I never thought so  and yet my son one day said to me  he said  \ You know  Mom\ --he knew someone at work  some woman  and she said her mother had similar experiences  and she thought \ I think it's affected my mother.
Uh the Germans are going to send us to work  but why would they take us there.
And he brought it back and uh  we-we got a  printing establishment uh where we could go to work and uh could only set one page at a time of the newspaper and then had to break it down and set the next page  until we got to be able to uh  get additional type somewhere.
Q. But you had to work in the theater sometimes in the evening?
So I work myself up all alone  and you know  I hired a lot of men  and then I had my builders work and I helped out decorating  which I got money for this too  but I could never [indecipherable] for opening my own busine ss for interior design.
You know  they we were kept away from newspapers  from but  of course  when we went to to outside to work in the brigades  we had sometimes opportunities to to exchange views with some Lithuanians.
You know  no matter -- th e officers  they -- to -- the guy around me -- had one guy who was a ta -- a tall guy  a big strong guy  he was -- he was so mean  and when he came in to have work done and he always brought something.
And there was a lot of talk about that  I mean we respected America as I did as a la nd that had given us  you know  a chance to come and to  to work and so we were very patriotic.
Be always for him...ﬂ He always used to say that I'm a... Because I did...I had the paper work to do with the books; and he said that I'm...uh...a spy.
And then I got caught up in life and living and marriage and work and children and life went on.
I uh...it was a couple of months  and since I had lost my position I had the time to do that  and uh I must say I somehow established...uh I got to like it because uh uh some work with your hands which which which I found interesting  especially ordinary metal  metal welding and so on.
Here we see Fanny's daughter   Josiane   being recognized for the work in the Belgian Resistance.
So we settled until my parents found an apartment  they found jobs in the garment industry and I think for my parents they settled into work and into living pretty soon after.
So my boss  the colonel  came to me and said  ﬁWe agree  and I tell you something  that they wont tell you  but you work for me  that in everything I checke d on your wife -- your future wife  came out as white as a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 50 sheet.
Those DP camps were not only Jews  they were all kinds  there were Poles and -- and all ki nds of nationalities  all -- all people that were displaced  you know  people that were displaced persons who -- who were in German work camps or something and they didnt go back  you know  they wanted to emigrate.
Before they went to choose us for work  a woman before us who was in Poland in a concentration camp asked where are our parents and the rest people.
So we went to this wor k  and then we start working  our three guys  and -- the three friends of ours went to work  and this was at the Air Force  German Air Force had a base  and they did rebuild -- not rebuild  but extend the airport.
I didn't work for him at the time  but those Jews who di d (clears throat) excuse me  uh  uh had this opinion uh of him.
Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 45 May 16  2012 Well thank you very much.
And  and then  naturally the answers were never answered to me  and after I crie d myself out real good  I would sneak back into the barracks  and life would start all over again in the morning with the terrible work that I had to face  and  and hunger.
And they said that this is going to be our place of work.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother's experience was just beyond description what she went through.
And Joe Walls niece  who went to 48 University Kentucky  picked me up and took me to work so I would be there by nine oclock.
And before they went out to work  they gave them the -- told them at that time they wanted this.
Before that they ask who wants to work in th in the country  or something.
And -- and was your husband going out every day going to work and you were at home with her?
They were -- All the killing  actually  was done by them.
Baldwin was extremely valuable to Storey because he took a awful lot of administrative detail  and this gave Storey legs you might say to work more on getting materials in to Jackson.
I was also with the maid now  helping her clean rooms.
And ther there were no work  no factories organize yet  nothing.
And I thought  among the so-called leadership -- not only the triumvirate whose names came up so often earlier -- but  you know  members of the executive  members of the leadership ranks; a good deal of the motivation was that of personal ego  rather than  you know  the desire to do a good work.
We all were sent  the people still able to work  were sent to Kaiswerwald.
And was there any sort of ways that at -- at night  after work was done and you were with your mother and your sister  how would you spend your time then?
Well  we looked at our handy work and thought  now how long will it take the Russians to get through?
You know  here I was  always wanted to work with children  and now Im finding the other end of life more interesting  actually  and very rewarding.
I wanted to go out to work  and come back and sleep  yeah.
And my father  being a barber  after a hard days work  he's a still help shave the prisoners  and told me \ My son  you're young.
And Joe Wiles niece who went to University Kentuc ky  picked me up and took me to work so I would be there by nine oclock.
Anyhow I got out of this mayhem and I went to work for another -- I think it was again a smaller little farmer.
Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 191 Okay  to me its it strikes me as that some of what your work was  and tell me if Im right or wrong  some of your work was as layout Yes  yes.
Then the Germans took me  took me out to work for th em.
You could not get work not get working papers  but still you werent you were only supposed to work limited number of hours  and you had to fu dge the truth.
And I worked over there  I worked as a -- in the shop  so the best thing was at work  so they didnt -- he couldnt -- you know  at -- at work we werent bothered with the -- the SS didnt bothered with SS  we  as workers we had a lot of people  everybody worked at his job was -- was a kind of relief -- Right. --
Then later when he came back  Fathering said to accept hi m. Moshe worked like everyday jobs what they sent out people to work.
They had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto.
Send her away with the -- with these people to Germany to work.
It was pretty tough over there  but we had a little bit more to eat.
Uh Sunday...uh sometime we have to work Sunday  but usually it was in uh we stay in the barrack.

>> Bill Benson: During that three -year period that you were all together in Belgium  before you came to the U.S.  was your father able to resume his work?
And we shook hands  and I say  my father said  you know  dont do anything to ho -- dishonor our name  and off he went to work.
The second one I had to go to work  but I did not work  but when I came back I got 10 days prison in prison for not working.

So he came in and you know  I new a little English and he knew a little Jewish so between we could converse.
They went into the compartment  asked by then there was two or three people  and it was 5:30 in the morning  people going to work or something.
Although the Hungarian Jews could not work as businessmen  we had a system called \ S trohm an\  in German and Straw Man in English.

But – but when I was in the work  I was always obeying the orders Š I should not get in trouble.
I had my own life  I had my husband  I had my kid   and Im a work So how did you know there was anti-Semitism?
It was very clean and when I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days  Id give it to my friend  and she would bring me a portion to work everyday.

I have a -- my main work  when it really was work  was help ing them to come to terms with the generation conflict.
He -- He went to an uncle of his in Manhattan  and -- and his grandfather lived there  and it didnt work out.
And in all this time you didn't work in any of these places?
At work  I was looking  having my shovel in my hands  I was looking.
And my father would never let us pick the fruit because when he came home from work he wanted to go in the yard and just pick it right off the vine.
Among them were five thousand Germans who were free workers  a small number of French and Czech workers who were free workers who were only obliged to work there  and a great number of slaves of uh various degrees  prisoners of war  English prisoners of war  French prisoners of war  Yugoslav prisoners of war and so on.
When I arrived in this country I had this in my interview that  when I arrived  befo re  when I asked for my first pape rs to be able to work they denied me the first papers an d I was interrogated every single week for a year and a half.
And  uh  then she taught me really what I had to do and it was hard work taking care of all the animals and get up in the morning about 5:30  go at night about 12:00 to bed and feed all the animals  take care of the chickens  of the ...of the pigs  whatever we had on the farm.
Like  even in Latin  I was getting harder work  like when we had an exam at school  she would put me at the end of the class with a longer exam because she didnt want me to sit there while the others were still struggling.
And so we lived in tremendous f ear  especially after the Americans got into war in December '41 and then by July '42  then really we felt  we knew about camps and I think the rumor had started that Jews are going to be shipped to sort of work camps and some of them may have been extermina tion camps.
And the specialists went to work uh doing those things that can be done.
So did your husband also work in the Army hospital-- Um-hum.
So on October 11 th  this was on the Sabbath Day  one mo rning  maybe the  the work was from eight to one and from four to seven at that time.
Even I -- if they need me around the kitchen when they had some doings  I did it.
Now  he was the head of all the work camps or something?
I  previous summer  I work I made a sled  I built a s myself a sled.
So  I found straw to sleep on and pots and pans and everything and then I had so many people because we are close to the German border  it was at the end of the war and many people could come through -- it was a march between our countries and we were about a mile from the German border  and once I remember they told me that there were a few people they called   because there was a before and then many people were picked up and they had to work in a factory and they could escape and then they went through the swamp to their hometown.
And he left  and I stayed on for three years  and I julo -- just loved my work  the best thing I did was l eaving the sewing industry.
Now someone would say  ﬁHow could you work on Yom Kippur?ﬂ And he might or might not.
When and why did you join the museum  and what happened?
>> Bill Benson: What did your mom do then with you at that point?
When I said I wish they would liquidate the whole place where I used to work over there.
Our lives were tough because we had -- we had to work so hard to get b ack to -- to where we were before.
ﬁHe asked me because he wanted it to go out before the post office closes.ﬂ So she said to me  ﬁThat was not of your business.ﬂ And from that point on  the 87 union and I dont work together.
Because I never thought why I would not work to help my kids to go to college  or to get something for the house  or -- I mean  Im not a slave  but I showed him that I was not a doormat  either  even I was married to him.
Louise had to take his da ughter  and Mr. Beck's wife had to take care 15 of the son  so I did mostly of the work  but Saturdays there came an uncle of theirs  Mr. Warl.
Because they need over here people to go to work  because this is a working camp  not a concentration camp .
So if they didnt work hard e nough  they were thrashed and I seem them killed.
They were inmates  but they were sent to that camp as ex-convicts to work the people  and to do everything to downgrade them  just do everything  fight  argumental.
They have not been transported to another place and it is their job to acquaint us with the work that they have been doing.
and then from there this was Buchenwald's outer-commando where we went to work.
Last year  the the Austrian embassy gave me the the gold medal for the work that I did because I worked a lot with these Holocaust interns  took them to some of the Jewish places  I had them for Jewish holidays because they have to learn to know how were celebrating them.
They thought  two people can work out things better  and they have support from one another  which is true.
And it wasnt easy  but we did the best we could  we tried to do the -- help th -- each other  the patients and the nurses and everybody.
I remember the responsibility I felt of myself that somehow I was supposed to behave  give the right answers  do the right thing and that was up to me to carry this thing off and I remember when it didn't work  the number didn't wor k. We came the other way  that when the quota thing ended they said no this is not going to work  I thought that this personally was somehow my fault  that i had probabl y done something wrong.
>> Bill Benson: And that was  well  because you were a child.
Well  I was there  I -- I had the job there.
A-And how it would work   there were the -- the organizations in -- organizations of private people in Germany who would put an order for forced labor help.
But at that same time its good that we are able to get this money because you really cant fund this kind of work with private fundraising.
And in some ways thats why– because those people were separated from ma instream culture and because they were disadvantaged in various ways  thats why you felt the need to work with them.
Well  we looked at our handy work and wondered: How long will it take the Russians to get through?
They were Polish army officers and the Polish army in exile in London decreed that they work in these camps to help repatriate the Poles.
From Czenstachow ph276 on  we didn't work 'til we was liberated.
I don't want to go out with the transport  I mean with the guys to work outside someplace.
gave permission for these escorts only under the provision that they would return to Germany from England in order to conti nue the work.
As ill as she was  my mother's lady  she was a very fine woman  but I guess survival is over taken everything and you run like animals at that time  and we started to make plans that one day 01:34: we will meet at the main station and take a train and again to go into a place or maybe we will ask somebody where we will be able to work  or maybe we'll go to the Russian border and maybe we will be across the border to go to Russian that we shouldn't be under the German occupation.
Because of this carnotite incident  the action didn't work the way it was supposed to and we had to run.
I would have had a -- had to have a permit to work  and the authorities wouldnt give me one.
5 You were doing -- before the war started  were you doing secretarial work  or this was during the war?
And they were s -- they were involved in underground work themselves  too.
Now  when prisoners got taken out to work the ratio was quite different with the SS  is that right?
But later  when I start ed to work  my boss was a anti -Semite  but he was hiding that feeling  you know  but sometimes came up.
One time she was ill  and she couldn't go in to work  and so  she gave me her pass and I was to take her place in the warehouse.
It was a very gloomy  dark day when we arrived  was terrible.
But a lot of thing changed  because they took me out from the assembly line and I started to work in the lab.
So  is this -- what -- approximately how ma ny months were you doing this demolition work  a few months?
And the day I ha d my Bachelor  I went back to the University of Pennsylvania  I say  ﬁHere I am  please let me i n.ﬂ They were very psychologically oriented at that time  and they seriously said to me  ﬁW ell  you know  you will have to work with people who know pain  and suffering.
In the -- the areas where they would put these young people that they had to teach how to work.
They used to keep them standing after a days work  used to make them stand there and look for the -- if they find something on them.
That is what we had to do  work on the Transaharian on the railroads.
But certainly all those injections and the circumstances of my childhood could certainly lay the ground work for this.
And to work as -- either in a mill -- I think he worked in a mill  as a mi-mill supervisor.
So because of this half a bread  my brother say  always says  he says he wouldnt have survived the conditions there if he would have had to go to in the mines or  or do other work.
He immediately looked for some opportunity and started to work for a co -op  a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a  maybe a small enterprise  as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided  the profit if there was any  and they paid their taxes to the state  this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in-betwe en of state farms or state enterprise and private enterprise.
They use to do all the work was underground  you know.
No  you know  there was no work and no one could work anymore.
Because the Jews were the enemies of the Nazis  but there were many people who went into hiding because they didn't want to work in Germany or they were picked up and were sent to factories and they ran away from there and came back to Holland and had to go into hiding.
You had to stay in line for to get a loaf of bread.
>> Bill Benson: What was your father doing during that time?
He also did translation work for the Museum  including documents for the Varian Frye E xhibit   which memorialized Frye's clandestine efforts that rescued some 2 000 persons fr om Nazi -controlled Vichy  France  including intellectuals and artists such as Marc Chagall and Heinrich Mann.
My father's former employers  either died or es caped in 1947 or 1948  to the West  so this  what I mentioned  was a volunteer work.
This was an attempt for organized an alternate supply line which didn't work.
His volunteer work at the museum has included working for Visitors Services  as well as translating deportation lists from Belgium  Luxembourg  and Marseilles.
>> Bill Benson: Continuing what he had done throughout his life.
But in the moment when they refused to work  or didn't work good  the they shot  the SS men shot them  on the spot  yes.
So But during this time  in the in the work camp  there was no sense  or no talk that you could recall amongst the grownups th at there was something particular that was happening to the Jews?
And they said you were going to the East to work?
And did Joe do some resistance work as well -- No  h -- -- as trying to get you food?
One time he selected me to work in his house to clean his house.
And it -- it is a -- it is a good method  you dont want to work [indecipherable] while you do it.
The guard was standing farther away a 80 few other with work other sections.
Because one day came  I came from work  and came these two German and also one SS man.
People used to work in front of machines in heat that was burning through their garments.
There was another SS man there from Austria  who was crying his head off be cause he didnt hear from his wife  and he thought maybe they were bom bed  a-and and I I put my arm on him  saying that the maybe the post does nt work or things.
We shouldn't think of bar m itzvah and we shouldn't think of holy days  and we should think only only slavery  work  on the very hard work that we should think only how to get another piece of bread and not think of and not think of holy days and not think of bar mitzvah and so forth and so on.
Until one day when I got a phone call  would I please appear in police headquarters outside the Balutski Renneck   and there was Rumkowski  and he told me that I would work in the evening kitchen together with 40 other young wome n my age who had been for six months in the womens police corps  and they wore uni forms just like the men.
It was sealed off but people were going to work and coming back from work so there was contact.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 I might skip some things.
We were paid a small sum of money every 10 da ys for the work we did.
We came back from work and I was working in the kitchen.
Then there was a camp...uh...nearby in the city  nearby city called 6 Starachowice where they had a steel factory; and...uh...all the Jews were ordered to work in the steel factory  also manufacturing things for the war.
And if they were SS men they would go back with them and -- and if they tried to -- to break away to -- to escape  they shot them.
Wh en we went in to the compound to work  I mean  to sleep  then the guards surrounding the compound were those only on the towers  right?
That you were finding out through this work  and that through the work and through your interaction  little bit your own story was coming up.
So I said -- then I start working as a tailor and as soon they open -- they gave me a room and a machine  and [indecipherable] set up a tailor room where I co uld work.
What I think was interesting in my outlook at -- at least wh-when I look back as -- Interview with Harry Gelb December 13  2001 43as a sort of revisionist  now  is that the desegregation movement of -- of the 60s  in -- in particular Martin Luther Kings work  begat a lot of equal opportunity  equal employment opportunity and other e-equa l housing opportunity  equal health opportunity  equal educational opportunity movements in the 60s.
And the adviser had said -- at that time  they didn't have an undergraduate social work school  which they do now.
And on the day we should work so the work was useless.
And you were in a hospital where there were German cannons?
Here they could just take the machine guns and gun us down.
In earlier days  there wa s still some trading inside of the ghetto where you could do some work and receive food in return.
>> Sylvia Rozines: Once the parents went to work  the children were left alone.
So he went to work  and he told the two kids: S tay in the apartment until I come back at night.
And did you begin any of the actual work while you were still in the United States Yes.
So he answered an ad for someone for temporary work as a furrier.
My brother  I think  helped him with electrical work in the city  but then they would drive out with the man who owned the food orchard  on the weekends.
And the names of the -- yeah  we were sent to a textile factory  Yugalas manufactury to work.
And so my mother was doing charity work for the school to that effect.
I mean castles with moats around them and days and days of work.
You know  the big shots know each other  so I said to him...so he said to me I want you should be for me  work for me.
Yes  we going to work very hard  but in the evening we'll put on your lipstick and we'll all be together and we will sing and when the war is over  the Americans will come and we will be saved  you know -- this kind of atmosphere.
We had a hotel  so there was a lot of work; all the glasswork ha d to be kosher-made.
You didn't want to get whipped with the whip so you had to work pretty hard.
And one of the things that she did was she would spend a whole day assembling one radio tube and then when the siren was sounded at the end of the day to indicate the end of work  she would disassemble the radio tube  p ut all the parts back in the drawer and then start the process all over again the following day.
Interview with Hugo Herzog 4 March 6  2014 What kind of work did your father do?
Wherever a day free  he went back to work wher ever he can .

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 15 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: good thing because a big hunk of uh the population were occupied with that.
No  my father was a interpreter during -- as far as I -- I remember he told us.
And I took the work back and I said  ﬁI have taken over her job  and -- but I can do a good job for you.ﬂ They kept me -- And they kept me and eventually  they offered me a job on a part-time basis  doing what th ey called accuracy  or accuracy editing  which I did and enjoyed thoroughly  about 20 hours a week and then little by little  it crept up and it crept up and it was 30 hours a week.
Well  you know  I when we work in Suitland   it was always Jewish records they were after.
02:28:39 I think one other question I have about Cyprus is  you were helping all these basically young people get out who were being trained for future work in Palestine or in Israel.
There was no third choice -- it was either work or death.
So they marched us off to several camps in ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 21 an area where the clothing and belongings that came out of the many  many trains and the cloth ing and belongings that came out of the crematoriums were brought here for storage and for the women  the prisoners  to work with  to separate and to categorize and to get ready for shipment back to Germany.
During the day  th e Germans didn't bother  I was too young to be in a work detail  and at that time they ha dn't cracked down on the ki ds for execution  so I had the run of the ghetto  basically I could go where I want  I could do what I want.
But most people preferred others to work with them than me  because I wasnt as strong as many other soldiers.
And his job was to work for the Jewish community mainly organizing the synagogue.
This work at the factory continued  for how long  I could no longer be sure of  but we were marched out daily  as I said before  from the concentration camp.
She went to work in the morning and that was the last time I saw her.
Tell me what your dad did and wh at your -- did your mom work also?

And I felt if I could at least open up with some body  and give them some sense of my feelings and my beliefs  that would help help to go on to continue with the work.
And of the work in the camp of taking care of the SS people  that's the difference.
It does show that I did have some kind of blood work up.

So Canada was just one of a work -- but just one among many work details.

Other  some people were blowing bulbs and heat with hot  with heat and they had tough work.
The girls who work ed in the hotel saw me cry all the time  but I didn't tell anybody wher e I came from  only the people who were around me.

You know apparently in those days  from what I know now  there were open ghettos where people could come and go as they wished and there were closed ghettos where there were fences around them and you had to pass a gate and you could only go out in order to work and that was for a specific work purpose -- you could not go out.
So you felt that you could rely upon them  you could work with them?
So and thats Okay  so so your mother was not particularly religious  she did not go to church on a regular basis  or anything like that.

And I went to work  and they took them away and they all shot them  all these boys they shot  and I was just lucky  it was just like a lucky star above me.
But if one time it didn't work  you didn't have a second chance.
What was the fate of the people in the work camps?
No  I had -- my friends now  its not the original friend.
And then  some units from military gestapo came to the camp  never used to come on that day  and we thought somebody maybe...slipped out  but they left  and the next day exact ly  the plan was  at 4 o clock should start  everybody has to kill his  his SS man  and his guard  at his place of work.
Well  I worked  I like to say for work; I worked to gain money to feed my family  to keep my family.
And it used to make me almost -- took people to work everyday almost in our town.
I start to work around  and I start to work for the Germans.
39 Did you tell me how you were chosen to work there?
He got his  you know  degree here in Chicago   moved to Toronto for his post-doctoral work  then his fam moved with his family to New York for a number of years  and then to D.C. to work for the government.
Anyway the girls in that little village  since the parents had difficulties feeding them  would send them down to the valley to work as maids and prosper to find a husband.
When they need somebody for work they asked- they went to the (Counter# 100) to the town and they asked \ I need ten Jews  twenty Jews for work\   so they gave them .
So I ended up having a full time job  my daughter got in free  and I started to work for the daycare.
So that was  after 3 2 years of work for the Navy.
I was there in the blitz  and we did some  some undercover work in  in London  and then Paris.
Have you was your father involved in another kind of work  or business  or profession before he went and became involved in what your mother inherited?
So what did you do all day long in the ghetto?
By us we only did work and when we came from work they used to put us -- we worked like not melioration  we put grass in the -- the men were bringing us the water.
Did -- after you got married  did you -- did you work?
I mean  I work in an organization which is dedicated to this.
We were fed  and they ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 assigned us some bunks.
Did you get a sense through that work of the overarching USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 34 policy issues involved with -- with Jewish immi gration and some of the -- I mean some of the things that were going on on national levels  like this  the United States having very strict quotas and having a lot of [indecipherable] Oh yeah  I was aware of that -- by the way Ike and I got the job  through Henry.
He ended up being the Commissar de Police of Chateauroux  where I was doing underground work.
When you dont eat and you work so hard  all you can do when you come home is just drop and you just stay until they call you again.
And I immediately said to him  ﬁOf course I want to see  but you know how we worked every day long ho urs  and hard work  how was I to disrupt you and me from that work  and ask you about going to Darechen?
Just do whatever you have do  do your work  and don't be in the forefront and try to keep a low profile.
So I got a job with the Joint  as it was known  and after a month's indoctrination or so  I was sent to Europe and I was member of the first group of Jewish social workers that came to Germany to work with the survivors of the Holocaust.
And I we lived day by day and day by day and after I start to work  what I told you in the Husak.
And I was accused of refusing to do a good work for the people in the military because I could not help any wounded soldier.
In ot her words  what I had done in in Germany  studying law and being a social worker and so on  wouldn' t work  and then after a certain while many friends advised me if I would still have...like to do something with law so many newcomers  especially of Germany  had had had found uh uh a way to establish themselves and have a career in the field of accou ntancy  so uh I I went back to the University.
And his main argument was that he didn't want to work in a hospital as an orderly until he could get his board certification or whatever was needed in America to become a doctor.

Do you know what kind of work he was doing in the camp?
And did your father have what kind a work did he do  or did he do any work [indecipherable] after ward?
My work consisted  and everybody's work actually consisted  we took apart the bundles and we had to select them.
But very grateful that he took care of them  because I used to sit there and watch him work.
Have you been to the museum in Washington   the Holocaust Museum?
I sleep over in a in the room  so they next day  they say well  everybody  all the Jews must come and register to go to train  to go work  to work.
So the distractions are not there  and then add to this that what I chose as a replacement for it is to work on Holocaust matters.
In 1941  Manya was forced to work for a German company that produced military uniforms.
You're coming to our house and you're going to work in here.ﬂ I told him that I promised to work for a metal shop.
I want you to talk to me about what the risks were for the work you were doing.
I feel that this country gives the opportunity  you know  to keep your faith  to work.
I was a frail  in a way of speech  young guy who never did do hard labor work.
And you know  in -- within two days we went back to work and we carried on and -- and things got worse and worse and worse  til it carried on like that til 1944.
The gendarme had a plan  worked out years in advance of what they were going to do  and all they needed -- they couldn't get the approval from the Hungarian government before but under the pressure of the occupation they got the approval and they went to work.
Now  if there was no particular job for somebody  they would make them clean the sidewalks.
And  you work for Spiegel  and are there other people working for Spiegel  or just you?
Irving: 1948; January 1948 I came to the United States and by now I work as an engineer and design naval combat systems.
But the money was good  so I say  ah  hell w ith it  you work  you make a living and -- and my wife began working an d she worked nights for 10 years.
It was easier there to find a place to work and I knew some people so I...at the beginning I was working for two enterprises.
And after we started to work  around December  beginning of December  somebody gave me idea to write a telegram  to send a telegram to Arad  the Jewish community  to the Jewish community office  putting in that telegr aph  my name  the name of my uncle  his age  his wife name  and when he was living  the street.
He really liked his work and he knew that he had ability.
There is an in the mornings and an in the evenings when th e commanders come back from work.
You know  I went -- I applied to Columbia for social work degree  PhD. But just about that time  things began to be a little different -- or maybe it was different  New York was different from Indiana.
And the captain  \ Yes  yes  this is nice and go work.
Have you been to the -- like the museum  the Holocaust Museum in Washington  or -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 84 Yeah  of course  I -- because I had given them the belt -- I -- I dont know if you know all that.
You dont look for who -- for -- for your job  you have to work two  three years where they send you.
>> Bill Benson: When you arrived at Auschwitz  as you told us  your father was selected for work.
My recollection is that even your mother was involved -- in describing her experiences at the University of Warsaw and then the tutoring work that she did.
I mea n  they just out right told us we would be resettled to work in the east.
Is it -- Th-the whole time when I was in Germany  I did this work.
He must have  some kind of a work  be cause eventually he did do something to provide for us.
For months  because I ha d the studio already  that I didnt tell you  in Sherman Oaks  to work for me.
He hearing I was a chaplain became very friendly with me because I  he felt I was in the same work.
I said  \ I'm going to work my way through through through MIT and the reason is the Strassman's don't take charity from anybody.\
We went again to a Cayara di Piatra   where we really had to work at the stones.
We came by the ghetto area  we thought we're going to go back in to the ghetto area.
It was mixed  first were men which reinforced our false beliefs that they were taken to work.
And eventually  you know   it was a -- it was a -- in this business it was  if you know the busi ness  a lot of work  day and night.
what kinds of -- what kind of work did your parents do they sent them out to -- to do labor  forced labor?
Well  you see  I was in Germany  but I wa snt in Germany.
No  in the wor -- wh -- but the role call and the -- we went together to the same kind of work.
I volunteered wer -- to work in the social cl -- like federation in the cl -- British make-up of the so -- of the federation.
They used them to bring ammunition to the front line to do all kind of work for the Hungarian Army.
And  and they had a track there that we could that  that we could run on in  in order to keep us  keep us in shape  cause you know I guess a  a lot of us got out of shape you know based on particularly those who got sick  you see  and they had to work pretty hard  had to get through their land legs back again see.
But  I try not to worry about my children  and I have a lot -- I always have a lot of work to do and thats a very good thing for me  because I get very involved in my work.
Do the winery   I got  first of all  you have to light work  chemicals  light work.
She went on from Auschwitz to another concentration camp where she continued to do work -- >> Bill Benson: As a slave laborer.
The general work of the Joint  is there any way to describe that?
So  this is the only one who really was demoted  and uh later on and he spent uh time in  in bunker  but he was such an ugly uh fellow anyway  you know  he was such a  he  such a killer  that it really work for a good for a lot of prisoners.
They couldn't work  they couldn't do anything when -- because if you don't eat  you can't produce.
W -- I started to work in Poland in the Bricha  so we -- we took Jews who wanted to escape  and we smuggled them through the border.
I am emotional  easily hurt  ta ke things personally and all this didn't work.
I had no traini ng to be in an office and I wasn't asked to do any office work.
It was a time that I sort of felt I had to work and I -- you know  it is -- I had to go  I had to earn money  and thats what I choose to do and thats what I was successful in  keeping the job and -- because there were a lot of other people looking for jobs and thats -- thats the way it worked out.
The children were hungry w hen we came home from work  and they were along the fence begging.
These were all people who were deported  obviously  against all international law and without their consent  into Germany to work for war production.
I mean it would have been unthinkable for anybody to work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur when I was growing up.
For example  my sister Clara could not work as hard because she was 16  like us .
So I had to keep the fire going so the placeŠso they would be able to work  lay bricks and all that during the day.
Edith had wanted to be a nurse  but that didn't work out.
I could hardly move  but I had to go to work.
Then coming to the United States  how difficult it was to get started because I was still a scared child and then little by little to work all my problems out and find somebody that I had a lot in common with  to marry and have children and start a new life and though I could never forget what I have gone through  I still have to  and I had to and I still have to make a new life for ourselves  for our sons and if when they get married  for thei r children.
But  you know  I never tried to make somebody else do for me the work.
However  there were poor Jews who at the beginning they thought they would hide too  but they needed to work.
A young man who was staying near myself and he bit my finger and he said this way your heart will start to work stronger and you'll come back.
She had found work with a Mrs. Anstom who had 8 children and she came and for me after I got better and we worked at this farm  and she was just absolutely horrible.
Well  afterwards they uh...the Nazi Commandant sensed that there is still some youth left under 16 in the...in the work groups.
Theres a big different to have a hard time th -- I mean  hard life  to work hard  to -- to -- and come home and have a good [indecipherable] the re spect of your children are they growing  this is one thing -- Yes.
But I was on my fathers farm  on our farm at home  yeah.
And I called these people together who were on strike  and I said I would look into their salary claims  but not unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people leaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving.
Now the new Judenrat started to work and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman.
The first anti -Jewish law which was sort of the official anti -Jewish law came in 1938   it essentially said that no more than 5% of employees could be Jewish.
Did you and your sister do any work to support yourselves?
This was not a labor camp  this  this was just   St. Cyprien was just an internment camp  there was no work being done there  it was uh on sand  on a sandy beach actually on the Mediterranean.
You know  you could always find somebody to give them a little money  and to give me a job to go out of the ghetto every day to go to work.
And what was the work that you did in the office?
For the next nine months or so  I went from work detail to work detail  including work inside the barrack  until in April 1944  I was recruited to work in the ﬁSaunaﬂ -- the more correct designation being disinfection facility  where civilians were transformed into prisoners.
I remember having a German governess whom I couldn't stand  whom I had to go out uh walks with and the lady only spoke German to me and I had to answer her in German and I did not like her and I did not like the idea not being with my mother who had to work  but having some other people taking care of me.
My name at birth was Julian and actually my middle name Jacob  and my father and mother decided to call me Julian because they wanted an international name and they thought Julian  if I ever went -- were to travel  would work well.
It's a.... So she had to go to work in order to get that pot of soup.
End of Tape #4 28 Tape #5 Yes  several people were taken the Ninth Fort  to get out  and after they finished their work the majority of them were killed  and they're killed.
Were times hard for other people in the Ghetto  or was this Ghetto not too severe?
People who work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food  have to drink a lot of milk  cant do it more than so many months  I guess  in a year  and there are strict rules  but for Jewish women that wasnt important  so they didnt get fed  and they had to work very hard.
So this little incident what I sometimes wonder how that work ed out.
And with which he then went to work to bring them here.
The compa ny he was working with closed down and then after four years in Brazzaville  a cousin that was in Leopoldville called us to say  ﬁWhy dont you come here and work with me?ﬂ And then we went to Leopoldville to work.
JCC I taught and also I did some private work  when my kids were young as a reading specialist.
They didn't want too young because they wanted you to work in hard labor.
And I was he couldnt work  because he was coughing and coughing  and all the time sick.
I had to go out to work and that wasn't fun  you know  being in the strafkommando.
10 [Break in Tape] 02:07:26 Was it difficult when you first came over here?
So Im there -- whenever I want to work  I ge -- he and I have an arrangement  when I -- if I want to work  I work and if I dont  I dont.
And then we were told no  then  in the fall of 41  my father could no longer work  beca use he could not use public transportation  and he decided to spend a bit more time with my brother and me.
The first couple of days I dont think we did but then we were put to work.
So its -- its food  its clothing  its work  its movement  everything.
Because I have it so deeply imbedded in me  every movement  every step that I make  all the work that I did for the Germans  I didn't get paid for that.
I had special permission to come to the office only one day a week and work at home the rest of the time Oh  nice.
Pause- Technical Conversation) The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were  at the train station they were loading train cars with Jews who we re being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true  that they were going to work.
After all  there were also rules that after work  after sundown  none of us were allowed to leave the house.
But slowly  slowly  I start managing to get normal again and then I start looking for work in Haifa.
Because after a while  they became to be dependent on the labor forces--use to go out to the ghetto in different areas to do--to perform work.
>> Bill Benson: In August of 1944  your family moved back to Paris.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father in the house with you?
And ...and also because of him I got also a ea sier job in ghetto rather than going to work on air force...airport being I was still young.
And have you been a member of survivor organizations or any group of survivors?
I mean I tried to work as little as possible but still uh so there was hu...the SS was the main enemy.
Then later I started to work and later on I got my own apartment assigned.
Well I have on occasion but like people come up to the desk  the information desk where I work and say I heard there are Holocaust survivors that we can talk to and I say yeah theyre over there.
Oh  I didnt continue that I said well  in 84  in 84 I retired and I took my early retirement and and made a rousing fa rewell speech where I told them all what was wrong with government and with the General Services min Ad ministration in particular and it made people blanch  but I really loved the opportunity to use the commando spirit and in at least telling them how it was  which was pretty much off the rails by that time and I was glad to to get ou t. And I freelanced and I started to work on my book.
And he had a contract with the war department to work at the military government in denazification  and I happened to be in that department.
So I stayed there and I went to the military government in Ochsenfurt and I told that captain who I am  and I said  Id 59 like to come and work for you.
At the girls home -- before the war  Greek girls and particularly girls of good families never work ed  all they did was learn how to do housework  cook  embroidery and that was it until they got ma rried.
So we know that this was Succoth  the last days of Succoth where we go to work again the same way like every day.
Did you toward the en d do different work assi gnments or did you stay mostly on that one?
I think the soup kitchen  which they introduced so late through the yood-en-rod was a way of appeasing us  of making sure we would not be afraid to leave our homes  which would make their work easier  but these ar e hindsight.
Those were the three jobs I had  and I went to school at night  while I was there.
Regina's volunteer work for the museum includes working at the donor's desk  where you will find her Wednesdays  with the exception of today.
Was -- would you say it was unusual for you  as a young  now American  to come and do this kind of work in Europe?
It was going for a little while like this and then we are going to work.
And to keep me at work  which I ask them to keep me at work  do not fire me because I knew that we will be refusniks  and we have to survive somehow.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 7 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: belongings.
I lived in Haifa and I worked  found work with Esso Oil company at that time.
And if it was left anything  after the harvest  so a year of work  after the harvest you would ge t something if the harvest was Good.
Or we have to fill up these trolleys with sand  and we had to uh  push away a bunch of ----------- when we had to work  that very  that  that kind of a work  in the woods  we had to work.
I remember that he no longer went -- To work. --
Did she work with you both in Berlin and in Nuremberg?)
So I felt satisfied with what I was doing  and I was pleased with the kind of work I did.
I had experienced that on Jewi sh holidays I didnt ha ve to -- to work  so I figured here lets have somebody Chri stian have a chance to have the day off.
Le t me ask you a set of questions now  so that we can get some answers that work.
>> Bill Benson: Before we turn to that  as your parents began trying to think of how they were going to get out of Germany  Israel wasn't going to work  one of the memories you have is that your parents told you that it was urgent for you to learn how to swim.
And anyway  so the children were going to school  and the older one especially  she did good work.
My mother got word to me and to my sister   who was also working  this was not work on your free will  you were just told to work there  you u nderstand.
What she did was each time there was an opportunity to talk to one of the Russian guards  which was at work  and this she told us in the evening about  or wh en she got her ration cards  or when she whenever there was some contact  she would ask.
But I didn't want to stay home 24 hou rs with no children  so I started to work  manager of a thrift store Haddasah.
Of course I was already coming out of this labor camp  day  day labor camp  quite exhausted and it's of  manual work there  of digging trenches and the behavior of the Romanian military was worrying me.
And the concentration camp  meaning that in this camp it was primarily for work.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 35 Oh  you want me to  that way?
I dont re -- probably not  I was doing the heavy work.
The enemy is nearby and for your safety because they may bomb us  we will all go to work to the tunnels.
Only the women  we had a Jewish drugstore - pharmacist  so Jewish women but otherwise  Jewish women  well off  didn't work.
But I -- I di d -- I did work  and I did some active participation in the stores.
And not only my -- Rochelle did a lot of work.
So even if you had a chance to escape  and the chances were there frankly  at the place of work  in  in the synthetic gasoline factory.
Then when I had an apartment to get in  so s there I work I didnt want to stay by my brother  because the sister-in-law wasnt so well  she was an American  she had a di fferent view and everything  and and I saw that I am not welcome  so I said  I want right away an apartment.
And so he became friends with some of the farmers and he would work for them  of course it was for free.
We were picked up in the morning by the soldier  always under the gun  marched to the place of work  then we had to work all day to clean the houses  do the laundry  whatever had to be done  help in the kitchen sometimes  which was good.
And it came to a point that people couldn't even work; and the work was (cough) compulsory.
And they were just  you know  one room going to another and it was very primitive  we didn't have any furniture and we went  remember we went to Goodwill Industries and got  just a few pieced of furniture and my father had a really hard time getting work.
The Nazis  incidentally  had instituted a special labor offi ce for Jews shortly afte r the outbreak of the war  whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them  give Jews jobs mainly in the defense industry or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant work  like for example  the city garbage de partment  garbage pickup and similar things  and also they ride the railroads  certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the railroads on tracks and so on.
It says that for the family  but you can never guarantee because they were first of all  all the time  even later years  in 42 - 43  after young people  because they know they needed for work.
One was for the tailor and for workers like wooden work.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ETA HECHT page 8 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: March.
The only thing that I did do was  the...the uh teachers were sympathetic to me and they did work with me for many  many hours.
And I was there  and the boys  the girl had to go to work  in the woods.
Okay A2: N Many languages  but we didnt k now the language  and we I would ask them  where is this this no so we couldnt work it  so [indecipherable] so he went out  went out of the to and he star ts dancing like ahhh  its dance.
My brother and I would sometimes help him and I liked doing that especially because I think he used to tell us stories while we sat and work.
Some of the remaining youngsters were sent to Auschwitz to work  and I was among those assigned to a work commando in Birkenau.
When I came to the United States  I came at the invitation of my brother  who wanted me to work with him.
I-I -- I made a point  the first few years  you know  the fir -- after a couple years I said to my brother  ﬁY -- we have enough money now to -- we dont have to work so hard.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your father in his day.
It was heavy work  it was hard work  because you had to carry the branches  and then it was hard  physical work.
From here he gave to the workers every week or every two weeks a piece of meat that was allowed to them because of work.
But our main work was with prisoners of war  to identify students in the prisoner of war camps  particularly in Germany  cause we were in Switzerland.
No  work was five days  plus that ev ening after school  and I had one day off.
Ha-Has your work been  and your career been an important part of your life?
What kind of work was--what kind of factory was there that you were working in?
So the factory being built with -- near the camp where you were -- Yeah  tha -- yeah. --
They came from th e Congo and she wasn't us ed to do any work  you know they had servants there  the blacks and give them a pair of shoes an d they hung it around their shoulders.
I would take these boxes  walk around  come back into my place of work  put the boxes under the table  fish out the little gunpowder  put it inside my dress  call Alma to te ll her I want to go to toilet.
I the only the only little thing I remember was when I was in in I I dont think I heard any real antiSemitic remarks or anything like that  but when I was in Virginia   I accidently yers used to work meshugah.
I didn't work long and for two  three months and I was afraid.
I mean  to be able to conti nue our work  we had to respect those kind of rules.
Then they start marching and leavin g us fairly alone  on our own till they established a headquarters and a Gestapo  They caught to work.
This is another concentration camp  which was not a labor camp any more  it was only concentration camp.
If I came to the When you came to the museum  what were your thoughts?
We paid him  he took us  another couple  Jewish people  he used to took  take us out of ghetto and say that they are taking us to work  but they really took us to  we had clothes or something to trade for food  for bread.
First of all  the first change that might interest you was 1940 when my father was taken to this work camp I mentioned to you.
But the next day  we had to go...we had to go off anyway to work  so we went to work every day.
It didn't take you any place and we didn't do anything  so we used to work that time like this and then we went out when the food was ready.
You know having children and doing things and school work and all that .
So instead of doing road repair work they became human mine sweepers?
And the next day they have to present for work n o matter how they felt .
And and th I and I really enjoyed working at Latrobe still  especially when I become a hammer driver [indecipherable] and a lot of the times th-the driver wouldn't feel like going to work or something  hed take off.
Before that we had to have passes to go from one caserna to the other or if we had to work somewhere we had to have passes.
They came mainly from Poland to work the coal mining countries and then went into businesses  tailors  furriers  merchants  and they worked their way out.
But not in a sense of teaching me further  his items which I could do for him -- for the -- for the time to work -- Right. --
After the two weeks were off  they took us...uh...to the regular camp what they had  for work.
And that person  after having given herself to that work for three year -- three years  on the very last day  a few days before the liberation  she got -- she was killed in a bombing  and so on -- o-on the spot and her body was thrown on the wall [indecipherable].
After that  they were catching people  the German people on the street to go to work.
They used to cut  so the women were crying because they never  you know  they never did kind of work  that kind of work  cause you cut it in in in squares and you put it in the sun  you know  and the women were were were really...they were crying  so I told them don't do it.
In the boxes they had a lot of screws and nails and things like this  and this boy was also 40 going to work.
No appels of any kind because there was only 20 of us  and so me of the Polish girls  they left a few Polish girls to teach us how to do the work.
I mean  my mother never worked a day in her life  and ma and mo st other women certainly didnt  and the type of work that they had was heavy  physical work.
But try to work against it  that happenings like the Holocaust shouldn't have ground to happen again ever. (
There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they divided and they sent out cards what day each Je w had to work.
Well  you didn't have work clothes  you know what Im saying?
So th ere was a um camp that wa s being set up outside of our city  it was called Voltsehoff  uh  a uh German company I think  that was making electronics  uh  set up a factory with free  free labor  so my father through some protection was uh  and money  was able to um get to uh places for my mother and my father to work in that factory and to live on that uh  uh camp  working camp what they called.
No  I -- I really dont  but iv -- as long as my husband was alive  I didnt work.
I 34 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD was not quite 7.
Mostly  these police  \ Jewish police \  were there to protect the Jews.
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 57 So  did anybody have to go to work?
And every time I need him you know   we work together  so I you know  I am with him 10 hours a day  but still he he would never go to sleep without of calling me and asking me  Mo m  are you okay  are you do you need something  and you know.
Many of the young people in  in my neighborhood were admitted as students at Boys High School  which was I have to say it  a very elite tough school where you had to work very  very hard to remain to succeed and to get ready for college.
And then they took us now  I remember they took us to another camp  which was Buchenwald   and I 28 remembered it was Buchenwald.
And these were working pants for -- for when you work.
I says  I work for the American army and they pay me with scrip and thats wh at I have.
Because my husband and I did not know the language  we went to work whatever came.
There was no work to go to  there was just counting in and out  counting and sitting around  and being squashed by people.
That fact  that I had it -- a room away from everybody  that was a blessing  cause if I was to work in a factory  I woul d have to share wu -- probably live in a camp 143kind of situation  in a barracks  or in dormitories with a bunch of who knows whom.
04:27:20 You weren't aware really of a lot of efforts for people to try to sabotage the Germans in the factory or -- In the factory  special work we didn't have.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 50 50 And at what point did you realize that you wanted to do civil rights work?
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone  who was left in your household with you at that time?
And -- and they were tired and beat   you know  from the work that they did all day  and yet they would come with smiles on their faces and sing happy songs for us  just to keep us occupied and to give us something to do.
Just the name Berlin on the outside and in that book were pictures of men marching in parade but they werent equipped with Army uniforms  they were equipped with regular clothes  with work clothes  with uh seemingly baskets and then shovels on the shoulder and they were walking this way  this way  this way through the whole area there and uh what we found out was that they were not only being prepared for their part in the Olympics  but some were ready on  on the grounds.
But I didnt I rejected that because the other person who was in the deputy in the assistant secretarys job  weve had some differences  major differences and I wouldnt work for that person.
One day  indeed  the social work er came around and said we were ready to leave.
Each one of us did only one piece of the work.
>> Bill Benson: Even though this was a camp that allowed both men and women as slave laborers  how did the two of you have the opportunity to talk with each other?
We were so happy for our sisters and a few other girls from the town  th at we go for work anywhere but not stay here.
There are certain jobs women can not just do and men have to do it  but I don't think there was any distinction made and women had to do the same work as the men  at least they were delegated to do the job.
But we were very nervous  you know  and very temperamental  and we work very fast.
My father immediately  after graduation from high school  went to work to support his brother.
Well  of course  he continued his work with the orphanage primarily.
But this led you also to work a great deal with the military  I gather?
And he says he was doing some work  you know  tailoring.
I was going to school  public school but I always had to work because money was always tight.
Its  its  as I work with people  thats what I really try and teach them is how do you do that and  and  for me  the  the single most important clue is that when I was so unsafe and felt so defeated  I let the whole world define me.
She will not let us do it  because she will say  'It's too much work ' or  'Something may happen to the children or to you.'
You couldn't go out by yourself  surrounded by wire if you need to go to work to town.
Okay  some had bigger jobs  some had smaller jobs  but the Germans did it.
I think going to school every day  and from very early young age they teach you to work a little bit to keep you busy  and to keep you a productive individual.
The work that we're doing now in addition to care for the aged -- in Israel  for example  we have training programs for pr incipals of the ministries and municipalities to try to give them some notions as to how they might improve the services that they give.
So one morning I came in like 5:00  6:00 in the morning .
She had been taking medication for heart blood pressure  but after all  she was 82 and her health had deteriorated  she had congestive heart failure  she was hospitalized briefly and then just  the eve before my birthday  on October 26  1983  I walked in her room  as I did every morning to say goodbye to her before I went to work and I found her dead in her bed.
He was very competent  a very competent lawyer and a very nice man to work with and for.
And I like the educ ation field because you can influence the children and people and other pe ople and and I work in that field with when I was I had different job  I I founded a a Jewish school in th the mountains  the mountain there  the Catskill mountains.
DL] The radio set in the British camp  er  how did that actually work? [
Everybody wanted to have a work card  and everybody was preparing to go to camp  whether they know - knew where the camp was  because as far as Im concerned  I had no idea where the camp was  whether it was Majo wka  Strzelnica  or Tartak .
At that time the -- the Jewish police in the ghetto already had a stand  and -- Yeah.
After I went to work in that store where they sell the perfumery.
What I mean under Vaschek   Vaschek supervised their work  that lets say if we needed supplies or something  they had to tell Vaschek and he would do those things or whatever  but they were trying the best they could for the people in the camp.
When there came no transport on the end  when there didn't came any transports anymore  we know that's the end of our um  of our  that will be the end  we didn't know what was going on  we thought there wou-wou-won't be any work camp  but we  that was very scary  so  so  when  we were always  it is unbelievable to think this way  but we were happy when there came a transport and  b-because the trans port came anyway  and the Polish transport was much harder to handle than the Dutch transports when they ------------.
But  they were very  very pleased with our work because we w ork very fast and we did a lot of work for them.
Then I come there in the morning to work  three painters  and everybody has a can  like the milk can  50 people  10 people  3 people  the same amount.
I cannot forget how all these two thousand Hungarian women and the hundreds from our camp gathered on this big...big uh  23 This was evidently the Heereskraftfahrzeugpark subcamp  also known by its initials HKP  where repair work was done.
What special something do you bring to your work at the museum  thats the result of your experiences?
And while I was working next day  he said...[Solecky ]...\ Listen  why don't you work with me.
She must have waited outdoors or something  she came up to me  and she said  ﬁI r eally would like for you to work for Martins.
She never wanted to wash  because when we came back from work  you opened  no water  drops.
And just right after the pulcrum erupted many Jews were killed some of the work staff in this farm-like building where my grandfather had his works were burned and after the pulcrum the officer took my grandfather back to the place and on the way he asked him  \ why did you save me and my family?\
And after two one year teaching positions  you were hired again  to work with the captured German records.
>> Bill Benson: At some point soon after you were forced into the ghetto.
I was in ghetto  my father was too  he didn't go to work.
And I said  \ Yes  I have enough work but it's important for Montgomery County to do this.\
And he did so and I...he took over the whole organization work and he contacted other Vilna organizations and they organized altogether a movement by the name  name is United Partisan Organization.
Others were working out and in the beginning also I went out to work and we built the known Majdanek camp  Majdanek concentration camp.
Whoever came to me  asked for a job  he give me a days work and was honest and showed up to work  without any excuses  I didnt care.
This was my play and I didn't have much time to play because we had to go to work.
Do you remember how you felt about the work you were doing?
They were two complete ly separate I think that Stevens apparently did some very good work  but it had nothing to do with John Fords OSS unit.
And I told them  look  what they were doing to children  what I saw  and so on  I -- you are not go -- I -- I am going to do -- work out something.
Well -- well  I di -- I also didnt have  you know  because I -- I didnt at -- when I have to work  so I just -- I start to work in my -- in Lodz.
>> Fanny Aizenberg: Because of the union and too many people were without work  especially the war veterans.
So something -- my numbers may not be correct  or maybe the Germans were thinking that these guys were read y to work their butts off  hoping to survive.
Laughter ) Suzy Snyder: Did your -- did your mom work for the Germans then?
So we had to start a little bit to help to work  but we didnt got no professions.
They like when you work in the factory or stone quarry or producing springs or brakes  aircraft shells.
We didn't have the formal tr aining  but he knew what to do  social work.
And it was and they wanted th-they was it that they wanted that she be for be able to go to work?
So I went to him and told hi m a long story  the story basically was that my uncle was working in a local party district  registering folkshdum members and that in the -- in the crush and the busy work there  somehow the stamp got lost.
You know   give jobs  or say this and that has to be done  or complied with the Germans order that has to be done  but mostly it was the orders from the Germans that we got  or that they got to comply.
Then I had so much work  I had to work day and night to get it out.
3 And uh  about  uh  1936  in  uh  February  the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was banned.
We couldn't sustain all the people from the work on the farm  so the majority of the group went to Czestochowa  and they established a kibbutz there on Berka Joselewieza One  in the ghetto of Czestochowa.
Get back in your girls clothes and Ill take you to the work place.
They used to take coming in the morning and take out some people to work for them.
Well  my sister she was the one who went to Budapest  in 42 or 43  in between then she went to Budapest and she was a dressmaker so she was able to go there and work.
Whenever I walked to the street  and tried to go to work  I was beaten [indecipherable] direct to work  theyre being -- taking over offices and things [indecipherable] they want to clean up  so they grab people  Jewish people to work  and they kept us for the whole day.
And uh other two brother  Wadislaw and Frank  uh have a trade of tailor  making uh dresses and they open a small dressing...dress shop and uh were and have a few  about six or eight people to work for with them and uh and they fin...make dress  men's clothes  dress  for store...for store in Tarnow.
Also  when I go back  when I was in Auschwitz the time before I went to the camp  they give me they tattoo it  I got a tattoo in my arm because most of the people they sent to work they put a tattoo in my arm.
Unable also to work in France because they would...they communists would have suspicioned that I just had left...left my office  but still not being officially called Director  I still infiltrate all the possibility...possibility sections and bring...bring really for them great losses.
I stayed in the back  and in the morning we hear a whistle and there was a place to go out and they said to us  make groups we are going to work in .
But the point was we still had to keep double bookkeeping  until one of those days  and this was apparently in 41  one of the employee  he was not mad at me  he work over there a long time already  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 10and he knows me  and he saw me before th e warm I was in the factory involved.
This you know  this was your father  this was your sister  your mother.
Do you -- do you speak to any of the survivors who work at the museum?
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 One day we were playing.
And also  if you work with others  you can talk to them.
She had to work for them  and so it wasnt our business any more.
But I think I got into labor relations work because they were do-gooders.
Of course  it was going on for months  and later on they start taking us out to work  my two brothers and me.
They are delivering places to work  or jobs  better places  worse places and in order to get a good place  you must have what you could -- what you called protection.
As a matter of fact  I mean  I don't know how important it is  but it's just curious because now we hear about this that th ese young men gonna get flagging when I marched to the camp  to Auschwitz from my work  one day somebody gave me two eggs because we carried those canteens with soup.
Talked about the crummy bastards in the kibbutz who were freeloading  on -- on us who were working so hard  and they talked about the -- the guy  the sadana witha the guy who puts you in work places every day  and he always USHMM Archives RG -50.549.02*0051 60 gave you the lousy jobs.
They went in and they di d all that work for nothing  and thats what he wanted  see?
And it sort of made me a father image  young as I was  to my children -- to my sisters -- because my mother had to go to work and support the young family.
They -- they keep -- thats why they keeped us  to work.
And I didn't like the job because I ra ther do office work instead of being in the garment center  didn't pa rticularly like that.
So the work was much harder  so I didnt last there very long.
They had all the licenses for Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30  2012 47stores  for everything  for for like a a what is that shop  you know  where where you do the the iron iron work [indecipherable] Oh  a smith?
And I keep -- kept telling Allen  ﬁYou know  I should write a story of what happened -- that he actually made it there and he set up a Jewish state and everything was wonderful.ﬂ Of course the crusaders were there at the time  so it couldnt work  but anyway -- so I felt right along that I should go to Is -- but my mother didnt want to go.
Or  he pointed at a building   a hospital there   or we can find you a job in the military hospital.
Im just  as Im– you know  you dont always think about these things until you really try to  until you work them through.
So  now you're at Camp Sharp and s till doing your radio work.
Were boys expected to work and girls expected to be home?
With the people that went out to work  we managed to go into the ghetto.
You know  because the government did not accept any more -- the Germans did not accept any more of the Je ws at work.
Now  did you go to work for this firm in this camp-like atmosphere . . .
And and my my brother came and and they couldnt work any more.
So he and Leshno bribed also to somebody by the work somebody and they took a taxi on the Polish side and they went off.
I work in this factory  on an assembly line  and I as I am closing the boxes  I am reciting Polish poetry.
Really  but I was behind that cabinet that my father prepared for me to hide.
So they found out that  so I got beaten and I had to take off both my pants.
There was very stupid work but ve ry dangerous  very dusty.
And I could work and I had a one-man show  which was very nicely then .
You see  when the ghetto was instituted  they had the large ghetto  and they had the small ghetto.
And both my parent s were put to work in the Philips factory.
I worked  I -- What kind of work did you do?
We were assigned work deta ils; actually the beginning not the same  different details.
Now  just in terms of sort of the logistics  of the difficulties in terms of getting -- how you got food  how you got information  how you got supplies  how you got directions  how did this work?
This is the only Hungarian Jew who never ever attended the -- the -- the -- the hospital [indecipherable] or any -- and never was sick  he can work.
You were put on a hard labor crew to build the road.
What do you remember about when the Germans first came into your town?
Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19  2013 21 Did your mother work?
But theres no specific -- I mean  like for instance when you see snow  or something like that  does that remind y ou of the work camp in the mountains?
And it was that from the ghetto each day left the ghetto gates eight thousand to nine thousand people in various places of work.
I had to take off my old ones  take a bath  and go to work.
They sacrificed everything because the family always said  when I came from high -- elementary school  why dont you let her work and make some money and help you?
Our place was also hard work  but it was a better environment.
And the Germans said  yeah  we want to belong to Germany.
But I know that many people could not work any more because the employers didn't want to be accused that they were helping Jews.
Those people  we found out were kapos  other prisoners  but that's what they had to do.
At the time they thought all Jews would go to the labor camp and just work.
Everybody has to work -- arbeit.1 And start to be difficult life  but still we didn't know what.
We were no lo nger supported by the uh uh Albanian government and uh work ing permit as such was impossi ble to obtain.
There you couldn't go out  you couldn't scrounge  you couldn't beg  you ha d to work.
My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed  out of 36 the view from the Germans.
Where I work on Seventh Avenue between 38th and 37th Street.
And then the Nazi government  Norwegian  they had to give in  because the Germans would be furious if their laborers  all those  didnt get any food at all  it will stop all work.
Come  well work it out  well talk it out and well find a way.ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ He came back  he says  ﬁDont tell anybody that I did that.
So they send me the work  and I so I says  this place is too sma ll.
At any rate  and that well we we did a great deal of work on whats called signal transduction  which means what happ ens between the time these drugs  or the endorphins  bind to the receptors in the time the drug is abused or euphoria happens  a high happens  or pain is relieved.
They...we formed a...a Jewish community was formed like a work for the...the Nazis if need anything.
It -- not my own  but I work for somebody  yes.
And -- and -- an-and -- now thats -- [indecipherable] it was through the work that Id done for the museum that I -- and some other things  that I found that my great-great grandfather  Solomon  was one of the 13 si gnatories in Monasteer in 1864 for the bringing of the alliance francaise in Monasteer.
And somebody came to work that picked him up that lived in Los Banos  California.
Th ey didnt go to work like the Russian prisoners of war or the German civilians who could buy and so on. (
It was a very hard job to work there to do all the electric work.
When I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with  I asked him if he wanted the ticket.
Be lle talked about the discipline of hard work and that was very much our discipline.
If you could not work  they would open up  if you could not get up anymor e  they would open up your veins in your arms and bleed you to death.
The operation in Germany went quite successfully  I would say  because we got all the offices to work in the same fashion.
And every morning they went to work and they used to -- it was in the summer.
I worked -- I think I ran out of work and to the best of my recollection I needed money because I didn't get too much money from the men but they gave me food  clothes  very nice catholic people.

It means 27 of January 1925  it means that till 27th January 1942  I have not to go to work  because it was the beginning --17 years is the beginning of the first work.
62 Special commando (German); A commando of Jewish prisoners in the six extermination camp selected to work in the gas chambers and crematoria.
In other words I could go back to and resume my work.
They felt the war is over and they don't have to work any more and there is no reason why  everybody's free and why they shouldn't be free.
You could -- there were plenty of -- of -- of opportunity to wash yours -- to -- to -- to wash yourself and in -- in Osterberg it was sometimes very difficult to -- after the work  to -- to -- to be clean.
No  it didn't because Bert even though he was in a privileged position and he was getting special food  extra  he sent it to my parents  yeah  and there was a girl who used to work for him and she had tuberculosis.
They let him work there  he managed the mill at the same -- they took away.
In Pruschov I had the number of 25 113  and assigned to a barrack and made to work digging holes in the in the ground which was full of skeletons and and uh graves.
The place I worked with at that time was a department store and -- and they had an elevator for the employees  and the walls of the elevator were so buckled that the elevator couldnt work.
And then you got a kitchen in -- and there you went for food  they give you some soup  a little and a little bread  you were hungry like a dog  with such a physical work.
One of the companies that hired him he did work before the war  and  you know  they took him on as a jeweler  and he was able to -- but he didn't like it because he had to live off alone by himself.
I just knew that Jewish people did not work in the fact -- in the plant and that there were no Jew -- Jews living there.
Then you try to work harder than the other one  you want to be better than the other.
The work detail o ffice went to the individual barracks  because they had in their cardex the road workers  good road workers.
And then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at night  there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to eat and you went straight to bed.
And I went back to the candy factory that I used to work and I asked them to give me some sugar  whic h the man gave us sugar  and so I took it back to camp.
And so my father and mother in anticipation of being shipped to Poland  having to go to Poland to work  got nice bundles of backpacks.
Anyway  when we were there  we still kept the office  but I dont reme mber any German being with me because Vaschek didnt work there for a while.
And I know there were two or three other children who were learning aroundyou know  we were learning about the same material and that if I finished my work sometimes I was told to help Jill with her reading  and I was rather proud of myself that now I could read well enough to help Jill.
The Russians were coming  they said hey  you can work for the Germans or you can work for us.

Sometimes it was  it was Eva Edmands 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 dangerous work because he'd sometimes  he'd be called away at night.
My father  who was unable to find work because they wouldnt let him work  was in a -- sort of a desperate situation and as the war years came along  it became even more so.
The farmers in the in the village of Klenowitz used to operate in such a way that their family homes were in the village but their their farms  their fields  their animals  were further in the mountains  and they had a second home there where they used to stay during the summer when they had to work in the fields.

At the morning  you know  we got some black coffee and a piece of bread  and we were -- we have to walk over there to the factory.
He said  you will work and help us to win the war.
Everybody said  oh  you're going to work so it's not the worst thing.
I could not get i n. The only way I could get into the Warsaw ghetto is with a group of people who went out from the ghetto to work.
So he was apparently taking  at that time  everywhere in the country  people during the winter were just suffering  because they had nothing to work  not hing to eat  and so on.
Then the Germans emptied the camps and they put the people to work  death -- Death March.
Uh we were going to work - these were probably the most horrendously difficult months  the first three months.
And very often when he has to go back to the offi ce in the evening  I go with him  and I can always work in my office or in my area  in the shop  and wait for him.
And my girlfri end  she was  which was a seamstress said  \ If they...\  she was the older between us four of us  she said  \ If they put you to work on machine  sewing  sewing machine  I am sure that all the machine are electrical.

He was I work in the kitchen and and there was in the appell  I supposed to go to the kitchen to work.
Was able...not quite a few but I think no one was ready to make the choice that I I can leave Hungary and I remain because I have a a work to make this  so it was really in the like a romantic hero  and my husband was very very fond for Komo Otto.
I mean she did social work and now she had to learn to cook.
When when you would I I suppose you and many other G.I.s were eating the spaghetti  how did that how did that work?
And  one more thing I forgot  then you got in and it was a tremendous hall or house  an old Jewi sh lot  it was a community house  and there were already many  the mood was not bad  because they said  well finally we get there where we will work and after the war we will come home .
They did all kinds of testing to see if things would work.
He -- whatever possible  he sometimes  he work with a medication or something for -- so he was also my friend  but that was not a friend that really  because -- SE: Hes a very selfish guy.
And I stayed there all the time til I came here to the United States  they treat me very well  and -- Did you work in Australia?
Nobody went to work outside the ghetto and I got mission  a certain mission to go in another place  to say a parole  a certain parole  I think that I remember the parole  and they sent me again in another place.
They go  they work  they work seven days a week just like my husband worked.
I had my pare nts  you know  and I had my school work and I had friends  an d I was eight years old  you know  and as I sa -- as I tell my granddau ghter now  being eight year s old then and being eight years old now is an entirely different story.
First I did the story of his wife  and now Im doing his story and its absolute ly thrilling work.
A lot of times after work I volunteered to clean up the club for the German soldiers where they were smoking  drinking  eating.
We came to the same lager and then they selected us to go to work.
I came into work; my supervisor was awful nice to me.
Those who were officially -- there was like people who worked there and they were also very educated people because they tried to -- you had to a lot of influence to get off the street of Warsaw and work in orphanages.
Eventually  everybody was moved to the Ghetto  and to once they were in Ghettos  they organized working brigades which is one way they go to work  manual work.
And I think my work relates very well to my experiences of other people.
And shes the one told me that one of -- she thinks that one of my older sisters was in -- the older  older  you know -- the sister  she would have been that time  she was about three years younger -- she saw her one time in Auschwitz so I began think she was picked out to work instead of going  you know  instead of going.
And I happened to be around  so I moved up in that absolutely new area for State Department work very  very quickly.
If my parents need  we will work for them  and we should stay together.
They were supposed to go to work in Germany and said -- so I had to deliver this .
I don't take off from the job today  I have to work.
I mean  if he told him  ﬁYou have a 105 fever  don't go to work.ﬂ He couldn't do it anyway because he couldn't go to work.
Did you have anything happen to you while you were in Auschwitz?
Well  before I was selected for work  we had this horrendous experience with the Hungarians girls.
And then terminated my work at Drake  went home and oh then two or three weeks afterwards reported to then Fort Crook for induction into the actual the actual service itself.
At what point  I remember you telling me before  at what point did your father didn't he have to go work in Wilno?
Can you tell me a little bit what you did after the war?
It was very important that I speak about this because people think of gas and beating and sickness and starvation  but people were killed by simple work because people were unused...they're not accustomed  many people were not accustomed to working and with us in Kozel was a large group of Dutch Jews.
But  you see  I always say if people think they do a crime and they will run away and hide out  huh -uh  doesn't work this way.
He didn't work there  but he just happened to pass by.
I cannot say this oh  you know  because I did not work ed here.
And so i -- When did you finally retire from your work?
So  when there came a transport we know we had food  and we had  and we had clothes  and we know we stay alive because we had work.
I worked there  a couple pe ople worked there  and it was fairly  you could sit  you didnt have to go out side to work in the street.
So  there was a mysterious death that the plane landed in the water  because the steering mechanism didnt work.
And then one day  he met somebody and they and they told him they are looking for a pharma cist to look in  to work in a pharmacy because it was the Jewish ho spital that was in the cent er of the ghetto and they needed a pharmacist.
Where people dont own anything  they ju st work for a government farm.
And if I were to be an educated psychologist  psychiatrist  I could on it and write very nice  scientific work about the human behavior  because I've seen it first hand.
And when that was over   there was a transition initiative that the federal government created which meant the transition of handicapped students  special education students  to the world of work.
They just killed people they couldnt send to a work camp?
And then we used to go work in the factory  you did mingle with the Germans because you all were involved in producing ammunition.
>> Bill Benson : What was the labor that you were forced to do?
I just love to work -- I almost feel I work fo r him  because he represents the person I respond to  and he taught me a lot of things.
So they had a cook and a kitchen -- you know  like in their quarters.
It wasn't all kinds of different work  but they came -- some of the Germans wanted to have something done for himself maybe ev en.
And so  as I came there  we decided to go back to the ghetto.
So they only people in this one room that I was sharing with like I said the other people  other families  was also occupied by an elderly couple who didn't work outside the ghetto  who were the guard- ians of a young granddaughter  who may have been 3  4  5 years old.
And I was assigned there to work there by someone who had worked in the Czech government in exile and who went back to Prague immediately after the war.
We worked with civilians  Polish people   who were coming to work in the factory and then would go home.
And I was brought up that it was my job as much  to help with the family.
So  I had to make things in stock at the beg -- at the -- under -- in the s-stores  where those dresses were prepared for newcomers  that I did during the day  and -- and when -- when there were -- were not enough  and we had more people to go out for work than we could paint.
It was very hard work but after the work in the area was finished  they dismissed all the workers and that meant my father didn't have work.
And when I arrived everybody treated me as Captain Eaton   and and my driver was sort of amazed that I nobody criticized me  and then afterwards a decision was made to clear with supreme headquarters what to do with the general  that we would use him to work for us at Radio Luxembourg   and in the the day or two that this might take  we put up the general in the hotel  and my job  I was in the same room with him  was to take him for walks  see to it that he got his rations  and talk to him.
I was self-conscious of my English  and I thought I would go to work.
Million jobs  but I always I was always lucky to get some work.
And and then we used to come back to the barracks.
Social\  insofar as you can work all day and drink beer at night if you wanted to.
And it didnt work out  so Jerry and I got married and -- and we came over here and -- and Bob continued to be a very good friend and when we found out that we had to leave California  we decided to go to Denver  Colorado and he and his -- he and his wife we re our very good friends here.
So I had to go to school  so I went to night school.
Did you  did you have friends who werent Jewish  who were  who were questioning your teaching Jewish children and enjoying them so much or did you experience any sort of derisive comments for doing that sort of work?
And this kind of work was terrible  because you didnt have gloves  and you know  the cotton has pins like this.
Well  it was getting orders that camp was going to be inspected and trying to get everybody to work  to see that things were clean.
When I came to work and the same guy who hit me with the two-byfour  he said  \ You know what you did?
My friend Josef was working for the Gestapo -- the Gestapo [indecipherable] yeah  doing all kind of -- of hard work.
They put us into  into the camp and inside the camp was another tent with barbed wire around it.
And a Gestapo group came in and they said we knew that you were Jewish.
And so I remember that for for weeks  my father and and his other colleagues  you know  switched locations where they slept every night  so that they could not be easily found if if cause usually when they come to arrest you they come they dont go to your place of work  they they come to when youre sleeping in your in Interview with Arvydas Kliore February 18  2013 21your apartment or your house  whateve r. So they they were well  you know  scared of getting shipped off to Stutthof and so they they did this.
A little bit later orders came  and a mistake was made  go to work.
My father to the last minute still had good ideas  that theyre not going to hurt us  theyre going to put us to work.
And then one sort of interesting after development  I-I had discussed  quite a bit earlier  the former cl ient of my father  who was also a furrier and where I went to work once a week on his estate  so long  as a gardener in the fields.
So long you work  put your twelve hours a day  you're alright.
You got your place over there and everything and then we find out we're going to work in a coal mine.
The gentiles  they were obliged to stop work too because they couldn't do anything.
The other work we had to do which also protected us at that time from being shipped out were building the gas chambers in Terezin.
But also we work  on a farm you know  that was a hard work  but we dont mind.
05:13:47 So you just walked away from Schorka from the resin work camp?
By the Germans if they started to take people to work  usually Rozia was not taken to work because she lived not in the town  this was in the outskirts and the Germans didnt go to catch Jews to work because they were mostly like Poles and they didnt take the Poles.
FEDER: Initially  it was a problem and then when our people in the States went to work in the Jewish community in Brazil  talked to the government   it was worked out.
Mrs. Vanderlinden had to change work  change jobs  but they were willing to do it.
O.K. Then we are still in the factory  we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the kitchen to bring in the lunch for the group.
The faucets didnt work  the toilets didnt work but you could tell it was a regular high school like we almost have in this country.
And uh we were told that we were going to a family camp to work and that we should take our children.
I was worry about that I not going to be able to to do this kind of work here  you know  they here they are crazy  they go to the factory  you have to really know what youre doing  you know?
And we actually got among these people going to work and so by when the  avoided then go to Prague.
In this potato field  we worked together  Ukrainian girls who were from the countryside  who were big and strong and for whom this work was nothing special.
Probably  lets see the Selma case was earlier in ‚66  she came to work in ‚65.
But I worked  I could work in science the kind of work You can work longer?
I remember my fath er having to go to a gathering place every morning to be assigned for work.
Nathan: Then from Cremona  you see  I  from Cremona  I used to work and design this.
And the young women  that we were  we were staying there and sent to  to the camp to work.
My sisters never said you've got to go to work  which was probably good because I failed typing.
We came after work  they never took us back to the ghetto.
And there were indeed people  and I remember one couple that did not look for work.
The kitchen was a working place  and in the kitchen  we ha d a huge table  but it was a table that had like sides all around that was used like a work space where they were kneading the bread and cutting up the meat and doing all kinds of things  and you know  and baking and cooking and washing laundry and everything.
And then  so he star ted to work on our friends and they used to come to me  \ You have the opportunity for your children  for the future  to go\ .
We thought he is not normal  he goes away from the -- from the good home  and he used to say hes as hamed that we are making money easy  you know  he believe more you have to work fo r your money  not just from business.
They send us to Russia to work over there for... five friends and those Muslims.
40 People were dying  but not in our section  because in our section we didnt have to work.
The only thing they could do is to put you to work.
The rumors were actually in that ghetto that those people who work will be much bette r off if they don't work  meaning that you better have a place to work and then you'll be ge tting some kind of iden tification card that will help you survive.
We we nt to work in the morning because my father being a military person and the Germans also gave him a job as a supervisor.
I believe that received the report on a Saturday or a Friday evening  and we were informed on a Monday morning  and then I immediately work ed on it and fixed the dates.
And my place of work was going to be Q 721.
So  one day we decided with my wife to go see the art show and look at the work of the artists.
I -- I had no recollection of the Holocaust except after the war as a teenager by -- you know  I was 10 when the war ended  11 maybe  and b-by then of an age when all of this made sense to me  but -- and then Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 40of course my sister -- excuse me  my fathers sister  my aunt  who survived  Helene -- Helena  s-survived the -- the war in a Nazi work camp  what did they -- La-Labor -- Labor -- Labor camp.
So she thought that would be safer  because the Polish people were very goods at recogni zing Jews.
I could understand they would take away people because they need peopl e to work in the factorie s  on the farms.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 36 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: it was addressed to a Dr. Bloomberg and we had friends--Dr.
They were saying  oh  your prostitutes are taking to to Siberia  they will learn how to work.
First there was certain communication between Lithuanians and people in Ghetto  because people used to work outside of the Ghetto  and everybody knew somebody in Lithuania  or if they didn't know somebody  they would say would you like to buy a loaf of bread from me  and used to tell stories  what's happening.
He used to take me to the doctor for monthly check-ups  practically  til I was working for him as a forelady til two hours I came home at night and I took home a sample to make for the next day to take to work  to be able to show the girls how to do it.
And he -- and he -- I told him to do me a favor  and he did.
Oh  there was one time my mother worked for a while forthe first family treated her so badly she said she would not go to work for rich people again  she would go to work as a general housekeeper to a more middle class family  and she worked fo r a family where the wife was American.
My mother did an awful lot of philanthr opic work in our town and I remember they organized camps in the summer time for nee dy children  Polish  Jewish  Ukrainian and there was always an awful lot of activity and it was a very happy home.
And when I saw what she did  I said to her I can do the same what she did  sh e --and then I did the cutting out and was in charge of the -- of -- of the room  because at that time  the health service was new in England and you can only get the working permis sion if they havent got any Englishmen to do the work  or English women.
Because the Germans had us all lined up to be killed  and he came and he talked to the Germans  and they let us go.
Well  just to work hard and do the best you can  and make something of yourself.
So anyway  I came up the next week  I came to work and I see the bi he introduce me to the big foreman  and he says  oh I hear youre a tailor from home.
Maybe -- Maybe I had  but I didnt even -- End of Tape Three  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 92 Beginning Tape Four  Side A This is a continuation of a United States -- United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer.
What was your job when you -- That's what I did.
Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11  1999 80 Yeah  so it didnt make any difference  it just except we switched the ranks  so to speak because I basically we have a nucleus of certain people that do the work and we feel like we cant be somebody else doesnt want to step in  so we feel like  between us  well do it.
>> David Bayer: Well  every morning when we were going to work  the roll call.
And when we went to the Were there guards were there guards while you were walking?
I know my father was an outspoken optimist and ﬁthey dont mean us  we only work there.ﬂ And certainly all of us expected us to work and after the war go back home.
We hired someone with a truck who was delivering -- >> Bill Benson: Gasoline.
He says  ﬁYou don't look to me that you can still work.
In the evening when you came home from work  each barrack had to go to a consumer's place where they brought in all the bread and sometimes a little margarine with jello.
It would have been too dangerous to endanger the other people in the group  as well as our good work place.
The reason I said that is A  I had no money at all  and B  more importantly  I wanted to learn something so when I get to the United States  which I had in my mind all the time  I'd have something to show that I would be able to make a living.
What other job  you said you had a job digging out in the ---?
My -- I was charged with the work with the whole data acquisition system and analysis system.
It was hard work  because we had to be there I had to be there at eight oclock in the morning  and then we worked til about 1:30 or so  and then there were two hours off  and then I was back at 3:30  and then we worked til eight oclock at night.
Because in this letter  she was saying \ I can see the shadow of the legs of the prisoners coming back from work \  so the window of her cell must have been facing one of the main road where the people were coming back.
But they -- they didnt mind at all  they said  ﬁLook  if you dont work  you dont get paid.
And naturally we was being in the camp in the tents.
The first Judenrat of Lvov -- I 55 remember going out to work  coming back  a nd there were 12 people hanging right across the main gate so everybody could look and see.
And I dont feel its brave of me to work there  but its not -- its not the most amusing thing  lets put it that way.
They there were obviously teams doing that  I mean  the army had far more facilities and personnel to do that kind of work than we did.
There is some interesting work being done on this in Germany today.
How long after the Germans came  were you in either put in  or did the ghetto form around you?
We go a little bit early to the sleep but meantime I forgot to tell you...the very same day one of the guard come and he says he needed two men for some kind of work there  for short time  so he took two guys and they were there oh I'd sa y for a couple of hours.
But when I did heavy work once  he took me out  and let me do a whole day  we had to  uh  with soap that people brought  we had to make it in little pieces  and we had to  had to do uh  work with soap  and  and um  but also I  it  I  I was afraid for him  scared to death for him  of course because the man  they can change like that  uh  with  with  with the idea  what you have  and I was afraid that uh  that Frenzel  uh  that people would  would see that  that they  that he was to me.
They were helping to introduce to maki ng to work  you know all these forms to fill out  who you are  what you are and they were .
With him and with other younger pe ople  he was instrumental to work on a place called Hin Prague which was the on ly place left for us to go.
I think Im very proud of the work that weve done on behalf of coal miners  who have refused to work in unsafe conditions.
And as he had just pre -- previously been in the Yugo slav army  he knew that area and he was telling these guys  oh I know where this is  this is not bad  lik -- well -- well -- well try and get  you know  get together and all of these things  and maybe it will work out and so on.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 18 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: Why?
So when I heard there was a possibility to go to a satellite camp to work in a quarry  there I went.
The work camps turned out to be pretty much extermination camps.
To clean the snow from the railroad tracks  work in the street  this started this was later.
And there I remained in charge of tho se for a while until eventually an ambassador came for the four and State Department said you dont want to work under him.
Only what they figu red is 18 to 35 people who could eventually go and work in their factories.
There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto-bites-on   that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the Ukraine for work.
And its interesting that the thing that people would pick out when they want to hear something from you  is this thing that really happened in your distant past and really has to do with your roots  which hasnt been so much the focus of your ve ry significant work and interesting work.
They went in...covered head  and calling up the out-cries    and they went into the gas chamber at that time when outside we didn't work.
He said  ﬁNo Christian  no Jew  nobody is allowed to get in.ﬂ And he said  ﬁGo!ﬂ And I looked at him  and hes furious at all the people who work there.
We'll see that you do something  but God's will they picked him and sent him to a coal mine and they sent me into Germany to work in the train factory.
You come to the [indecipherable] room  and I went every day to work with him.
And at that moment  you see  where you were at work -- I am work  you see  I have to leave this place as possible  as fast as possible  to get out  to have a chance at -- and suddenly  they calling for the professionals by -- by the baroof -- baroof -- 60 profession.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 3 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: EL: I was in Kovno.
What kind of work did you do after your husband died?
My mother was a very  very hard working person  I guess by necessity  because my father didnt work.
If you didn't look right to the camp commander when he passed by or you didn't work hard enough  or this bahis didn't beat you hard enough while you were drag in the sand through the desert  he would take you at the end of the day  and he would say  \ Quinze jours---------------------.\
In the beginning we didn't leave much  but later  again  we had to go to school and we had to leave the farm.
At one morning  we were told that we're not going out to work.
They're such good people that they do such wonderful work  why not keep them?
They were very diffident of course to give up their lists and having such a very short time in Prague I had to use kind of black mail tactics bringing up eventually I think it was the communist committee saying that I had one list on which I would work and the others could join if they wanted to  otherwise none of the lists would be considered.
I'm not talking about right after the beginning of the war and people were seized on the street and put to work on rubble.
Y ou know  some of the Germ an SS sort of favored some of the German girls an d saw to it that they had better work assignments.
And I got up and I went to the cest lappel and she was trying to hold onto me so I shouldnt collapse out there and dragged me to work and then she came to help me out.
I -- when the teacher needed a helper I was ready  because I didnt work.
And from what I read about your work  that would be hard-hardly a word that you would use  because you want to talk about the Holocaust in context.
So  we arrived in Retzow  I think we regist ered there  and then we lined up for work.
They were apparently concentrating all the people at that time  but basically there was a work -- there was work to be done in our town because of the munitions factory.
Germans raided up the areas again for young people to go to Germany to work  they were sl aves.
The order was 24 hours where no one could go to work at all.
They got lists what they had to take along  because they were going to a camp to work and to  uh...they had to bring their own clothes  all things well-known by now; so my par...my father bought them and bought  uh  backnaps and he bought  uh  clothes and my mother sewed the tapes and we each had one; and it was already there all the time  as for all Jews  not only for us.
I was doing this type of work  but in the time this experience I had one day a German came to me come we me.
Ukrainians  Lithuanians  no  th ey are all who work for the SS  you know?
They made a day when if you were at work that day  they picked at random a day and if you were there  it was called in German the schteichtag .
In that respect I was lucky  I always got good jobs.
My father worked in abandoned salt mines assembling rockets  horrible  horrible work.
In 1947 I was assigned to work for the second annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund  which was being held in London.

She would work in the political -- she would come by  and she would ask questions and she would come around.
They have embarked merchandise  and like here  for example  I dont know how -- how railway stations work [indecipherable] we have people  and we have cattle  and we have all kind of things.
Yes  quarantine because t hey had to make sure that we healthy to go to work  was an ammunition factory.
But  when the Germans were fleeing and trying to escape and wanted to dismantle the machinery   this nice Germans came in to our camp and asked for volunteers.
You had to work hard and try to make a good beginning in a country.
Draft age Jewish boys were put into these notorious labor brigades  doing horrible work  including mine cleani ng wa -- with their bodies.
Where uniforms  German uniforms were repaired and perhaps other repair work was done.
Im going to get in touch with my brother and I think he will agr ee to shield you  and you work for my brother.ﬂ That wasnt easy  because when you lee -- left a town  and I think its probably still so in Germany  you had to go to the police  you had to fill out papers that you were leaving such and such a residence  and you were going to such and such a town  where you were going to live in such and such a place.
That  it is not that they just had to work there because they are all volunteers.
And finally I looked around and my friends who were in Connecticut and they said maybe you want to work for  lets see what did I do t here.
Did you hear about and they selected me and Hannah and the same to work and that was heaven.
We stopped work at seven and the curfew was at eight  so we always went out a little bit.
Didnt say anything to me or my brothers  but you stay hom e  and your mother has to go to work.
My brother  again  back to my brother  on su -summers  he would work there at the dairy.
My mother realized that it would be very difficult to separate me from Mima and so her plan was for Mima to continue to care for me while my mother went out looking for work.
And then they started to work for you  and -- and you got to like Julian slowly.
When the -- When the Negro movement started coming out  you said in ‚54  I was totally i nvolved in my studies and you know  work full time and trying to take as many credit -- cred it hours that I could at college  and there were too many things on my mind to get involved politically.
So  she came to work right  probably right about the time of the Voting Rights Act.
How long did you continue to work for the Czech government in exile?
They were to catching the Jews like you catch dogs  in the street.
And the boss just looked at him like  you know  when he when the boss left  he comes over to me and says  Ill tell you one thing Saul   as long as you gonna work here  you never gonna get a raise  an increase.
em long pause.. not really working hard at anything because things were quite disorganized eh I eh one day eh I I was eh almost eh told that that I had to join the brigade eh that work eh in the stone query and that equalled to almost a Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
She used to cook for them  you know  some food  and take over there.
And the Germans really were not very happy to go in that area because they would have got shot.
You know  that I think what I remember  I remember that when we go from work and we had to go home  we had to sing  and we had to go down and up.
It's a time -- and I had arranged to take him out from ghetto to run with him to keep the place where to 41 work  but it didn't worked out.
Then one day we go out to work and then all of a sudden at 10 o'clock come  be assembled and...on a certain area there and we were led into a railroad cars  passenger cars  and all of a sudden the rumor was that we are going to Auschwitz.
Again  I had to make it clear that I wouldnt work on Saturday  I wouldnt work on Friday afternoons  or would go home early on Friday afternoons.
Well  you see that okay  I work at the desk one one day a week.
You work in the hospital  those big ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 rooms with 30 wounded soldiers  they came from the east.
First of all  we went to Bangor  there was a theological seminary in there  non-Jewish  that wanted to have some kind -- it didnt work out.
That was still in the Hamburger Kaserne  and it says here that I can now work as a nurse  and am permitted to wear a uniform  and it was signed by Erich Munk he was the health officer there and dated as well.
It was not a work camp like Auschwitz was some times.
But anyway  he -- I never went back to work there after that  I ne ver went back.
Tailors work hard  but they don't have to cut big trees and get in the river  pushing them around.
Not at all  no  she you know  I mean  the day wa s basically her day was basically shed get up in the morning  go to work  you know  come back from work  you know  after many  many h ours  tired as  you know  ma ke something to eat  you know  and then fine and fall asleep  and The same thing repeated in same exactly  you know.
So I started -- I was taken on a detail to work in a spinning mill.
So I did all this preliminary work  and Li nda sent everything to Montreal.
We were supposed to be there at 8 o'clock in the morning.
If they would take us like murderers or whatever  that means we would have to work in the woods and they would give us some eating.
As long as we had potatoes  we had bread  we had water  we can live  but if something just didn't work very we ll in her household  we could sit two and three days without food  without anything.
And my father and my uncles  they went out to work  so we would see them in the evening.
So  when you work hard  it doesnt matter what  if you work hard– then when we knew we were going to lose  its– and then you did lose  youre sort of prepared for it.
Again  my father did more of the physical work of going to the slaughterhouse  and bringing sides of beef into the business  and so on.
And also the rest of the work of the slave laborers.
Yeah  and thats how I learned I learne d a lot of things to sew in the in the factory when I used to work  but I worked there for about I worked in two factories.
After a year or so they Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 40 took me to work in the office.
They were told one day they have to -- to send 10 000 Jewish men for work.
And my oldest brother  we used to have correspondence once in a while when he find people who work in Birkenau they used to send us sometimes packages from there and letters.
So I always had some money  you know  for these things.
Martin Blake knew a lot of people politically as well as of course his work for the school and he was very friendly with one lady Doreen Wariner who was the representative for the British Committee for Czechoslovakia and was given the job of going out to Prague and heading a movement to try and save those who had ar rived in Czechoslovakia and were politically endangered since the Germans... when the Germ ans... if the Germans arrived.
Nobody knew him and he went th ere to work so they used to share him with the potatoes and the flowers and that's how they how died  they had nothing.
But you didnt have to work that day  or did they make you work?
He -- If he tried to escape  he probably was caught by the Germans  by the Gestapo.
The arbides deenst had only one thing to do to make available the -- th e amount of people  but the -- to make available the people -- Was the ar -- was the work service. --
It was -- it belonged to Romania originally  but then Hitler and Horthy -- >> Bill Benson: He was the leader of Hungary.
But we had only two sm all rooms and he would work a whole day and at night he would come; or whenever he would co me  he would bring some bread with him.
When she married and had a first child  which was me  she would not be hired to work any more.
I do it  all the work  what in a service station has to be done.
Anyway  the -- you know  the work situation was not conducive to a happy feeling  depending on who you were and how you fit  you know  but being who I was just -- I didnt find it any more chal -- not challenging  any more acceptable  anyway  for me.
Th e next morning we left  you know  as if going to work  with no particular luggage on us.
So he worked very hard and studied very hard to do it so quickly so that he could go back to work and earn a living.
So Shabbat was it was a work day for us  we couldnt afford to keep the store closed and I guess that sort of set the pattern.
I should return to Slonim and work with the underground so I followed that.
And then to the  he left and went to work in Texas with that heart specialist  DeBakey.
And he proudly notes that by persevering  Fairfax County  Virginia  has also now established an annual \ Day of Remembrance.\
And here is a case here I went to work  I wouldn't even dreamed about it was going to happen  and get killed.
So I went to work at a factory that was making maternity clothes.
The Einsatzgruppen come eve ry day to that slave labor camp  and if you didn't line up for work they knew how many each barrack  in the front of the barrack how many they need people.
She said  \ Maybe you'll be ours will be maybe our Block will be lucky to go to work.\
And again  like in my Warsaw uprising  my first day  I didnt find my mother  because she was at the Gdansk  in this territory  looking for my body  because again came some messages that Tadeusz  he work in Sofenwalda  ah  yes  he had the problem with the legs.
To characterize the work that we do  we do everything from pr enatal care to care for the aged.
Now I -- i-in some of the work that -- that Ive done  I noticed that for long periods of time in the ghetto  the men had more jobs  many more jobs than the women did.
So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work  when the work was finished  they let them go.
I says  how you gonna work with small kid  thing like this.
You know  I got work right away  and my husband couldn't get a job.
And I dont know how many Germans -- a lot of Germans knew what was going on.
But she was at work when I called her this morning  and she didn't have it with her.
When I work at the Information Desk  even if it is sold out  I always find a little reason to give them tickets.
They are very tired of the long and heavy day and they are moving very slowly  but Jews dont loose you faith because the time will soon come when we will be free  and we will work for ourselves in our own land  our country.
And so you did that for what  a couple of months?
We had to work 36 hours  36 hours because...because we gave...gave...he knew that...and it was a Ukranian.
And then I worked for a neighbor who had some German blood in him so my mother felt it was good to work.
And the schools were very small  about sixty  seventy sch... uh seventy youngsters and I got scholarship and uh then had to uh work after the six months working on the uh agriculture school.
Did you have  were all of your friends Jewish at the time?
She was a pretty good seamstress in her own way  and I did some odd work  deliver pape r or whatever it was and got some income as far as that was concerned.
As a consequence  although we had all the amenities that Bergen -Belsen provided  we did not go to work.
My aunt had a -- uncle had a dress store  an elegant dress store  and sh e could perhaps work her way into that.
To show you the logic things from a person  regardless if you stand with a gun  if he has nothing from the work and you don't feel like working  nothing can make you.

In Warsaw was very dangerous  becaus e they keep people from the street  take to concentration camp or to work in Germany  because a soldier were fighting  therefore  for work  they took lot of Polish people.
But I only know that during this time  it was a because it was an organization in Germany during the Weimar republic which was called verhein  means a-an assembly  a group  for Germans in the foreign countries  especially in the Austria  Czechoslovakia   where the Germans were the bordering countries  here was such kind of an organization and they wanted everyone already in the Weimar republic  they wanted everyone to join this organization and to work for them.
Anyhow  there was...uh...uh...we... we...we would get up in the morning and we would work.
The other ones  who he found old  not enough good to work  and so then we were separated.
But I had a very strong need to work  to be independent because when I was growing up my mother -- my father was  of course  working  my mother wasn t and my mother wa -- had to ask him every morning she had to ask him for some money to -- to buy grocerie s and to buy necessities and he would always -- he didn't have very much  you know  my -- we had it -- more than plenty to live on comfortably  but not -- he didnt have really em -- any kind of bi -- money to s -- extra money to spend.
Were you ever put on any work details  or -- No. --
Well  we had as I say  my cousin tried no  they went to Palestine because it was  you know  it was a way out of Germany  but we knew that Palestine was hard work and very physi cal and we were no we were in a we were in America and we really didnt consider Palestine as a as a as a very pliable option.
And he he used to work for for this Albert  his name is.
He was home for at least one week because Yugoslavia had a law that only Yugoslavs could work for Yugoslav firms.
I didn't love that my little work too much  but it was alright because I still at this time uh uh rema ined active to...in in in in Jewish affairs  especially with the Jewish community and youth work.
We used to get up in the morning  4:00 in the morning.
The other twelve hours was the 'strafe and then it was again my time to work and it was at night time.
To work ourselves and have a good life and an education.
And you were obviously sometimes doing work for those people  as well.
And so she says  well -- when she couldn't go to work anymore I was on my own.
And what would happen to them if the Germans ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 32 had known?
And I worked fo r almost a year for Montgomery County  and then we went to Syracuse  and my two children were born there  and I went back to work as a social worker.
So when it came to Rozias time so she was notified and she went to work like other Jews went to work  cleaning houses by Germans  cleaning the streets  throwing away snow in the winter.
They kept them in the factory until they finished the work.
How did you get to the next -- to the work camp?
Even though my parents didnt always go because it because of of of work.
She got a Polish baker who work for her  Tomek   and he he took this this lady  and he buried her in a field.
I mean  there was a -- a f -- couple o-of prisoners work in the camp office  and they we re the one that wo -- w -- ha -- have access to information such as that.
They  right away  they took the young people for work and my uncle  rest in peace  he was one  the first one.
And  sometimes during when people were working  during work  and consequently that made it very  very difficult.
A is a cell  very strong  be...below  again below the surface and they used to...used to take them out of the in the morning a nd they used to work while chained.
And tried to get an interview with– I think the Civil Rights Division was almost impossible to get in to  because there were only– they only had about eight lawyers that were doing civil rights work.
Luckily  they were very nice to us  They gave us food  we ate with them and my mother helped them with the farm  with the work and I did some work.
Now  simila rly  similarly  when two months after I came back  so  when I came back to work in 1941  say in early November  by mid-December  the  Bucharest gave the order to give us food .
The only work I do  mostly its volunteering for different things and thats what I have tonight  the volunteer job and tomorrow.
Then in August we were suddenly a ssembled and taken away from our work places and we were put on freighters of barg ers (ph.)
In that time we had a lot of work and the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular transport from Minsk.
But the third time  it didnt work anymore  and. . .
By the time I was 15 1/2  I was growing up enough  old enough  they put me out of this kind of job  and I had to work for the military industry.
The work was determined  creating something extremely new that will turn the tide of the war.
And my son was on a work study program in Israel at the time.
Is that ultimately what led you to volunteer at the museum?
And so we moved to Cumberland  Maryland and he got to work for the navy naval reserves office there.
And  in about three months I got my own -- I was work for the company.
And I star ted to work in the city hall  in a French office of dealing with the Germans.
Sam did it personally because h-he he during his work still in Brussel had many contacts here and there.
And so he would work during the day and come home at night to the ghetto.
They took to the ghetto young people with one child or two children and those who worked for the uh they can show papers and those special papers was called the   and if they got the   that means if you work  then you could go to the ghetto.
But for the line up for the factory -- in fact  at one time  I also went to work in the factory and I dont remember how long I worked there.
When we had gotten back   the six girls from the -- from the work commander at the Baltic sea  we did move together into a very old shack at the end of the ghetto that had been unoccupied.
Would you allow your daughter to work in that office?ﬂ My mother said  ﬁSure.ﬂ ﬁWell  she doesnt get much money.
Now  of the 102 prison sentences  that's where I believe that the Clemency Commission did th eir nefarious work.
So at the beginning...I mean it was hard but but but I also considered bearable  but then  you know  not a couple of days later...was early in March  uh terrible rain storms hit the ar ea and the area became muddier than before so the work became more difficult  es pecially when you have to carry these cement bags.
You know  Israel is not as -- so easy to go work in banana trees.
>> David Bayer: Well  I had a lot of Polish clothing hidden with the Polish man who used to work for my father.
She was a professor of soci al work in Bryn Mawr  and for quite some time I stayed in her house  and she was a president at that time  or the founder of this refugee section  and she knew that I knew typing  a little shorthand.
And how did you take care of that  when you were in the ghetto?
In terms of your work  what wa s the hardest thing you had to do?
I made a decision to go to work because I figured like that.
Eventually  yes  a man in our hometown who survived  he was with my father in th in that camp where they gathered them all when they discovered that it wasnt really a work thing Right.
And I do remember Auschwitz had this famous sign  Arbeit Macht Frei  work makes you free  I guess thats what the translation is.
So we did a little bit at a time--our ration of water we put into an old pot there  we had  we cooked a little  we gave it to the sick ones that couldn't work and couldn't get up anymore.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 125 She did work with him  when -- when it was really necessary.
In the morning  we marched out; we were watched and marched out to work and in the evening we came back.
Demolition work I did  I would say til end of May. Til the end of May. And then you went  and you said that you have this profession  yeah.
And my mother then received a a proposal to go into town and work for the Polish unit that was taking care of the of the refugees and things.
So  they had to stay there  and they were forced to work on the farm  in the same place.
And I just say I work on 30  37 th street off Fifth avenue.
And sure  you cou -- you could talk to the others.
End of ‚58 he came here and we as -- advised him to go to UCLA  and he went to UCLA and he started to work there and to study there and hes a -- hes a very  you know  because hes my son  hes a brilliant young boy.
The Germans gave out or ders that whatever the Jewish families have -- even radios -- everything has to be brought to the police  and the Germans probably took it from the police.
And she gave him an unpaid job there for the community  what he did he never really talked about and he was  I mean like in all other things  very close mouthed  but I know he had some work at the Jewish community that may have exempt ed him for some time.
A nyway  there was a lot of panic and chaos in the ghetto at that point  and a few days after my sister left  my mother came home from work and she says  \ It's time to go.ﬂ And so  she made me dress in my best clothes  and  again  I still had that coat with a few sewn in coins  and I put on my high-top shoes  and she got dressed and whatever she felt was still not threadbare  and she made two little bundles  one for myself and one for her.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 9 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: when things calmed down  Mr. Tory who was secretary of the  of the council of elders invited me for  for an interview and told me that uh the council of elders will help me to continue with this work as it is very important for the archives.
Who made the business  they made it  th ey didn't allow us to have land  we couldn't work in mental  in  in governmental offices.
I said to my all people there  \ Listen  we have to lie down.
He was a cabinetmaker  I was apprentice and he was teaching me.
I would work on the three civil rights workers case for quite a time.
So but they they si this a ll prisoners  you know  who work over there  they told us what is going on.
First of all  I was asked by my former boss to consult for another year for the company  because there was still a piece of work that I had USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 86started  that was unfinished  and he was not planning to replace my position.
And people who were able to work were put on a boat.
As long as you are able to walk  able to work  you were valuable to those people.
And uh I I asked them that I would love to work  because uh I just cannot stand  you know  cleaning outside.
They killed bankers  they tried to kill the commander of the American forces in Europe with a mortar shell  when he went to work in the morning.
Most of the work of the partisans was to disrupt the progress to the fro nt lines  the German progress to the front lines  to fight the Russians.
And then he said to me and this barrack this man that was involved with the for the work.
Its not easy on me  but I needed work  and I have to stay.
And they starting already talking; they say  \ Oh  when somebody goes to a work camp  then my father will be sent away.
This was like -- the ghetto was already -- no  the ghetto was not.
And -- What -- what -- how did you feel about be ing in -- being in Germany again after the war  and doing this work for the American army?
If youre a citizen  if you -- if you dont work  you were subject to -- to be scrutinized  and -- and ask -- be arrested and ask you where do you live  who -- where do -- how do you live  where do you wa -- are you l-live from black market or something  you di -- Right  right. --
She was helping my father to make a living by being a seamstress.
And there were already some people and they were just giving us work right away then.
But that hiding business  it's hard to explain because we lived in an atmosphere of terrible  terrible fear  so for all I know maybe my father tried and it didn't work.
So when we heard that everybody who want...who we knew that going to work is gonna live  survive.
And I was able to get Jean to come with me on that  to work on the case.
And were people near you in the barracks going to work?
And uh  since uh it appealed to me most I  I decided to go into printing  and I began an apprenticeship in that field uh  uh with a local printer  but after a few months uh the authorities uh also made it impossible for me to uh to work for  for a German printer.
Yeah  is -- i-in the Auschwitz  or maybe -- probably it would have been in Auschwitz.
And tunnel work was  we had no idea what it's for or what weird looking thing  a mountain and into it are cut tunnels  one after another  like maybe seven or eight tunnels and they told us  you are working in tunnel seven  remember that and the outfit for which you are working is Holtzmann-Polanski and those same firms are still existing in Austria.
We got the sense that we got to move into the ghetto.
This woman that hit me  she was  she was strong  and cheeks like this  red cheeks  and not like us  that we  we just had no food  to eat  nothing  starving  and had to work.
And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with wood  he owned a lumberyard  and he was also very handy  actually more than handy.
When I came in this country  I went to work for Edna's uncle  who was an uncle the Pepsi-Cola owner from Pepsi-Cola in Munich -- in Richmond.
And then one day nobody went to work  and then we went to work again and then after that nobody went 23 to work again and then panic started in the camp.
We used to go to work every morning and come home in the evening  and that was going on for quite a while.
Many of them ended up working in my uncle's factory  because they came in and they needed work.
So if you were on one of them  you had to work.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 33 By that time I had done a lot of things.
And the mine safety and black lung work sort of go hand in hand.
You have the every day work and problems and so on and that goes  the dreams.
When they could no longer work  then they were taken into the gas chamber  and they were told  remove their clothing  that they were going to get a shower.
And if they didn't count us  we didn't couldn't go to Sam Spiegal 20 May 3  1995 work until everything was counted.
There was not enough work within the ghetto to fully employ everybody.
And now I work  say two hours; and two hours I worked in one small Kommando as Schreiber.
But when I ended up in the hospital at Luck  thats where they nursed me back to  I guess  reasonable health.
So that somehow  because then they started - people were beginning to be shifted  because I forgot how it was - I think Majowka 36 people used to work in the sawmill  or some thing  or the brick factory - I really dont know how it was all decided who worked where - but I do know that word came back to us that Hania and Krysia survived - no  the word was not ‚survived - that they were not shipped out.
They happened to be Polish  and they were there not as prisoners  but they were taken from Poland to work in the fields because their young people and old people and whoever was capable was fighting.
And when he h eard my arguments  he understood completely what I was aiming at; namely  that if we now established a big rescue operation in the embassy here along those lines you are thinking of  we will not ha ve any possibility to act as an embassy any longer with our ordinary work  and we won't be recognized any longer as the Oder Swedish Embassy.
But everybody  of course  was very involved and very interested and cared a lot about what was happening in Germany  so my -- my work there in military government was -- was highly respected.
Because you had an enormous amount of work to do in terms of -- Oh  I remember I had once to bring a very Orthodox Jews from The Hague to Duchorn  that is a village outside Apeldoorn.
So I subsidized that with sometimes being a Cashier in a supermarket  washing windows  doing any kind of work just to get additional money.
Of course you had to and you got certain uh--uh certificate that you could stay in the ghetto and work there.
So we go to work  we didnt know if -- wh at is going to happen now.
And they used to take us  and a lot of people didn't know how to work.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 30 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: country and Lithuania was agriculture and people were coming to spend their vacation because food was so much better and tastier than in Germany.
You dont have to work  you have bed  and you have food  and you have -- I want to be independent.
My father also ended up in Buchenwald in an adjoining barracks  which was separated from ours by a fence  and because I was getting enough food during the day while I was working in cleaning up the destruction  I was able to give him some of the food that was allocated to me in th e evening when I came back from work.
And Did your mother work with him or did she have an Yes  she was also the brain of the business.
Although my 13 father did work in a different place  but at nighttime we saw each other in the barracks.
And the -- So it wasnt so harsh under the Russians?
Some grandparents was left their children because that...everybody went to work on the air port or whatever...the brigades.
After a while  it organized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the ghetto working.
I forgot to tell you  when we came here  after a very short time  we get the  oh  at the American Consulate  they told us that if we go to America only for a year  my husband is  can't work in America because I get the permission to come to study  not my husband  that means he can't work because he doesn't have any basis to work here.
So I went to work for eighteen dollars a week  but that was money.
And I guess  by virtue of their -- their work  which -- and Im not trying to be critical now  Im just trying to say that -- that -- that they try -- they thought they were helping  you know  and then since they werent  they obviously had a more privileged status that the Germans didnt bother them.
They came back from work and they had been to ld they did not perform prope rly  they were sabotaging German wer -- wer -- for these 150 germ -- 150 Dutch Jews  who had arrived at this small camp  which was about 600 people  to repair railr -- railroads  and then -- so Mikes fa-father and brother came back from work one day  and they were accused not having worked properly  and they s -- wanted to make example of them.
We met w ith Langbein on occasion  but there was no massive movement  because the inmates themselves we re unaware that these negotiations were taking place  and in fact when we later distributed these funds  we found very often the inmates came and filed claims when in fact th ey had not worked for that company or did work for that company but not in a plant wh ich was authorized to receive compensation.
So fortunately I was able to conti nue my work as a researcher in the system of the academy of sciences  and I di d my research there  which apparently was important enough to be picked up by American sc holars.
And through his work in this rehabilitation center  he found out that that was a mistake.
I was living New York and I was still working for Outdoor Life and he had just  he was out of work at the moment and so supporting the two   two of us.
And we went out in the morning and came at night.
Here you go to work ; the children are staying by themselves and there is no food.
And so  I traveled to 'Buda' and I was fully accepted as 'Anna Voyachickola' and they handed me a lot of hard work that I was 12 really not accustomed to.
After your you know  when youre in this village  and you and your mother work  and your sister is telling fortunes and getting you know  shes getting sick and and then is relieved from having to work like you and your mother  I want to find out what happens then.
So we became self-sufficient  and we had to supply ourselves with food and and and  you know  and clothing and Interview with Witold Pawlikowski January 21  2015 102 So your mothers work stopped.
And she stayed and worked and so [indecipherable] after my work and after the war I went to the city Koshitzer  and I met her on the street and she said  come  visit us [i ndecipherable] go to a restaurant  she said come  visit us and well have supper with us.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 18 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: other than that it was relatively quiet.
Some people said it's better to hide in that Malina  in the hiding place -- Malina was called the hiding place during those times  a Malina -- some people said it's better to go to work.
They put us on the trucks and we traveled a few miles away from that spot and there was a train.
But in or der to become an auto mechanic the first year we had to work on bicy cles  the second year on motorcycles and the third year on automobiles.
And I hope that it really w -- is work -- worth it  you know  that -- thats all I can say  I -- I hope that its really meant th e way its said.
And of course it was ideal because it was in France  so I would have disappeared in Fran ce  would have been ideal solution  but it didn't work that way.
So within a couple of days we got a joint list and we discussed at that time how the office in Prague would have to work if I could be successful in London.
And he suggested prisoners of war in German and practically everyone they don't like  but would liked to have work for them but not propagate  so that they don't endanger the German stock.
And that is what saved his life because he didn't have to work outside in all kinds of weather.
So  I went back to work  and a few weeks later  my boss Henryk Neftalin called me into his office and he said  ﬁIm transfer ring you to the Statistical Department on Plac Koscielny  4.ﬂ I didnt want to leave because Id become very friendly with Spiegel and I did not like the unknown.
In 1976 through a friend of mine who used to work on gr -- eyeglasses frames  representing a Fr-French factory in the United States  I was given the opportunity to go with him  and to represent this French company from 1976 til 1991  where at the age of 70  I decided to retire.
There were people around us  Polish  Russian speaking  and they signed like an affidavit to become Russian citizens and work in Russia.
Says  well we are  you know  we were in labor camps.
Cause you said youre now in Saint Louis   and Yeah  and I had this other friend with whom I whom I known because of my work and and we always but this this navy the the sailor kept wri-writing to me.
The man decided to go  I dont know what made for the decision  probably there was still some sort of hope that they would go for work or something  and that  how could they hide?
And she had some wounds on her knee and they didn't let her go to work  and they put her in a separate block.
They said that they take that -- took them to work.
So  the 1939 Club  organization of the survivors  mostly from Poland  was organized quite early  which wa -- I was active for awhile there  and I have a picture  I will show it to you  where Im being given a-award for that work.
I don't know if I mentioned  when we were forced to leave our apartment where my parents live from 1936 to 1944  a German family moved in and took over the apartment.
Whatever they did  some of them later  I I I dont know  but I think they were instrumental to to star help others to decide that they should  you know  work underground also  like like those six who worked against the Soviets.
Some of them were shot and the bodies  the mutilated bodies  sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before uh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it.
So Mrs. Green and I  we were outside  and we did work.
So  if this is the case  are you any lo nger doing any work with the underground?
Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families are going to be together and work .
Right  and we have just arrived  an d we were actually sort of waiting.
Were the Germans in the ghetto  or were only the people -- the Jewish police in the ghetto?
>> Bill Benson: Susan  told me when you were forced to make the submarine receivers  you were told if one didn't work that would be considered an act of sabotage.
There was at time that -- in Poland was very anti-Semitic  and [indecipherable] all over  and there were no -- as I said  we were -- we were married July the second in 1933  we went away for a few weeks  and then we came back to work.
Every evening when I come home from work  I was able to get myself from the warehouse  they had a warehouse over there  get me a change of clothes.
And that was -- that was unusual see  because there was a such a big farm  so ma ny acres land and everything  you know  was plenty work  you know  but one of us gotta go.
Tell us about the work that you were made to do ther e. >> Manya Friedman: Well  for some reason  you know  when I first arrived  we were s tanding in a row and the German overseer selecting girls for certain jobs.
And when they heard– I hated St. Louis  I just couldnt find anything redeeming about that  that city  and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this  they took me to Aspen  Colorado and they said  ﬁYou can always work here for a dollar an hour  too.ﬂ And I loved it.
I remember I had a habit and we wer e joking with my fellow survivors always  even a few years ago he was here from Brazil  Shlumer Schmizner  survivor of Sobibor and he was joking  \ Tom  \  he said  \ I used to ride with  work with you in the street of Lublin and there's a truck stopp ing  a military truck  and you see a military  a truck  you was  you went crazy  you just went straight to the driver asking  where are you going?
I I immediately got a part in a play because the word got out that Id been on Interview with Hedi Pope November 6  1997 57Broadway  you know  that was so so this this marvelous man  who was a well-known Shakespeare scholar of all things  gave me a part in the in the in ﬁTwelfth Night ﬂ and sat down with me and work ed on pronunciation.
Do you see people  do you go out  are you busy in the community  apar t from your work with the society  are you -- Oh yes  yes  we had so many meeti ngs  by gosh  you know  almost every week meeting  you know.
And the kind of work that defenses in eviction cases  consumer cases  all the work that we have done.
Interview with Edith Langer 30 We had to work all the time.
My -- my -- my colleague at the time was a -- was a professor of child psycholo gy who had done a lot of work on childrens attitudes -- international attitudes.
Looking forward to the gate to walk in  we saw the sign  the famous sign that said in German Arbeit Macht Frei  English  work makes you free.
If I would move during the day and the neighbors knew that Frania was at work  it would be very suspicious so I was not even allowed to cough  not to breathe loud because on the other side of the door there lived a family  there lived an older woman who was all day at home and she would have noticed that something is going on in the apartment.
As a student I was not allowed to work  so I was a burden to them for a year or so.
End of Tape #1 13 Tape #2 Okay  I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Minsk ghetto before we move on  what you can remember about the daily life  or what kind of work you did.
Why should I work for nu -- for th-the money that you pay USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 72 me  nothing  35 cents an hou -- an hour.ﬂ And I told him  ﬁListen  if you dont want to give it to me  Im quitting.ﬂ So the end of the week  I quit my job.
My mom was not so ve ry good in her health.
And my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night time  and from the cement and the powder and the water  and I can't even explain  and it was going on.
Will you give me my pr operty back?ﬂ ﬁDont worry  you will work in your property.ﬂ ﬁAgain you avoiding my answer.ﬂ He says  ﬁDont worry  we going to come pick you up next week   you all go back home  youll be very happy.ﬂ Well my father told him screw it  Im not going to go ahead and deal with this stuff.
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 95 So obviously I didnt go there  but Yeah.
And that was going on for a couple of months... Tell us about the work you did.
Because she had no -- you see  the work service had the request for 50 people who can do road work  okay?
He was a sculptor and he was make a face for Hitler and I have to assist him  but before I came to this in this camp and in this castle  I was doing  I was doing all kind of work.
Oh yes  well the war came  and I decided to work in a ca -- in a -- with an organization called the Auxiliaire Soc-Sociale  w ho were taking care of -- well really  what we later called displaced persons  but that is not -- they were called refugees then -- came into Paris from  you know  all the places that the Germans had already overrun.
So I was his {l76}  I used to work with him  you know was secret ary.
I mean  and th en when this one pers on got out  then they would put another guy in there  strong  work in the mines and everything and just let him die and then they take him over to the... Some of these people that went to the crematorium  I heard that were still alive.
People keep asking me did you know so and so who work ed on this.
The police immediately are known  get the place where you work.
And we found work what they call the Doldatenheim  a soldier's home.
Here I wa s. As long as you were in a work group  there was still hope for survival.
The only thing is like like you say in social work [indecipherable] you see  the most important thing of a person is be able to listen  listen  you see.
I worked  nobody came in to check me  what I wad -- what I work  but I wa -- they were -- just want the acceptance if they came -- outside people  if they came in  they want to have them h-have the um -- our -- pi -- pi -- our officers should give them permission.
Wh-What about your sisters and y our brother  did any of them work?
There are good people and there are bad people and I love to work with a lot of different people.
>> Martin Weiss: My father -- anyway  once we were separated  men from the women  picked for work  we were sitting -- we were standing in a huddle.
>> Nat Shaffir: The Iron Guard was very anti -Semitic  actually did the dirty work for the Nazis.
And he went to work an d I was alone with my parents  w ith my sister and they told us this  this ghetto and we have to be there as soon as po ssible.
He said I he ard you are a very handy boy  you know electrical work.
The others it was different and the work teams  and so he used to take pity on me.
I was nervous and to meet my sister and see how  how it will work out and I couldn't see her  because I couldn't...I I pictured her entirely different.
Well from there which was a huge camp we was moved out to Auschwitz. [
And after that he discussed it with other people who were in that line of work before the war and they decided to start.
After work  I came in and worked in the clothing store til 12 o'cloc k at night to make a few dollars to get an apartment  you know.
But the decision was made  since he was the older one  he had already completed scho ol  he was already  you know  an apprentice at a electri electricians job  to take him along to America because my father was unfit to work  he was emotionally  physically broken  he really never regained his health.
And then they were taking young people to...to work...to work camps in Germany.
If they had an overcrowding  then I -- I mean if there were too many within  they figured  oh  might as well take people that are new  theyve still got strength to do work  you know?
You will get all the education so that you can work  and life will be different for you.ﬂ That was my mother.
And my mother wanted to work so that I wouldnt have to go to clinics and he didnt like that too much.
Could you talk a little bit about the work that you've done?
But we were taken by German train; again the Germans were uh meticulous in what they did.
indecipherable] yeah  to behave  and to work when I will have -- when we have to work  and then we will be free.
What they didn't have the material there for me to do something so in the meantime  there wa s a railroad station about a mile...two miles - a mile away; and they took us there to the railroad station to work.
You know  she -- they gave her for work  you know?
And the same time they maked me...not to come during the day but to come...that's how they mixed up people...to come in the night to work.
It was very challenging and I had a lot of work to do and a lot of catching up to do.
And I was uh able to do some work for that uh commander.
And then they told my mother they would not have work during the winter for women  and during the spring.
And there they took away all the youngsters and of course  disabled people and old men who could not work and my brother was taken away at that time.
Then I went to work for Lincoln Laboratory  which was located in those days at MIT.
Did you do this a -- do you remember  di d you do this on your own  did you decide you wanted to do this  or did s -- did your parents -- Yeah  it was -- it was fun for me to go be among other people and do some work.
But what it meant: if you are not going to get work immediately  then be [perfect ] that you could go on.
Well  th-the -- th-they were -- I dont know who -- who they were  but that -- but that was from the high authority  you know  we need so many for this  so many people for that work  for that work  and I was assigned to -- to iron those -- those uniforms.
Instead to go to work  I got back my job to go for merchandise from the other towns  and I got the pass.
And we stayed...we used to go both to work  my brother and I. And she remained at home hidden.
That they were planning on running away from work  they were going to go out from ghetto  they were going to go to work  and from there they were going to run away  to go to the partisans  to meet him  but it's a long way they have to go. \
Th ey find out that they supposed to be killed because the Germans  they knew  they did after five  six months when the people work in the crematorium  they were sick and tired  you know  and disgusted.
Treat th em good  work with them slow  dont rush them  you know.
Our biggest effort was  in fact  to allow young people to come to Denmark from Germany  young Jews  and to train them as farmers in Denmark and after a year or at the most two years th ey could continue to then Palestine and work then in the kibbutz in Palestine in a very positive way.
Have you ever encouraged other friends of yours who were survivors to work at the Museum  to volunteer?
They were a lot of kommandos people wh o used to go to work every day and come back.
Thats where they lived and all I knew  in the morning I would go into -- I think it was Hampstead or West Hampstead  to go to work.
And all what it went bad with Germany  he [indecipherable] tried to blame it on the Jews.
That's all he had to work with and that what he had to do and that's the way he did it.
I found people and I had to keep them alive and I had found work and rations and food and money and places where they could stay.
So he said  you are not going to work  40 I will show you.
On the way to work  at some points  we almost brushed against the barbed wire fences.
I'm supposed to be re tired  but I work all the time.
See  I -- I did a lot of phone work  I m ean answering the phone at work over there.
In school  did you intermingled  or did your family know any Jewish people?
Do you -- were you aware of efforts to sabotage work in the factories  or for people to try to get out of the ghetto  any kind of resistance?
And uh .. I went to Springfield and I guess I hung around for about two or three weeks doing nothing and just enjoying this wonderful country and all the opportunities and I decided that I wanted to work in either a wholesale or a retail business.
Can you describe your -- your six panel work that you did relating to the Holocaust in a little more detail?
And that sounded as if your mothe rs resourcefulness had been at work.
So  there was an advantage to that because Father was always waiting for me to return from work so we could have a meal together.
And I don't know what it was  he was also the one that told me when I was so sick  and had typhus  and he kille d all the other uh  people  say \ Back to work.\
People started to work  some people started to work in Jewish agencies for the American government.
In any of the work that you did  did anyone do any sabotage or any resistance?
It was a job inside  office work  ﬁo fficeﬂ quote  unquote  but still it was indoors  and working indoors made a great deal of a diffe rence  and we went back to the barracks  to the original barracks to the group from Starachowice  and when we came in nobody could recognize us  nobody.
One day  I was supposed to meet somebody  somebody was going to work with me and he was going to bring me the sticker.
See  that was a big difference between this and the concentration camp.
They overlapped the time coming  returning from va-from vaction  from furlough or they uh didn't show up at work   or they run away from work  and I have to take care of them.
He says  you know  I work at post office  and I work in that department  theyre asking for 57 bookbinders in  what was it  San Francisco  and in Denver  I think  and in Washington.
And then there came some men  I dont remember them  and now we were shaved -- then we were shaved  here  here  here  everywhere.
I would go very early because the first shift  if the shift was going  I had to give them the work list.
And I went back over there and I find out in the work  I have a cousin over there.
To be deported  not as they said  to be resettled  but to work but for one thing namely to be exterminated.
And there were those people who didnt want or couldnt go and were able to afford it were more than happy to pay for the days work to another person  and in most cases  the people who were filling for this person were people who were displaced  who needed the days work  because when they went to work they got paid from the man whose place they have taken  and they have gotten a bowl of soup and some bread on the job.
The old -age home was the relatives all had to work.
Obviously as the -- a good -- a good deal of the -- of the nitty gritty and of the really the day to day and night and day type of work  it always had to co -- to come down to a smaller number of people who had to devote all their time to it.
We got married on Tuesday and we left during that  after the wedding and went around the coast of Houston  where I had to report for work a little less than two weeks later.
From there  I like to work myself  I [indecipherable] you know.
So  during the summertime  we used to wash ourselves outdoors because it was so much better  but in the wintertime we used to bring the I dont think that we had the running troughs in the barracks  but we had a pan of water and we used to wash ourselves and on occasion if anybody had contact with the outside  because when went to work in the factory  you met with the Christian population of the town  and there were people who ma ybe werent willing to give you outright something as a gift  but they were willing to take a message to someone who was willing to help you and by getting something in return they would bring it to you to the factory.
When they came in to fit  they overwhelmed them and they killed them  and shoved them in under the  under somewhere that nobody sees  and  and the work went through like nothing happened.
They count you  they divide you to the groups and so the companies they're supposed to work for th em.
But  apparently  his work was considered important enough  but he was told to go to one side  and the five of us were told to go to another side.
And that was the main reason that we young people  of course  guided by grown-ups  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 11 came in -- very young in the illegal press work.
I wa s working in the camp in Auschwitz  uh  doing some welding work in the camp proper  and then I heard that the British soldiers had been brought to Auschwitz in their own camp and were working on in the factory  and I heard this  I asked uh for a transfer to a commando where  where  where I could meet these British soldiers  which was not easy.
One side they were tattooed and they were in the work parade  the other side di were not even didnt even get a number  they were put in the ga s chamber and my father was one of those.
And finally  they my mother  my father and I deci went up to the German commander; and I said  in German  that I to let me live  because I could work.
You know  during my early years in America  I used to work in the summers as a babysitter  as a governess.
Yeah and -- and when I -- I was very  very happy girl  I loved school  I didnt work at school.
Anything in particular you want to add abou t your family or your values  the way you were raised  that might have prepared you a little bit for the rather challenging work ahead of you?
We see them all the time still working  they still work there.
So he knew me because he used to come to my father  he used to do work for him.
That was at the time when uh the Germans have gotten after the Jews.
Can you tell me about the work you do for the Holocaust Museum?
And there used to be Jewish police  you know about that?
But in that time  the wome n  yes  such women  they did not used to work.
So in Flossenberg  after about three week s  we were not put to work  we were put in into a special barracks for Jews.
The school was very nicely organized  we had dormitories where we stayed all the time and we were lear ning Russian and also specialty in locomotive work  locomotive engineering  building cars  railroad cars  and after that to work on the railroad.
I started on to work on Interview with Charles Stein June 8  1999 75opening day in a hospitality suite at the at the [indecipherable] Plaza where some of the VIPs were quartered and we had a suite there where we a a a gor a room there where we gave them tickets  gave them directions  told them where to go and so forth.
They are doing their job and we are working together and help them and work with them.ﬂ It was very  very important for us because  you know  we were not alone.
Every night after work I would lie on the floor  on the carpet  on my stomach and fill out some more of this huge  positively endless form Interview with Ruth Harvey 54 in quintuplicate.
So and  there were seven children in your family  so that was  you know  again  as I say  during turbulent times My mother worked  when my father that is the other thing  so he used to work in in the business  in his mothers.
As we came there  the Russianist ar rested us and took us  they said  not arrested but they wanted us to work so they loaded us on a truck and they were driving somewhere and said where are you driving.
Have I am I accurate in saying that  or were you involved in her research work?
Once your husband left  did you have to go to work?
It doesn't -- I describe th ings rather than -- and I've actually discussed it with somebody  that she might work with me.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 14 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: time.
And my father went ar ound trying to get some industrialists to undertake to work with that company who -- whom he represented  but nothing came of it.
He was now a member of the war essential work force  assigned to work far beneath his qualifications  at wages set arbitrar arbitrarily by the Nazis.
Yeah  I think the men helped in the kitchen  but so did the women  but I know we couldnt get the men to work in the kitchen.
After a six week course  she found work and she would work for 30 hours a day and then have four hours off.
>> Bill Benson: Were you able to find work eventually in Belgium?
First inside Hungary to work  which is -- entailed road building and you name everything what was not meant for a Jew to do  and later they took them out to go out to Poland and Russia with the armies and  of course  many  many stayed there forever.

Well he gave us a place  he told me O.K.  you as a machin ist  you know mechanics  well give you a job on a machine on a certain machine to work  but the other four I dont have any place except for a place in Tashkent to work on the same machine th at was cutting railroad ties for the railroad.
Then we felt the more serious part was with the uh Japanese carrying on and and continuing to kill our people in China  and so they said you have more work to do.

My father remained in Auschwitz for about six months  a nd my mother was sent on to another camp called Reichenbach where she continued to do electronics work for the Telefunken company.

I was assigned to the Signal Corps Intelligence Agency in Wash ington  and then the Corps of Engineers 46 Technical Intelligence in Fort Belvoir and then I was shipped off to Berlin to do some intelligence work for the American Army  which I did until July 1953.
Do you remember the work that you were doing at the time?
I then went to Los Angeles magazine and told them about this  and I showed them the work  and so they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and  uh  Time Magazine picked up on it  did a big story also running a page of Johnny Scott and Jimmy Sherman  Sammy Harris  all these young poets.
Then later she said to me  well maybe I shouldnt give it to you because this gift didnt work out good for her  but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to Rozia.
I went in and I said the man I want to work.
Some had to march to the different near working places; but some what had to work far away  they were put on trucks.
She says  yeah  she got herself preg -- an-and she fell  she would go by the streetcar to work and she fell off  injured herself.
Went to school  from school you went to work and next morning got up  went to school  went to work.
And right away  you are gonna be my children  you are not going to work any more in your life no more.
Because there was a factory th ere  they would try to get the prisoners who were young enough on one side and they would go to work in the factory.

Here she has to work everyday so there were some days that all the family didn't meet because one is working afternoon.

When we  we settled in in New York  as I said  within a week  mom was out looking for work.
When we always...we went out to work  the SS told us to take along a little wagon  four-wheel wagon.
He did uh the research work in the libraries uh which he which he would either copy or summarize and send send down  and my dad would would write in his field.
We [didnt] use bulldozers and snow plows and stuff like that.
He was telling us stories that they were dying from hunger and work.
I mean weve always assumed that in the cases of most of them that they died at Treblinka which was just a completely an extermination camp and that would not have happened to the ones who were able to work and so forth.
So  when we found it wa s scary to find ourselves behind fences  suddenly  not be being trapped again  but we figured we will work  and I was working in the kitchen.
I got beaten  so  so I took when I was on my work I saw some other pants  so I took two pair of pants.
So she was still at home taking care of the household.
We couldnt work  we have to live on a ration  [indecipherable] gave us.

On on the work at lunchtime you get like a seaweed soup...just brown soup with some seaweeds in it.
Well  unfortunately  it didnt work out in the long run  but since they survived in Ecuador   in Quito   they came after the war here  like most of people usually do.
So we hire horses to pull the car  pretending that It doesnt work.
No  I dont think I want to go to work any more.
But you had to work a week to get one loaf of bread.
So did you go -- did you leave home then  to work?
I I realize in some other peoples minds  it becomes stopping work and just enjoying yourself.
I used to work in the Mayflower; and my head waiter  uh  came from Europe too.
Possibly did some accounting and other wor -- secr etarial work.
And he came  and he said  ﬁListen  I work for the leather company  how about to start business  to make leather footballs  and basketballs?ﬂ And thats how we started the business.
but if it comes -- now  lets forget about the logistic  lets do the work of -- of how to supply the work force to the employers  yeah  who are requested. [
We left the next morning  at the Jewish Community in Ham burg delivered soup and the Jewish leader in Hamburg told us  dont worry you go to work and we loaded the cars with sewing machines and equipment for you  and with food and you will be we ll taken care of  I have the guarantee from the SS and so on.
The factory was operating up north  but we were constructing the second project  and the job consisted of being marched from work everyday from this camp which was al so about four thousand people  and which was a very mixed camp.
Well  I had the L section in the tracing bureau  and we did the lion's share  about 90 percent of the work.
You were forced on a whole variety of work details that you had to do during that time.
>> Bill Benson: You were forced to go to work in a factory.
Was your camp guarded and were you guarded when you went to work?
After finishing my education there  I I went to to serve in the army for one year  and after that I entered the graduate school of Slovak Academy of Sciences to work on my thesis  on my Ph.D. thesis.
And then I found out that if the wound is bad enough that you might get a day off from work  barracks rest  they let you stay inside and I learned all tricks as much as I could  I mean I kept my eyes opened and my ears opened because otherwise my father said I was not survival material and I was trying to  I wasn't trying to prove him wrong  I was just tryi ng to get by.
Jews were still permitted to go out to these work places  they always had to come back.
The next day we were taken to work and we were carrying big  wooden boards  like for building barracks.
So I went to work for him as a -- as a -- not bookkeeper  how you call that?
Not only they reported for work  they had to bring certain items to work.
We were ve ry withdrawn  Bert had enough with his job when he came to  when we came after work we were so exhausted.
There was not a possibility to talk because there was so taken the day to day and hour to hour with work in the Jewish community and I I uh I had a secretary and I had to go to the to the German offices uh to in town to ask  for instance  let's say the the l east.
Well  my mother  like later on everybody had to work so she was working in a kitchen  a communal kitchen  peeling potatoes and things like this.

We were really not starved there  we got enough bread and things and we could actually  there in the basement of each building  there were places where you could sit down and eat.
That saved us because people that were taken to Auschwitz  many -- some later on they sent them to work but many  many were killed right away.
But I then went on to do some hospital j obs  social work jobs in hospitals.
But he was willing to work and take it  we went from one  it was very hard because he got a jo b here when we came to Philadelphia  he worked in .
And some people -- I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't worth doing or something  I don't know.
Her incessant work finally enabled me to get to France with a transport of kids and she  as a widow  eventually to England and thus she saved both our lives.

My -- well  I was small but my sister went to school.
It was tough physical work  but he was free of any -- any kind of other concerns and obligations.

Interview with Eugene Chmielowski January 31  2015 89 What did you do?
So in this way I mention Schacter first  because in his way he did work on the Czech mind  and I worked on the Czech stomachs.
But I guess when you do this kind of work every day  it becomes sort of routine.
They were asking for young people to go to the work camps.
And they put us in -- the next morning  we went to work.
But Im sure that what  that going in to the civil rights work and being  and wanting to do public service work has been to some extent influenced by  and maybe a large extent  probably a lot of it is subconscious  the fact that I want to feel th at the contribution I can make in helping other people in this country  who are not as well off  is just a way of helping to give back.
But I did that; and then I would...as far as my books went  I would... Joyce and I would work our books together.
So you you started did you ever work anyplace else  or just at this bakery?
But if I got a permit to work somewhere  I was allowed to - of course  I had to wear my band - but I did wear my band until I couldnt get on the bus  and if I stayed in Kielce  there was no place I could go anywhere  and I wa snt sure whether the next bus will take me.
In front of the camp  they right away made us work  digging the  uh  I mean  working at  at the ground and was extremely hard was  was all granite  and not only working again  there was uh not a commandant  the leader of the SS with a very infamous ma n  rude man  young and even small man  not strong at all  but he had a dog.
In-In-In-In-In the German war  I was a pawn  I was just a pawn  and Im glad what I did  that sabotage work  which I did  blowing up trains.
A. Well  there's more going out on the streets  cleaning the rubble and cleaning up the street and waiting until we can go back to work and continue.
And coming back we had -- Bill Benson: And you weren't gone all that long.
His education and experience made it possible for Peter to remain and work in the U.S. following his defection until he received his green card and later became a U.S. citizen.

They had plenty  there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they came here  they had to cross a bridge --.
My mother  sister  and I were fortunate enough to work  without any pay.
She would leave at about five o'clock  leave work like everybody else and then she would hide in......Well  there are several things that happened.
We could not go  like some people used to work from one place to another as long as they did not look like Jews.
02:36:04 And after standing there like a half an hour  one SS told the next one  \ You  you know  but let's  let's take this  this group we will take them to Nurnberg for work  because we have an order to take the next day.\
>> Bill Benson: They were able to continue that for a while?
Now people should know that Toppensohn who built the crematorium of Auschwitz was from Erfurt and if you don't know the histor y actually  that Toppensohn had the same problem that all contractors have with Government  that it didn't work right in the first place.
And I went over there to the soldier and I 10 10says to him in German  you know like big deal  I says to him  \ Look  I got 8 people going to work and this is the papers.\
And I dont remember what - I dont think that he - or maybe he went to work?
And two weeks after that I got in on the kitchen work.
The raid it is over and everybody stand up to go back to the place they work.
Yes  no -- you so -- simple story  they tried to remove the potential fighters  yes  and to find workers for them -- some work in Germany.
Well  I want to thank you so much for -- for taking so much time  and -- and -- and -- Thank you.
So in the months of July and Au gust we hired a staff  did the necessary work to collect all of those military and SS documents in the Pentagon  and then I went to my first love  which was to find th e I. G. Farben docume nts.
>> Bill Benson: At the start of 1943  you went to work in a factory  a German factory.
And you had to work because you would get the money  the German money.
you know) And it never came to a war  luckily  but that was sort of my motivation towards the intelligence work  to do what I can.
And so when you were in for forced labor  were you living in the ghetto?
One day was in the line for work  next day they're not.
Deliver internal -- they had -- see  Terezin was organized as a functioning concentration camp with certain activities  with some semblances of normalcy  and the -- again  the Jewish council had to administer a law from the detail  not the [indecipherable] principles   and people were assigned work  and were assigned to do certain activities.
But the funniest thing is  for the first -- it sounds strange -- 40 days  I couldnt go to work.
And I went to work for University Hospitals  for some reason or other  I dont remember what I paid for bread yesterday  but I -- that was two dollars an hour  even at 40 hours  which I didnt put in  it would have been 80 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 66 dollars  and I was --what did I earn?
If this 50 volunteers are going to be taken to die or to be killed  then it will happen immediately  but there is also a chance that they need 50 volunteers to go to work somewhere else.

We needed to show that we still had strength left to whether it was to work or to live another day.
He couldn't take it  and I think this had a lot to do with his change of attitude  that he started to work and to think against that Nazis.
He gave 14 us this little home and we would work.
Had to w ear the white and blue armband  there was nothing  and register for work.
We dont spoke about it  a little  we spoke ve ry little of it because before that  Germany invaded Russia  and they said that were going to who wants to go with them can go to Page 6 work in Russia.
And I went to work -- I found myself a job  that was something I wanted  I wanted to be outside.
that bombed that train and Thats right  they needed to clean up  they needed work.
They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work.
Had about 20 or 30 women doing the work  so it was not a small place.
This was beyond comprehension in Nurember g and probably beyond having being able to work out.
Did you ever have the day off or did you have to work every day?
She really appreciated how Mima had taken care of me  and so she invited Mima to become part of our household and to continue to care for me while my mother went looking for work.

But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he su rvived  and basically they found out that well  they knew that he was a banker  and so they put him to work in an office in Jasenovac to balance their books  to work on the books  and so that he didnt have to be out in the rain and snow and people  there was one person in the office who was an Ustashe but not one of those not one of those that went around killing people necessarily  and he was reasonably kind to him.
Th-They made the women well  both men and women work the the logs  move them right  and they would wear the rubber leggings of some sort  that up to the waist.
We have to get up early  five oclock in the morning for roll call  then they took us to work and we worked teen hours -- 18 hours or so  and that was it.
And they were the wounded at Dunkirk  so they couldnt do any they were not supposed to be working anyhow  but they were working doing easy work.

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 For two years I was an expert.
>> Bill Benson: What work was your mother and Dora made to do?

You either work for me  or you work toilets  or cook in a kitchen.
You tell me that the German Reich has no metal to work?\
And I have to make a point here  that in the building trade I work harder in my business than I worked in the concentration camp.
And that's where my mother learned working on electronics was one more type of work that was essential to the German war effort and might save her life  though she had many other occupations in between.
So 60  6-0  and older could still work as maids but nobody else?
Youre not registered  and they dont care about your dog dog tags  they dont care what you are  you just work  or you die.
The ghetto was -- the ghetto was formed -- it was separated.
I went back to my house  and I went back to work because I had no other...no other way than to work.
And they bombed two transports  whatever  and also building new railways  which was the hardest work because people were not strong and the food was very limited and uh  uh  the people were beaten to death on the job or in the camp.
So they told her they relieved her of all the work.
What was it for you to go through the Museum? [
So  then I so I knew that was genderus dangerous to pray  so thats way and I knew that exactly  at least twice during the time in those year  in 1950 - 51  maybe 52  the secret police came during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work  they were checking my a our apartment for certain things they will find  because especially my wife  she realized she opened  for example there  her underwear was  that it was put a different way back  or our other things what we had in our drawers  or in the in our in our clos et.
One pair of boot s for work  two pairs of socks  two shir ts  or blouses  underwear and a work suit and two blankets and two be dding and some bowl you can eat from and some glasses.
At the time they thought all Jews would go to labor camp and just work  you know.
Theyd say  ﬁTheyre sending me back to the .ﬂ You know  and theyd beat you up; theyd kick you for any reason and nobody wanted to go work for them.
So so that was my other miracle  [indecipherable] that I went behind him and and he decided  go back to work.
And so Richard Swig  who was owner of the hotel decided that Atlanta -- the only thing that would work in Atlanta would be western entertainment.
And I went to the Joint  and said -- I said Im back in Eu rope  I might just as well work  and they assigned me to Germany.
But he was...the Germans got a hold of him and put him to work.
After  you know  this my work was kind of like ending  because it was end of this particular stretch  then I moved to another place not far from here  in order not to disturb them  and and and then you know what happened?
So my mother thought that here my girls are going to die from starvation  let them go to work  maybe they will be fed  maybe they can bring home some food for the rest of the family.
They were all full of hope that they'll be released  but it didn't work that way.
He used to come bring all kinds of goodies  because you didn't work on Saturd ay or Sunday for whatever reason.
Well  when we first came from the ghetto -- when we were taken t -- from the ghetto  it was around July in the ghetto and we had to line up.
He took us to the city of Nuremberg  and the GIs  the soldiers were there in tents also  and we did the same work.
So you had to register in that...uh...that agency you I will call it  and...uh...you...and they had...uh...and after...after you register...after 3 or 4 days everybody registered  then they sent a policeman to your apartment and they took you down to the police station and they carried you away to a work camp that was in Germany.
And were you -- the office that you were in  were the -- was the male police -- Jewish police there also  or were you totally separate from the Jewish police?
But I know that  the first thing was  I was  I couldn't sleep at night and the less I could sleep the worse it got and was really hard for me to function and work.
We are going home from work and we don't seem...the Nazis don't let us go hom e  go past.
I mean there are cases where the workers come up here and the grower breaches the contract or at least our workers claim the growers have breached their contract by not providing the work ing time that they claimed they would or the working conditions under which they would work.
So  uh  certain days  uh yes I was allowed to walk around in  in the camp  but whenever there was a lit--first of all  the camp was supposed to have been maybe for a hundred uh people to work in the factory  but when a lot of people have heard that there was a place where maybe you could survive through the war  uh then they would come into that camp  a nd it would swell with people.

Not -- Not as much as now  because I -- in the beginning  when we didnt go away to Florida  I used to do volunteer work at the Jewish home for the aged.
But the Jews were allowed to work for the non-Jews sort of.
01:49:11 Now we got out of the train and...uh...you know   the...the reception was (chuckle) was...uh...you got the beating  you had to fall in line  you had to do lots of things you didn't do before in your life  and...uh... you were assigned a bunk at that time  and...uh...all of us... then...then we were...uh...told to fall out and we were going to work.
And here   he works outside exposed to the hot sun  the hard work  he got a heart attack.\
>> Bill Benson: Bob  during that time  what did your mother do?
This is an -- an example of the fact that one can overcome si -- n-not per -- I personally  bu t that we can overcome some of these murderous things that have happened  and still be able to work for a better world.
Do you want to go back to your parents?ﬂ I said  ﬁOf course I would like that.ﬂ He said  ﬁI'll work out the papers for you and you can go back in two days.ﬂ Were you in a work camp in Lublin?
You not supposed to smoke for 12 hours when you work there in the quarry  so -- so he gave me shtaffkommando  what is shtaffkommando?
Before the war  we went to school  my father went to work  my mother kept the house.
And then we start to think what to do  you know  we have to start to work.
And when they came back from work  this drill sergeant drilled them that they walked like a army with the shovels on their back  and when I was standing there on the steps and they saw me from a distance standing  they were so thrilled  so happy that I'm alive that this Lampel gave an order to them and they say Achtung which means attention  and they told him...it's like a review  and they start...and he told them to march with their feet like the Germans  you know  like the   and they started to march through me and everybody looked at me that I'm alive.
She -- the family of his father paid her a pension  she di dnt work.
Yenema  and Maria ga -- work in gimnasium that was a -- you -- you have to know that the gimnasium program was absolutely the same in all gimnasium in Poland.
One work in the kitchen and one work in the where they where they washed the clothes and she was a seamster.
And in Germany  I was assigned to work in a salt mine.
And suddenly I -- I noticed that big  big guy with a big dark red beard  and just urging the others on to work  to work  to work.
After that it was I do not know exactly how many people were left over but it was in December  I found a job to work outside of the ghetto.
And I told him  how come that you ha ve to pray five times a day  and how can you work?
In Britain at that time there was compulsory 76 labor actually  yo-you had to work  so you had to report to the employment office  and they would assign you a job if you couldnt find one.
It's very important for you  maybe also for us  but what's more important is you have stopped to do it and everybody who is in a certain age \  he tell them  \ You have to come and to work very  very urgent  because Germans demand I don't know how many thousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort.\
But what happened was as soon as the Hungarians came in  my father was old enough -- he actually served in World War I under the Austria Hungarian empire.
I went to work for a compa ny -- through another company  actually  whose main product was environmental testing equipment.
For instance  in the winter of 1944  it was a bitter winter  but one day when they she came back from work  the neighbors say to her  look  whats going on there?
So since my contract at Daystrom had a two year option that I felt I should not take  I went to work for Avco Lycoming in Strattford for 20 years  and I went up to  to become a director of a department with about 400 people.
And then  several years later  he gave a paper at a U.N. conference  dealing w ith the work that he had done before  and at that time we took all our children.
My mother used to tell about inventions  pe ople discovered this  or that  or made some gadgets  you know how they work.
And then I went to work  and -- and then came the time when I -- I immediately applied to go to the United States and I was told immediately that I will not go  that they will not let me go.
They were sort of washed  but six months because the laundry did work for the Germans and for the higher-ups within the ghetto.
I asked especi ally in the work I did for the...with the...after the   I went...I was...I met hundre ds and thousands of fellow surviv ors  if that fe llow heard about somebody who ha d come from from Auschwitz and gone to Theresienstadt.
So thats how I say  oh my gosh  I cant work like that and then study and all this.
Was the people we wo rked with  sometimes some par -- some people - some peasants came to work and they told us certain towns there were some massacres [indecipherable] out  you know  like next town [indecipherable] neighboring towns.
But if it was warmer than that  then ev erybody had to go work  and men w-worked falling trees  and women doing the rest of it.
So everybody had to work  and it was important to work because in a place of employment you got an extra bowl of soup.
The other narrow escape was with my partner who was  uh  caught at the station with all kinds of identity cards and  uh  and  uh  material which was absolutely very dangerous  but he was just caught as I tell you as a  as man  a boy of thirty years  twenty years  to be sent to to Germany for work.
Throwing 1 200 calories per person per day into the camps was -- in the campaign the UJA campaign in the United States  of 1946  in 1947  more UJA money was being given to the Joint for use in the camps among this population than was being given to the Jewish Agency for work in Palestine because the greater need was there in Europe in those two years.
If you would take this and this  come after three months  and shes working o -- for three months youre working  and well -- shell show you the work  and then well come and well see.
I started to work in -- in the -- in -- in different places  from one to the other  and then -- What -- What type of jobs?
And they started doing research on what they were interest and based on the work Id done before and I stayed there for seven years.
So my mother finally decided to take the chance and apply to the German military camp  to work there.
They take pistol out and shooting people came to work like dogs.
Sometimes we were -- sometimes we were to pick flowers in the flower area  and during the time when I was in one of the parks where we were supposed to work but we never got to it  the American came with a (inaudible) from one end of the city to the other and we were the one which they bombed.
And one morning before [indecipherable] we came we went to work  came the SS man Ludwig.
I didn't know too much about the pre-1930 period  during Hitler's Munich and post-Munich  because it wasn't part of any of my studies  and I was very much involved both with the work I did at home and with my great desire to play shortstop for the New York Yankees and also be a member of the United States Davis Cup tennis team  yo u see.
Well  then when she pumped out from my wife whatever she could  she went to work on me  you know. \
And then I started with to work with the with the children children children  young children.
In the concentration camp  or when you work ed  were there ever -- did you ever have an experience where a German seemed sympathetic or helpful?
After a while  I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was through by half day; and the rest of the half day  I was polishing the boots and the belt buckles and the belts of the soldiers.
I said  but look  sometimes I dont feel good and I dont come in and I cant really work so much.
Okay  she is the CEO of an organization called Parents Anonymous and they work with children  parents and different people  and -- in helping them before they become violent.
And Mr. Bozym was a [indecipherable] that was looking for work obviously  to do something  and that field artillery unit needed some repairs to be made on their -- some of their storage equipmen t  whatever it was.
As I said we would be woken up around 5 o'clock in the morning and stand in line until counted for a couple of hours and then marched to the factory and then work there for about 12 works without...well  we had a half hour break simply...not for us...not for the inmates  just so that the Germans who worked there and who were running the factory and the SS that were watching us  that they could take a break for some lunch.
And now you have the wh ole story like no charge  lets go something to eat [indecipherable] Interview with Joseph Bach December 12  2015 36 You know  I have one more question to ask you  and that is  when you got to America  did you go back to work for MGM  or did you work someplace else?
I am really bad at languages so that didn't work very well.
And then we had to wait  after they count again they give us a little soup  a little bread.
So when -- when I had -- so he told me he's not going to go to a foster home any more  that he made arrangements like next house  they were a family with two children and they say he can see him every single day when he comes home from work and take him back to the house and I should -- so that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 66 there -- so I brought him there and -- and when I left him and -- and Peter was all so -- I remembered that h-he didn't cry when I left him  but -- but you could see that he -- i-it isn't because he's not going to miss me  but because he was like in shock also  you know.
They go to the gates and for food -- and but in the ghetto someone was going out to work who somehow  some people were making was make like a black market.
5 >> Bill Benson: That circumstance meant she had to stay.
And my brother was in a hotel school  and he had to work in a hotel; and she was their maid.
And she work -- there was a separate barrack where the commander lived.
01:23:46 We went through the basement  up to the other side to work and  uh  our food was a little better t han if we were not working.
There was a wall constructed that I later found out and behind that wall were some members of the family of the friends who used to work there  and that was the time that I wanted to bring Eli to that place and most likely he would be able to work for us  but I was too late.
Before we get to the war  what was your life like outside of work?
We had to work 12 hoursŠ nightshift or dayshiftŠand someŠ On the nightshift they used to call our room  our barrackŠ not the whole barrack because there were other people there too Šbut our shift would–were working together  the ?
And did you work for any other group after the D efense Department ?
And it depends what you call  sometimes you could work overnight.
They were not able to work in normal conditions not only in Lodz ghetto which wa s terrible place to live in.
And after  when I got married  I stopped work ing  and I had my little boy  my Jay.
So between -- by the way  everything had to be done 1:00  2:00 in the morning.
>> Bill Benson: And this is the family that your father  as I recall  helped them out.
They have the same brain  they have the same ab ility to work.
And when they all come here  they shouldn't run  they should go to work.
We were supposed to do work  we were digging trenches against the sw Swedes in Stralsund in Germany.
For the first time I had received letters  I also have at home he sent me picture how he had to work in 8   how very hard  and very -- they had here a -- Polish  this is in Poland and he wrote me so that I could read th e conditions were very  very hard.
It was a very careful made work to take out with a...with a to write out the name and to put another name  because it was very big value this paper with the stamp from the Swiss Consulate.
I mean I just left one office and went home a nd did the other work.
I mean  if it was just lab work  I got As in biology lab work and stuff.
We thought that they were put to work burning the bodies of prisoners who were killed or died in the camp  since every day there were heaps of dead bodies in front of each barrack.
It may be because of where I lived  but they made absolutely my life miserable with my clothes and my accent  my a -- a -- at that point I was not yet excelling and I was very  very unhappy and I didnt want to complain to my parents cause I knew they were doing this  they had to work at what they were doing.
We used to stand there for hours and hours and hours.
My father was called up for one of these work camps -- >> Bill Benson: But it was slave labor?
You werent y -- officially you weren't allowed to work because the British had [indecipherable] on us.
I I used to be in construction  heavy work  but now You actually did the heavy work.
This was a ghetto where you were not allowed to go out except to go to work.
You will work afternoon and evening and 10 the other job you have you must keep it.
So after this episode and you kind of went back to just wherever you c ould find to work or a place to live?
And the next day I went back to work  I went up [indecipherable] and the next day I went back to work.
The work was hard  no food; because scared...even the German guards were fighting for food for themselves.
I tried  it didn't work for me and at this point I certain ly am not going to go searching for the man  for the person  right?
Now when it comes you go to bed  everything comes back to you  and especially with me when you work in the museum.
I went to Seattle; I start to work but I had hard time because I didnt know the language.
But this is scholarly work being written that the Holocaust never took place.
When we were talking about how you were able to get al l of those work permits so that other people could have papers and be free or sort of free  why did you do it?
In other words  wed we to simp ly say the Germans were unfair and unjust and so on  wasnt going to work  because they felt that Germany  in order to survive  had to do some terrible things  thats war.
In fact  just a few months ago here at the museum I found in the archives a little slip of paper with his number as a prisoner.
And then she asked me -- yet -- but I went out to work.
When she said I can have a work card  and she was good to me  because I really washed and cleaned and helped.
Ten cents to go down to work  and I had ten cents exactly to come back.
Too long at Auschwitz-Bir kenau we were told eventually wind up in the gas chamber because you don't produce any work.
And they put a lot of the schools [indecipherable] a lot of -- they put up school  or people who want to work  they gave a sewing mach ine.
And on weekend  on Saturday  I would work with father in a field  but on a weekday  I did not.
There were even  even murderers  and I just one day after another  these things  they added to my little disappointment  but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we  we did the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image  good self-image  we had a very good self-image of ourselves.
She was a terrible housekeeper  hated housework  loved to be with people  loved to work.
And they were I think they were mainly interested in trying to get these wer young people into some kind of a job work   or training for jobs.
But I mean  I -- at that point it was  you know  i-it -- I mean it -- my thought was good in the beginning but it di dnt work out anyway  because I just left and -- and I went and I ca -- I mean  I did receive the word that its -- you know  my time has come.
Then I was...uh...by coin cident  I was given a job when the ghetto was created already  to work in a battalion on the Aryan side.
So  one day they when everybody went to work  and some reason I I I was home and then they doing something.
Like they took all the sick people  when we stood in the sorting shed  and sorted the things from the people  the belongings  and you see the lorries   the wagons  go by  and the older people  or children who were maybe orphans or  were thrown in like cabbage  and then at the end rid es Gomerski [ NB: SS-Scharfuhrer Hubert Gomerski]  who was in charge of them  with a pistol  and just asks  \ Who is tired  and who cannot work  and who is sick?
Everybody from the city had to go to work for the Germans  everybody.
Did you have to w -- to work for him at doing something in order to get this -- No  just to do my job.
And I wanted my children to see th at place and I wanted them to see the pretty town  with the neat houses and the window boxes with the flowers  so that they would know that the people who killed the babies and who pushed people over the edge of a precipice went home after work and played with their kids in their pretty little houses with the window boxes and the fl owers.
Coming very early to work  when it is still dark  I hear a voice.
So -- and I s-set up and it was better than cement work .
I washed out the belt  I washed out the collar  and I went to work.
When I did something wrong  they didnt send me to work  so I will not get a second potato  but I had to go to pick up the potatoes  somebody has to go.
Sometimes they had -- so they were selected for work  or for work detail  and they were standing there  and I had to go from one to -- to -- from one to -- and to -- from one to the next  and do the whole [indecipherable] the whole group  and then some -- and when there were no people after th -- after they went out to work  during the day I had -- I -- I had to do the stripes in the store  and prepare that for the next person who received that dress of -- as a newcomer  yeah.
So this is what we did  we ate our way through the boat  and the rest we did was run around and have a good time.
I dont remember it  but you just did it  and it wasnt work  you see  you were helping people.
>> Bill Benson: How did your mother do once she came here?
And most of them survived because they were characters who are... If you will allow me  I will sh ow you the picture because I thin k I have a photograph of these young men being deported probably to work.
They say  here by you are informed that you are to deliver to -- to work as labor -- forced labor.
So he says to me  look  a temporary thing til you get the real job  you come work for me.
I came out of the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 46 46service in ‚57  then I went to work for the Rohm and Haas Company in Philadelphia as a technical representative for a year and a half .
She said  if youre going to work for her  were going to get food.
And when the war ended  I stayed on in Europe and went to work for the Joint Distribution Committee.
I uh  there was uh  a rumor in that camp that we need some  so many men  and uh in another camp for work.
That was the way we generally did our– and the bigger cases like this three civil rights workers case  there were many of us who– The Neshoba County– The Neshoba County case  there were a number of us who did investigative work  both in the black community– we had a lot of FBI agents.
N o  no  things will -- wi -- wi -- will work out  and they were first sent to Theresienstadt.
And so  seve ral years later  the family in Gastonia asked Dad or Mr. Heilbronn asked him if he wouldnt come to work for him as a  I think as a shift manager.
He told me that uh  they were uh very br utal but uh then there were a kapo that they would be very mean and hit and do everything when th e SS was around  but when the SS left  he would  he and they worked very hard  they had to  they had to uh  they ----------------in mines  I don't whether it's coal mines or salt mines that they had to bring I don't know some very heavy stuff up  and they had to run they said  and on both sides would be SS  and while they were running they  they would  they would hit them a nd  and a lot of them just died  they never got back to uh  to their uh camp again  so but  it the ss were not around this kapo would say  \ Okay  relax don't  don't have to work now so hard \  but as soon as he would uh  uh see the SS he would scream \ you filthy dogs  get on with your work  you  you  you better do it faster!\
We werent allowed to work  and it was hard [inaudible] and I was so young.
Because we didn't know -- we didnt know what the Germans going to do to us  see?
One never knew  I never knew if I would see my mother and my sister again because these actions could occur during work or after work or before work or anytime.
Eventually  I was shifted into some cabinet work  wood-working shop because of my previous experience of working in a furniture shop.
And then  since he was strong enough--I mean  looke d strong enough--to work  they would give him a few hours to recuperate.
Oh I  we went through the  uh  barracks  the different barracks to see how the people were.
The same probably -- as a matter of fact  the first years in Ne w York  most of my friends  and  in fact  many of them I just met somebody who reminded me -- I found them work.
I had no friends because I had 18 to work morning from one work to another wo rk.
He was y-y-yo -- you know  taking his -- his work that -- to-to -- to the end.
The order to come to work was the order of what to bring for them to work.
Mainly when you work in the crematorium or the gas chambers in this particular  you never came out of it.
And they lived in a little room with a kitchen  so we had food  and this  and the next day they took us when they were going to work  they took us back to that kindergarten where all the children were.
First they told us were going to Germany fo r a work but then we end up in Auschwitz.
That's where my mother continued doing the s ame kind of work.
And then we moved here and he went to work for Hubert Humphrey so you know he left the State Department because you couldnt actually stay if you were going to go back and he felt by then he should go back and finish his doctorate.
I cried and cried in hours and hours  because with with the work  with everything  it was just foreign.
We knew because  because we knew earlier because they killed our grandfather the Nitenfort and you were going out to work and this faction -- so telling us what happened to us.
These are not problems that a psychiatrist can -- I mean there was nothing that I could work out with a psychiatrist.
No  I --I -- I really just go and do my work  and -- Tell me a -- a little bit about your work.
I used to go and do work  ﬁHow much do I owe you?ﬂ ﬁNothing.
We we re  all five of -- four of us  we were then assigned to work  which turned out to be adjacent to gas chamber number 4.
I mean  it wasn't just him alone  quite a few men tried to get away and it didn't work.
And when the Gesta po no look me  we took deep breaths  breaths and start  pretend we work  we not working.
All these work that the Gadiel made I saw but I wasn't there.
And later on  the Germans got hold of it because the Volasof's Army already was surrendering and they had all a new 36 Army of Ukrainians who used to work for the Germans now and fill-in for whatever they need  in local or on the front line.
We all uh at this time had no...wer e not gainfully employed in productive work  and all purposes more or less lost our positions and uh the first thing I organized were these cards...these cards were so called...when I asked what is it...these are permits which had come in already from England to give uh children the the permit to come to England.
There was a lot of work to do  because there were many bodies in this in the barracks.
And then  when my father went to the Gestapo they had statues of the organization  so my late father sent me to the lawyer in a nice neighborhood - I walked when two Germans grabbed me  this was already cold  maybe Nove mber  l939  to go to work.
This was not the time probably  and especially not on a farm where talk was not that much  I guess you didnt really talk all the time to each other because work was so much.
My mother and father were involved in different kind of charities.
And I would like you to explain to me how you came to work for the Czech government in exile in England.
This wa s the beginning when the Germans came and  go ahead.
It was a lot of work and I did most of the work because Louise  Mr. Beck was working in the ammunition factory during the day.
Rae Goldfarb: Because I was old enough to do some work.
Those melodies coming back from wo rk  they said to us at the entrance we should work to the music and like nothing happened.
That people such as we  or some of the people that he has seen on tape because of his volunteer work that he does in the oral history  are not really that much related to the -- should not really be pe gged as survivors.
These people wo rked  there were very few Ausen  it was called Ausenkommando who went out of the lager to work but it was very  very few relatively.
Or to get into the work of repatriating the displaced persons.
He was going to work  and other ones were going to work  so they all got killed  one month before the liberation.
We had to work very hard  35 especially with these stones  rocks.
So my cousin who was had to go to work but she didn't manage to bring anything.
But from there you would also then be sent to several labor camps.
My mother got a sewing machine in case she needed -- she was good at sewing.
It was a work camp  and I wr ote the .
Now my answer and her answer combined is that wh en the barrack was assigned for the administrative  administrative work details  to work and to be housed there  it was very a negl ected one  the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that ba rrack  which was Block four  a wooden barrack.
And a lot of  you know  more things to work  in a farm.
Don't forget this was toward the end of the war and  uh  we tried we tried to do our work so we should sabotage a few of their airplanes but I don't know if it succeeded or not (laughter) but uh... How did you do that?
So a few of the men on the way back from work took off.
And it was very hard for me to work at jobs  sales jobs.
I get to to Frankfurt and theyre processing it  doing a good job  and they still got about a about a hundred people at five oclock in the afternoon  the consul the U.S. consul says well  were gonna have to continue that tomorrow  were going home.
I think my mind didn't work right  if anybody with -- with the right mind  will not do what I did to escape.
So theres certain things -- I do all kind repair work  I do -- I can do anything  there isnt a thing I cannot do.
And what sort of work were you doing in this ghetto?
And  of course  that was a tricky thing because I was by that time  away without  from work without permission  so I couldn't be seen there.
We were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 maligned.
She ca when a young girl she came to Klaipda to work there.
So the life in the ghetto  you know  was -- was very hard.
I bet he could figure out how to work this tape recorder.
Is there anything that you would like our audience  our researchers to know and to understand about what motivates your work?
Before the ghetto was established  and well get to that  did you see your Jewish friends?
And that was outside the ghetto  or inside That was part of ghetto then  yeah.
Interview with Vera Levine 7 February 7  2013 No well  when  when we lived  after we moved from Pankow  when things got tough  she brought work home.
Yeah  there was always this two team units or one -- somebody was always there to work the hospital  if some of us got to go to a -- a so-called party  you know  as long as there was enough left to cover the hospital  that was okay.
I always had to be on the outlook for agents of the police department trying to catch me at work.
The chief judge of the United States Supreme Court refused to let any Supreme Court judges come over  he refused to let any District Court judges to come over  so that you really got a potpourri of people from various states of the countr y. However  just as cautious as we were in the sele ction of the prosecution staf f for I. G. Farben  for example  and I think basically for better or worse  we felt that the best people we were getting would go to I. G. Farben and the other industrialist cases  if those lawyers wanted to work those cases you see.
This camp eventually became -- was an SS labor camp became a concentration camp.
So they gave us masks  and that's how we used to go to work.
I used to work in vineyards and go to school occasionally and then-- Did you have a sense of fear or anticipation?
And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly 7 depressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer allowed to to work.
And he was captured by Austrian  and he started to work as a Polish person  origin from Poland  but hard to say Poland  because at the time that was not yet Poland.
He started with a store  they opened a little store  it didnt work.
But I left the hospital  and I start to work only a few weeks at [Angelo ]--was the name of that photo company.
Most of the time they took us through country roads but we were going  we were told -- the rumor  nobody told us -- to the Swiss border.
Its ver-very interesting work  and -- and that theyd learn a lot about -- about th -- about the Judaism by doing this kind of work.
I don't think my father found work when we had come to uh Karlsruhe.
I did a lot of work -- I have clearance with the F.B.I.  with the C.I.A.  and I never forget when I came over to this country and I worked at and I worked at the and in the middle of the day  one of the soldiers came over and took me up to and I got very scared.
So I gave up the idea of trying to work an evening shift  besides working myself duri ng the day.
And what I understand is when you were th en sent to Funfteichen because your work was done from the other camp  what you did ev ery day in Funfteichen.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 5 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: side.
We got to recr uit all the work on his shoulder.
I said  ﬁI didn't only work in the kitchen I also worked in the private quarters of the SS.ﬂ Because that was next to the kitchen as a cleaning person and I remember that I took the toothbrush and put the toothbrush into the toilet.
And then I work with the -- with the speakers bureau.
You know  as we were going to Auschwitz we didnt know where we were going.
For people who had come into Germany -- Yeah  they did.
My mother and my sister kept going to work again  as if  you know  nothing happened  or  I mean  as if they were still in the old place  and rumors began to fly that our end was near.
You know  my friends are from my work or my husband's work.
So  the first job my father was given is to register all the people who are able to perform work.
What was the nature of the work  what was going on in the camp?
That was a very common thing because they needed people to work in Germany.
It wasn't because we hug each other  there was not  you came home from work.

He was...uh...in the...in the work camp in the town of Longglad  and he and his other comrades had been put to work doing odd jobs  working in the kitchen  working on the road  working in the soap factory.
That I can do good work  that I am a good  I was trying to me to be good  to do the 36 right things.
at that time  and my father was born in Limbeck   Poland  and he came to -- came to Austria and he went to business school  and then he got this job -- I mean  he -- he served in a -- he was -- he was a prisoner of the Russians during World War I  and then he came out  decided to work for my grandfather  and eventually hard work pays off.
My work was always with Timisoara   but I heard Yegendorf was -- they had formed committees.
You had to have your common sense and  and know what you were doing  but they sent me there and I started to work in this firm and I worked all this  through the different stages because we were moving a lot.
So they invented this idea that he went to look for work.
And I think my last...what was my last sentence  which I didn't l earn in the school of social work.
I don't to work for the Germans  and disappear I said.
And I know all the history  like we work and -- then when it -- 19 -- the -- especially the laws  the -- in 1945  the Nuremberg laws came out  that you -- y -- y -- 1935  yeah. --
No  I dont mean what work she did  I meant  how did she affect your life?
And he got in touch with me  he wanted me to work for him  so and I worked for him.
Their work was to build a bridge  and the next day they they blew up the bridge the bridge.
So  somebody didnt want to -- didnt want to give the police -- the Jewish police were forced  you know -- you got to give.
And I asked mamma  beca use I'd overheard a work here and there  but not everything.
Was there a different kind of work for men than there was for women in terms of the division of labor you have there?
And eventually those who made it  brought them in in the ghetto.
They also teach us all kind of--somebody like us would be--something to work  you know?
And when the war came and we when we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets  I knew I was going to be stuck and work on a farm with my father  which I was quite resigned to it.
And it looked like they thought I had too much more ability than to work in the factory  and they sent me back to school.
During the march from our house to the place where we was sent to the railroad was very bad moment because many Ukrainian people work for Germans and was very  very molested situation.
So the only way people got out of the ghetto would be with a work brigade?
And I said  I was supposed to work here for somebody.
Did you have did you have interactions with with any of the Jewish people there when you were growing up?
Men -- men who can work  okay  no  he could no t survive because thats -- if they were Jewish  forget about  he could not survive.
And was that a job that you did besides the factory work?
I think it was in 44  but Im not  you know  Im -- that was very unusual that they allo wed whole families to go  but we didnt know it was going to Auschwitz  but we -- only after the wa r did I learn that they had this Familienlager in Auschwitz where they had set aside a whole area where families could live together  because in Auschwitz  as soon as you got there  the children and the women and -- and men were separated.
When the Polish eh Worker's Party got in touch with us  they told us that they would like to  we should join their ranks  we should work together.
But he survived because he was a strong guy  he wa s four in the 40s or so  so he went they put him the to go to work.
Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa  who made a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the CDJ or the  I forget the new name they get  they got after the war  but anyway  it's the CDJ  it's the same.
So I became an apprentice in this machine factory under my brother  in a wa y. The factory had a small department where the - we made all the little parts  little screws  pins  what have you.
You work on in a little bit and th en get together with a few people who are like-minded.
So in this book when you find Poznanski and Sierakowiak  thats my work.
They took I didn't see because they said one of them  this is the work that you Jews are going to get.
So we had t-to work physically so hard  no food  no nothing.
And hell be the one say  no  we gotta work this out  calm me down.
She knew that I am in that  that I work in that hospital.
He remained as so-called \ Einsatzleiter\  [ Ger: \ Special Leader\ ] He managed very...how many people he needs to work  and where to send them to work.
So  I contacted my grandfather who saved us from the holocaust and he once again put his machinery into work.
He put them separate and he said  I give you exactly half an hour  pack a small knapsack  you go on a special work commando.
Will you permit the people pray after the work...after the work?
So we were ardent Zionists and we wanted to live on a kibbutz and we wanted to do all the work and we were very excited.
I worked like a -- I -- like a decent person has to do  work for you living.
And I loved I loved still love to work with bricks and mortar and and stone.
Did you see some kind of -- did you want to have a profession to do work  maybe  or did you see yourself -- Mm  not really  we -- we -- that all we h -- were teached  you know  to be a farmer  thats all  you know ?
You had to go through naked with your clothes on your arm and they looked you through like cattle and looked at your teeth  exactly like cows like cattle  they're buying cows to work.
Then I was assigned to a certain brigade to work  which was to load lumber into barges into ships someplace and to unload it.
And then I -- I -- I came here and I had my first job.
Sure  it was a day that we had to go to work.
Now  would the people in the work detail -- Wait a minute  then -- Oh okay  all right. --
What was your life  your daily routine like  i -- did you work as the -- still exercise teaching and photographer?
And six weeks after I started with American Express I get a response to one of my job applications to do the same work I was doing in the Air Force for a civilian contractor back in Wright Field paying me $75 a week  going from $35 to $75 a week.
And there she had to work in a factory where they made rayon for parachutes.
But anyway  so I work there  and in the meantime  the my the director of our school in England keeps writing  continue studying  because I studied quite well  you know.

Because  how much could they work  you know  and what was their value?
So  this whole thing changed about  too  because  from that group that was trying to kind of find other people to fill for them at work  they realized what is going on in other parts of the country  where people  if they are not employed  are been resettle d  taken away  that they seek themselves employment and in order to have the arbeitskarte  they went to work.

And  of course  everybody who got that punishment  they tried to go the next day to work.
How did you pass the time when you were in the office.
But [indecipherable] when we came to the camp -- a matter of fact I came with my brother and they pick me out to work and when he went to the gas chamber.

Now  I told you a minute ago that I dont want to sound bombastic  and I am not a deeply religious man  but I truly believe that it was almost destiny  if there is such a thing  that put me in this path  and I am very  very grateful that I have the opportunity to do the work that I am doing  because it gives meaning  it gives purpose.
I -- I worked hard  I wa -- I was young  and -- and I wasn't afraid to work.
But it didnt work out that way  I was a very fidgety chi fidgety child.
I mean  I was no carpenter but they took me later on to work in the office in the carpentry.
And they central was in the Auschwitz I camp  in the main camp.
So  people were called to go to work and sometimes sneaked back they were telling tales and to us they were just tales  because no that couldn't happen  wouldn't happen  didn't happen.
I came out  you know  going to work in the morning I had my sandwich with me and it was torn out from my hand by  by another starving person.
But my parents didn't let me continue to work; that they were very afraid that they're going to catch me.
And he didnt work that way through the entire war  I gather  because at a certain point  when the Germans take over Yes.

The Germans initiated something for Jews which I call forced labor.
So they would set up small musical groups  depending on the activities  and depending on the interest  depending on the health  because the condition in the camps werent really conducive to any intellectual work.
I worked extremely hard  and my father being a barber  got a job in the ghetto  in the uh concentration camp itself without going outside in the concentration camp  and he ask one of the Germans if they can give me a job to work also in the compound itsel f. After a few months  and after he was cutting German's uh hair  he made so that I should work in compound  and this was my lucky break because I could never survive the working outside.
We d ecided our father shouldnt go beca use we were afraid that he wouldnt be taken to work.
I mea n  I certainly wasnt going to work in a leather shop  and then what leather shop would -- would even take me?
We were -- eventually kids dr opped out as they went to work  so the last year there we were 12 students in my class  six boys a nd six girls.
And after my father was put in a concent ration camp and the servants had quit because they were not allowed to work for Jews.
We assembled in the courtyard  separated from the nonJewish members of the work crew  and watched with horror  and envy  the satisfaction on the faces of the latter that they are lucky enough not to be Jews and not to have to share our foreboding of doom  and doom was exactly what we expected at the time.
Could yo u describe your first encounter with the museum  and when you began work here  and how you learned about the museum.
I knew that my father will be at work  so I wrote something.
And they were very busy going away to work  and nobody had time to cut the grass.
So  they gave me a job in the kitchen  and the kitchen was whatever had to be done.
The block that we were in was so temporary  we were coming and going  all being killed or sent somewhere to work.
And the next day I came back to the camp from work and that was the news what they told me that your brother's leg.
I th -- listen  if she was in -- in my de partment  I want to help her mother  so -- But you were -- but -- but Im asking is  you were able to get a pass for her -- a work pass?
Because I was in the camp  and this was not like a camp.
In fact  I don't know if you realize this  but in the museum we have volunteers  interns who come from Austria and Germany every year who volunteer to work here instead of going to the German or Austrian army  so they choose to work with survivors and choose to work in an institution like this.
And then finally  from there  I was asked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps  working with a group of young children and adolescents whod been brought to this country whilst I was still in Germany.

300 coul dn't work any more  they killed them  300 stayed to dynamite the ghetto and they killed them and 3 000 marched out of Warsaw and 240 got out of the boxcars in Dachau.
It wasn't an issue because all they cared about  since they were a private school  they didn't have to  you know  there was no certification and they knew I was qualified  probably better than some people who did have degrees and that's all they cared a bout  that I could do the work.

Shortly before I left the Kovno ghetto  two or three weeks before  to to and never came to come back to work for the Ghettowache  I noticed that Jewish were building near the Kaisergasse   a gate a  a  a fence  a fenced a  a  a wire fence  a wire bu-- a wire partition like -- four or five times as big as this here  on the field in the ghetto.
Thats why when I go by now and I go on the way to San Francisco  I go on Salenas and so on  I see them picking that and I said  ﬁOh boy.ﬂ No matter how expensive we pay for strawberries  we get it so cheap  because its very hard work.
I keep saying that the day...I keep saying that the work did not involve just writing those letters of protection.
Espe -- all over the south  to work in the -- I know. --
And after after a few years  I went to work too.
I will bring you a carriage  and I will bring you to a safe place.ﬂ S -- and he -- he work -- he work like with them  but it was -- he wa s like part on something like underground or something like this.
And they blocked off all the intersections  they put barbed wire at every intersection with a guard and a dog  and you could no lee -- you could not leave unle ss you had a permit  a pass  or if youre going to work.
When you went to work  wh o watched over your children?
Oh yeah  my first year I went for I went to work for an accountant the first time.
They give a hand to other  because other maybe were beaten up or we had to stay longer to finish your work  and then you had to st...stay longer.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 30 I want to thank all of you for being with us.
And I took to the work good  but we wanted to have our own farm.
You can't go to work that early.ﬂ I slept in the bunk with my brother  and Aron knocked on the window and he 29 said  ﬁIt's time to go.ﬂ I have not been able to go through the door  so I had to slip out in the tiny piece of the window  the little window that opened up fo r air.
I loved my job  I work like a dog  it was too much.
And we didn't know  of course  where my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter.
We were always doing this type of work  but there was a German almost it was a big man.
And  uh  staying there after after the Zahlappell we were marched out to work.
And decided to go to the ghetto to get us out.
It was industry  uh German industry that make all the war industry...hundred and sixty thousand slave work workers who was over there  and all different labor camp  all nationality and uh they put me in the one camp.
Now  you have a cracked engine  it will be very difficult to make it work.
So consequently I told the boss  ﬁLook  I can't afford to work for you any longer.
You have to realize that I didnt know I was Jewish.
Ours was a   it was a not a camp  Birkenau was not a camp that they were sending you to work  it was an extermination camp.
A nd throughout the war  he was able to do that periodically  so that he would always be able to move somewhere else  find a place to live  work somewhere.

I did some work  tangentially of what Belle's de scribing  in Washington with the Board of Economic Warfare.
Up to that point  things were not the best  but things were not the worst  because when you went to work  you received some food at the factory.
It was a little bit out of my line  I would never use  you know  a brain thing  and I have to work for somebo dy.
]
And and of course my mother didnt need any any additional work.
My being back to work was supposed to be at 8 o'clock; 6:00 to 8:00 was the two hours.
Because a lot of people that work with me in the museum  that are in higher positions that I am  are very misunderstanding  and don t understand the feeling.
We would be se nt to the east to work there.
This one didn't last long either because another law came out which p rohibited non-Jewish people to work for Jews.
When a girl wanted to go into publishing  she was advised she should go in as a typist or secretary and work her way up.
Now  my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen  the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the time...I was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said  \ Though (that's my Hungarian name) isn't home  we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son  Emmy  and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into labor camp.
Youve said  I believe  that sometimes you were -- they were angry with you  they didnt want your sympathy  they wanted simply somebody to work out their anger on.
and he got -- you got two Polish wo rkers who were working -- supposed to work on your farm.
Jews wasnt there already any more  because almost the Jews some  a gr little maybe after the second [indecipherable] already was nothing left  one group 200  one grou p 500  who was to work for the Germans.
Even when I came here  I was able to speak German.
So I never got to see Estucia or Jakob  it simply didn't work.
They were just used for really front line  dangerous mine clearing and heavy work.
So  I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work.
Wi ma prepare everything so  in a way that it will work for half a year.
We went for by 19 themselves and we start to work with stuff.
It'll be an ideal place to hide out.ﬂ The first thing he asked me  ﬁWhere are you going to get the food from?ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  that's something weve got to work out.ﬂ He said  ﬁHowre you going to work it out?ﬂ I didn't want to tell him that I have some jewelry that I could barter  because you didn't know who you can trust.
So he had to work as a draughtsman instead of engineer.
This is a very important step forward and if we would have had that 100 years ago  I think that it would have been much more difficult for the Nazis to work because you cannot if you have sufficient information you can not go around telling st ories of cruelty and what they tried to put into their propaganda if people know better and therefore it was a big job and an important job between all groups in this society to be open and to give that amount of confidence from one to another that is necessary.
At noon  as you see on this picture what I got  we had soup.
And otherwise  I want to go and work in outside and prepare myself.
So whenever was a field work  we had to do that  the washing  you know  the laundry.
>> Bill Benson: You told me at one time that once you were in the ghetto  it was really important to be able to get work   is that that really mattered in terms of survival.
I went in there  I see people working  cutting wood and other thing  just just a regular work.

Then suddenly -- ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 >> Bill Benson: Yes.
Uh  in the hospitals--Jewish hospitals--doing all kinds of...you know  of work it was uh needed.
You know  the the work camp in re in Ryevka was everybody had to work  you know  they brought in all the people and of all the kids attended school.
And uh my mother had to work there because to to make a living.
The work they were doing had nothing to do with labor.
For instance  in Budapest   the soldiers took the women up Interview with Edith Palkowitz August 26  2016 43 to the ho office  to do office work  but that wasnt office work.
One evening I come home from work -- ye s  so they going to give Judenkarde  that means a ﬁJﬂ. A J that means Juden.
So every morning we went out  they took us out you know to do all kind of work you know like I said  to clean clean up the ruins you know and working for them you know  the Germans.
Yeah  well  it was different  yes  it was different  but th -- they suffered a lot  too  and all of a sudden  you know  comes a German outfit and rounds up several blocks and takes out people from trams and take them to -- to Germany to work  or just shoot them for no reason.
My  then there was no money for soldiers wives and so on and my fa mily wasnt rich so Mother had to work.
This was a very famous uh headquarter for the Zionist organization and this was the source later for the shutzpasses and the several places including uh uh storage where was where was food for the children homes and everything and my husband began began to work at on the outside.
As you were growing up in Poland  when you went to school and then when you were working  did you have occasion to work with  or meet  or be friends wi th  non-Jews in Poland.
And bear in mind that this was a period when Jews were ghettoized  but not in the sense of ghetto from the Holocaust  ghettoized means that there were sections of town where Jews lived  you know.
No  I couldnt foresee it becau se I had to do some work to help my parents the upkeep in the house where we lived.
And the young-- younger brothers  they were working in the place to get some work because everyone supposed to working.
It was there  and they asked me   ﬁDo you want to continue on your work on the visa?ﬂ I said  ﬁYes.ﬂ Well let you know  and that was it.
At the age of 10 he had to work to provide for his family  for his parents.
I have a sister  Diane   who is a year older than I am  and she is a PhD from Berkeley   and very into social work  and I occasionally I consult with her  to find out whether she remembers.
People  other people in the town they never did a hard work in their life.
After the war  when there was a great shortage of food  and my father had to work very hard to get milk from peasants near Nuremberg  because you couldnt get enough for a baby.
And he -- when he rested  my aunt -- my uncle  one that studied medicine in -- it was already Russian were there  so he was a doctor already  he arranged for him to work in clinic in hospital  so he went to work.
>> Bill Benson: Up to the time that Germans occupied Hungary.
Or the work detail office  had any influence on any -- on any work detail.
So it was days very -- very -- not quiet days  because the KGB were already -- start already to work very energetic in Lithuania.
They used to take out groups to work outside the Ghetto so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed  the Germans did not especially check those who went 19 out  they only checked those who came back  so we used to go and beg for food.
I trained in the city hospital  New York City  so -- we did a lot of work like that.
Did your skills as a stockbr oker aid you in doing this work?
We felt very uncomf -- and on the -- and on the train and starting out in Antwerp  there were a lot of Belgians that went to work in Germany.
And my  at that time  in Hungary and in Europe  it was the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then have them work for a few years for some firm  hoping that theyre going to catch a husband.
She took me to the basement to wash me up and put something around my wounds  I was not in such good sukkotpe yet  and she figured I should wait a few days before I go to work.
You see this -- you had to say what you were planning to do  and I said I was planning to be a social worker  so this is what I was really planning  but it didnt work out that way.
I slowly was starting to get a little better and we made contact with some Russian officers who were coming through town and they asked us whether we would like to work for them as interpreters  being that my brother and I speak fluently Russian and German  they asked us to to come with them to help them to deal with the with the civilian 02:05: German population.
Auschwitz had a subcamp  a labor camp  where they made ammunition.
In the me antime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or ta ken off to uh poli ce st ations and eventually ended up in Dachau or in or many other places that at that time already existed as uh concentration camps.
They said you could work for the Germans  you can work for us too.
I mean there was no separation of people because after you came work  people just uh caluated together.
The Kommandant says  ﬁAt five o'clock in the morning  you get up in the morning and you go to work.
And the they said  you can go back to your families  well give y ou permi permit to work  and everything will be fine.
I went to the northern part of Berlin where all the laborers work and so on and I felt much more secure there.
And some people went out working and Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 14brought in food  which I did too  because I volunteered to work outside  and I brought in some bread.
>> Bill Benson: And your father had frantically been telling you to come earlier.
He must be very  very important engineer  because he got the  he made the green card and he can work and they bought a house.
And  then I see fellows standing in the back with my sister Renia  and the Block Alteste   the woman who was in charge of the block  and they kind of push my sister Renia and the Block Alteste comes running with her and she says to the man who was selecting the people for work  she says  ﬁPlease take her with you.
So we had a dead body in our -- in our camp.
I was put to work next to the Hungarian interpreters on the assembly line  Messerschmitt airplanes.
And I became very interesting -- interested in -- in their work and in their fate  so when the -- theres a new -- New York association for Ethiopian Jews  I started buying these and now theyve become collectors items  because when everybody -- while they were in Ethiopia  they -- fo-for five dollars a month  they were -- would embroider and th e five dollars a month they could buy and feed themselves.
She was going to be the housekeeper and she was going to work for us.
He had been a captain in the Lithuanian army  which is a high rank for a Jew  and he belonged to a group  kind of played a leadership role in the group that said Jews can be part of Lithuanian nation  and they should work on that.
There was no work  there wa -- we had to find the enemy and who the enemy was  w ho knows?
After a couple of weeks of work  I thought I'm going to collapse and I returned back home.
So I would do normal secretarial work in support for Henry.
about two months later he was -- there we re -- there were all kinds of round-ups  you know  for -- for young Jews as workers  and he was caught in one of those round-ups and was told that 28 they just needed him for a couple of hours to do some work.
It didn't work because those words came [Indiscernible] very similar in German and they did not work.
The other  after the [indecipherable] after the three or four days of [indecipherable] they killed over 5 000 people and they took a lot of people into the concentration camps  not in Germany  but near our place  like Moldachewa   kola -- Koldachewa   Moladecznai and a lot of my family went into this category  they took them away to work over there  and they made them so miserable  you wouldn't believe what they did  the Germans did to the Jewish people over there.
So I sat there  and I hold [indecipherable] with my tongue sticking out like it was rea lly unusual work.
And then they recruited German people to do the laundry  to do the cooking  to clean  and do all sorts of things.
DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 35 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: C: 7.
In '41  in the beginning I think of '41  they came at night and they took my older brother away for work in a work camp.
His name was Avisha...that he used to work for my father.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 27 >> Bill Benson: And had the faculty for language and everything  as you described.
Even if you were sick -- we had girls who had typhus and you were dragging them to work  not to go there because and then I'm going to come back to that Tricia.
They were the heads  but they have to work with something.
And I designed a few [indecipherable] vessels  some smaller vessels  40 40 45 foot work boats and fishing boats  th ings like that.
Some gentiles men used to work for us  used to bring us food and used to tell us \ be careful  don't go out.\
And in the town we were given a place to live  and my father resumed his work as a tailor.
But  and I think that my work  going into the military  in part and then working in the Division and maybe the work I do here is all  in some ways – I never viewed it as a sacrifice  but I think having a life in public service  in a way  is help ing to try to make this country a better place to live in and give back a little bit.
And then the -- so the Jewish police knew it  where other people are -- are going.
I'm a fighter.ﬂ \ I sit here \  he said  \ to work  but I have connection with the woods.
28 Did you still think the reason you were going there was just to work?
She decided to apply for work with the German military camp  just outside the town  because she wanted this outside.
And he said  ﬁNo  but if you're so concerned about your daughter  go with her.ﬂ And she was just about to do this  and  and one of the women  who was working in the barracks I think she swept floors and whatever and maybe cleaned the chimney  the stoves and whatever other menial work  but she had some kind of protected position  whatever that was worth she sort of grabbed me under one arm and my mother grabbed my other arm  and we managed to walk away.
So did they get wa -- And I wor -- and I went and got citizenship and I went to work  and they set up shops [indecipherable] so to say.
And were you attracted to doing work on camer as  was there something attractive for you in that?
Like  for the election of the last few days in France  when they call a socialist  he is not more socialist than I am  but it -- it -- it is to be understood on the basis -- then I-I -- I went to work for them  but before that  when I was 19 years old -- This is 1952?
Not many people seem to understand quite all these underneath things 33 that were going on  cause all our work  political work so to speak  on the sly  that lasted well over a year.
One day when I was assigned there...it was just after a week my sister was assigned  my be st friend Junior was assigned to work  and we...when once we came there we had uh lady who was German  ethnic German  means born in Poland  and she was the supervisor.
They told me to take my rifle  whatever I had...I didn't have much...and report to the headquarters of this...it was a...called...it was the nineteen  twenty-ninth uh independent battalion  machin e gun battalion  to report to headquarters in the rear and I did report there and they took me in to a place there and there I found some uh neighboring...uh one fellow I knew which was not   was a Jewish fellow from a town near us and I found there many others  Jews and Ukrainians who were from the socalled western Ukraine  that were born  or lived...not just born...lived in in the Soviet...the territory that was Poland before the war  and they took us on the front  with the purpose of putting us in work battalion  because they trust us. .
But I think his experiences in the work camp were horrendous and uh he he did come back  so that was...but the guilt of having...for him to make a decision to go to Germany never left me  up until we corresponded  which was only a few years ago.
After a da ys work  when I came home  I didn't need no food  no nothi ng - just to lay down.
I remember one incident when my mother went to work and she took me with...with her because she got a chance to go to home ~ in Panemon because the brigade was working there for...I don't know who...theQ; g D military or somebody.
And I was always painting or doing art work  but I wasnt doing it fu ll time because I was working in places  until about the early 70s  or just about the 70s  yeah  I think late 60s  beginning of the 70s  I decided to go and work on my ow n. And I became partners with a Danish guy  he was going to si he did silkscreen printing  I did more of the graphic work  Interview with Annette Fein November 7  2008 39and he did he did pr inting for for artists and all sorts of things like that  until he left.
Well  specifically  the people who went to work  went on an eight hours shift.
But in the meantime  they called them lottas  those Swedish they work for the Red Cross  I guess  the type that type.
And when they found somebody who didnt go to work  they took to block 25.
The the probably very seldom that somebody was running around and uh didn't work  but somehow I did  I I managed to do that.
My job during the day was hooking up different cement machines to the electric wire s. I don't know how or why  but I became very proficient at it  and as a result in the later stages I was getting extra food so there was no reason for me to work for a Pole or anything else to get extra food.
And its nothing and it has to start at the root level  it has to start at the s with the school system and work its way up.
Or  when he was working something and if he did not work as fast as the policeman told him to do  that was a good way to basically not shoot him  but beat him to death.
So she She was accepted but there wasit's ca lledyou don't have t hose things here  volkenyensadig ; you have th is  yes  yeswith the hope that in a year later  twoI was so I had to go to work  to regular  normal school.
My mother my mother  Maria Wayshnitta Gureckas  she was born on the farm  and when Lithuania became independent  you know they established offices  various  and there was a need for the secretaries and all that clerical work  considerably  so she went through a cour some courses  and then started working in Lithuanian bureaucracy as a secretary.
And the whole town knew what happened  so when I was came to work and all start to say  Francisca  what's happened at church toda y. Oh  I say...what's happened.
Then to mix the cement  literally we had to carry the cement bags  which  by the way  were heavy   especially at my age.
And so  as I came there  we decided to go back to the ghetto.
So there was never a day that you did not work?
I cannot work and at the end  with may kisses your friend Teo.
And then they were uh  um...they were all taken away by Germans  of course.
But the Germans  they would take me  too  if I approached them.
But for us children and my father she felt that we go to because she did not go to work  she stayed home.
They did repair of roads  repair from bombings  heavy  physical work for which none of them were qualified but they learned.
I dont remember now because my mind doesnt work well but in those days I absorbed it all.
And it through all those years I did lots of growing you know  between the war and between my work  you know  I became extremely much more tolerant and and a much better person than I ever would be  even not all those things.
The Dutch government in exile in London arranged for me to have private lessons because I had l more year to go to finish my lycee education and which after I would have finished that education I could have entered graduate work in a 11 university.
You tell me some about the unde rground and then we get Tsippy(p h) to talk about her work in the drawing office.
You're gonna die there.ﬂ Not 11 that I think he knew that we were being murd ered outright but that it was cold and that you'd work yourself to death and that you might die in..you know  like in Siberia  people died in camps.
Did you work in construction  did you work in interior design?
He was again a first aid...uh...person in the camp and...uh...he put me into a good block  you know  into a...he seen that I that I have a easy work detail and he managed to give me his bread  you know.
The Germans already begin to put out laws  a law they needed young people to work.
That comes from living in the village wher e everybody had land and chickens and things  but I remember that Mr. Runjak because he was going to work  he could have scrambled eggs for breakfast  and we all had to take turns  who was going to get the empty pan and a piece of bread to eat to rub the bread in the fat and eat it  or maybe have a crumb or two of the egg left.
If he had given me just an opportunity to go to school and learn how to type or to become a bookkeeper  I would have  you know  been able to do something better than work in a factory in a wrapping department wrapping things.
What kind of work were you doing when you were working at Gestapo headquarters?
Shortly after we left  this is towards the end of 1944  he was taken out of territorial Hungary with his group and began to do similar work  fortifications  whatnot  in the Ukraine.
Yeah  we were free and then we went to that camp because we were not allowed to work  in Marneff.
And then youve done other work since then thats had to have been very depressing.
And then he wanted to have the girls come to the United States  which didnt work out  because one went back to Hungary.
They were all -- everybody that went to work  except if you were sick  they used to -- one day they used to give you permission to stay.
So I work a littLe bit and over there there was a very little town.
It was made out of redwood  I mean  and it was made by Finnis h carpe -- boat carpenters  who used to come during the winter season when Finland sort of freezes up  to work here where its warmer.
And he -- and he told me he will only take it if I w ill work for him.
I had I was sent twice  I was sent there for special work  also carrying 225 pounds of on to also to the top floor.
And I can understand why the 14 commandos (German) 15 certificate (German); term used for Nazi issued work permits.
Well Ilus I met later  somewhat later  not even in the beginning of my kitchen work.
And so  what had happened with the Germans  had they retreated by that point?
The rumor was that because people that would work  that would pay for the women and children and so on.
I said  you're coming to that house where I work for that Gestapo.
And I was crazy about him  because he was a photographer  an amateur photographer  and he di d beautiful work.
But  but she  especially on the   certain functions could not be performed by a woman  because we had no know-how  like repair ing of the roof  the replacing of broken glasses  putting a new floor  building partitions to  to divide camp  barra cks    designated to us  into a housing or sleeping  sleeping area and another area  so there we had the first time  certain ma le work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities.
My mother said : Lo ok  I have no money  nothing b ut the next day  tomo rrow  I will go to work.
He continued to work to try to earn a living throughout the war.
At one time I ran away from the group where they took us to work.
54 You are working within a structur e to try and make things work mo re efficiently  you're trying to help people in that structure.
For hundreds of them it didn't work because then it became a regular thing  that they knew--\ let me look--is this the right paper\ --this was the beginning in '41.
They were  you know  providing all these services needed in any community like health services  burial services and work.
Each one of us has to be assigned to a work place  and there what would you call the work places were called in Lodz  \ resorts.\
And they had places where they should work  and they need them.
So  that saved them also from having to work so hard  and theyd sometimes allow them access to some more food.
To the Jewish people  Then in a couple months   they take us to the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: And  Peter  when you were in the ghetto  you were in there with several other relatives.
And I want to achieve them before they finish the work.
And most of the people worked were taken out from there to work in various  various jobs.
Also another person -- a cousin of mine -- first cousin -- his nephew and my first cousin went on a work with me.
Now a work camp  that was something not pleasant but you had to work there  maybe in a factory  maybe make I don't know what; but the children went with the parents.
Over there  wherever I wanted to go  I had no problem with park ing  I didnt have to work streets -- walk streets to find a parking pl ace  and then go ba ck  and -- and so on.
Um  these work details  the outside work details  went on  you know  these work details had to do with the war effort.
They didn't know the difference even  what's a Jew and what's not a Jew.
They blocked up the ghetto; a special kommando came into the city and they announced nobody could go out to work.
A. Bad dreams that you missed so much -- you missed so much of living  because when you could live  you couldn't live because you had to work  to work  and to work when there was no money.
You had to ha -- make the things work  you know?
The other lesson that I was learning at this time was th e clandestine press  because we had wonderful 35 people who did work for the press  which was all controlled by the Fascists  who did control for the radio  which was all controlled by the Fascists.
24 family what in language and to work they take me.
And she couldn't work so hard...so I had so fa st  so I had to quick for her and quick for me for her not to be beaten up.
So  she 43 came from work and she went straight to th e station and she bought tickets for us to go back to Lodz because w e just came for the day to find out whats happening  and for the train  she knew exactly when the train will be coming  and she asked the man who was the head of Doroszka.
To stay  and that brought me in conflict with the military uh structure and uh we had to uh work this out.
So  so whenever we could escape a little  hide from the work  our pastime was to kill the lice  the  the; it was  uh  we suffered a lot there from  from  uh  from the other people.
This is not a concentration camp  this is a labor camp.
Don't send me to work because I saw my friends sw eeping the streets.\
I mean  they paid her for her work  and -- and life was very good in is -- in Sweden.
He had to have a sponsor who was willing to have enough money that in case he could not work  there would be no welfare for us; we had to have our own money and my father needed more b ecause he was a disabled war veteran so they figured that he may not get a job he re and we would become a burden to the country.
They disinfected the clothing  the places there  the clothes; the Germans did this.
Although he never did this kind of work before  he had at that time  I mean before all of this happened  he had his own textile busine ss selling dry goods.
They march you through that -- you had to run though that thing  and there was the SS standing  one guy had th e cane  and he had the t -- the end that -- the handle end out  and if he saw somebody that he thought was not able to work any more  he would pull him by the neck over to the side  take his number  and he had to stand th ere.
Her fath er was without work and she hadnt tasted butter before Hitler came.
They don't have too much because some members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war  but uh they co ntinue to  to work the land and they come with the less product to the market.
So  April first  we had just finished -- I -- I finished work is no longer ap-appropriate.
You could only walk where you work and to your barrack.
All of this was so unbelievable that even now that I am an adult  an old man  an artist  whenever I try to represent it graphically I look at my work and think that it is comple te]y surrealistic.
And he was not so well so that he would never have survived like my father if not for one thing a nd that is that different from my father who was being made to carry bricks an work very hard -- and work very hard .
After work -- well  I -- I dont know whether I told you that we ha d to  when we made the bunks  the bunk consisted of a straw mattress  and a -- and a wedge pillow  a very thin wedge pillow  Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 131and a blanket  of course.
And they told some people that work there  ﬁLook in the pockets  look all over.ﬂ If they find some money  some diamonds and gold  glasses  anything you find -- they made up places where they separated everything.
And then they said  well  why don't you just work on you're degree instead of just taking cour ses.
For inst ance  to make a telephone call to London from Berlin could last hours and hours and even within Germany it was not...you know  it was still in the age of...the the age when most of the work or all the work had to be done manually.
Perhaps not as much  but they were they and when they were eight years old they went to mines to work and so on.
Somebody had given them some money so that we can work on this archive  and Bill & Howe did our microfilming for us.
By the time my late father was married  they had a big cattle business.
Yes  the mass escape of this sonderkomma ndo was planned at that time was possible to escape  the fences were not so tight  Birkenau  it was in the middle of the woods and so on  and there were some escapes  yes  but you must see that people refused to work.
I -- I -- I just collapse from exhaustion  because I also work Sunday.
But  uh in this particular case  the SS came  apparently they had no intention of maybe having a mass execution but just fi re into some prisoners because somebody got angry  or was upset about something  not performing enough work that they  uh whatever the reason was which could be ma ny reasons.
My brother went out to work  my sister went out to work and I went out to work.
And we were guarded; I mean  stricter than...than in the work camp  you see.
There was a tower  one tower near the gate where they watching  and as I said  they were taking people to work and from work  and they were transporting whatever had to be transported.
B-Before we get to the lib -- the liberation  again  lets just talk a little more about Bergen-Belsen  did you work there?
I figured the only way you can understand what is -- but I decided later on thats not going to work.
I work  my family  my work made me forget my wife.
20 But was he still able to work when the Germans were there?
The main purpose  I understand  was...uh...uh...just to show that...uh... we can take care of ourselves  and also some sort of a warning also toward the Arabs  you know  that...\ Don't attack.ﬂ It didn't maybe work  but said don't attack us.
40 And there was already a truck hired  and I remember an afternoon some time in November  possibly mid-November or so  the truck was in th e factory yard and the -- they [indecipherable] after the work stopped  being loaded with basic furniture  bedsteads  mattresses  and -- and bedding and all our spare clothing  winter clothing  I mean you name it.
You said you were working with other educators  but were there other people who were coming from Washington or from the big cities to work with you  or were you going on your own?
I started to work in the designing room because I was very good with my hand always.
And she is the boss there  you know  shes USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 60got a group of people she work for  then -- and she do very good with the sign language.
But we got married in October 1941  and like I just told you  because so many young men were supposed to report lets call it to Madison Square Garden Interview with Frank Hyde May 4  2013 48 for work.
And I just had a need to be not only independent during my working li fe  because the money during my working life -- my work time  I -- I -- didnt mean that much.
A couple of weeks after we arrived  some strong people from our transport were selected to work in the Sonderkomando  but we had no idea what was going on.
And in 1948 when it was really communism  I had to let her go  the girl  and I had to go to work.
So they did not m arry for ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 a long time.
That was the rations you had then you marched to work  you got into  marched about six oclock  then you got into works about ten to quarter past six and then they used to hand us over to the civilians.
>> Bill Benson: At some point  you were told or got word about your father.
What was your impression  since this was the first time you di d factory work  that gave you a different impression about -- No I wa -- I was very -- it was very tiring and I had to stand  because I belonged to the u -- the youngest one -- I za -- I looked young.
So he was sent out to do manual work  clean horseman you're  ox man you're from the streets.
>> Jill Pauly: Only people who could work and could swear they would not become a burden on the state.
Yeah and then I had sort of started up some sort of a talking acquaintanceship with a Czech engineer  who ha d been taken by the Germans to work on some war plant.
My father really didnt want my mother to work because he felt it was really important that she take care of the children so that he could study.
It was Sunday and I didn't go to work and this boy said  I have a trick to make and  I said  fine.
And the Hebrew school  which was -- theyre trying to revive  it doesnt work.
Oh ma-main work there was  well  of course there were refugees in Switzerland   helping them get settled.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 52 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: EL: When you went out to work you came back at  at 7 at night yes.
Believe me  they didn't -- they didnt need the work  only to -- to murder us.
Because  when she would go out to work  they would have right right away to take her to work camp.
RJ] I came home then and my father took me down to see Mr Birchall and he said  ﬁyou can start work whenever you like  Ron.
So she is take -- she was taken to that place  to another work camp  where they would braid -- ... That they wanted to really gas you  and it didnt work?
So that was a very interesting lesson because the first time I was re sponsible for other peoples work  which was interesting.
Did some of the work groups go outside of the ghetto  or did everybody work inside the ghetto?
I wouldn't say one had the other one thing like this because it was a thing like disaster thing  you know everyone was trying to cooperate and see whatever we could work out.
The place was not too crowded  there was no work for us  and the food was at near starvation level.
If  as you work on this  sort of if you feel that on some aspect  you need some additional additional elucida elucidation Okay.
Shier came up before he went to work and he told me in Yiddish  \  .ﬂ So I told him  \ It's cold and I am almost frozen and so on and so.ﬂ He cried and he gave me 500 rubles.
Sure  I am happy that I went to the forest and had the opportunity to lead a platoon and to go ahead and do diversionary work like burning bridges  downing railroads  as I get to it a little bit later.
But soon after we walked away from the cattle train  we saw the people on the other side  which looked to us like crazy  and we thought that we came to work in a crazy house.
Few weeks later when they took my older brother to work  he was th at time already 14 years old.
And she took me into the kitchen  assigned me to work in the kitchen.
Sometimes we were lucky not to get the steam to work.
Well  and yes  I chose I chose to go to s to work during the day  make an honest living and went to school at night.
And my father had to prepare himself for a lot of things.
Well  he knew somebody in the mechanic business  and I could work there for a while  but the owner wouldn't allow me to do anything at all.
If I had been free I wouldnt work for the Germans.
That was -- one time they told -- I work in ausch -- in Birkenau  I work by bricks  with the tuchkas you know  schlep brick?
Well  I -- I -- it was not much of an apartment  it probably was a room  yeah  right.
He come to Jordan  and told Jordan that he got to do -- to get more people to do work  and the people are not coming.
But the work I was doing required a cleara nce  a secret clearance  later a top secret clearance.
I had s -- a kid who were helping me on the tractor  and he wouldnt work very well  and I thought  ﬁOh  hes a rotten kid.ﬂ When I think back of it now  I cannot even imagine that I didnt realize  that I didnt have the compassion.
The Germans didnt go out and grab people  Jews from the houses in the streets to go to work  it was already organized.
Food was  again  only a piece of bread in the morning.
Somehow they had work for it and they came out and they said they'd like to have all the doctors  the lawyers.
One day  when those guys were missing to work  they need 4 more to replace them  so he says to me  \ Go over to David  ask him to take you into this commando  you know  to this work commando.\
The farmers which were all around did their best and to feed their families and have something to sell and feed us  you know people living in this small town.
If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing  let him work in a hospital.
So we came there in the middle of the night  2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.
I mean  the Germans did a great job arranging for these groups.
My grandmother was very  very nurturing and loving and hugging and so was my mom  so I always attribute those first three years  especially having  you know  studied child development  those first three years of nurturing and care taking are so crucial for a child's growing and for feeling comfortable  and I really attributed to my mom and to my grand mom.
If you didnt go to work  they had the Jewish police.
ﬂ But of course I never did until  you know  until I did this work  which I did much later.
One day  I with the father  we work in the farm and we didnt go to sleep in the ghetto afte r that what the guy say what the German take from him all the gold stuff what he need to wo rk around that.
So after work  he brought all the workers to -- back to the ghetto  and he used to take my sister -- tell her to take off the -- or put on another -- something  a blouse  so that you dont see the -- the -- the yellow sign  took her out like he walks -- walks with a fraulein.
The work that was given to men was a lot ha rder and more difficult.
Movement you had but you had to go  you worked there but I didn't but the other girls they made they worked out underground and they had factories hidden in the woods like and they were making ammunition and the girls went out to work ammunition.
Well  she did work as a teacher at the time when I remember.
And of course few days I stayed Dachau because I and also I sign-up to work for there was a lot of workers you know.
She had to buy it  and it took her a lot of work.
DL] So did you talk to any of the Jews  or did you manage to talk to any of the Jews  or communicate with them? [
Was there anything else that you wanted to to mention about him  and his work?
And then Did you work at all or did you go to I dont think so.
So if you were going to have your self-respect  a nd made a livi you know  knew that you had to make an honest living  you had to go to work.
Whatever  as far as I could remember  whatever my father used to smuggle in through the gates  because in the morning he used to go to work  come back at night  as a barber.
Uh they had a special camp  a special prisoner of war camp and they were guarded by German...by German soldiers  by by by by by army soldiers  but they put them to work in that factory and when I heard this I said I have to come...I have to meet them.
When you laying in a stable  you haven't got work to eat  and you jealous the others die and I didn't.
I give them a day's work  so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too  if they pay you  you could work for somebody else too.
Yeah  the French underground  lik e I said  they did not work with us  but Pol Polonski and Jack Roytman  who were the two guys in Toulouse  told us we--because the French underground apparently furnished--supplied--the passer.
After they went out to work  each group went a different direction  you know.
I was looking to get away from the uncertain ty -- uncertainty  to start building my life  to get some sort of a profession where I could -- where I know if I cannot do it -- if I cannot work for myself -- be on my own  is work for someone in a productive capacity.
If you didnt look healthy they wouldnt send you to work.
But you see  before they took all the -- took us out of Ozerkoff Ghetto  we all had to register that you were a tradesman or whatever  they looked through this list and summoned my father to do some work for them.
Okay  basically  the first six months I l earned Hebrew  and then I just wanted to ge-get work  and I found work in a silks doing silkscreen printing.
So  she burned the passport  and I was without a passport and I went to work.
This work has also provided Michel with new information related to his own experience in Belgium and Marseille that we will hear more about later.
And then he included...then he told about how  after a certain period of time  Jews were begun to be brought into Dachau after Goering had begun his nefarious work in Prussia.
And he says  well  if you wait an hour or so til I finish my work  I think my neighbor may hire you.
In other words  you worked in the United States and then went back to Italy -- No  no  no  I didnt work -- I work in the United States as an interpreter  then I went back to Italy.
And they tried to 102 to 26 prolong these periods  and and and to offered Jews for work in order to spare their lives.
We were worried that the work  that business  I mean already we start worrying.
She couldn't work as a dentist and after World War II she had to take -- when she became a French national   she had to take a kind of general French culture exam a nd the last exam of dental school.
Just the girl -- th -- some of the women that would work -- work at the camp that were -- you know  lived in the village  but they didnt say very much  and -- of course there was a language barrier.

We went back to our work  regular shifts that you had  and all of a sudden didn't take them a couple of weeks  three weeks when the guy says we're all going to be deported by such and such date  and the date was there.
I will not survive tomorrow one day cause I cannot work.
So I was accepted by the people  by the small group that sort of controlled the camp   but I was put to work like everybody else.
>> Regina Spiegel: From there  one was Baumlitz  where they used to make -- most of the places that I was was always something to do with the war  you know  either stuff to shoot  and actually from Baumlitz we used to work on -- they told us we have to clean very clean  working on Panzerfaust  because if you leave anything it can fire back.
came to an end  they were all looking for work  so many of them found the jobs at with IRO  International Refugee Organization  and the infamous UNRRA.
Yes  I thought it was just a labor camp  and right away they took care of me  I didn't have to suffer any hunger  nobody was beating me up  you know  and we didn't have to work even  it was only Auschwitz was only a passing.
So at one point you went away  you were doing your work  or your education  and you came back  and your brother was in hiding.
The construction take about two  three years to build up everything  that the kind of work.
Uh in Starachowice  I uh I was not uh with the uh work squads that were uh going out  uh outside the camp working in factories uh whether it was munitions or whatever for the uh Germans.
Shell take a short story and work on it for a year  and still not want to show it to anyone.
He went to work and he put me there in a shack and he says I will bring you something to eat.
We concentrated more on working and  and getting married and having children and so we weren't fixated on careers for a lifetime  we were interested in having interesting work experiences  but not necessarily lifetime careers.
They had to prove their strength  their capacity to work another day.
We work hard  12 hours a shi--12 hour shift  no  8 hour shift  I think because was three shifts working in this factory.
They said we are going to work in the Bata factory.
Imagine  she couldn't make a living for us  I have to work  be in school .
Yes  I graduated to become a locomotive en gineer  driving a locomotive which I liked very much  and after I graduated they sent me to a place to work  which was called Kamionka Strumi owa located about twenty five kilometers from Lubov  the city of Lubov.
And when you came here  you did work in a factory.
We were told we're going to work but didn't know it was work in concentration camp.
This nationalization destroyed the small enterprises and in the place where I was working  they were forced to close practically  so I started to work as an accountant  as an economist in an enterprise factory which was manufacturing clothes.
So now that I had to move  I said to Mr. London  now you -- I like to work in the sewing -- in the sewing room.
But for the time being  they...they used to send transport to go for work in labor camps.
But look at another reason that I was not eager to get involved at the last gather ing last March was because I know from the work that Belle was doing that they were busy writi ng resolutions concerning the es tablishment of th e International Criminal Court at the Hague as well as Bosnia an d the apprehension of thos e war criminals  and so on and so forth.
So every day  when I went to work for the Quakers  I had to go by these damn cars  with swastika flags on.
So they would leave their shoes at home and everybody had sort of a little mud room and they would put on wooden shoes and then go into the manufactory  you know  through the courtyard and into the ma nufactory and work.
Uh there's another stor y of uh which was given by Professor deYoung  who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from Holland  and he was a young man and and and the government of exile in Holland during World war II  and was in charge of radio emissions  and he gets hold of some of my reports  and he reports in a lecture he gave in Washi ngton...no  in Harvard  some time ago  and uh tells the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of Holland  .
So he had two or three of them that did the work.
Did your mother go to -- was she -- did she work?
And in those days we were not pooled but this we I was doing ABC  and the people I had used to work with was ceeb from CBS were next door in the next booth.
And I had to work 6:00 in the morning  and even some...most of the time until 9:00 in the evening.
I dont mind if you kill all the Russian Jews  but the German Jews are good people  they work  theyre qualified  I want to keep them.
You don't know if you gonna come back  because they ...you walk on the street and they need 100 people to go to work  they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you.
The told us to report somewhere  then we would work awhile  then back to the pigpen.
And I came out full of blood  I had some cuts  I had even cut myself  I'm filled with blood  and some of us in the group  in the group for the people went back to the work  so she  she knew I was there  she came there  she took a handkerchief  put o n my bandage on and wiped off my blood  and we were lucky  they came a truck with ----------  two Germans   and I  I just came out and he  he probably didn't see me because he just came  otherwise he would seen something wrong.
And of course everyone started taking the mickey out of them  saying it was funny to be stupid to have the two big fellas on the end  they were actually carrying the pole  but then afterwards of course we realised they were Jews  or told they were Jews  and afterwards when we went to work in the factory  course we obviously knew they were Jews. [
And uh they said no they had to send people to  to Germany for other work in  in other  other camps.
Then you went to work and there were three roll calls at that time I came  three roll calls of the prisoners a day.
There were still a lot of butchers around and cattle and many times he came home beaten up and in the spring or early summer of 1941  while my father was away in a market  the gendarme or whatever...I don't remember anymore what they were calling the police...came with an order to tell my mother that in a week  in a week we will be taken away  that we are not Hungarian citizens and we will be taken away someplace else  to someplace where there is work  in work camps.
And I went back to my office to continue my work  and no charges whatever.
Okay  because of the difficult economic conditions when we first came  and particularly before my father got a good jo b as a cook  my mother also went out to work as a domestic on a day day daily basis.
she got plenty work to do  with -- wi -- Mm-hm.
There was one young man from my hometown  he used to work for my father  he was the one who was putting the material on the conveyor.
And I stayed with him until six years  then I went to work for another company  and I ended up with the company I mentioned called Shoppers Fair.
And I wondered if you could tell me  you mentioned that you me t a friend  Bets y Gordon  and that you were  at first you weren' t working but then you were work ing doing sewing with her?
The moment she finished her work and she cam e back home  she call me  ﬁAaron  I saw Vanya over there.ﬂ His name was Vanya.
And whoever was a physician  and his daughter as a matter of fact  his adopted daughter speaks Swedish and started to work for Wallenberg.
And  uh  so it's it was very dangerous that an  an  SS what kills any people sometimes took me out for  for work to do  but...that was  I don't know why  it was just my luck perhaps.
They were also the people that the life of the ghetto depe nd on  because they had the strength to work  and the older generation was sort of losing this physical strength of working the factories.
He was the man in charge to make sure the people should go to work.
Thats -- you had to be it yourself  you have to loo -- something -- You just have to look and see -- Look and see -- a little bit you had start to work  you had to start working while he need -- the boss needs his work -- Right. --
They reached a certain point of infirmity or they came in and they were of no use to the work program.
We had good things to e at because it was a farming town.
Sometimes they Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22  1997 88went out with friends and we didnt like th eir friends  because their friends  they left the kids with babysitters  it didnt work out.
So when they were married  they moved USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0001 44 in commuting distance to his work in  in  in Camden  so they moved to Haddenfield in the Cherry Hill area and have moved  you know  from that little garden apartment into a house and then into the home that they still occupy in Cherry Hill.
But my brother knew a few words and he said I will work hard and I will do this  so they finally accepted us.
And I starte d to work with him in the schools and when he had a Day of Remembrance  I was his firs t keynote speaker at the Daly Center and I spoke out at the Daly Center.
SWB: Tell me about the sort of day-to-day life you had with the orchestra work.

Irving Hass: I was too young to go and work in a labor wit h a pick and shovel.
So you were in New Jersey and you started looking for work.

But I don't think it lasted more than a day b ecause the following day I did go to work.
I have no special trade and I don't money to start a business  so I ended up I wanted to go as a waiter  I work as a waiter.
In the evening we were assigned to the ambulance because all the people came during  from their  from work  returning from work  they came to the ambulance  we treated them  they had different kind of wounds  were hurt or broken fingers or something  we treated them too.
This is tape one  side B. Now  you were giving me a lot of information about your Montessori work over the years  and you had been telling me about this collection of books and films and and other things.
Unfortunately  I went only three grades because I had to go to work.
I don't know what kind of wo rk they did  but not the same work that we did  Jewish people.
And somehow never work ed because my husband liked to take long vacations and I started to work for school syst em and was teaching German.
We have th e -- an-and we went to -- they -- they put a -- a ghetto  they made us a ghetto in our city.
I forgot how you name it  you know  but those you know  you you got to work.
W-Well  what was their They didnt have to work  because over everything free.

We were there fou r years but it doesnt quite work in terms of because it overlaps years.
I didn't know th at night where we were  but she was a gentile woman who was living on the second floor somewhere  and we lived with her for a few weeks and we had to stay in bed all day because being a single woman  the people who were below her knew that there was no one else living in the apartment and she went to work every day  so she continued to go to work everyday  I guess because she didn't want anyone to suspect that she was working with the underground  and Freddie and I had to stay in bed all day but I mean this was uh...I was seven.
This was my work after I came back from...from labor camp let's say.
And then I had to go after Sabbath  pick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly  th ey let me in their house  but like barely  and try and copy it over.

Maybe the stomach doesnt work  and th is is why I did go in chiropractic.
It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go out from the ghetto  you know  with the Germans to work.
So  like we come here and do this work  which is not easy  because you never adapt  for you to come here and visit  this is just the beginning of learning .
Which actually was paying off a little bit  you know  they were paying me far more than I was worth  and I had originally asked just to to work for nothing  but they wouldnt accept that.
And we heard of it...you know  rumors were going around that whoever they took and they couldn't work  they threw them in and...like he said...they killed them.
You had to  when they went to work  they used to lock up the shops okay?
Otherwise  it was cold all...all over and the only light that was there was about in a big  big place  a little about maybe... The next day we had to go to work.
And  but through my friend Hans Fabisch  whom I mentioned ear lier and who was training to become a physician  he sort of advised me on certain b ack symptoms which cannot be traced by a doctor which are purely subjective  but make you incapable of working  it has to sort of hurt at a certain point and when the doctor pushes this way it hurts more and that way it hurts less  and so I feigned that and so I received an official sort of a statement  yeah  as a Jew I couldn't just call in  I'm sick today  you had to have a physician certified written statement  you know  that Ernest Fontheim  you know  has blah  blah  such and such a sickness or disease and is not capable to come to work.
From there  they take us because  we finished the work in Valea Homorod.

Can you remember what you were thinking as you did this work?

I didnt know how will I come to morrow to work and look in his eyes  if he will still here after everything they told about him  and this Barbara  who happened to be -- you know  she -- of course she liked him  but he was -- he was very respectable man  that was far for her.
Did you did he ever talk about No  we dont no  didnt talk about it  he had to go to work  a nd had to lay make a living.
The work was impossible for me   I was not well yet you see?
Well  unfortunately  uh  uh the  the smell was the was most was  was the burning of those bodies and uh  and then it was the people that which had dysentery and it was an awful way to uh  it certainly was  I had to smell  and uh  we had um  we  we watched an  a lot of those people die  and  and they would be  and this happened many were beaten to death just for that alone because  because they could not keep their uh their bowels and  and they had no way of uh of going to  to  to a bathroom  and uh and then they that's the musi c that was playing which was a mockery  uh  in a  in a place where they were killing daily  they had this band of music consisting of uh prisoners that were forced to play music as they marched to work and from work  and bringing back uh bodies uh killed while working because uh  uh  uh they  they were beaten to death.
No money  no job  no work  no work  afraid every day  afraid in your bed  afraid in your house  you wanted to go out  you were afraid  you still went out.
We want to talk about what you did wi th your work with .
Somehow I got pencil and paper  and I did writing  and writing  and writing.
Anyway  well after Sarah was born  I did not work any more.
So we found out about another camp and we thought that maybe our families were there.
So basically  it was a labor camp and then th ey took you out from there to go to work?
You cant work like dog -- like a man and not come out scarred.
07:04:48 So  I worked for ten years  I work  fashi on consultant  Macy  Herald Square  the main building.
The work brigade is told that every third and then every fourth  and every x person -- Yeah. --
A lot of people were also physically exhausted because they were not used to heavy labor ; the doctors  lawyers  people who did not physically work before the war.
And uh then uh uh in in the summer of '41  uh in the course of the uh events and especially uh after uh uh...after uh Germany was successful in Poland and in France and in in in Norway  and had taken over all these countries and occupied them  uh there started what we called the the final solution also in Germany  especially in Be rlin  and uh then I came to the conclusion that uh it's better to stay away from work in the centr al office because there was nothing we could do any more for our for our Jewish people  and I had th e the feeling and I want to be careful in this respect  that we more or less uh would be in the danger to be more helpers to the Nazis than than to do what what was necessary to do in the Jewish interest  though I realized fully that all these leaders  devoted men  most of them had become ma rtyrs  tried to do their best to save Jewish lives  but uh uh there was nothing anymore to be done  so I decided to to become separated from the work for the for the rest... call them...of Jews in Germany and I uh uh had to uh report to an office which distributes uh distributed uh Jewish workers in in...for forced labor.
01:23:22 So the council was -- would gather people for work or for something.
I needed money too  so I started to work in a place.
32 Did you have any other friends  or acquaintances in the United States  going to do this same kind of work in Europe?
At the time you were writing an d reading your work  what was going on in the world at that point in time?
I think that when therere other ways of dealing with it  that would be the preferred way   to me  like (you know) getting involved in your in your work  in your family life  and And th at was effective  of course  for a long time.
You will be free to ma nage your life as well you can  so each was supposed to be a municipa l...a a chairman of a municipal council  so Dr. Elkes says I have no experience at all in municipality  in municipality...municipal work.
And th anks to her  we went into the best labor cam p when we went to work in the working camp when they sent us.
But documented incident  because as you went out to work all through the year there were kind Lithuanian people  too.
But the colleagues -- I still ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 remember my father's colleagues.
So there were a lo t of kids  and then I could  during the day do my underground work  but I slept there.
Oh yes  my mother cooked  but we had servan ts in the house that did the heavy work.
They teach all the things that ought to be taught in terms of team work and cooperation and practice and respect for the other team and all that.
>> Bill Benson : What was the labor that you were forced to do?
And they took us to work  we worked very hard  Interview with Hannah Kalman May 20  1999 43with no food  with nothing.
105 people that day  the minute they went out to work  they selected and there was the grave.
He come and the block ma n make a report to him  so many men go ready go to work  so many men is sick  so many die over night.
I told them I will not because I don't want they should kill 10 for l. The next day they went to work.
That they need--for example  at one time they need strong people  so they took all the strong men and they put them to work  and they send them away.
And many times he has to get up middle in the night  and has to go in if the people cant work out the problems  then they call the boss  and he has Sylvia Green 109 January 11  1996 Page 109 to go in.
And these places where they distributed the food  mostly the old people had to go because they had no place of work.
Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 63 Thats right  I mean  you didnt like I said  in the displace camp you did not have to work.
And he some times even got in some extra piece  for the extra or bread  for the work.
And eventually  as soon as he finished school  he went to work.
A-And when I came back I was restless and didnt know what to do  so I went to work for the navy  the navy hospital in the as a pharmacist.
And then finally my father  you know  he was getting restless and he went ahead to Paris to see what he could do and he did find some kind of work there and a place for us to stay  a furnished room.
Where we worked in the factory  there were little metal boxes to keep no t the garbage but the debris  you know  from work  you know  that something that wa s spoiled  a piece of material  what have you.
Your mother -- what kind of work  or what did she do when she got back to Berlin?
I said to him in Russian [speaks Russian] do you know he is Jewish and I am Jewish too?
We finally stopped one afternoon  we finally arrived at AuschwitzBirkenau where that famous sign says \ Work makes you free.\
We support the center  the Wiesenthal center in Los Angeles and it was a painful trial but a very necessary one because as the Holocaust deniers come out  as the Holocaust survivors die off  without your good work and the Holocaust like this  there is a danger that the world will forget.
You have to realize I work for 50 cents an hour.
And so he started making arrangements to get permission to work and live in Holland  while he was still employed in Germany.
And then a couple days after (cough) came some recruiter from some uh sugar factories that needed people to harvest uh sugar beets and seemed like uh the work was pretty tough but they paid well so with a buddy of mine we went and signed or signed up and uh worked for about three weeks and then my buddy had a brillant idea.
And to work out the principles and to set up the machinery and to put it into legislative form so that it will be passed by a parliament and be enforced by a whole series of judicial instruments and courts and agencies on an enormous scale  I mean millions of claims  Jews and non-Jews.
The camp was situated on a  on a mountainside and our work was to carry these big wooden planks up on the steep mountain  that we we stood like three girls or five girls on there  one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the mountains.
There in the lab was working a older lady from Bucharest who also finished university as myself and we had experience  10 years experience in Romania and that means we knew the work  you know?
I started 167 to work  I started to work and then I figured theres nothing to it.
Yes  we were running to tr y and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work  during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really Nazis  but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house.
Steven -- all my kids had to go to work at the age of 13  just like my father  you know  you -- you have to have a trade.
What was it like in the DP camp  did you work?
It was 104 degrees  and the air conditioning didnt work  but it didnt matter.
And did a lot of work  but I re ally learned English that way.
Because I then l earned that in the United St ates  it isn't very elegant to work in a shop  that you have to work in an office  to be  quote  so mething.
After the War  I found out how he arranged it  and this proved to me how sincere and honest he is  that he really wants to save my life and after work I dropped my arm band with my star carelessly on the tracks because if they would find it they would search for the one who threw it away  and I boarded the train to   half hour ride.
I had to work all three machines  and make tea twice a day for everybody who was there.
But when the ghetto was established  it wasnt the medieval ghetto  it was everybody was crowded in  in the small place  tak they didnt work in their professions  they had to work outside  you know  s-simple some digging or something.
And when I said to the man in the tax office  I said  \ We pay taxes  but you don't allow us to work.
So  whether they took glasses routinely of people they were sending to work  would it make sense to take glasses away from people you want to work -- for -- who -- who have to work for you?
But they were there and talking  each one had their own own the work.
You had finished the work in the textile factory and then -- Yes.
I could have done other things  I was offered other opportunities in the Fund  but I stayed where I was because I enjoyed the work I was doing.
On this side we used to work  in in this side they used to keep the parts.
And the Lithuanians from their side was trying to do the best they can  a nd they can't do it and it doesn't work.
Yeah  and they know about -- there was us people what they take to work.
And you work all night because everything is done at night.
I had a brother there  a tailor  he was doing subcontracting  tailoring  and I went to him for a while  then I went to work for somebody else and I worked until 1939  ‚till three days before the war broke out.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 20 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: hard to get to the water.
What we did do though  is to when we could  when we saw there were no guards right around  who could see it  we would exchange the sabotage work that we did on the railroads.
And he was -- he had an business in Germany  he did car u-upholster work  and he was my -- friend of mine.
And some people who didnt work in the kitchen  were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard -- Yes. --
I mean  we all thought there wouldn't be any difference between a Jew and a non-Jew  for instance.
The ghetto people went out to work and there was a lot of cultural activity in the ghetto that came to me as a total surprise.
When I got after the call to the work service  after his execution  that I took the stand and refused to take part.
My grandfat her was a was a combination of he Interview with Dino Brugioni November 13  2014 8was a stone mason  brick mason  and an d and I would work with him.
You are supposed to work.ﬂ ﬁI pay well  people who go and work for me.
So my fath er said  ﬁLet him stay with us.ﬂ And somehow my mother was much more able to -- to work wi th him  and he loved my mother  he absolutely adored her.
So in the end we went out to Palo Alto and thats where we spent two and a half years and -- and he actually did some very good work at the Hoover Institute.
No money  no work  the friends I thought I had are not friends anymore.
Kapo Kapos were group people who led groups of people to work and to exercise and to kill at will.
And I started taking classes because I want to keep my mind working  and I have to find a niche for my volunteer work  because the woman I work for is fantastic.
Did you have any idea what was happening in Germany might come to your town?
Im now going to work with children  which I look forward to.
So there the rumors are going that when you go willingly and say youre I want to go to work in Germany  you can choose the name  the city  wherever you want to go  they take you.
Like this was legal be cause some people had German ke nn cards false but this usually didn't work because they could find it out easy.
First I went on Wednesday afternoons and then Larry asked if there were anybody here who would be willing to work on weekends because thats when they really need help.
Because also  when she moved away  eventually my brother-in-law got  after another dentist  a very nice -- for himself  an office th-that he didn't have to work for the -- you know  for the socialized  he could do private work for himself.
During these few months before October  be fore the Hungarian Nazis come in  before the comes in  are you and Wallenberg both organizing the gr oup of people who will be doing all the work  helping?
Now actually it turned out that things didn't work quite the way the Nazi organization book specified but at least that was the theory then  and that was exchanged at these meetings.
Yes  I made quite a lot of frie nds but really we didnt keep it up because a small  a quarter of the people ended up in England  and a lot of those eventually got to America anyway because so many of them had quota numbers to get into America at a future date  an d so quite a few left during the war even  and I think we were sort of spread around th e country  and I in par ticular was sent away  straightaway two days after we arrived I was sent to a convalescent home by the seaside to scrub 12 floors for them you know  because the only work yo u were allowed to do wa s domestic work  so I was sent away straightaway.
I was always thinking that to myself  that I like nice things and I would work for it.
And there was Raoul Wallenberg  and uh  he introduced himself  I didn't really know who he was  ad uh  he asked me in English  that time  \ Would you like to work with me?\
And I as a writer would work on their cover story  which was very much like writing a story.
While I was working as a slave labor on the railroad  every Jew or Jewess was not because we had the and we had to work with our bare hands to wash the toilets and scrub the floors.
I would say maybe a week  and they made me work uh on a...breaking stones.
My uncle was  had a franchise for the Richmond  Virginia area of Pepsi Cola.
We did a lot of  but our  we as lawyers did a lot of investigative work  especially in the black community  because the level of trust was a lot bigger.
There was no pl ace to really work any mo re.
So they pushed in more people what they got to go to work.
My father worked in a factory at that time  my mother didn't work.
But when I came back from work  they didnt ge t food  those people who didnt work and I gave them my half of the bread and I dressed them up.
When a person was still there  naturally it was a possibility that he was sent for another place to work  to make against the tanks or something  so it was not hundred percent and this was not such an organization but was working like a clock work.
I only began knowing him when he was  you know  55  or with the you know  a a grown-up  and doing work on the farm.
Going to even when they  when my husband went to work I took both kids  schlepped them to school.
She says that she participated  that she was the one who did most of the work to get us out of Czechoslovakia.
This work has also provided Michel with new information related to his own experience in Belgium and Marseilles  that we will hear more about that later.
She tried to get rid of me a long time ago  it didnt work.
They just want to send the Jews in camps to work.
And it was like in the middle  this work was always done like in the middle of th e night  like from suppertime around  before it got dark  unti l like the middle of the night.
And so how was Hannah   who was younger than you  taken to work  to be a cook?
So you get to Auschwitz  di -- youve heard about Auschwitz?
The pe ople who wanted to leave the Netherlands or the workers at the -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Whether you liked it or not  you were sent to work in Germany or in France.
After six weeks of work and hard labor...oh yes...I'm I'm forgetting something...when we first came to Flossenburg  we were marched by this young SS guards with their dogs up the hill to the camp  we we were brought before a very large building in a kind of assembly area  and we were...there were four hundred and fifty of us approximatel y  and we were all told to undress  to leave our clothing on the floor and all our possessions and we go in to take showers.
And at work we used to get a soup a day at noontime  mostly peas.
Because I think my father would not have been allowed to work anymore.
If you are not attached  they put you there and write your number and you work and you work until 6:00  7:00  it depends  and then come back.
Now it comes in han dy because I dont have to work the computer.
I never assigned a problem I didnt work through first  and I knew exactly where they were going to be hung up.
And he made an arrangement for me to work as an apprentice.
On behalf of the Holocaust Museum I thank you for sharing with us  your story.
And I was give n a a cou work at one of my uncles packages to Poland office  to write some addresses on the things  on the and to be able to live  because my mother  by her [break] All right  so after when di where were you when the war ended?
But I know that my aunt  a cous in of my mother work ed in such a shop and she couldnt give me more  but still she tried.
And I would like to work  I would like to be in the outside world.ﬂ So I said  ﬁWhy arent you?ﬂ Because I cannot.
But normally he was assigned to people to treat or to work in this pla ce or that.
So you never went back to work -- I never went back until I was 92  I was.
That way  not for his good will  no  just was a good person to work for them.
What was the extent of your dut ies while you were doing this work?
After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work  so they put us to working more days.
They told me everybody told me that my Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20  2014 114father had no hand  so he couldnt work  so they made him a night watchman.
Jim had his problems getting adjusted to work and working for other people  he never could work well for other people and I was a lways a partner to him in that respect because first of all  I understood very quickly what was bothering him and I was able to  he was able to talk things over with me.
I didnt -- I didnt eat that -- now I -- I -- I gained weight  because I can work so much  but I was walking with -- with weights in my hand  and I was walking I -- I never gained a pound.
So then they couldn't say that we couldn't do th e work; because if we couldn't have done the work  they wouldn't have kept us there in the fi rst place.
on the other side  but some people promise they know the law  they know the area  but it didnt work -- it didnt -- I dont know if they told the truth.
When they would know that you were helping Jews they would put you in a concentration camp and kill you  but I said certain people a lot of them were picked up on the street and in the churches to work in factories in Germany.
I don't really know  but we got the stu ff which obviously needed an enormous amount of work done on it.
But I like my work  and I I [indecipherable] now that I got old and sick  if I go to work  like I have to go in this rainy and snowy day  I really should be in bed  but when I come here I dont feel sick at all  because ma my mind is occupied with what Im doing and not with my sickness.
And again  on market day  Mother dressed me  dressed herself  and we left with the work details and we kept on walking.
He he he he did buy his supplies  I think  in New York   and then eventually  I I I I think he did find them  he he did work very hard  he was very ambitious  in terms of what he had to do.
I will get it from him but I have to come back in ten days because he tried to arrange it at once but it doesnt work.
Nevertheless  you know  she  with trepidations  turned us and fulfilled her work.
This was the segregation because in Auschwitz or in Birkenau they want you to still be healthy and able to work  and they had there later when I went to work  I saw them  but they had there all working people who had still a lot of energy in them.
My mother had an argument th roughout the rest of our lives  which in retrospect is the most stupid  ridiculous ar gument  especially by 19 90 standards  but in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 56 college  the last year of college  I was friends  pals  with another woman in the chemistr -- who was a chemistry major  and were still fri ends  I mean  wa -- we still talk to each other  and I got her a job  as a matter of fact   where I used to work.
Did any of you  or did you see any acts of resistance of any sort or sabotage?
I remember I pinched her cheeks sometimes so she would survive so maybe made a little bit her hair so that the Germans wont say you are too old to work.
And then he went for specialized work to Munich and studied in Munich for awhile before he actually went into practice.
Well  when you came in  you were always asked and filled out what work or what you do?
If you pick  if you look at you  you're young enough  all right  with no children  you're going to the camp to work  all ri ght.
I've done all of this work; whatever is here  I've made without help  and now you're going to...\  So when I saw how this was going I said to Jacob  \ Let's you 8 and I step out of this meeting and have a word with one another.\
Not that we carried a lot to work with us  but due to the fact that my parents met that young men at the time  Mother insisted  especially since it was getting a little colder  that we wear three outer layers of clothes and good shoes that we have a good coat when we go to work because normally  she wouldnt have even thought about it.
And she  in ch apter 12 for example  speaks of the organization  the Jewish organization that were in [indecipherable]  that -- who did  you know  the different work  okay.
Boys and girls that didn't have ID but still were able to work  they put them to the left side.
They took them in the morning -- not all of them  Im sure  but this ones what I know  they picked them up in the morning  take them outside the ghetto there to work  and evening brought them back.
Whatever you have  put -- they are taking you to Estonia for work.
Maybe  we going to be free or maybe we going to be dead.ﬂ So I say  ﬁI have to try to survive long as I can so I try not to work too much.ﬂ And I become in a Kommando 37.
Anxious that something can happen in the bus in which we are going home or coming to work.
Ohrdruf was a work camp  it wasnt they they di-didnt have the the killer machinery  the ovens and all that  but they were working them to death.
In other words  I didn't ask to go to work to the KGB.
The reason Jews did not live in Starachowice  because to qualify  you had to work in the factory  you see?
And then when we moved to Indianapolis I couldnt find anybody to work with and so I hadnt done anything for years until about three years ago  when I met somebody by accident  and so Im at it again.
And after the war I went back to work and got my Ph.D. in Biochemistry.
And then a bell rang and we could go to work.
But you have to be in time outside to go to work.
If you couldn't do it  they didn't let him out...go out the shift--the shaft  'til his work was completed.
So  in 1968 when I came here  it took me a lot of work  because I couldnt get the visa to America before I get the permission  a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit.
Most of the people in our room we re people who went to work.
My mother hardly ever went to church  but not because she didn't believe in God  or she was not a Christian  but there was too much work to do at home.
The part which was written -- the framework was written after the work.
They were born after the war by now and there is some wonderful work being done  sensitive  insightful.
Was a coal mining town  and there was plenty of work  and paid well.
Six of us were pulled out and put onto another truck  with several other women  to go to work in a factory.
I came to work for the Germans  and I missed my train  and I don't know where to sleep.
He was in the  when we had to go in the factories to work in small parties  he was one of a small party  that was painting pylons.
Before we get to there  is so did you spi was your work the whole time you were in Buchenwald splitting these trunks?
And he came to Gastonia to be  like the chief chemist for the factory  dye work and things like that.
And those were the dead for last four or five days  when the crematorium did not work.
So he came back and again he went to hospital  and they didnt care  they really like him  so that he work in hospital.
It didn't cost him money  you know  sent  so all of a sudden I get...I get a call from the workshop  big work shops uh that I should immediately come.
How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position  to work with Nazis and trying to sort of get them back on a normal footing on the -- on the non-Nazi lifestyle or non-Nazi outlook.
Then eventually they started -- Jewish councils started demanding that Jewish men  able -bodied men  report for work in Germany and also to build fortifications along the coast of France and Belgium  the Atlantic Wall th at was built to prevent the allies from landing.
I eventually was made a job offer by then the human resources administration of the city of New York  which was then the parent organization for the agency that I still work for  which is the New York City administration for Childrens Services.
>> Steve Fenves: Well  I think the very first day of occupation the current law of Hungary was announced that gentiles were not permitted to work for Jews.
And then  three days after we were incarcerated in the ghetto  they finished the the the barbed wire fence around the ghetto and the gate and then three days...and they every day they gave Jewish committee head to mobilize Jewish work ers for the various German places to to clean the barracks  military barracks and the Gestapo uh building  to clean the pavement  to...tailors  uh pressers and all kinds of things.
And we were the ones what  what did this kind of work.
And she ended up in a small town not too far from Interview with Andrew Glass February 14  2005 33Warsaw  and when she was 104  she was doing some  what might be called relief work.
So I called my mother and my father  and I say  \ What should I do?\
And so it was the easiest work for me because I didn't have to Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 138get dressed or anything like that.
Th e work was so hard that many prisoners would cut off their hands.
>> Bill Benson: By that time  Henry  where did you think they were taking you?
I mean I think people who work in legal services across the country who devote their lives or their careers to serving the poor  are a wonderful group  I have a lot of admiration for them.
When we stopped you were talking about your work at the museum giving meaning to your life.
I said  ﬁYes  thats what Im going to do.ﬂ So when I got back to Baltimore  I went to a shorthand and typing st -- school  to do shorthand and typing  because I knew I had to go to work.
Before we get to your work in your fighting group in your resistance  during the war  Ive heard that your father hid a Jewish family  or hid Jews and I wonder if you can tell us that?
He was in his 70s  but wanted to continue to work  which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and Im probably about the same age he was when he retired.
We was tired  and hungry  but we went  because we Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24  2010 32 thought maybe this a good thing  maybe well work as schneiderin   and thats very good.
Anyways  in the morning  I showed to work  and with the last whatever force I had I walked.
>> Bill Benson: I was struck -- you shared with me that as you were out there doing these work details where you're forced to clean up rubble  really hard work out there -- >> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
And she was worse than the Gestapo because she want ed to show off how sh e work.
You have to go and work first and earn enough money to go to school.ﬂ Well  that was the last I ever went to see her again  because I didnt -- I thought that was just a complete waste of time to get that sort of advice.
Once he told them Moldavia n and that didn't work  so the next he got captured when he ran away with the other guy  you have the name  I don't remember  they told both that they were Tartar  and he advised him to say the same and he'd teach him a couple of words here and there and that's it.
But he supported me with my work  and he ab some of his colleagues would say  youre making enough money and you let Lena travel around to Mississippi and and [indecipherable] and all these different places.
Where -- the purpose of this work really  we realized after a year and a half of working there  we realized that those stones practically never used  but were only a reason for killing us.
T hey told me that in the morning  every able-bodied person had to go out and do some work for the Germans.
And before long  I found myself in charge of that work group  not by my choice but by Fischers choice.
He had a plate carved  you know  carved and beautiful work.
One evening I come home for work  I says to my aunt  to uncles wife  give me the soup  Ill go down to Grandmother and give it.
Because we needed to...together to find the way to work for the values we had set.
The work was -- first we received a piece of bread before we went to work.
And my mother was totally oblivious but she did work hard.
We  during our work with the Resistance  did not see it openly  feel it openly.
Number two  she couldnt get a job  and she had to be independent because -- she couldnt get a job because the Jews were not allowed to -- to teach  and they could not work in government establishment -- establishments.
You two work together  perform the job  be civil to each other.
They count us out  we had to stand -- whoever didnt look right got shot or got send out  because you couldnt go to work any more.
They would use people to work  as long as they could work   on minimal rations.
And your sister and Izra el had to do work too?

The uncle who came in on Saturday helped us out because I could do...most of the work was really on and on Mr. Beck and both of us could not handle all of it.
I mean you could see the groups of Jews who were under  mostly under the escort of the police going to work and of course they were trying to get food and they were getting food  potatoes and bread and all that.
Was it just -- were these all to help out the general farm work?
I used to work for three -- I really don't know what was their title and I should know but I forget.

The two sisters -- the daughter of one of the sisters  and their parents  my grandparents  were taken to Auschwitz at the same time  and the same place.

Lets say the the lets say the Germans  Poles  from the German part  from the Prussian part were  lets say  a little bit more like Germans  very orderly  lets say the work that they accomplished was more thorough than lets say the group of Poles in the east  under the Russians.
In fact  when we were in these wooden tents doing our last work detail in Poland  at night  you know  we -- there was no light in the tent or anything  we would lay down and we would reminisce and make believe we were in our cozy living rooms at home and the mother of Margaret and Gerta would us th e story of her news and how she had spent time at the English finishing school  so we kept ourselves alive.
It maybe they came and we didnt know because we were at work.
I say look  when we were kids   they told us the life in Russia is so good  he say  you only work and you get everything for nothing.

Well  the Holocaust Education Trust is -- was formed  oh about 10 years ago by -- it started by a rabbi  not Holocaust Education Trust  but he decided -- a local rabbi  Barry Markus  in London  and he took a group of people to Auschwitz for the day and then somehow they got together with a group of other people and they decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust  which is a working people  its not a -- they work there full time  and what they do  they also teach teachers about the Holocaust.
Why did you want to work as a volunteer for the Holocaust Museum?
And did our work  whatever it was  to feed the people  to clothe the people.
And my father started to work as a tailor there for the army  for the Russian army.

Because I came there early and someone asked me if I wanted to work  and I said \ what else would I do\  and I got where I was.
After they liquidate this home and everybody have to go to work  but we have some trouble with the work and we need an carte didentite 54  a card.

The young people  because the Romanian population was in the army and the Jews were not taken  they were put to certain types of work.
And we didnt work ther e. We just were there 12  14 days.
So I just held on  you know  to some friends when we went to work.
Th at's what they did  and then they put us on the trucks.
a good place where to go to work where what to eat  and always look out for the action.
Because I didnt have maids knees so she probably could figure out that I wasnt used to doing this kind of work.
We came there  and there they took us and sent us again to 10 work battalions.
At that time the -- the Jewish police in the ghetto already had a stand  and -- Yeah.
If somebody looked well to them enough to be transported to work  which I thought was work  was in one line.
What was your job when you -- That's what I did.
You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do.
It was demoralizing work no need to think  only to get tired.
The children were selected by  by the welfare organizations in the different cities of Germany  and then uh  don't like to go into the procedures--uh  in a simp le way they got their permits  what they hand out at the English consulates in  in Germany  uh  but we had to see to it that they were transported out of Germany  so  uh  and that was not an easy job because there was no  no  no  no  uh  uh  uh  uh fax uh  there were no fax machines  and there  there was uh uh no dialing system for telephones  and so  so this uh and uh  uh  uh ----------------  under which supervision all this certainly had to be done  was very meticulous  they wanted the exact reco rds  uh to be checked  so all this preparatory work required a lot of preparations and labor.
There is just no two ways about it because those supervisors are standing over you and you have a certain assignment and you have to break up this much during your work day  and that's all there is to it.
>> Bill Benson: When was your father able to begin to resume his work and his life after the war?
So when we after our interviews  and when we started the training program  we felt we  you know  we really had done the right thing and we would we would we would want to do the kind of work that the museum could provide us.

But at that time  I was very lucky  Columbia Unis -- University School of Social Work had never ax -- never had acce pted ex -- very  very few older people.
Then they wanted to send the girls to work in the meat factory.
And I never regretted that I work hard  or so  I -- I didnt know it.
So somehow it didnt work  til we decided that we want to leave.
But I think that I am alive  now  this is not a choice  but he did see to it that a lot of young people from our ghetto  from our area  that they were sent to Germany to work.
To Vienna I couldn't go also Russian a nd without working to be  then I started to work.
And then they concentrated us in Kabe lwerk for a short time  and then -- but -- but the time we s -- were sent back to Plaszow  we did not work in Kabelwerk any more.
But the forester there  sin ce he wanted also to get work out of us and he knew you know hungry people are not as strong  so he got actually through the local Nazi \ Bauern\  or farmer leader  peasant lead er  whatever  extra rations for us of farmers bread and sausages which were actually delicious.
After work  a brother-in-law of mine was there and my brother  Maurice.
Within the ghetto you couldnt move freely -- No  within the ghetto  you could -- Oh  you could  you -- -- but you couldnt go out.
No  there was like a mess hall near where the kitchen facility was  and they were preparing meals for people as they were coming and leaving for work  you know?
I got a job  so I got extra bowl of soup.
And I put in ..instead of sugar  I put in salt in the coffee in the morning  the group went to work  was Pollacks also  they were eating from this kitchen.
They accepted me as an advanced standing student beca use of my experience with social work.
So next day was the day when you went to work  you got instead one potatoes  two potatoes.
One of my uncles was -- he was  you know  was s -- they used to take you to work outside the ghetto  and he was  I would say  dogs.
And school at that particular time taught you and they kept saying that no matter what we do  we must go ahead to do work.
So  with those instructions we took the S-Bahn  the subway  the elevated out to Wannsee and we went to work  raking  cleaning up  whatever they told us to do.
So he got -- he dressed himself up as a woman  with a kerchief  with a -- with a dress and everything and went to work for my mothers place.
And I think I'll work at the Holocaust Museum until they carry me out  because it's just a very  very nice thing to do.
Well  when I took the government job at the Interior Department  I went on the bus every day to work and always loaded down with books because after work I went to my classes at George Washington.
And in those years  it might have been nice if we had had a little extra  but over the years  being an airline pilot  we -- we had a decent income  and it wasnt necessary for me to -- to go to work  so I was a stay home mom.
There were for instance we would send the secret instructions--no  not secret  open instructions that there is su ch and such anniversary in the Nazi movement and today is free from work.
And -- however  this -- the -- the -- the whole ambiance of the place -- I took the courses I loved and by the way  I took -- I ma -- I majored in social work.
Anyway  at this point the man came again for a group of people to be in the square to go for work in Germany  and at this point you see my mother  because she had some connections there  she knew two farmers.
And he was...he was a communist; and I asked him if I could work for him.
So she said  ﬁWhos Uncle Sam?ﬂ I said  ﬁI work for him.ﬂ Okay  that was [indecipherable].
Do you bring work home with yo u or only work at the museum?
We were talking about office work and work in the factory itself.
And again  she didnt work out of the house  but she would take in sewing  so they survived.
And so we -- we work very hard  you know  in addition to goin -- going to school.
And my father had a work permit for England whic h was pretty hard to get but he had done business with England quite a bit and he got that work permit and that was about to expire so he went to the authorities and said listen can I have the  my passport back I need to have my work permit renewed and somebody gave him this passport and my father said we are l eaving so they packed a little suitcase  a little clean underwear and they all took off  my brother my mother and left the house  left everything back and went to the next town  went to the next town  went to the next town.
And were you escorted by policemen to your place of work  or were you just able to ŠŠ No  they took us.
But when I came back from work  and I found out what is happening  I went out to the rail station.
And so the one time that I present to him  he said no what you wrote here on the lab work  its not true.
Now you want them...to send them to work to Russia  because they are enemies of...of um...like of the Russians.
Can you tell us what it was like to go back to Kielce  th at is  where you were in the work camp and then there wa s the massacre?
Besides his volun teer work in this museum's archives  Morris has been a volunteer for the Red Cross Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center.
I mean  i-if you were  thats and you got caught  thats it  cause they were after getting as many people as possible for work to Germany   because they needed labor.
My elder brother  who was ten years older than I was  escaped somehow from the ghetto and would  and went to the province hoping to find some wor k. He was already a married man and he had a boy five or six year s old and he was hoping to find some work so that he could come back to the ghetto and some how feed the family  but that was it.
For three weeks I was doing his work  he never gave me anything.
Many of them perished there and they perished I would say primarily because they were unable to to do the heavy work.
He never  in all the years  he never had an un unemployment check  and he never let me go to work.
You -- what -- what you had to do  you had to work  yes?
And  and the hope was really making us imagine better things  so one day -- it must have been again in March or April  in March  I think  March of '45 -- they put us in trains and they sent us to so-called ﬁFree work.ﬂ Each one was assigned to some deserving German family or on a farm to work and this  Pepi and I we were assigned to two villages not far from each other in the northern part of Germany near Rostock.
We...we were once again...we had  you know  we had the Gestapo breathing down our neck  and ...uh...again we thought  \ Well  we're going to have to...we're going to have to leave.ﬂ And my father was...uh...told by the commander of his work camp that he would have to report somewhere else and possibly be sent to Germany.
H e was working and at one point he was sent for  away  you know  to try to get alcohol rehabilitation and it didn't work.
If I help somebody  I gave him the full work  whatever I have to do it.
Trained in the sense that we learned the language  we knew where we were going  we knew the kinds of jobs we would do  and because of the work we had done in Egypt  we were trained to take care of Yugoslavs who had gone through hell in this war.
And I  myself  was not allowed to work  I had been going to work every day  and worked different places and once I was taken to work on a railroad station with some other girls.

Yeah there was work that we all had to day  give a day in the kitchen about wash dishes or something of that nature so we all always were available if they needed some people but as far as really working  there was no work.
And that-- in that one  the women did not--did not do any work  didn't --because they were afraid the women would be attacked by the inmates  but our men --the men from our hospital went in and cleaned up this place because it had just been liberated too  so we were stationed th ere for some time while --while the men in our unit cleaned it up  took care of --set up the hospital  took care of the sick  and the women were--we were separated  I think  just by a fence  just by a fence  'cause I remember a tall fence.
So they want to use the Jewish people like a labor this work factory as they put a lot of people over there.
I had some kind of idea about technical work and so on.
So  I was permitted to stay in th e camp  but not go out to work.
It's cowardly  but it  that's the only way I can work it.
Life was not easy to do this type of physical work but I you know youre young.
>> Henry Kahn: Well  we lived in a small town  which in the meantime became a suburb of Stuttgart  but at the time it was a town  an independent town  and my father had to travel every morning by train to get to work.
That refusal prompted then  the transfer to a camp  to a work camp.
Did -- Did you want to stay there  since that was home?
They used to stay in by the gate  there was a gate all around  you know  where the people had to go to work  and where they had to come back.
But they the the work that that they did was they got a contract with a soft drink distributor  and they would truck the soft drinks.

Th en I received a fu ll copy of the  of Hebert's dissen ting opinion and that indicated that some of our work had struck fertile ground  but it was a two to one opinion and both Shake and Morris were very provincial people.

But then we figured we have to establish a new life when we came over here.
They had to go uh...in uh to...to the labor...labor camps  most of the youngster.

And that very creditable work has been appreciated by several of the top prosecutors  including Louise Arbour  A-r-b-o-u-r  and a conference was held at the Washington College of Law School -- the Wa-Washington College of Law  and several of these representatives  the very top ones  from the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague  came and participated in that trial  which got fairly good publicity.
And I had my -- I went to a bakery to work.
They were sent to Auschwitz  and the day that they arrived  they were all gassed  all murdered.
They said  well they all work for the battalion headquarters  we inherited them from the battalion of the 80th division that we relieved.
I work for wes oh  Western Costume  I says oh he says all of my pictures are made in Western Costume  because they are union.
They -- and they  as I say -- and many of those Poles included people who had come voluntarily to Germany to work for the Germans in Germany.
And then I found out...at this time I was in a concentration camp.
So the landlady just added another  you know  cot; and  and I lived with those friends and I started to work in a suit factory.
And where did you work  or how did you work  after the war?
03:18:05 They need some people that would work  ye s. They got rid of  you know  the natives here  so they needed  until  in 1944 they figure out  it's final  they're going to liquidate the ghetto  and the war changed their whole picture.
Myself  I was living there by my grandfather up to '33 and in 1933 when I finished something like junior high school here in the States  I went to work to the Battah Company in Bohemia.
I only took the courses I needed for my work. [
One of the 20 was an engineer who happened to work in the same office with my Aunt Bella.
He got a job as a ga -- accountant  and he worked for 400 rubles  which is okay  but since my mother still didnt work  it was not enough  and we -- at the end e -- I mean  we were starving  actually.
And as far as Im concerned  I always say when they as k me how can you work there  I said  how can I not?
My father was very amb he was a he was a very hard work er  and very conscien tious about what he did.
They used to get so many grams and so many uh uh quarts of milk  or so much butter  you know  that money was no no...you could buy but when you work in a in a in a cooperative  you get...you get food.
Again  there were no Germans in the barrack s  and the gendarmes were out at -- outside at the gate  and this was happening in the cellar after work.
He did not go to work  but my mother we nt to work and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone.
Yeah  but I didnt But s so you didnt even think of whet her you could work  even with the minimal amount of knowledge that you had as a two years doctors medical student?
They were in business with a lot of the Jewish people and they let those people also go.
Forced labor meant you had to go and work where the Germans want you to work .
I [indecipherable] Did -- Did you discuss with other Jewish people how they felt about that  at that time?
So grandma took over with the little girl so she could go to the factory and work.
>> Susan Snyder: The Nazis appointed people to do the work.
The women worked eight hour shifts  so sometimes we would pass each other coming into camp and other and I I wasn't sure whether...I didn't know whether they had her hair shaven or not because they were all wearing scarves over over their heads because the work  it was so...the girls who did not  did have their head shaven  they would put a piece of hair just in front of it to show they had some hair  and I wasn't sure whether my friend at that time had had her hair shaven or not.
We -- we girls would work harder to make up for her part of the work and we really dug these drenches which be came very difficult in the winter because we first had to loosen the ice and snow with pick axes before we even get -- could get at the earth.
Di dn't go to school  didn't have the time because I had to support  ha d to work.
That you mentioned that where you come from and your escape from the Nazis has been a very important part of the work that you have subsequently done .
And the father was going out with the eldest son which was like six years maybe old to find some work to earn some money.
And I asked him  why are they put in Jewesses in the work to do to -- could use some pasokas because that was certainly not very important  and especially -- certainly they -- it was now pr-profiteering motivation [indecipherable] you know.
For me the work was unbelievably heavy  I couldnt do it.
Sh-She shou ld go because he -- he did a lot of work and he didnt really have any children.
Is it less easy to push things away a little bit  with work  or whatever?
In other words  they should not have to go out everyday from the ghetto to uh--to uh work.
My brother sent me the standard work in Holland  about the destruction of the Dutch Jewry  a two volume book  and it stood on the shelf.
So  ar we we always used the farmers  the peasants and the farmers to work for us.
I mean  the army immediately began looking I mean  as soon as they hit Germany   there was a special detachment of the army which started looking for any scientist who had anything to do atomic work.
That was one of the jobs too  that they had to -- to -- to work on.
So I went with him to Poland  to the occupied section of Germany  what became Poland eventually.
You know  it wasn't actually work  but on top of it just to make people work.
You know  and where do you find  the resistance never  never offered any  you know  the false permit for children to go to work.
And every time when the Jewish community  the community when the German make and theyre always -- they ask for money and they ask the peoples to work and they send the peoples  you know  to the different camps to break the stones to make highways  and all kind of things.
He say the Germans say we will work  we work and we will cooperate  for working.
They continued their improvement during th e three months that I was at work in Germany and they continued their improvement even afte rwards under the civilian advisors to General Eisenhower.
The Germans were some very -- we were go -- go out from our yi -- you know  went to work or what  and were -- we were still working.
Warren Marcus: Henry  how long were you then in the camp doing this work?
Those who were the first to go to the woods  they should go and work in the place where they repair the Ge rman uniforms  see  and then they used to adjust to .
I contracted the typhoid...uh...at the very beginning and...uh...I was lucky that I had a friend of mine who...uh...when he came back from work  he looked after me and he brought some water.
B ecause I read a magazine that the Swedish peace organization will pay for any young people  anywhere in the world to come to outside of Stockholm to a farmer that will give you a job for six weeks and give you and pay you for the work.
38 This was mainly geared to help refugees -- people who had lived in the area and hidden out  and could not do any kind of work during that period and really were penniless  to  to put them on their feet again.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 16 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: time and they took those clothes along to the work places out of the ghetto and they exchanged it--the Lithuanian people use to come with butter and uh margarine and potatoes and sometimes even some meat and they exchanged it.
No  at that time women were minding their own houses  and they have maids to the do the work  and they were very happy that way.
This is the end of Tape 1  Side B. End of Tape 1.
Mostly there was ammunition factories they put in there  and they work with ammunition like bullets  they make bulle ts for guns  o-or a-all kind of things like that for the war  war material.
They were catching people to  to go to work and  and confiscating merchandise from the store.
We did work out an agreemen t with the Swiss in which th ey would make a payment on account of looted gold to the International  the Tripartite Gold Comm ission.
So while I do want it  I somehow am not doing the work for it.
And one evening  this must have been in late November  it was dark already and we are coming back from work and at the gates we are counted and the SS is relieved and the gate is being opened and the SS around are watching that everybody goes in and ahead of us is standing another work detail and they are being frisked one by one by one  by a row of maybe four or five SS men.
But after that didnt work out  did you try other things?
So he used to come only once a week  and apparently didnt work.
This even went on later when we were in the concentration camp.
But when he left  he locked all his - I had no access to the papers anymore  but the list were prepared in advance  so the lists that I was giving out before they went to work.
And then with this Mr. Stanick in Bernau  for whose father I worked during the war  when I couldnt work for my old boss  who was Jewish.
What we did there was when we arrived there  he lined us up for work.
I was surprised at the kind of work they did  but got used to the fact that any work here in the States was okay.
You must give this  you make -- you work  and you produce five sacks of rice  well  one has to go to the government  and they came  and th -- to the farm  and looked  a nd -- and checked  and counterchecked  and if a farmer had not pr -- given everything  a nd they found something  it was the prison.
He couldnt work any more and then he went  the British opened the Kitchener camp for young Jews who had to get out.
Maybe they're going to put them in the Lodz ghetto  he will work a electrician  he will have a trade.

We were locked in  in the -- in the barracks and we didn't know why  because usually they would come every morning and they would t-take us out  even though the factories were already bombed and they didn't have any work for us  but they would take us either to dig ditches  or to clear rubble  take from one place big snowstorm  another place  only that  you know  that we should be doing something which is -- which is very hard wh -- especially when you are in such weakened conditions.
No  they wanted to talk and I -- Im -- I was talking about the difference between work  factory work and -- and homewor -- and other work  as a -- and yes  I liked it and so I liked it  too.
No  I dont go to work on that day now  its a day of celebration and I sit home and I read American history or Bill of Rights  whatever -- whatever I can.
He was to take this group to his place of work and spare us Auschwitz.
W ell actually I tried to raise them you know but when I was a professor at the University of Connecticut I met   there was a synagogue there and I would go there with them but somehow it didnt work out.
And actually some women even ended up in Germany in work ca -- in wor -- as workers.
Well  after we got out of the ghetto -- How did you get out?
We live here most of the time now  because I work here  I work in New York.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 7 They tried to hel p the family's business by taking their cattle to market for them and providing them with -- but that didn't work  of course  because if they had to close down in 1938  that was the end.
And he said to me do your work and no worry everything will be ok.
Maybe youll get sent you to work  I will take care on your childrens and we will be a family.
All I remember there were work gangs in the camp  outside the camp.
But seems like men  who were then put to work  were easier to trace  whereas women and children were shot before they were even put to work or anything like that  so so what we did  we would just write out the names and professions and where they were born and all that  and you think possible that could facilitate the finding.
But there was some places where -- where you -- they and -- there was a -- a Leaman -- a Leaman commando  which they were in charge of the communication line and telegram and te-telegraph  telegram poles and they were rough people there  where -- you know  nobody wanted to go and work there  because they beat -- you went there and you know  they told you what to do and decided they were unsatisfied  they -- you know  they were beating you up and kicking you for no other reason.
When we want to move to I alr eady told you  I wanted to move when we are  still can work and do something.
And I Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 119was there and I really stopped going to school because he had so much work  so I s interrupted my studies.
But when I was in the Warsaw ghetto it was still the ghetto.
But it's worthwhile talking about it because as you come back from work they frisked you bodily to make sure you are not smuggling in ammunition or food.
In 1930...uh...in 1926  I entered Franklin and Marshall College  graduated in 1930  was admitted to the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work  which is no longer in existence.
I worked the fields a migrant laborer  and it was hard work  it was beautiful work  but I couldn't keep up  but somehow that rapport clicked  I never spoke to the migrant Mexican workers about my experien ces  but the rapport developed and they would finish their rows and come down mine.
A Jewish organi zation in Bratislava found out that we were arrested by the Czechoslovakian police  they work ed very hard and they got us out and they transferred us to Bratislava into that hotel wh ere we were going to leave Czechoslovakia.
I went every day to the hospital after work  and they showed me through a window because they felt it was a communicable disease.
These three categories of people were sent by order of Rumcof-ski as the fi rst transport to go to work.
When you hear the work Auschwitz in todays world  what do you immediately think of?
And he had about 10  12 pages; and he keeps on asking me  \ Are you working...you work in the factory?\
They put them in gunnysacks  they brought them back to the United States to the Treasury  and on the basis of those and then there was intensive work on the documents  because some related to war crimes  some didn't.
However  after she passed away  I decided I would work in the Holocaust Museum  which I did.
You certainly didn't learn it in the school of social work when the people were social 24 workers.
04:06:51 Yes  I was with the family Rouba and he was going everyday to the city because he was doing some work as an architect  you know  very little  but he tried to get  you know  to make some  earn some money  and he brought a ll the news.
So I wanted -- my first thought was going back to Poland.
He got...they got me out because uh they need me for work so bad and that he did anything possible.
>> Morris Rosen: Well  what happened  we didn't go to work.
But my parents started to work very hard towards getting us out.
A camp -- a camp that they put you to work.
And it was an saying  if you are married  and you have a sent to Germany   to work there  for the sor from there  then you get you could back you came back in half a year home  to see your family.
He started laughing and was still laughing when I left  this was my preparation for social work  but I made it.
There was one thing  and the second thing was that he -- yeah  that he spoke French also fluently  and work with the French police in the pa st.
Which indicates the difficulty of ha ving  of identifying heirless assets even in a situation wher e you have the entire forces of the government trying to work with you.
And I was focused on my work and being single and living in Philadelphi a and having a good time when I wasnt working.
But you still had to decide when you get in the morning a piece of bread  should I eat it all now or maybe save some for later?
They both have a farm  large  by...near Tarnow and uh for generations they have a house and a farm and people work on the...on on the farm for them.
Anyhow  I translated Sierakowiaks diary  and Poznanskis work  which those two books comprise the biggest part of the Polish translation and thats my work  plus I -- you must have heard the name Rumkowski?
So I...we worked in different uh Kommandos  different work places... What kind of work place were you assigned to?
The men used to go to work  and the smaller children couldn't work  were left in the camp.
But he also could he gave out also work in the city  in our city.
I tried with my twin brother  to go up in the mount mountains  and work it out  when the rest of the world would have said the war is ended.
With the... Seamstress  tell me about what her work was  what she did  what did they... She came into the camp with her husband  he was a good tailor  and she was an excellent seamstress  and the Nazis didn't wear underwear just from plain mate rial  everything had to be made from silk  the shirts  the underwear  so she was excellent.
You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do.
And that's all  they didn't do any-anything to me  and uh  I was  I joined back my father  and we went back to uh  to work in the uh  in the concentration camp  in the mines that we re there.
There are some attempts at revisions sometimes to say it was a work camp.
I did all kinds of work to get some more food.
And my father was  as head of  as head of the family we joined his work outfit.
It also sounds good on the level that I interviewed a doctor for a story I was working on recently and he said  ﬁPeople dont realize how prone physicians are to problems; drug problems  stress  enormous  enormous stress.ﬂ So it sounds like perhaps this gives them some tools to work on their problems too.
How do you feel about having the Holocaust  a holocaust museum in Washington   DC?
Did they approach you  or did you want to work for them?
Gosh  I mean  it was 24 hours work  Interview with George Dynin October 21  2015 224 something endless  you know  its just unbelievable.
So he said  Esia  so thats how I got to work for them  about seven months.
They want so and so many of them they should work for them.
Hard work  a lot of dust  and I was punished  you know  that was punishment.
You are in Auschwitz  that's a work camp and if you work you will live.
End of Tape Seven 134Beginning Tape Eight You were explaining that you were susp icious if you worked in the field and got money  and you were suspicious if you didnt work.
Did they come to the town and gather people together and send them to work  to camps?
I want to also mention that besides bei ng hungry and work hard  we also had a lack of vitami ns.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 >> Bill Benson: Does a good job of explaining that.
I married him already  and I became pregnant and the Jewish organization  the underground organization from Is rael started to work to bring out as many Jews from Poland as they could.
Yes  either to work on fa rms  or in factories  or wherever.
And here I heard that they need 2 thousand young men to work in an ammunition factory.
I had to join them every morning and go to work with them.
And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wa sn't just that but uh uh the decision I had to make whether I wa s a child staying with the women or men.
And I went to work as a waiter  but I didn't know the language.
That morning when I came to my commander to go to work -- it was exactly November 5  1942  when I went with my group to go out to work -- we saw outside of the ghetto trucks  trucks covered with canvas  we were told we cannot go to work.
What was an average day... An average day was from morning till late in the evening because it was a lot of work on the farm  so... What kind of work did you do?
So the girl s smuggled out ﬂafter work and they gave it to the men to through the wires you know.
During my imprisonment in Gleiwitz  I had electric car where I was transporting those scales and the women would work on at service those machines  Jewish women prisoners  and I had...I I was the only one from the from the few men...I could talk to Jewish girls which was a...and I would befriend my wife.
By the following year  Dan and Dora came to Washington  DC and Dan embarked on a career as a researcher in the medicinal chemistry at the Walter Reed Army Research Institute with his work culminating in his expertise in the development of medicines against malaria.
So  I would say that after this encounter we kind of began to realize that something is happening  that inasmuch as living in the ghetto was so different from the normal life th at we led before  and being forced to work in factories was also someth ing that we have never planned on doing  especially forced labor.
Different distances  whatever they were able to do by way of work  and sometimes the very small children were put to work on doing things -- curling wires and doing and things where a little hand was better than a big one.
And I was a little bit more home in the barracks because I couldn't work so hard with my hand and they knew about it the Germans.
Very few  maybe I was even actual the only one who did go to work in a bi cycle repair shop.
Always in the head  always special operations [indecipherable] What kind of work did you do?
Anyway  she said  \ Come with me to work as uh...in a confection factory.
I had to work for two years to pay for dental work.
He he he was very  very sick  I couldnt work at all.
So I went down  opened the gate; and in that moment two of my friends with whom I used to work together in Kanada passed by.
Now  this friend of mine who was quite a high official in the government who was in the ministry of finance in Prague  and he's the one who insisted that I go to work for the annual meeting for the International Monetary Fund.
I can give you and I said you can't take money for that work  and he said if you can't take money then he's not serious because you have to stay in 8 hotels and eat in restaurants all the time  and he convinced me that was necessary.
I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes for all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own because my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that stuff.
What happened in the camp uh I started working after maybe eight months of working outdoors  sweeping streets and working on construction  I was assigned to work inside the factory and I was marched to that large building and led in together with all the other people inside the building and was walking through the factory building to my assigned place of work (cough) and I noticed that in front of me there was a man in a white coat walking and something fell out of his pocket and instinctively I ran after him  picked up that envelope it was  and chased him and gave him that envelope  and he kind of looked of me and was pleased.
And we had rehearsals almost every night in ad dition to my regular work.
Then were people who were sick  people who couldn't work  so was A  B  C classification.
And I remember one time that was in the -- late in the fall of '41  we were coming from work  because my job for most of the time through that cousin that I have mentioned that was a  a makher in the ghetto with the other famil y. Unfortunately  I don't remember the name of the other family  and they didn't survive.
What was your what were your parents doing  your father and your mother?
If we going to work for them  you know  they wont kill us right away.
After that  when he left  I went to work for the canal.
You dont take people to work in the east in that condition.
You had to move into the ghetto  and how long were you in the ghetto?
And my fa ther k-k-keep him  you know  to -- to work for him  and Berestitsky a pproached my father and said  ﬁHeger  I know that you are building and building those hiding places  but you ha -- you -- you will not succeed.
But we -- we got along fine  and then they started -- and then they called up my father to -- this wasnt an army  it was a -- like a work force.
They work until they can work until until its su sundown and then they have no electricity  so how how why But it wasnt this experience wasnt sufficient to get you turned off from Interview with Annette Fein November 7  2008 37 No  no.
So  as I said  he had his tools  and he was able to work  and they were happy to have him.
And kept us busy  it was very interesting work  very challenging work  tiring at times.
I don't remember wh at my mother or father were doing  but I know they were also doing physical work.
We were sure we're going to work for the Germans  maybe 13 to Germany  maybe by summertime or whatever you know.
And he promised us if we will behave  we will do good work in the mine  he will look into it that we are not USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 76mistreated  and we will be getting proper food.
I -- I can t explain what it was  it was an inability to work with what Id seen.
We got the job at the hospital  OK  we did work there  kitchen stuff.
He clearly was very  very bright  the work he did and then even what he learned and studied when he was in prison.
In those days  if you had a very smart person in the family  you had to defer to that person because you couldnt disturb the genius at work.
When schools closed  I went to work for him as a machinist apprentice and that lasted in the ghetto as well.
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION (IN DUTCH) (Showing photographs) [(3)] This is the direct or with her sub who wasn't allowed to work there anymore after 1941 because she was not Jewish. [(
But when they analyzed it  it's did come out that we need to work many  many days  nights to dispose of this very dangerous dispose of the soil.
We did a lot of work against -- we had a ca -- a law -- we had a law  you know  the ho-homosexuals and the -- discrimination agai nst homosexuals and lesbians  which when th-the -- the main religious right ga -- or ganized the -- a what do you call it?
You know  after 14 -hour work  couple of hours of sharpening weapons  took us aside to give us lessons in history and French and alg ebra.
I work  but I felt somewhat -- something small  felt like Im confined  you know?
And what did you do then or where did you go to high school?
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: The question is  was there -- within the concentration camps that you were in  was there a leadership  a core of Jews that came together to work as a resistance?
Our work was to -- well  this was the place where all the clothing and belongings that came out of the many  many trains -- >> Bill Benson: That was dumped on the platform  you told us.

KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 21 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: from the ghetto.
Strangely enough  one of the best forgers was an old monk in Father Bruno's abbey    very  very adorable old father who would never have done a thing like that in his life if he hadn't been persuaded by Father Bruno that he was doing humanitarian work.
So we none of us worked  we all refused to work.
So we went there and we tried to find work  it was very hard to.
And different people came to work with us  and so on  so on.
So it was felt that its enough if you have -- if I t-take care of the child and my husband and the household  that I couldnt possibly go to work.
I had to keep in line  just do my --my work and -- and try to be modest about it  and - not that I was necessarily that skilled  but I mean  I -- I learne d. You know  I -- I applied myself to it  in fact  probably more than maybe the othe r kid because I wanted to -- to do a good job  you know  so they would keep me instead of kick ing me out and saying go back to Zaremba  you know  we dont want you.
I went to Brest-Litovsk  and there was...uh...military com pound  and they accepted us for work for...for digging ditches.
I call myself lucky that I was young enough and strong enough to do all the work which I had to do.
I wanted to make more money by going fast  and I was told not to work so fast  because the others didnt want to work so fast.
So I went to work as -- I walk in  th-thats all  you got to work.
Then we had nothing to do; we were free in the camp.
Soon after arrival in the U.S. he was hired by the U.S. Post Office Department to work on the design of mail sorters and conveyors.
And Jews were caught in the street like uh dogs  and taken to work uh in doing all kinds of things.
My mother was still in bed  was getting ready to go to work.
Interview with Adam Szymel January 25  2015 76 When my sister turned 16  I believe anybody over the age of 16 had to work.
It just had the meaning of the work was to destroy us  to make us tired  to make us exhausted because in the beginning like  for example  every morning we had to be waken up at 4 o'clock.
Stutzpunkt was the work assignment where you went and naturalized  denatured the mass graves.
So  therefore I tried to do my best only to stay to work for this baker instead to go there  to Germany.
I continued to work with the...with the embassy...with the Consulate  but my focus was really upon helping these people.
Or they brought them in not a crematorium made to burn but they were killing them there because we were finding spoons on the floor  bones  heads  we saw heads with hair to work.
If a doctor was hoping that he could go somewhere and work as a doctor  but saw that it was useless  hed go anywhere because he knew once he got to that new country  he could take exams again and work in his profession.
Uh  used to have music in the morning  when ---------I go out to work  and there were not a day that people didn't come back uh dead.
The next thing she decided that she would like to work for something like a German military camp.
I lost my job not because the queen didn't want me or didn't like me anymore but Jewish people were not allowed to work for non -Jewish people .
He said  well  cause you have to work at so mething.
This is how it was done  and it was a fully automated factory  and what that meant is that they only needed to work us  to work the people who worked in that first dept which was called riefenlage  I don't know what that means  in  in English  uh  enlage must be department and rief must have been the  the  the name of that first place  and as long as they rushed us  the whole factory was working  so the SS men were forever st anding over our heads making us work  so  because if we worked fast  they did.
you reported every time -- every morning to the same group of work detail.
While I was in this barrack  they took out people for work  the kapos.
I don't want to go to work no more brigade  we'd be package -- a package house.
And who is this  explained him over the face and the men from the also German a little higher from him came out  and there was a fight and beat up this Jew  he work for me.
Then the private room also  top administrative inmate  like Katya  who was  became the report and another room which I  whic h was assigned to me where I 41 could work and was called the dr awing office.
So they give him a pass...special permission  so Isaac Kowalski can work in their printing.

Okay  when you were deported to th e ghetto  okay  you said something about your brother being taken away for work.
At the same time  I ha d a special project set up in Frankfurt with a Paul De ncker  who was the chief bookke eper of I. G. Farben  and I was pumping him over a nu mber of days for info rmation about th e work activity of each of 22 Teleconferences.
It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the barracks.
So they got very affectionate with us  and we became friends with the people in -- in the town  and my dad and my brother started to work in the fields  to make  you know  some money  or even for trading for food.
And if you were a tailor  or if you were a sheet metal worker  or a mechanic  they put you to work.
This is tape number two  side A. So  you had a -- a nice support system of - of friends here in the city  and your husband had work  and you were bringing up children.
We understood by then that the train was being shipped out to Stutth of  which was a detention camp where Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans.
Even now  with all the comfort that you have  you have a lot of comfort like be fore  used to work without air condition and it was hotter than here.
But I would work  also  in the store  as well as other people.
Were you still in a work camp or had you come into Budapest by that point?
Well  uh as I say  tightening the screws was done on my family in a very dramatic way in that uh they first pulled my dad's work permit so that my dad  who was very much in the public eye uh giving lectures at public museums  going to auctions and so forth  couldn't openly do that anymore.
I work in a lumber yard -- you want me to go on?
I could have been  more or less I knew -- know a lot of people that ended up in a German DP camp  but not in a DP camp in Germany.
And they say  when I first came to America I had one vis it with them  asking for work  and they said  what I want to do?
that is the place where they recruited me to work on new designs on television tuners and that is not only very high frequency William Loew 34 tuners but also the ultra high frequency tuners.
They gave them a name which I don't recall -- which co-- collaborated with the Germans that  that   that did the dirty work.
As soon we registered to work  they made a old ghetto and a new ghetto.
He sa ys  if you want to come and work for me in Tokyo  youre welcome  Ill send you a visa.
Saturday Jewish people dont touch money  so we hire Catholic pe ople to play the music  to clean the place  because we cannot work  because we cannot sing  its against the law of the Jewish Torah.
About a mont h later  on January 3  as we were lining up to go to work  a group of Gestapo agents came over in their black coats and took my father out of line.
In Maryland you could work as a physician in a hospital without having to take all the tests.
And he stopped him  he said  ﬁHerr Kommandant  I woul d like to work in my profession.ﬂ And he said  ﬁWhats your prof ession?ﬂ He said  ﬁIm a cook.ﬂ He said  ﬁDid you tell it when you came into this camp?ﬂ He said  ﬁYes.ﬂ So next Sunday on the roll call  they pull him out and put him into the SS kitchen.
They said we have much work  better place to work  or words to that effect.
And according -- when I showed that letter to the polic e in Piccadilly  those foreign police  I got some per-permission to work -- a working permission.
And in reality it was very nice  even though it was a lot of work  but then we had help  I mean we had a cleaning woman and my mother had hired  by then my brother was  you know  maybe four or five or something  she had hired sort of a nanny  not really a nanny  but she would come every afternoon and pick him up from kindergarten and  you know  come home and feed him a snack and she would stay til dinnertime  she wouldn't stay til after  but she would stay until dinnertime.
I don't recall the name of the farmer that my sister was going to  but that was on the edge of town  and he -- the plans were that he would pick her up after work one evening  and that one morning when we all got up  we ate 21 our meager breakfast  and my sister took her little bundle with her  the most important things  clothing that she still had.
I helped my father as a plumber  and then I became a jeweler  because they build a sh-shop for jewelers  and th-the guy [indecipherable] of the jewelers wanted me to work for him  so I started working for him  I became a jeweler.
By five o'clock in the afternoon  the street to enter Kovno ghetto was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades  lined up five in a row to march in to the ghetto after a day's work.
Then they decided they 're going to take us to Auschwitz.
Was some big building  I dont know  was was to work some something there  and I I walked aw ay a little bit from from the building  I was all by myself  standing by a tree.
A dollar  a dollar and eight.ﬂ And you have to do the work that they should come back  you know  to clean the windshields and everything.
He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all and that was in his favor because every time he used to go to work  he used to just leave the place and go to Lithuanians  whom he knew  and traded some silver or whatever my mother gave him.
And I myself  when I used to work in sadiva I think we have to change the tapes.
And nobody wanted to work  because everything was already like black market.
When we started to work in that camp  it was not ready  the camp  yet.
But one day as we were coming from work we heard cries from the ghetto.
What kind of things were available  what were you eating  how did that all work?
ﬁCan you work for us while you walk from The Hague to Amster-Amsterdam ?
And it was sort of -- What kind of work did you do there?
Because there was a huge wall around  and you know how much work it has to do to paint that  too.
And the Gestapo came to every home and they had -- they knew where the Jews lived and arrested many.
So  there we will work  we will do what happened in Poland  so that is and maybe we can survive the war  maybe.
Interview with Susi Frank Annes October 4  2015 92 He was an attorney  went to Washington   wanted to work for the government.
We all -- we had a -- we went to work in a hospital -- bib -- in Wales  I think it was.
And I would work with my father  he was a pai -- he painted well  he drew well  and he showed me how  and all that.
And in the evening  when I was...after after work  and work and worked there probably two hours.
It was usually very difficult to make it  you know  work.
Oh  the mothers  the wretched mothers who returned from work and didn't find their children!
And the one that were capable to work  they sent to work.
This woman had a garden outside the city  the old mu the mother of the young woman  and I had to and this one day I forgot all about my birthday  and I sh-she always gives me work  extra work and I said please hurry up  because Ill be late for the Russian kitchen  I have to get the food out.
But Norm Feldman   Cohen   Bernard Vogel   he was a young fella  very docile  and he he gave up very easy  and they forced him to work in the tunnels.
But it didnt work out with some of them  and at one point Mr. Funkin was offered   if he [indecipherable] to say yes  so he will get the representation of the one company  which was named the Hodakoof.
So  of course  every...even though I was young; but I had to go to work in order to get my ration.
Well  the fellow workers were very upset with me  you shouldnt work so fast  because the new norm will be much higher.
I didn't know what the work consisted of  but anyway it was something to look into.
And they used to just take them quote unquote to work  but we no  never saw them again.
And then we thought we were going to go back into the ghetto.
And the two girls that worked in the same division  the same horrible place  had come back after our work and that's when I went to that place where the sick people were.
So our -- our -- our chef -- the head  took out his pe -- a lot of people  German and officers who had the people working for them came and took their people out of work.
And he and other crew refurbished and rebuilt it from another one; from two of this year or maybe more of them  wound up to make the motor work and everything else.
They -- they need me  they need work to be done  somewhere.
So the work that had to be done that could not be done by the Russian male population was done by a force that was organized by the Hungarians  labor force of Jews.
It was like pe it was very hard to find any work and to an -and to survive.
But you know  there were transports to -- to -- To Auschwitz? --
But the Polish people  instead to work the soldiers they maybe will work in the garden everything.
His driving thing was you had to learn how to work to survive when freedom came.
But in America again  in the beginning  we did need to work Saturday or not Saturday and we would never keep it up Jewish spirit  the way I remember in Poland before the war  so the conditions changed  or th e behavior changed.
And she came back  but she couldn't surv ive; her body didn't work.
We crossed several remarkably interesting roads  because they were autobahns that had built  you know  by the Reich in and the Germans in the 1930s as as big work projects.
Which was bad because they got stone quarrel main work there.
He had an employee who came to work there in a Nazi uniform.
No cultural activities  no political activities  you just try to live from day to day and work  and if you have a chance to have some fun  get married because you were safer.
I was 18 at the time  so I did..I did learn it  and...uh...immediately it was... really I had to go to work to...to support the family.
There -- there is not enough of -- there are not enough of people for certain jobs available  because everybodys -- the male are on the front  and the women in that - to work in factories  so do other things  the civilians.
And in Ravensbruck {p h} {64}  we were not th ere  my older sister  they wanted to take us to carry  you know   this {65} I don't know  I wasn't there  but my older sister said she would work for my mother so let her go.
I do volunteer work for the arboretum in season  every week  and so... one day  and these are the people  usually  that I am the closest to  because we have a common interest  gardening.
Because hed have found work  and so they were able to to work.
He tried he did not play the [indecipherable] because he thought that it wouldnt work anyway.
Interview with David Halivni June 13  2014 28 and a half. [
In the beginning we went to work in the morning  came back in the evening.
We were working very hard in the farm  work which we were not used to in picking vegetables and planting.
So my sister was beaten very badly and she couldn't go to work the following day a nd so hid her under the bunks.
And that was part -- ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 >> Bill Benson: Right.
His volunteer work at the museum has included working for Visitor Services as well as translating \ Deportation Lists\  from Belgium  Luxembourg and from Marseille.
It wasnt easy after a days work  get to college  get your courses  get homework  papers and -- but I did it.
I could smell like Sunday we didn't work  you know or at night you go out  you saw the flames.
And thats not altogether prope r  but again  it abso lutely necessary at times  you you you cant get if you ca nt get the work done  you cant get on the air  and if you a deadline is a deadline and so forth.
She stayed there -- I would check on her every morning when I come in from work  whenever I got off I would always go in to check on her  see how sh e is.
I then ended up at Northeastern University at night  there was a Springfield division of Northeastern University -- it was a high school equivalency certificate and I went to Northeastern for six years -- always continuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales person.
Because one  the youn gest girl  Anna  she had something with her back  some pain  I know  she was taken to the x -ray and some medication  Barbara Farkas 24 December 9  1995 now she didn't work.
Um  and then we had to work  um  and uh  in a nearby community called Badovitz  they had the shops there  where they were sewing uniforms for  I guess for the army  and we were marched  my  my mother and I and all  all went.
SL: Right side of the heart took off ma -- took over the work from my left heart  because my left one was completely closed.
Birkenau was part of Auschwitz complex but th ere was  people didnt work over there.
And I used to use as a speaker a lady who was assigned to the Embassy from here  I think she was from Tel Aviv or Jeruselum; I think she was from Tel Aviv  but she was a lawyer and assigned to do some legal work here for a year or two  and she used to come out and talk to my class at Rockwell at the Montgomery college foreign affairs seminar that I had.
Did you find in the DP camps where you were visiting that this was not an easy time?
It was cars that they used for pigs and  you know  pasture work.
And he said it's because I'm laying bricks and it's hard work and it hurts my hands.
That particular hiding place did not work out  because the -- the lady was so in -- exceedingly anxious that her sons  who knew about that we were hiding there  told us that we needed to leave.
If you are alive  please write to me  I am here in Rakichenka  and I am here working till -- I am supposed to work till the end of 19 -- till 1940.
And the German was bribed by somebody who went out for work that I would be on his workmanship today.
It is an automatic machine  machine doesn't work for you  you got to work for the machine.
But that didnt work out  they couldnt make enough money on the store so they closed that.
So so we were jumping through them  and and going to to the fi eld to work  or or s or something.
And the next day they went to work  they brought us back.
And she work ed as an office manager for a man who is American who had this business in scrap plastics  so he'd buy plastics from factories and he would sell them all over Europe and I guess they would recycle them essentially.
He had her every day by work and if the Germans came in  myself and Dr. Bussow...I was working  also cutting.
When Id come home from work  she would jump up and down in her crib.
I used to take off Friday after work  from Cleveland  by car  drive all night -- thats 500 miles -- drive all night  come here Saturday morning  have a couple of hours of sleep  spend Saturday and Sunday  leave Sunday  late in the afternoon and go report Monday morning to work.
And I would regale them with stories about subway trains that arrive every five minutes and 2 000 people shove their way in  and go to work.
So I had a teacher that come to my home to teach me Hebrew  you know.
Bars  slight ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 clothing  and work.
And one day a girlfriend of Irenes  whom I also kno -- knew from Salzheim said  ﬁBella  I work for my uncle.
They said  you have to walk about five  six kilometer s to your new destination.
I would say we were there -- it was very early morning  so we were there for maybe a couple of hours.
And and we started going to work  and sometimes playing  you know  and and those little boys  the they they were mischievous  you know  so so they th ey started killing turtles.
The Jewish community just send us to Kansas City  and -- and my mother said  you know  Kansas City  I think that one guy that work for us on our brick factory  he -- he got married and he went to Kansas City.
The document saved -- definitely saved our lives by being in the right group with the right -- the beatings during the  during the work  while we were working  were rather rare.
And  like  they are going to the gas chambers  you know.
There was actually three of them that I would work for.
One or two days a week I would get release from the police force and work with them.
I would say I spent more than 50 percent time in ghetto than in outside  because it was safer for me in ghetto than being round up in -- in the town for labor work in Germany.
They didnt kn ow it to operate it so he had a Red Cross on part of his work clothe s band  on part of his white band  he was permitted to go during the day so the Germans could have access to the pharmacy  but in the evening he had to come back to the ghetto.
I feel as long as I possibly can I would love to go on with this important work whether it's in Israel  whether it's in this country  whether it's in Latvia or in the Soviet Union.
But there were times where the Germans  lets say  separated certain parts of the street  or streetcars that were in  in order to kidnap the people for work in the Reich.
So we can manage  you know  to not to work so hard.
They actually picked me up and dragged me to to to work next day  and when I came in  my my German master saw me and since I had a cushy job he let me there stay a few days  but that was a bad experience because I couldn't walk  I couldn't bend down for a long time.
I had friends come over while I went to work to stay in the house with my kids.
I come down  you know what  you do th e work and you have so afraid.
We don't have no right to work  no have to right to make business  and every three months we have to go to the police.
The -- the leader of our -- or the organizer of our underground network at Ose  George Garell  in 1947 published a book on the -- the work of Ose under the German occupation of France  from 1940-44.
So what they do is they would work on it and make like a   work and work until .
Those that were stopped from one work and sent to another could exchange ideas or whatever gossip was going around.
I  after coming to Lublin  have been working con tinuously at the post office in Piaski  which allowed me to be continuous -- in continuous contact with my parents  to whose house I used to ride after work on my bicycle  about three to six kilometers from Pi aski to Sialishky.
It was snowing and there was snow on the ground and I remember it seemed like we had a long walk  a very long way to get to the train.
At that time there was no work so they had to shovel sand from one mountain and build a new mountain to be busy.
So even my father who was employed in the ghetto had to go out--outside.
He decided to come back so after a couple of days he was home  he decided to go back to the factory where he was.
Our duty on the highways was to pick up the gravel  straighten out the highway  whatever it was damaged down on there  we did the work.
It was really no work for us  other than helping the other people with lifting up bodies who from exhaustion just fell and died on their own.
If you don't work you're kicked out never mind if you're Jewish or Christian.
MG: Well  uh when the people came back from uh work and they didn't find their children  I mean  I don't have to tell you what that means.
When I used to go to work I used to stay till 2:00 at night on Thursday night to prepare for the two days food  not to cook  not to do anything.
Were the Jewish police in the ghetto good or were they not good?
And he called me  and he said there was a very intere sting thing going on there  and why didn't I come over to the State Department and organize or work on something called the Reorganization Program in the Foreign Funds Co ntrol Division of the De partment of State.
So there were three schools  school -- school of commer ce  social work  and literature  so -- so I chose the school of social work.
And he was coming then  and brought me pen  and a piece of paper  and said sit down and do some drawing  start to work.
He was knowing that I was Jewish because I did not work on Saturday.
So he was  you know  there was all kind of parties in Europe  so he belonged to a party  it was a chalutz  he used to go out for -- for hard work  for building  for -- for -- for -- for other work  ha -- this was a -- he bel -- he belonged to a party chalutz.
And then when I got my dental degree in 1956  I did some advanced uh work  graduate work and I got a graduate degree in uh oral pathology  uh specializing in diseases of the mouth and the face and the neck  and then uh I went into uh academic life and was one of the founders of a new college of dentistry at the University of Kentucky in Lexington  where five of us started a new school  really from a fr om an empty cornfield and at the end of that period when the first class graduated from there in 1966  I decided to uh to look for let's say new horizons and like so many people uh looked toward a second career.
You talked about working  and what kind of work was there.
I didn't my mother met him much more because of her her volunteer work on the on the it's not the consulate.
If I saw they were enjoying the work  I took them off the job.
I was work ing there and I knew everyone there and I knew his 2 whole personnel.
Because when we went to work  my brother and I went to work  and our mother took -- made some sandwich for us  but we couldnt take anyt hing to drink with us  and whatever we drank had to be boiled.
My so called stepsister took the heavy part of the job and when you work with the shovel and filling dirt or whatever  you know  you work physically hard  you do get warm.
I told them  I said  now were not going to work on the railroad anymore  looks like were going into some kind of a different uniform and were going to have to fight or shoot or something like that  because the whole transport is going to wards Stalingrad.
I forgot to say that when they took me to work  they sent my husba nds parents to a different place -- to Obadovka -- a different camp.
Ill work for a month or two  I thought  but then I couldnt leave the work.
We used to laugh at them because this was the easy work  see.
And when the season started so I work at night 12 hours  for night.
And those conditions were to about 1941  when the (sounds like youthenlaut) in Stary Sacz was ordered to select about 100 young people from (sounds like Ermitz) and to be sent to Rabka  R-A-P-K The time when we were told that we will go to this place  we did not know what the function of our work will be.
And I went to work as a tailor in the factory for uniforms.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 24 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: officers confronts me and wants to know why I'm not at my work place.
All the b ig shots  Germans  came and took me to work in a coal mine.
So it didnt take very much money  he came over there and he opened his grocery store  and that was the first one in the town.
The Jews had to line up on the outside in a given place and from there cleaning the streets and so on was the kind of work that we were ordered to do.
These things have got to be addressed and more people have got to get to work educating more people  who will do something about it.
Later on every man wanted to go to work in camp because they felt it is a way to survive; they need me  so they are going to protect me.
And  you know  I was looking out this little window and I thought to myself  such little tongues of fire were escaping towards the sky  and I thought myself  ﬁIts like human souls trying to go to Heaven.ﬂ Fortuna tely  I didnt have I wasnt separated upon the arrival from my sisters  a nd I hoped that Father  who was in good health  if he was put to work  that hes okay.
I was working - no  we traveled around because in Italy you don't work in a theater.
In the meantime  uh my sister who had encountered similar obstacles in her work  wh ich was nursing  had managed uh to leave Germany by 1936 and had come uh to the US and  and specifically to Buffalo  New York.
But we felt that something is wrong because all the older people and the sick ones were going on side and the one who could...could still work was going on the other side.
So when my husband survived  again he had to start from sc ratch and work his way up to whatever and thank God I mean  with all the work and without the formal education  he still made a good living fo r all of us and he was a lways a tremendous father and husband and so we are married now almost 41 years so I can just look back at those years as wonderful and those few years that I had with my mother as being marvelous and I'm very thankf ul to her  helping me surviv e those horrible  horrible years.
On one of my electrical engineering assignments I worked in a textile factory installing cable and on the way to and from work in th e truck  I met a young Jewish girl from Czechoslovakia who had just recently been brought to Riga and there was a very strong attraction.
Was a very difficult work  because special when we have no idea about the auto electricity.
We also stayed there for a short period of time  and in Hiflingen  the head of the SS walked on the end  we were standing still  he looked at me and pulled me out and say  ﬁYou are staying in the barracks  you dont have to go to work.
And then what they did  they wanted to make us to work so they took us...every morning at 5 o'clock we had to get up  \  Appell\ . \
And I see farmers coming into work  and I know them the farmers.
And of course  doing such exhaustive work  you just couldn't do it you know for long.
And she was there  I made an appointment with her  and I said  ﬁMrs.
Saturday afternoon after work  and the road was full of snow  and there was a railroad in the middle  we were walking on the railroad.
And and asi-aside from stores and manufacturing  wa s there any other kind of work  and other kind of economic basis for the Jewish community?
Marcia Loewi: I worked in that  in a small furnitur e company and one day we came to work and the night shift  the night.
But  first of all  Jews were not entitled to any worker's cards even if they did do some work where Germans would have received them.
And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough  or whatever  to work in the forest  and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they felled  and and yes  there was one occasion when she I dont know  you know  she was so tired by then  and and malnourished  and just  you know  devastated by the whole experience  because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira   that she didnt end up in one of those Soviet orphanages.
TL: (Russian--wrote about at first about hunger... products later about work in brigade wanted to help family also wrote about facts of life  coldness politics  love  questions) Video Tape No.
This was ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 important for my family  a lso  because my family members were also domiciled in these areas.
She said with your command of English and your knowledge of newspaper work and publicity  and thats when I got busy and I did we did pack  information packets each month.
We saw trucks on the platform where they were loading our stuff into it.
And there were some parts for some milit for some other sa there was one barrack inside the camp  who also only people with high technical education work ed there.
But it was more like that  but it  I was not in constant touch  but I was very aware of Stuarts work and aware of the troubles he was having  that Sandra explained last night in much more detail  but I was aware of all the back and fo rth troubles with the  uh  with the group in  in Germany that were trying to stop the film and so forth. (
So  finally I was dressed  you know  at that time we had clothes from the Ghetto  people had so much clothes  so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work.
So  a -again my luck would have it  I was doing some work as a ticket agent for Scandinavian airlines in Rome .
But the reason was that we were passing for Alsatians  and there was an agreement between France and -- and als -- and the Germans  Alsatians who were -- some of them were Ger-Germans  some of them were French  should not be forced to work f -- in Germany.
and a couple months..) We used to  people used to go out from the ghetto to work in factories or in railroad station  wherever they 4 needed some help  workers  they sent out our Jews there.
Those who were  who were still capable to work  as long as they were capable to work  and able to work  had a certain slim chance  but they had a chance  how long it lasted  that was uh a ma tter of  of  of uh  uh  uh daily destiny  I would say.
At that time in Germany though  you kne w that there were concentration camps?
Their recent work in the German laboratory had led to a breakthrough in the processing of faded documents which is now the subject of three U.S. patents and one international patent.
So I became an ordinary prisoner and oh  I -- I -- I  yes  and one day  I told one of the guards that I would like very much to work in the quarry and he was kind of a nice guy.
He wear...you know...he weared not just not at home but in the home of mine friends and the home of our 2 neighbors and uh usually most in the main street is all Jewish people lived and we had some Gentiles on the side and some Gentile...we goed out together and uh we have in the town very...we lived like and and there is no more hate  but I couldn't remember too many years...maybe they had before or after or whatever  and then so my older brothers went the same thing and and cheder and then it's what I remember  come into the years in 19...1939  you know  my uh brother remaining...there come a time when in every household had to go to work  you know  to do some work and and in my home I was chosen by my family that I should go.
Well  there were the   the  there were really different kinds of camps  concentration camps and death camps.
But just -- just -- i-it should be peace in America  it should never happen anything again  and I should be able to have both my knees working because they -- they dont work for the last four or five years  and I -- I -- Ill just be happy.
But nevertheless  the effort was necessary even if the produce that came from all this work was distributed to the students that were working on it .
On behalf of the Holocaust Museum I thank you for sharing with us  your story.
My fa ther didnt have any money  but they took me to the ghetto through the entrance  and they said that the Germans said that they should take me to the ghetto  I still can work and so on.
Father was away a lot from home  and when he came home he was busy also preparing the work that he was doing.
And from this  uh  from this day on  we uh  contact other Jewish groups which were organized nearby  like from Makushu  and so on  and we began to work together  and that's how things had developed.
We were magnificent cheap labor force  that a lot of people were saved from especially those who were young and able to work  and survived due to the fact that from 1942 until 1944  until the time when they took us to Auschwitz  that we were working.
>> Bill Benson: You were sent to Auschwitz in 1944  as you just described.
A-And if you were in the ghetto  what was the advantage of hiding?
And my father work and came home  and we had a normal life  like anybody else.
Me and him going after work or some meeting  together  without his family  without my family  only me and him.
And we the so the farmer takes us to his farm.
You are still living at home  right  going back and forth to work?
Every minute of my work I learned something new and it was fascinating for me to work with the material I worked with.
He -- they couldnt take three weeks off from work  so he had to go back to work.
I have to send a person.ﬂ So  I go with the group in the morning to work and they tell me where to go  and I come in and I enter this room and it has like in a cl assroom  small desks  and in front there is like a glassed in area and there is this head of the office.
Then my mother was able to arrange that in on January the third  I think  or second  immediately after the first of the year in -- of 1940  I started to work at the Hilfsverein15.
I always had the responsibilities  there were always some kind of a problems which I had to solve  but I really -- so it wasnt easy  but I didnt mind it  because I -- I always felt that I rather work hard  than have problems which I woul dnt be able to solve.
Since I had to go to Minsk which it was my regular route time of the month to pick up supplies  I hurried with -- my father-in-law gave me to take along some Vodka and some butter and other things because you had to bribe the officials to get work done  even in the KGB.
And uh  next morning  I had to give out the report  how many people are alive  and who are ----------ready to work.
I'm not quite sure of the exact time  but then one day people were told not to go to work  and we were given approximately an hour to take whatever we could carry with us  and we had to congregate again at the marketplace.
Well I will let you work until you can make some money.
AR: Yes  the ghetto settled into a lull--into a routine and there was a lot of work being done for the Germans in the ghetto.
Neither of us blinked an eye lash  but we both knew why he was going to work his head off to get those 11 Jews out of there and he wanted me to know why.
It became slow work  and the German command always referred to the partisans as bandits.
Anyway  they took a hostage in the village  a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his parents.
There they were assigned to do slave labor for the Philips electronics factory.
And then what we try and do is help the adult son get to Canada because we knew that through Canada and the United States  they could work something out where the two relatives could be joined again.
And I guess when the Germans came in and they were -- they were the -- they were depressed into the Russians and the Jews owned -- owned a lot of things  the chance to take everything away from the Jews.
After several days of work at different work details  I was assigned one day to a group whose job it was to clear out a machine shop  which was located in a converted or abandoned monastery.
For example  also my father's shop  he has to work but one German was there and he was li ke the director from it and he took money and my father had to work.
But it told me that I had a lot of work to do.
Two of my best friends decided it  and it didn 't work.
The same guy sit at a table and asked  \ Who want to go out to work?\
And where would this be  where in Auschwitz would this -- Just a place where I -- where my duty was  in the entrance of block B  where the people went to work.
Now what did you do in the first work camp in Puchine?
I had a couple of people working under me who did the same work and a -- I was in charge of that.
There are such places  and the ORT is also active in America  and your relatives will probably assist you  and if you work hard  and get accustomed to the life there  things will be all right.
Or they were shot or they killed when somebody couldn't work anymore  dropped  so they shot him.
I went to work as a milliner  an d I got a stitch infection.
At that time uh there was no wholesale buying and all the inventory used to be produced by seamstresses who used to come to the store after it was closed in the evening and my mother used to give them out the work and discuss the various fashions and they did  did the work at their houses and used to bring it back and this is the way we we acquired inventory.
And I got registered for the draft and my father tried to have me deferred because he needed me for the farm.
In the beginning  I had two times  two times a day  to work and back.
Did your work change a whole lot after the Civil Rights Act passed?
I started almost immediately working on Mauthausen  when I could physically work.
There was a German population that they moved in and they used to beat up the Jewish kids or the Jewish people.
If I would go away  I wouldnt report to work the next day so the Germans would kill my parents anyway.
And I was going to shave him  but his electric shaver didnt work  and I wouldnt use a straight razor  he was a severe diabetic.
So she took after you in the work that she does.
So  then after a little while when I was in   I met somebody that I knew who asked me if I wanted to do so me work for the resistance.
End of Tape Two  Side B 49 Beginning Tape Three  Side A -- okay.
I dont remember whethe r we got paid for the work when we were making bricks  but once you worked  you saved your life.
Do I remember correctly that your y our mother had basically been at home in Austria  she had not Yes  yeah needed to work?
I said they ask volunteers  I went to work in the kitchen  where the food is.
You mentioned a few th ings that when you came over here  you had to work  you had to learn English.
We work ed in a place called do you know German?
And I continued to work all the all the time in in the Lubavitcha office there.
I started to work over there  and then one day I decided whatever it will be  I go home  and I was lucky.
And all thats what the Interview with Riane Gruss January 5  1996 45first work was.
I dont remember any transpor ts there  I mean  possible that there were some when I wasnt there  when I was at work  I dont know  but Ive never seen any there in -- in our camp.
Anyway that was the time...when we 12 parted  and he said we had to part  he took us all...not only me but a lot of other Poles to a church  and he said from there on  everybody is on their own  but he knew there is going to be a raid by the Germans to take the people to work the Germans.
She would do the dirtiest work and she would get a little extra soup and she would give me a little bit  bread or a little something you know to help me.
So he recognized me and he talked this over with the  his chief which was the inspector for that bridges and track and they took me to work.
I didnt have no friends  I -- I couldnt get no friends.
So I was there  and I was still working by this tailor a little bit  you know  I went to work there  he got open the store  but he did for the Germans  they came in Was he Jewish?
This is no like a carpet...this is work  you know what I mean.
If you got sick in a camp  you were sent to Auschwitz.
What I told you  on the third day when the Germans came in  was on the radio  \ Everybody except Jews should go work.\
The work was easier than it was to drag the stones and everythi ng else.
So  jabusky immediately  they wanted to make sure that we come to work for them.
I was you know first  I don't understand German at this time and they talk always German.
Because eight hour  when I start to work  my mind is on the work and is not remember what is happening.
In the evenings  when you werent on duty  what -- what did you do?
And then we knew  yeah  well the -- well  the Germans had -- well  they were just put to -- to work in Germany  so we didnt think much of it  that they would be killed  we didnt know about that.
Now  in 1932  I think it was  I spent a summer in the school which they ran at the time  which was near Berlin  it was called Gutw inkle  and we somewhat participated a little bit in the work they did  and ma -- we were re warded for it.
Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21  2011 63 Did you get an order at one point that We all got orders to report for work  and many of my friends who were not married at the time reported for work.
And sometimes they took them to work  you know  to make the uniforms for the Germans.
And so already at..uh...uh...I...I would say...at the end of Spring we really have recuperated fully and continued our work.
So this was at the lunchtime  the soup  and the soup was good.
Well  he went over  and told him  and he came back  and he laug hed and -- and he said  ﬁOh  dont worry ﬂ you know  ﬁyoull be slow another day  it will be here plenty work for you  come and work.ﬂ I was over there maybe a whole week longer  and it didnt come in too much work  and I was still doing nothing practically  here and there something.
I never done that kind of work  but I did it.
So in other words  if I understand this right  you were dumped in the middle of the woods  and youre put to work.
But the thing was  because nobody went to Germany to work ther e  in the fields -- there was hunger in Germany  and they loaded in all the countries the trains full  and the food went all to Germany  and we had very little.
So my mother--we were not allowed to take musical instruments into the ghetto so she sold the piano to some Lithuani- an family and she use to work everyday.
One morning a good friend of mine was sitting at the bench doing some work for the Air Force.
But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the the br the work?
He says  ﬁOkay.ﬂ He says  ﬁCome back Monday and you can start working.ﬂ And I started to work in the -- back to the paint supply.
But  most of them were young men and women who were taken to labor camp  to work cam ps in Germany  and there was contact  they were allowed to write postcard a month  so we kne w where they were.
The farmer where you worked found out earlier  but he decided not to say anything  but when you decided to give up work on the farm -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067 21 Right. --
Anyhow I...the news was that they arrived in some camp  and were taken out and sent to Chem to work.
we marched past them every day going to work and coming back.
They -- and I was out of the ghetto and I walked in camp.
Could you tell us about the office  and w -- and the job that you went there to do  and that you ended up doing?
You know I have the right to shoot you if you walk 50 feet away from the place you work.\
Vote  support it  work for it  enjoy it and keep it free.
And I escaped to Vilna and from Vilna...in Vilna I got work .
And in the winter it was terrible  big snow and I had to walk to work.
If we get a blacksmith  he could work with the blacksmith and hit the iron while it's still hot.
It was very tough  it was hard to get into construction.
My daughter didn't know until morning that what hap- pened because I come back from the  from the work and she is already asleep and in the morning I got out  I get out at 5:00  6:00 so she's a  still so she didn't know but when she came to the kindergarten the children Video Tape No.
I see  so you were allowed to go out to work in the soap factory?
There was uh there uh began to work the leaders from the from the Zionist organization  several prominent uh Jewish person  later more and more relatives and and they began to work and to give out this shutzpass.
And he says  I give you more hours to wo rk  stay and work.

And Mariani and I were in the block together for mayb e four weeks or so  four or five weeks  and then I worked that we -- I was sent to work in -- they tor -- I still dont know what they did with it.
So the Oberscharfuerer was standing downstairs with the people on appell to take them to work  and the kitchen was raised on a little hill...I took the whole package and let it down the hill and it stopped right next to the Oberscharfuehrer's feet.
But I couldnt work over there  th ey say  because I was Jewish so I lost the job.
So what was the difference between the wo rk that you were doing sorting clothes and the work that Canada commando was doing sorting clothes  do you know?
work at FDA was very satisfactory because I went into areas that were clear  clean  no -- no one did any of that work.
At one point she offered herself to work in Germany because that wou ld have been saf er in that the G erm ans needed people to work as Pols.
And but you know  it didnt always work as beautifully as it sounds  because there were many kamikazes who crashed into picket ships  because they knew that the picket ships these were destroyers  all the way al all in different spots around the island.
End of Tape 1 Tape 2 I had just asked Mr. Winton if he would lik e to say anything else about his relationship with members of the Jewish community in Br itain and what their response was to this work you were doing?
One day  my father said that he was going to 32 Rotterdam  to see if hed get tickets to come to -- to go to New York  that he -- and the reason  I guess by that time they told me that much  that he could not -- he was under the impression that he could work there  or start a business  or something  but he could not.
And what kind of work did other 16 year old boys do  besides what you did?
So after the Soviets came  of course he had to relinquish his bu siness and what is interesting  that the Soviet government  they hired him to work for them in the army  to make uniforms  I think  and th -- and he was making good money  they paid very well.
They should come out so they will be free to work and live.
What I remember is that they cr eated the ghetto  they were the conquerors  and they created the Jewish police to more or less supervise any [indecipherable] that the Germans had imposed and also in a way  take care of -- so thered be no crime.
My work in the Holocaust Museum is so great because I get to meet all of these wonderful young people who are so super.
My grandparents loved my father  and this -- especially her two sisters  to the point during the Nazi time where my mothers youngest sister  as they always accused her that she couldnt keep her mouth shut  she ended up in a work camp.
And--and it's I finally got a job work- ing in there.
And then we were not the only one  we were with with other forced labors  from u from the Ukraine they brought a lot of young women to work by the farmers.
Its a recognition of many years of work and struggle for the common values  because since the beginning of the Cold War  United States goals and objectives were identical with our asp -- Polish aspirations.
Then they counted all of us  and we were led back to our stations  where to work.
I go every day to this work  and what was bad  we didnt have much food in the house  because the Italian people  as wonderful as they are  they were stingy with giving you food  okay?
And I did volunteer work at a veterans hospital up to the age that I got married.
And the owner of the apartment 12 told us that his two daughters went to work early that morning and locked the apartment with a padlock and they didn't have any food.

So by that I was given electric car and I was able to move in the part of the factory where the women used to work.
A lot of work which has to do with keeping the flame alive  perpetuating the heritage  trying to tell the world what was done to us and never let it forget it.
And because the work condi- tions seemed so wonderful by ghetto standards because already food was scarce and men had been taken away for forced labor.
>> Bill Benson: The one that you were scheduled to leave on.
And that's why we ... And later  when they couldn't work no more because the Russians closed in  so they took us in 8 there to the other camp  and got us away from there.
Were you really mainly just focusing on your work and your family or did you have other interests or passions outside of that?
They were sitting there  there was nothing to do because there was that much work and that much places but people had  that they were delegated to the straw aut-tie-lum where we had old people  sick people.
And they  uh  were assigned the works; but only they work about two weeks  and they were all called up--their numbers called up--on the roll call  and  uh  assembled in  uh  Block 11 and shot  you know.
And I dropped it on the floor in 5 000 000 pieces and the supervisor -- susupervisor was coming -- running over  and he says  ﬁYou cant work here.

You see the gate with the famous inscription   ﬁArbeit macht 13 frei  \  meaning -- it's a deceiving inscription which means work makes you free.
I did some related work at BEW10 as well  in connection with the se izure of patents.
Everybody takes a blanket and everybody got a loaf of bread with s ome marmalade  margarine  and we started walking.
Once a week  there was a class  that was volunteer work.
Since I was fairly young  I think I was 18 or 20  whatever it was  and I didn't have much money  so  an d I had a cousin in BergenBelsen  so I went to work in BergenBelsen  and that's where I met my husband.
As new immigrant groups came in  there were all kinds of tensions and problems and he would work with those.
We had other -- we had to work and we had to look after families.
And with me  because my mother was with us and she could take care of the children  I could go to work.
And it was all integr ated with the work done by the Committee of National Liberation  and by the churches  by politi cal party  by groups.
So the -- since there were so many traitors in the city  so I would say the approximately 6 000 Jews of Greece who were saved  were saved either by going to the free partisan controlled areas  and -- or they stayed w ith -- in that work of resistance sympathizers in Athens who volunteered their services  and there are no cases where the [indecipherable] for example  they w -- they were appointed to go into the house for one man  but the -- the -- well  i -- this is a case wher e it shows how the Italians were very helpful in Salonica  where they saved hundreds of Jews by gi ving them Italian citizenship  and they moved them to -- to Athens.
He was always sitting at the edge of the river on a bench near a little shed and he was always teaching me how to do work with...with...with....how to carve things for  with the little knife  with a...uh...and he was telling me story and he was teaching me.
And so we had -- we had to work for them.
And when I came home from work I was taking care of the garden  I was the gardener.
I could not walk and all these guys who I helped carried potatoes  they carried...they had cold compresses putting on me to to keep me cool and the next day I had to go to work.
The father  a minister  was sent to a work camp -- concentration camp -- was sent -- came home again.
Germans used to say that we need a brigade of twelve hundred people to do this type of work  so he selected  made a list who are these twelve hundred people.
In the morning  it is still dark  but the bell rings and we have to go out  stand up and go to work.
So then  sometimes  while working  or wanted to work  it was intellectually  mentally  a very demanding job.
But I continued visiting  meeting with Jewish chaplains  who once again were doing a remarkable piece of work in helping Jewish survivors.
And I used to misb ehave to be able to stay after school  and the teacher always would work in the library.
It was a very nice -- it was actually a girls school.
My father  as soon as he finished high school went to work for a lumber mill in what is now Croatia  to suppo rt his brother.
And the agriculture workers  and my wife among them  dressed in shorts  and nice blouse  marching by with 90 the rake  or the -- the -- the spade over the shoulder  singing happy songs going to work.
I went to work in a sweatsho p. They called it a sweatshop  it was actually  you know  they make the blazers.
My father's former employers  either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948  to the West  so this  what I mentioned  was a volunteer work.
It wa s a difficult job because -- and everybody falls in love -- when you are in reli ef work you fall in love with your work and you fall in love with the people you are working with.
We are talking about  if possible  the time spent between work and sleep -- what would you do  how would you spend time together  or separately?
Did so you were and there was no other selection while you were there at Auschwitz  you just they just took you to this work camp Oh yeah.
It was a terribly scary thing for the head of the family to be taken away and then forced to do the kind of work he wasn't trained for and the disrespect and the danger that went with it.
And these people had been there for political deportees  who had no way of ever getting out  at least they thought  and they kept telling us that we would also remain these were work settlements that we would also remain there forever  because whenever we said well  you know  maybe someday well get out  or after the war  or something  they used to tell us theres no hope.
Really  you know  I was astonished how much you can learn just by watching what somebody else does  and then sometimes having somebo dy who knows  come over and and work with you  and so you learn those things.
>> Bill Benson : When you got to Auschwitz  you were selected to do slave labor.
Y-Youre tailors  Im sure youll get work over there  49 youll get settled down  things like that.
Even they  they told us  don't work so fast because it's not good for us  they said .
All the time my father work  and you know -- we were expecting that war will be over  we all are going to go back and life is going to be the same as before.
We did a good work because we wanted to save our job.
comes ha-has already spoken to your fa Has already spoken to my father  yes  and its actually Friday night  and my f we we were my mother remember  my mother  my brother and I are sitting on the balcony  waiting for my father to come home from work.
And the other ones who were there had to work and there was not a good unit  but somehow he managed to get along there and eventually he got discharged and then got back home  but during that time we were home without him and again jumping things  my father  after awhile  found it  no more practicing secretly  he was  he tried to get a front man to work with  another doctor with whom he could  to whom he could take the patients across the street and sort of share and split the fee or something like that.
And they used to put two people to work for one single ship  maybe two weeks or more to decide whether they  how to do it.
They were telling people that young people are being taken to work.
When Just they just went to work at six oclock in the morning  they came home before dark  or dark in the winter and they never just be glad to be home and go to that magazine  whatever they had  get their payok they called it  you know  the grams of bread  whatever  and the soup.
I can work with th em  but socially  you know  with a few  but not with the whole -- with all the people that I am in contact with.
So thats -- after two and a half years we moved back to Washington and he went to work for Voice of America.
So we stand in the tunnel  and you -- when you are so long in that work  you get really a look at people  that you -- and I saw he was very vain  and so I started the conversation  and he could speak some Dutch.
My mother and my sister were taken to work to labor camps every day and brought back in the evening.
We were back to normal  to work every day to the factory.
So I took th e stripes and I threw them right into his trash can and I said \ I am sorry  sir  but these st ripes only interfere with my work.
It took about 400  500 young men from our town t o work in the canal.
And went originally to work with the European Student Relief fund  which was an organization made up of the three student serving organizations.
So we -- there we are  the Germans in the German uniform.
I was very fast in the war  and some people would be a little slow  and then I say to them  \ I work for your part  and what you get paid you give me half of it.\
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about the ghetto  you were also  I think  at some point sent to work on a farm.
And there is this my stepfather needed a new radio  he sa ys oh  my old radio doesnt work.
And then some transports usually  when I had to work near the railroad tracks  you know  near the ramp   there was  and  and sometimes when a transport came  we had  they sent us all to the compound  except for those who worked with the unloading of the people  b ut a few times  we went to clean the houses from the SS  and there wasn't enough time to run back  so they would lock us in  or we knew ourselves we are not supposed to walk out and watch it  and  and sometimes we saw the people the way they were delivered   before they're dead  they torture before they're dead.
Can you talk a little bit about the importance of work?
So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like  for instance  we went to a place  to a concentration camp.
You mentioned the fact that the French seemed very their priorities seemed to be evangelization and theoretical Protestantism and ideas  whereas you wanted to do social work.
And then I had to leave the ghetto in the evening at six oclock with the brigade  which went to town to work.
It was a strictly union place  but I had a cousin and the cousin knew Maximillion very well  a woman  and she asked me  \ Would you like to work for him?\
Your mother  did she also go to work or did she stay home with the other.
But it didnt faze me  it didnt faze me because I was occupied with myself and everybody was just going to work and coming from work.
And we were being bombed by American bombers  which was something happy event for us although some prisoners got killed  and in the factory  where we did also mostly construction work.
And after that what normally happened was that the group would stay in the same kibbutz and become part of the kibbutz in which they had been for two years as regular members of the kibbutz.

Im sure that a couple of chaps who used to work in the butchery went behind a barn and cut its throat–.

Laughter] >> Bill Benson: During that time  1936 and 1937  tell us about your father  how your father was doing from a work standpoint with the anti -Semitic laws taking full effect.
I was...I had never had a preparation of being a teacher  but teaching was mostly...uh....si nging together with the children  keeping them together and the children came very  very eagerly to school becaus e part of their work was a soup.
I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 69 would say they contributed money to the -- to small museums  and s -- and now the Jews  and the Gentiles work together in all these places  so its -- its a very good relation.
Mostly they talked about the daily work and what they were doing  and then while I was there on that farm he got married and that was an enormous event because at Polish wedding  literally it is a Polish wedding.
Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer  and they were of different color for different days and again  one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the printing office and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors.
Lusek  I speak to him -- and I hear that hes guiding -- I ask him first  I was -- wanted to go  ready with my group  I still kept the group  sort of like the 10  that we work together  as I said  to begin.
The first four weeks  I was doing that kind of work and that was the time when I started having typhoid.
As a camp how it was  we did not have hangings in this camp.
These were people who were coming to my home  sleeping and eating  an d I was helping them with work.
I went into the kibbutz  in -- to work in the hospital b ecause I know how to give a injection  you know  I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp  by working with the animals  its not that different to give a injection  and take a temperature  and so on.
I got -- I got a license to work  you know.
Not quite sure what it was but there was some work.
That may have been the depression rather than he gave up his business in 1929 or thereabouts and went to work for a leather and shoe factory in the suburbs.
Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12  2016 104 Thank you very [break] Okay  before the break  we were talking about your work  the work that you were starting to to do with the Quaker organization in Marseilles  and how you ended up working with Dr. Chalmers .
The most wonderful thing that helped me in the forging my identity was the help I got from the Director of the school of social work and the director of the school of early childhood education.
And I'm going to mention her name  because she's so well known: Andree Salomon is known by everybody for her incredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war.

You had to go...uh...by foot...about 10...I'm speaking kilometers  10  15 kilometers and then after a day's work  walk back  and with the parcel your... on your back.
A nd I don't have day to day contact with him  I work with somebody who is employe d by him.
But with the work that I did in mine building business  I knew  I used to come home at night  like ten o'clock at night  and I was tired.
And also  my father was out  you know  since he had a work permit  he could mingle  he could go out there and he could scrounge and do whatever he could  while she was always at home  you know  I mean  she was -- she didnt -- she didnt work.
The next day the marchik is the...that is a man who drives you to work  that sees to it that nobody stays inside.
And then they assigned to me some twenty people or more  I don't recall  mostly elderly people  because they couldn't -- they were not useful to go out and work manual work.
Instead of  put me on put me on work on piecework like the other Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20  2009 121guys work.
>> David Bayer: I went to work for the irrigation canal.
And that kind of got us st arted and every Friday night Lucy and I have Shabbat dinner and we do a blessing and when were not too exhausted from the end of the week well read something and have found it very important to have something that separates the work week from rest  to have a moment of grace  to allow ourselves some grace even though the next day  Saturday  were still doing th ings we have to do.
My father made enough money that she didnt have to work and she you know she ran the household and we had a nanny and I think we had a cook and a maid also.
My mother had neve r done any kind of tailoring  any kind of work before  hard work  let alone working with fur  but somehow she managed to persuade them that she was able to -- to work with fur.
Shortly there after  he asked   ﬁD o you want to go to school or do you want to go to work?
And I had an exhibition of  of Is  Palestine pictures with me that I planned to exhibit in Belgium where my professor had promised to help me but as I was planned it in Kovno I dis  and I  I wanted to work so I got myself inscribed in the  in the local academy so I had models and I could go and uh and continue my  my work and I had an Video Tape No.
Th at is what we got and for a little poor boy who had to go to work wh en he was not 14 years old  had to go to work  that was quite a bit.
Of course  there were some fo lks who got divorces over that hard work  just as they do in the Service  I think.
And she was my mother became a maid over there  and had an income.
So my father explained to him that yes  I am in Kaunas  my family is in Kauna s  but I cant -- I dont have right to work in Kaunas and I dont have right to register in Kaunas to live.
What was it like to work for on e  one-on-one as an errand boy  and how did you cope with that?
The fi rst time I work with Holo caust survivors was in a psychiatric  I was working in psychiatry because it was a natural thing for me.
But then came a  you know  a past  you know  story that when he came to Belgium  as -- as I mentioned in another oral history  he went directly to work in the mines  coal mines in Liege for -- for a year.
But he got a job  and then another job  and he did very well.
And can you tell me  what did your father do  what was his job  what was his profession?

You know  when we were picking up  you had to work some place to get stamps.
And then they organized us again and they took us to a train station and they had a big barn and we had to stay there for a whole week to work.
When we did this work  when they made contact inside  they made someone  not us  but just someone  in London I think it was  so we would never know what happened  we didnt know whether they got killed or were doing great.
So we went we st we start to go like five oclock  used we used to work like oh  it t ook us a hour half til we came to the place.
So it we were all brought up to collectively go to a a brick factory to work.
When I came back from work  I found she was gone.
And this helped me to survive when I did the work for that camp commander. (

I could live  could pay my rent and mymy mother didn't work  but she was broken.
They brought Jews from adjacent villages and they were always ready to  we were ready to work on -- Were you living at home at the time?
>> Bill Benson: What led up to their finally being able to leave?
Some other kids seen that we get along so good  they also tried tried the same thing  but it didnt work.
I gi -- bega -- I never saw so much blood in my life and -- you know  and they work so fast  whereas orthopedic is  you know  you aw-aw.
When I work it seems it's completely full  my work is so demanding and I give so much out of myself that during the day I never know  once I get there nothing exists  no private life  no nothing  I'm so involved.
I started to work and I was terribly unhappy  but I was unhappy all the time  it was nothing new.
But I had a chance to work in their kitchen  and in the kitchen what I did there is I did heat the kettles the to make the fire underneath  you 44 know.

He had business contacts  and they initially helped him out and he went to work for them  initially as an employee  and he shou -- he sh ortly became their partner.
He was walking out of the house going to work and the SS and the French gendarme asked him  Are you Mr. Zosnika?
Katya really made what she could in the time of counting the work -- the -- time of counting the -- during the roll call time was cut down to an s -- minimum amount of time  yeah  and that meant more relaxation  more sleep.
The directorship of the ghetto was almost hundred percent Zionist  because that was Jankov Edelsteins work  because he -- he believed in that  I think.
So mainly I was a hostess and you know this was an enormous work because we had thousands and thousands of people coming.

And you know  one day I took some small piece of bread and I put here.
She was sent on to another camp where she was assigned to slave labor for the Telefunken factory  electronics fac tory  doing the same kind of work  assembling radio tubes.

If it didn't work good  I call over the supervisor to adjust it.
Those not educated went to work on farm  or in the factories in Germany.
For the other part  we were welloff  and the Russians sent many to Siberia.
The team was  came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch Jews and they were lined up in the camp street  and they had said that they did not perform their job properly.
When we got to the ghetto my mother still continued digg ing ditches but my sister managed–. That was the work that sh e was doing outside the ghetto?
Used to work for 10 years to the -- she was director of development for New York City ballet and now she works for the 42nd Street Development Corporation.
The only place where it would have been possible to escape was at the work site.
There there's no criminal activities whatsoever  and my first reaction  my brother's and I when they asked for volunteers  we wanted very much to volunteer for that too  because it meant have a uniform  have a little bit larger rations of food  not to have to go to work in the city  be inside the ghetto and all that  but my father  God bless him  was very much against it.
My mother didn't have the time or the ability to watch us constantly because she had to work on the emigration.
So what did they do in Shilova  what was ki what was the work that your brother had to do?
There were at work  if we didnt work fast enough  they would kick us or prod us with a shovel or rifle or something like that but it really wasnt the real gruesome things that you hear about --those really all came later and in the various concentration camps.
And in the beginning I still got some schooling  a teacher -- a Jewish teacher after work  we could go and read something  books or -- she had some books from history  so I would go in  she talked about history.
And what did you do during the day in the ghetto?
And then when he retired he had two years of he had to sign a clause that he could not work in Interview with El eanor Rolfe 35 industry  that he represented the governme nt  you know  for two years  a noncompetition clause because he was the one who put all the emission controls on our vehicles.
But it was seven days a week we had to work.
A little bit later we were lined up and told all the working people can go to work.
And my mother had nine children  and when we were 12 years old we had to go out to work  to work for the farmers.
Yes  so one night  it was end of  I think 43  the Ukrainian band  you know  the troops  whoever it was  in [indecipherable] was name of the group  they invaded monastery  and they 82 wanted to -- they were after Polish people work ing for Germans to register cows and pigs.
First of all  he start to employ them  and the work  and working condition in his camp was so wonderful that people who were in the Plazov Camp  or in or in any concentration camp  called his camp and his factory what we ca--there was the name Amaria  we called them a paradise.
So I sent him to my hometown  to a Polish man who used to work for my father.
And...uh...people whic h had apartment...houses where they lived could not bring any Christian workers to work and to trust them that they're going to hid Jews in them  so they brought me in.
The next sizeable liquidation took place in November 1943 when a part of the Sonderkomando was transported to Majdanek  allegedly for work in the crematorium there  but once in Majdanek  they were put to death.
And the doctor called...someone called the Belgium doctor  and he examined me and he said  \ In your condition  you'll never be able to work again.ﬂ So...uh...I said  \ Alright  so I'll be going home.ﬂ At the same time  Shave Mission  the American Shave Mission of Belgium was in Brussels  and Eddie Warberg   who was also the President  then and later became President of JDC was also at Shave Mission.
I had to work  I had to wash the floors  which no big deal.
No work for us over there other than bundling up clothing.
And thats why I was -- Im doing it  and it turns out its almost -- not quite  but almost a full time job  yeah.
That means that I would have a bed an d food and then I can work.
They had to do farm wo rk and garden work  things like that.
And this was really helpful to Germans when they came in  to -- to drag down Jews  and so every Polish little kinder  five  six years old  could show all  hey  Jew  so someone took him away to work [indecipherable] and so on.
Sylvia went to night school and then went to work for the New York Public Schools  where she worked for 24 years.
And then we were back to work  and then the -- the daily routine started again.
I couldnt work for awhile because I wa s unreliable  anybody who came from the West  especially from Israel.
Q. So when you were sick you still went to the work and did all these things?
I was born in Vienna  Austria  on December the fifth  1909  and I had a good life and I worked in Vienna and when Hitler came on March the tenth  '38  I couldn't go back to work and I said okay   give me letter of recommenda tion so they said no  you're Jewish  no.
The Jews could not move into their own city  could not travel  could not work.
You see  y -- I say  when I started to work somewhere  yes  that I have [indecipherable] work for half year  yes.
But eventually a man was in charge of the building and he came to our apartment  up to our room  and told us you have to go to work.
He didnt know what -- what -- you know  he tried to work out something.
He was working on the railroad and either drafted to work in Germany  or some of the Belgians took jobs working for the Germans.
And they walked him back  the Jewish police  back there 13 when he was done with his work to return the work.
My sister went to work  and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work and for me  she dropped through the window for them to eat.
When we walked through the ghetto to work after the entire ghetto was empty  it was a very weird feeling and the streets  open windows  flowing curtains blowing with the wind.
And that went on and on and on like this  'til then they start taking the men to the camps  the work camps.
We had to do some what they called   some work in...for the camp  you know  but otherwise we didn't have to work and being told all the time.
No  because after we did survey this area  we were told we have to get out; that other people were coming in to do something to Would work with the survivors  and How long were you actually inside Buchenwald?
Did you work for the resistance at all  or -- No  I could not -- -- you couldnt. --
So  did you have to work as well  or were you to considered too young to work?
As I indicated he had just returned also from the concentrati on camp  but had returned immediately to work again as the executive director of the organization.
And so I ask her  ﬁYou dont need to work  it is already -- the school is end pretty soon  and now  no harm will ti -- be taken to the children if you dont finish with them.
We went out to work  and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked.
Any ty pe of work which was nobody wanted to do it was given to me.
We st arted looking into the possibility of financing the purchasing of the town and how it might work.
My father couldnt work and then the last one was that they were going  but they didnt know where they were going.
But men between the age of 20 and 40 were taken to work every day  railroad station  unloading crates of ammunit ion for the Army or doing  quote  manual labor.
And there -- I -- I remember I used to go to work  and -- from eight to 4:30  and I -- it was an old Greek restaurant there  and I used to go there  do my homework.
And then he went to work  you know  different places and all.
The bitterness doesnt work  it eats you up alive and it  it doesnt harm the people you hate.
I figured worse  you know  being -- being in the family  you know  having in the business family  an uncle  if I would want to go work for my uncle.
It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day.
And they presented me with a gift certificate that just about covered a cruise  because I told -- I was so tired  I was trying to wind up everything  not to leave loose ends  be -- by the time I left  and it didnt work out.
End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B Okay  here we are.
Besides that I used to work on their combine so I was a real uh  you know...what do you call...a hard worker.
Come to my store  and whatever I will be able to give you to work  you'll ha ve some work.\
And also we had to  they would grab people to do th e work in the street.
And there we were  didn't know what's going to happen to us.
So you all went out duri ng the day to work.
And most people I know were in the underground  a nd most of the underground people that I know were involved in this rescue work  I would say.
I 34 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD was not quite 7.
And as we got ready... ready...whatever we have to..you know...all of a sudden... yeah...before  the Germans came and set up shop in our yard.
We had a daily train back and forth to take us to work.
All we knew is that Germans usually take the men first and women hopefully uh later or whatever  but anyway we were hoping that things could work out.
So he thought he was going -- tha-that he would be able to bribe the German and he will let him I -- I dont know what.
I had to wait for that guard to come around and after he left  I had to work on the wire.
And when did you well  from Israel where did you go?
People that had to work  with the -- with the food they were given  couldnt rest too much.
And so then they they made me work in the officers mess for after I graduated the basic course  which is general in nature  they they had me work in the officers mess for a few months.
I said to them  you know  I feel like the Pied Piper  you know  with the kids following me around  except I was really in a hurry because I had to get to the museum  it was on a Wednesday  so I wanted to get to the museum for work  so I didnt want to spend so much time.
It didnt work out too well  cause theyd come one time and then not show up for another month or so.
But foot  with they were normally told that they are going east for some places that they will be employed and work for th e upkeep of their own lives  and so on.

Then daytime I used to work and night time I used to go to night school.
And there were ways to slip out where the work group or work brigade as they were called that worked outside  outside of the ghetto and with the knowledge  it was usually best that with the knowledge of the group leader  one could slip away either to do some trading  bartering  get food.
And you have to say that uh you work in the past--a little lie--to work  to be together  to don't separate us.ﬂ And they...they... we went to Orebro.

End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B Okay.
A story  I must tell you that story in my manuscript  I would like to show this  now th at you mention  but what I wanted to bring out is  we did not have enough intellectual pe ople  even including Elie Wiesel  who wrote a lot of work  and more like Elie Wiesel  that they did not insert that we cannot return back to these places of se -- of cemeteries.

Every time you didnt report to the work  when you were chosen or you didnt go to the place where you were Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 43 May 16  2012 supposed to go so they can deport you.
So we worked  we went separating the clothes  if possible  we were together  so we were pretty often and pretty very -- and very often together as far as the work didn't interfere with -- if the work wasn't the same location  the same thing  we could be together with.
In the beginning we all stay together and we supposed to work in the soap factory which my dad and if -- initially owned it  but he made it fictitiously gave some Lithuanian who was the owner  so we worked for him.

If you want to get work out of slaves  you have to give them living room  you have to treat them with a modicum of satisfying the basic needs of subsistence to live on.

Now  in Auschwitz  Dr. Mengele was conducting experiments and that may have been one of the reasons that one of the -- the barracks USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 5 was filled with youngsters that did actually not work  per se  but maybe were kept for other reasons.
A-A-And -- and shortly afte r  I had to work in the fields.

They didn't know nothing about the work  but they were very sick.
Yes  because when they asked Rumkowski something about the giving to give people to work or what  so we had the Warsaw alteste der Juden came to our alteste der to talk with him.
And because in Arad was not a medicine factory  you know  they give me a job as a biochemist.
My uncle was to sort of continue a reasonable life in terms of work.

My father had remarried  and so he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 29started this business  and I think -- I think -- Im -- Im almost sure  that it isnt that my father didnt push Sam to continue  or to -- to -- to pursue university work  but starting a business  he thought that it would be a wonderful thing to bring my brother in  so that he would also learn the business  and grow with it  and eventually of course  inherit it.
You were checked in  get into your straw  put your things down and off to work  you see.
I would love for the audience to hear a little bit about your father's work once he came to the United States.
In that moment  everybody was very very very scared; because we find out that they misled us  that we be in no Hungary  no puszta work  no nothing.
And that was -- and so as I say  we was assigned people in each group to do this kind of work.
Then I knew that ours is probably going to the gas chambers because if it would be going to work  then  they would be last ones  so they  so I  I  I had no choice  I was just thinking to myself  well  my  my sister was going to get her wish  but I was very  very upset and very angry because I thought that nobody will ever know how we died  just like we didn't know what was going to happen to us  that nobody will ever find out now  and um  and they really took us  and we were standing already in front of the gas chambers  and it was so quiet  you would have thought that we  nobody was  was crying because uh  everybody was  was really prepared.
Afternoon  I had to work in the commando of the -- the Russians commando  to clean the rooms and to prepare food for them  to cook foods for them.
So this way we got the uniform; because  you know  it was the prisoners who work over there  too.
But some of them -- I mean  I -- we didnt have a lot to do with Germans people -- with German people.
So -- see  my brother was assigned  like I mentioned before  to work for the Burgermeister  actually for the wife.
And I remember like now the guy took us and we walked on the street in the ghetto...what nobody is allowed to walk  but he had a paper from th e...from the...from the German Air Force  that he's bringing some people to work for the airplanes or something  so... And I saw these German SS.
He did not  he always preached that Communism wouldnt work  that you couldnt expect it to and that he thought it was a very repressive system  not only for religion  but for huma n beings  he thought Communism was terrible.
and -- and then they would -- oh  its ve ry hard work.
But other than that  it was routine  you know  wed work every day.
So the Willy Nahman told him  yes  we are here  but the Polish they will not give us the work and so what you are slosher .
Now  I work there until late fall... early fall  excuse me.
And what does it mean to you to be doing this volunteer work?
My father  apparently -- we found out much later when we were working in this area next to the f ence that he was actually selected to work in the gas chambers  in that section where our own men  our own people  our own fathers and sons  were made to pull out the dead from the gas chambers and were made to help with the burning of the bodies.
But I have no -- social services  human kind of work  that kind of stu ff was understood.
Did you work at any time Everything went and thats why I say I lost with the quo during that period of occupations  I lost like  regular education.
Not of course with the persecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared and he always – I remember one of the th ings that he always used to say was  ﬁWell  this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about the Jews  particularly the Jews that had served Germany in the war and so on and so forth  or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesnt believe in all that nonsense and if it do esnt work out  we will leave on the ﬁlast trainﬂ.ﬂ Whatever that ﬁlast trainﬂ meant  we never caught it.
And I have to work  and I was working over there.
I rolled up my sleeves you know  and I was doing the work.
So there are different  cases that happened that people -- it is in the movie  is it about -- there was a group what worked outside the camp  about 10 people  15 people  whatever; and they went out with two Ukrainians to work there.
The building in the ghetto that was des Interview with William Klein October 18  1993 32 Not in the ghetto  outside the ghetto  we didn't work in the ghetto.
Did you get an additional compen sation for doing slave labor work?
For instance  I didnt know  and my colleagues  we didnt know that the Germans are bent to kill all of us.
And I used to go out to work every day  carry those barrels  and so hard work  I thought I gonna  I gonna die.
Koenig shook our hands; General de Gaulle didn't even acknowledge anything that we were doing work for him.
78 And what -- what one of them told me they drag -- they dreaded nothing more than the Sundays when they didnt have to work  what were they supposed to do ?
So -- so I wouldnt say anything at home  I left at six in th e morning  like I will -- would go to work.
Like this day  which was also a a incredible day  it was in 43  and that day I didnt go to work for some reason.
But you have to arrange your papers through the arbeitsdienst \  which was the ghetto Jewish equivalent of work exchange  you know  they were in charge of organizing the 7 proper papers and what have you.
That h-he became very  as I mentioned  very successful  but again I -- with all those document  I have no proof that -- of the fact that he went directly to Liege and work in the mines.
I went right away to work  because my father was working in that factory.
And this was done while the parents while the parents were working  they were away  when they work in the morning  and the children were left there with the grandmothers or with ot her  were  ended with all the children  when they came back  it was  it was unbelievable what happened in that ghetto.
And  the -- then she decided she would stay and get a working permit  which she had  temporary  and she could work -- Away from Denmark?
This lady was busy with social work and God-knowswhat and she liked to ask me to do things for her  to run an errand or to take care of this or that in the office.
And so I felt  we ll  maybe I could work at a doctors office.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 26 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (Rolling cassette) (Camera roll 82  sound roll 48) (20) (Second sticks 20) EL: I'm looking at you yes.
So I start to ask who they are  then they told us [indecipherable] and when I came to her  she said  ﬁWell  my name is Felicia USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 42 Muirashefska.ﬂ And I ask her whose apartment it is  she said  ﬁWell  this is the apartment that we live  but it belong to Meyerader and Krauss ﬂ and I start to ask her more questions  she got annoyed  I got annoyed  and -- and she -- I said  ﬁHow could you have a job l -- wh-what -- do you work here?ﬂ She said  ﬁI work  but thank God I dont work any more  because the Germans left already.ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  what do you mean the Germans left already?
And [indecipherable] respected her work  actually  he liked it very much.
Another part was  were people who are counting the profits; and all those profits  from every day of work the prisoners earned  would be then transferred to the treasury of the SS.
They had an order to take the next day a group of people to Nurnberg to work in an ammunition factory. \
And -- Te-Tell me  Im just curious  how many places did you work?
Oh  I've been back to Poland many times  because I used to work in America for a company who dealt with overseas trading with Poland.
You had to go  pass through  show your ID You go could to work through the gate again into the city.
As I said  there were foreigners from all over Europe and the Gestapo came from time to time together with German officials and asked people whether they want to work voluntarily in Germany and many people see that they can't survive  Poles in particular  Hungarians uh volunteered for work in Germany.
This must me mean that they send them to Auschwitz .
So I went to Hailitzski  and I said to Halitzski  if I can...you see  I could work.
And s -- 82 believe me  you didn't want to be reminded to work harder by them.
Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 91maybe I can help.ﬂ She said  ﬁThats what we were going to ask you too  if you would be willing to.ﬂ And thats what got me started  and -- and that -- that initial piece of work took almost a year  because now  for th e first six months  I would go the museum carrying my portable computer  and get the bo oks  get the microfilm  sit in front of a reader  and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable  I would then transfer them to the computer.
And apparently  there was a prisoner of war camp nearby  and they wanted to bring these prisoners over to talk to me  the Germans.
You see  this is th is another thing that  probably now that y ou ask those question  I think that one of the reason I was persistent to get a medical degree in th work as a doctor  was to give some stability  internal stability that you were somebody that has a purpose  and so on  instead of floating.
And the content of the work  did that have appeal for you?
All I can tell you is that if you couldn't get out to work  the next time they came to shrink the ghetto  you were one of the selected people.
I managed to travel the world in that capacity  managed to do Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9  2009 54world class photography  and it was a very war worthwhile work experience for me.
Well  on behalf of the United States Holocaust Museum  I thank you for your time and for your story.
It was pretty tough because every person in that ghetto had to go to work.
Well  anyway  we came to the factory and we -- the place was prepared for us.
But  we get on a train  and then the man who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to Germany to work but before we do we are going to stop in Pat-o-vich-a   which is a border to wn which by then was Germany.
And it was a -- Yeah  my husband had gone to a school -- unde r the -- after he graduated  he went to school -- to designing school and he took several courses in designing and for work.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us how they did that and where they went.
And I say to him  \ I cannot go back to work.
And I was afraid that they will not allow me to go back.
And how did you take care of that  when you were in the ghetto?
And then they used writers in a very creative wa y. They had writers like me work with  on the team that would drop  drop agents behind the line.
So uh  we were living in our apt and uh I had gotten some advice that I shouldn't go to my  to work.
And uh  at night time when people would come back from work in the dar k  there would be no light on.
to support a wife and two children  ca use that was the custom in those days  the women didnt work.
But not all day long sometimes  but yeah  I di d work also  I worked.
From there we went to Poland and in Poland we done the same identical work for the Germans.
Did you have any connection or cooperation with the Signal Corps units  and with George Stevens unit?)
Now here also is important part of it that Ive seen Jewish people staying next to this place  and t hey I they doing some kind of some k ind of work with this ar with this water well.
Well when was finished as a doctor  then he could work in the hospital you know.
And they took out about twenty in the same day  maybe twenty  twenty young guys  strong young guys they took out on the side and everybody went out to work and we were staying and we didn't know  you know  we thought already it's it's not for the second camp.
When I came out of the Service I went to work for a chemical firm in Philadelphia  Rohm and Haas Company.
317 was left in reserve so that we could our ou-our assignment was to do police work and keep control of the city.
So when I -- when they came  I spoke German fluently.
After you cannot work  you  you become obsolete.ﬂ So in the morning we lined up and we used to get a pishke 10 you know what a ﬁpishkeﬂ is?
Magda had her  her fiance back  took to work  to  in Russian  in Ukraine  Ukraine.
And what else we did  we all got some kind of a -- we didn't make anything warm to drink in the morning but you could buy hot water or coffee  so Grandma was going later to work so she volunteered.
We were working there  shipping there on the wagons  it was all kinds of work to do.
In those days  you could work and actuall y earn your room and board and your tuition  which is what she did.
Instead of sitting and moping around a nd being hungry  there was no work  I would go from contact to contact.
And we used to encounter them when we walked to work.
But I guess a lot of opportunities for people to work in Vilnius became available just before or during the Soviet occupa first Soviet occupation.
>> Bill Benson: While you were there at that slave labor camp  you were involved in an escape attempt.
>> Bill Benson: Until that time was your father able to continue to work and feed your family?
My husband had a tremendous amount of respect for my mother and my mother had very much respect for him because  not only because he tried to work so hard and to establish a life and hav e children and a you know  family life and taking care of me  but just the fact that he was trying to hard in everything and to pleas e her and to please me and to just try to make a good life for all of us  yeah.
And to put in all kinds  to work on a way to transmit this news  small papers.
Uh...I went back to work and we tried to...uh...save up every penny.
What kind of work then  did your father do in The Hague   continued with the construction work?
To me it was much more work to knock than ringing the bell like that.
No matter whats going to happen  they felt so when I graduated from college in art and design with a degree  AP  a few of us were taken to work for the royal house.
And here I was by myself in a camp where you really had to work very hard.
Again  fortunately  my father was out of work  so he coached me all summer  and I was one of the nine who were taken into school  which mattered very little because we were sitting in the back  never addressed by the teachers  never responded if you raised your hand.
But we were the lucky ones Do you because we didnt my my mother didnt go to work with the big s you know  with the [indecipherable] on her back.
Some had to work -- they all had 62 to work  but they try -- you know  they -- I -- I think they all came from reasonably well-to-do circumstances.
Myself and my husband  who likewise are work in Piaski  took a leave of absence at the time  and spent it working on my parents farm.
So we get a few people -- not all the boys know about it  but a few went out to work with -- we could trust them.
I'd love to show you  but I don't think we really have the time  I do have some unbelievable copper work with the designs from the shawa but I don't know if you would have time for that.
Where the -- the people used to go in there to work.
Your mother goes off to work and what did you do?
So the following day  I immediately walked around the streets  where most of the people -- who had everything they needed for the first three  four weeks -- they're hiding  in order not to be captured to be taken to work.
And people used to always slowly work thei r way in closer closer to their lunch  because if you didnt  there was just a si one hour time you had to feed I dont know how many hundreds of people.
What we used to do  when we walked out to work  at night we used to march in and carry food.
Tell me a little bit about your father and his work.
My father was volunteer to -- to work with children  to teach them Hebrew a little.
Um  otherwise we didn't have any traitors because we all were Jews and some were sort of like the German Kapo  he thought he might be a different --------longer  but  uh  that didn't work  everybody had the same  same thing.
We had to work right through the bombing as they were bombing because our guy was a kapo watching us.
And he became we became very good friends  and he tried to take me alwa ys when he was going to work  and I was with him on the cart there  going like this.
The Germans came to the school and took the most part of the class to Berlin for some forced work.
We had no gas chambers around  so either the people were shot or they went to other places to work.
So the same guys that I mentioned before  volunteered to work in the office.
I mean  if you think about the irony of what we build up and -- and work at and its USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 132 just so we die in the end.
The work was hard and miserable but we worked and we came back and we met at night in the ghetto and uh hoping to hear something from our parents because we believed  or at least I believed...I had no reason not to...that they are someplace in the Ukraine.
I was the youngest  and I was the youngest that came out.
Soon after arrival in the United States  he was hired by the US Post Office Department to work on the design of mail sorters and conveyors.
Th e next week  on Wednesday  I want you be here and we assign you in for the work  for the farm working the German  and you got to be here about nine o'clock Wednesday.
I also got in touch with the German archives that we all work with  the greatest archives that existed in Germany  trying to find out about a farmer who took us in and my friend Rafael.
The lookout will hear him  so we wouldnt eat  and we would work very hard when he came.
Were you injured by that to the point where it was hard to work?
Well  we had the maid  and also one of the workers who used to work for us  used to bring us some food and one of the maids that used to take care of us  her name was Naja.
What was daily life like for you once you found yourself with work assignments and things that you were forced to do?
And she -- he took -- he asked Shtevitz  was another famous SS man  to come over  and to check if I am capable to carry on with the work.
I had to work to put cars -- I can't re member what kind of work I did.
Well then we had the prison guards  the Americans  who supervised all of this  who directed the German PW  who were the work cadre.
I said handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting longer and longer and he hung up and he said okay  well work until its finished.
Yes  people were 33 were very there were people who were you know  th-the maybe not now  or maybe some other later  didnt work.
And now   since I am married  if I would work  that would mean that your father is not capable of supporting a family.
One of the other miss -- miss -- Mrs. Biddle of the refugee committee  when I had finished high school  called me in and said you know  your mother is work ing  your father is so ill -- I had applied for college and got into c -- University of London.
But we didnt realize that that the winter comes and over there theres no work.
Inside work details  outside work details and fo r each inmate in charge  there was an SS man who was not a very high  high ranking SS man  just a puppet to .
Uh and the  the So this shows the work shops of the ghetto.
We work in  you know  in the kitchen and I didnt go to school over there.
So my father obtained for me a permit to work  a working card to work outside  and he told me if should ever come the time that we'll be separated and we are not in the same transport to be sent to be gassed  let's jump from the death train  cattle cars.
Up until -- how long did that go on  the work  what you were doing?
Here  I had this -- they were talk -- I heard them talking  the co mmanders talk about their Jews that they had in their -- in their -- in their units  who were giving them trouble in terms of not wanting to work on Saturdays  not wanting to eat the food in the mess hall  wearing a hat which was against army regulations and so on.
So naturally you had no choice what you would like to do for work.
My mother wasn't working this day because they make the come in the nighttime for work.
Then from there   I went to work in the canal every morning  early in the morning  came home late at night.
So you had the Jewish agency doing the techni cal work.
Only the kind of work  like metal resorts  clothes resorts  shoe resorts... I dont even know that we had a comb factory.
Okay  so somebody who would work his land So the youth  this organization  although was formally disbanded by the government  but they still existed  and th ey have they have library  and even [indecipherable] them  because they ask me what kind of book to buy  and they have some eve may even some to corre ct money for thing.
And so when he heard that I was coming he said he would get me a job.
They were in Gurs  which was a work camp in France.
Uh and uh in the youth movement  not only did we do uh uh intellectual work and educational work but certainly uh they developed ties with with friends and I must say that for for...over the years these ties became very...have remained very close  up to toda y. They are not too many people left survive  but some of them I I went to together to Auschw itz and I lost them  but uh especially I must say when I came for the first time on a on a visit to this...to America.
End of Tape One  Side B 39 Beginning Tape Two  Side A This is tape two  side A  Martin Weiss.
A girls price wa s a piece of buttered bread  a womens price on the market was a piece of bread and an onion because was less work.
My father's job was to go out in the summer time  sweep the streets and until the wintertime shovel the snow.
We not -- were not allowed to go nowhere  were in a camp.
It -- it wasnt until a little later that I got interested in the work of the European Court of Human Rights.
They built outside of Buchenwald they built 12 factories  12 holes [indecipherable] each one in each hole they work they they produce something else.
And I start working on the coat  without no knowledge what to do with it  but I start working  and I stretched the work it should take a little longer.
So my work was primarily centered in Marseilles  I lived at the Hotel Terminus  and then wed travel regularly to different camps.
Monsieur Libare had been called to go to work to Germany  because they were losing on the Russian front at the time  and they called -- were talking Gentiles  Catholic where I was  to go to work the factories.
Everybody had to do something else work  and we were by the commanded appointed to do all kind of...I was...I was appointed to be the main...the editor  the director of the printing business all 16 over  not on the front  for Vilna  for Lithuania  all the Baltic  all the printers and they entrusted all the...like a union all the printers the Baltic I was appointed.
And we had a lawyer in legal services in Lexington  Tony Martin  who focused on energy work  and basically demonstrated that there was no need for the power plant  that all it was going to do was increase everybodys power bill.
Here's these women  and they speak Russian  and they speak Polish.ﬂ And they said  ﬁWe're going to be coming back in two days  you're going to work for us.ﬂ Meanwhile  the word got around they were raping the women.
From there I was I was told that I have ki if I cannot go to work  some of the prisoners told me  if I go on a pa role call  to stand straight  because theyre theyre expecting a couple da ys later  that one of the days theyre expecting a health inspector.
They created an office where you had to report in the morning.
Those who are up to work  they take them to work.
That was the smallest possible underground unit  platsuski  which consisted usually of one or two platoons of the local peasant  local soldiers  who would train on weekends when they didn't work in the fields.
And my f -- my grandf ather couldnt work  he was too old  or it wasnt possible.
I had to run the next block and I was afraid  9:30 I had to be at work.
I tell him  I...he will not work here in the hospital. \
No  no gas chambers  they knew they lead to Poland and that they they they thought that we would have gone to Germany   we probably wo uld work.
Some of the -- yeah  my father came in 46  because in 46 was the first time we had Passover in our house  and the soldiers which work with my -- they -- they were officers  you know  were in the same thing with my husband.
From the end of March to October 13th  I was not...I had been interned away from Budapest in the countryside...I continued my work.
They managed to s till work  they had diarrhea  they were working and shitting  working and shitting.
I want to go back to Poland right after when I mentioned it because I was barely one year over.
And I did some work  whatever it was to do in the kitchen or whatever.
The person that sponsored us   my parents  couldnt  did not find any work for me  so that I had to be younger in order to qualify to enter as a child.
So  and then we had I should say  when I st arted to work -- I was 13 years old when I started to work.
I had the fortunate time to work a little bit in a kitchen  and I sometimes took a piece of horse meat after it was cooked  and took it home to my parents and said  Here's a piece of meat.
My health was good  and a lot of them helped me that they went out from the ghetto to work for a farm.
So she does pretty much the work of a social worker or a psychologist  a mother.
There was a lot of work to do in Italy because people were coming into Italy to try and go either to Palestine or to register with a consulate  if an American consulate was open  to join family in the United States or to leave Europe one thing people wanted to do was to leave Europe at this time.
Once I finished this furniture business  then I went back to work to this building factory.
Did you talk about your situation with the other Jewish children?
And I was -- I-I left in hospital  because sick people and people who work in hospital stay  the other people who can walk  go for march.
Now naturally  if you are a poor 84 farmer and you work from four oclock in the morni ng til late at night  and ri -- next door your Jewish tailor is doing a good business sewing and this and that and he doesnt have to get up and milk his cows and maybe that brought some kind of a jealousy?
They wanted representatives of ethnic communities to kind of dialog and and work together on racial problems of the city.
But my mother dressed me every morning  took me out to this Zahlappell 6 which is the equivalent of roll call and dragged me to work so that I wouldn't be beaten or sent into the hospital the barracks which was  which was really a death barracks.
But when the Germans were gone  then -- then things were different.
And they still selected people by coincidence -- I mean  to work.
But they certainly werent paid  you know  to take care of me.
And we went out in the morning and came at night.
speaks foreign language here] Polish  because I... [speaks foreign language here] I: It was very hard work and I  I felt very weak  so I decided not to go back to work and trying to hide somewhere. [
I was working next to a German woman one side and next to a German man on th e other side so there was no way to sabotaging work.
N -- it was brutal  they were -- th-th -- you know  beating us  forcing us to work  and in some ca -- not in some  in many of cases  they made fun  you know  of us  and we had to -- they gave us toothbrushes to clean -- to clean a sidewalk  you know  and things like this.
My mother kept ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 me home that day  and I wasn't allowed to go to work  but physically I wasn't harmed.
And she to ld the director of this place that I am a half Jew  it should be a little bit easier for him  and -- and that I -- and he gave me work  I was working like a -- like -- no  like a sanitarka  you know  I -- w-washing and -- and feeding the children and so on.
I've been to the one in Richmond because my son does a lot of work with them  but we'll probably give it a shot.
And I knew we would go back to work on the Klan case  probably  and that there would be an opportunity for her to come down.
Like where the best part of my work was when there was something wrong with the assembly line and the machine stopped.
Now  with the small sickness they sent back the people to Stutthof because they n eeded another people who was able to work .
Not -- I dont mean free the money  you have to work for ev -- everywhere for -- to make the money.
My   Herman Taube  on behalf of my wife and myself  I want you to continue that holy work of keeping the memory of our people should never be forgotten. (
I would say  you know  if your father came -- did he come home for lunch from work  or did he come home from work for dinner only ?
You had been telling me about five years of freelance work after 10 years working with CBS.
What happened with his group  they were supposed to go to   too  his group  but to work for the Germans.
And after  I told to me  oh  you cannot thinking in this way  you have to be quiet and only you can work for the future.
And I think about it  I have the greatest admiration for my father  who somehow managed to get a factory back to work  and make some money.
Because we didn't know whether these guys were put to work let's say in the \ mines\  in Mauthausen.
And I went to work at six oclock in the evening.
Instead I liked to handle cases and people and work fast and what not which is not anything to do.
One was a little ghetto  and one was the big ghetto.
Well  my parents couldnt leave with a child in a cast  that doesnt work.
If you want to live here in any way and get work  you have to learn the language - Yiddish and Polish.
Actually I was in the first transport to leave Hungary to Auschwitz  and  uh  day and night they were bringing in people and even the gas chambers couldn't work fast enough for it  so they had to make room.
So once  it was maybe a week or two after I started to work there  the gabrininia  th e nurse  the -- the main nurse  she came  asked me  who are you  where are you from   who are your parents?
Uh  but--------------  every time you saw somebody else got punished and got hit  and we have to look all the time when they give 45 whips or uh  the  all the time we had to look that th ey did things like that  and I think that we didn't get insane  it was because we had each other  Chaim and I. We were always together  we try  not when we work most of the time  in daytime when we had to go in the woods  but then I was worry if I was here.
So the girl's documents were such that she could go out on work details.
01:09:01 You go -- the whole group goes to a farm and we work on the farm  preparing to go to Israel.
And finally we decided Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 135there was some something go on that she didn't like it  you know  to live where a place where the work is  you k now?
After Apr il 1st  1933  certain uh laws were promulgated whereby doctors and   uh Jewish doctors  Jewish doctors  lost their license  with the exception of those who had served as veterans in World War I  and since my father was uh uh...had seen action in World War I in France and in Russia  I was entitled to continue uh with my studies  but as I say I did...came to the conc lusion that uh this would not guarantee me a future  not in Germany  so then in uh in uh Apri l-May I I stopped with my studies and I uh got...I was volunteering in in some kind of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth movement  the work done...especially the social wo rk being done was always connected with the Jewish community.
They kept me in the hospital about te n days and after I got out of the hospital they put me right to work.
They were going to  to a factory that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of  of the family's who had a factory of  of electric chandeliers  and the Germans took it ove r  and I think that they kept him as a manager or something  or as a foreman  and groups were coming in to work.
They used to beat you up every time you you you had to to work  I mean without almost without food  but constantly  and under supervision  and within the cold weather  t hey they used to put a a some a a side fire in our work.
And I  at that time  had been befriended by -- this was much later in my experience there  Id been befriended by somebody from the Jewish Br igade  and I did quite a lot of work with him in Kownitz camp.
Because he still couldnt get a permit to stay in New York state and get a license and he really wanted to get a license in New York state because he already had a lot of doctors that wanted him to work with them.
My parents survived in Berlin and what happened my father was used -- no my mother originally had to work in a factory making uniforms.
Everybody was jumping through the...through the windows and through the doors to be the first to register to go to 6 work  you know.
What kind of work were you doi ng in the railroad machine shop?
Between June and August  we all got paid for our work.
And one question is  how do you feel about the role of the Holocaust Museum?
Then you had to get into fields that go up like this where the people who work in those fields are attached by cords to work in the fields  you know  with a sickle.

The elsewhere  if it works  it will work elsewhere the same way.
He was not a member of the Judenrat  but rather than to have the soldiers come ev ery morning and catch people in the street  whoever was available and most of the peopl e who were caught in the street where not even fit for the work that they wanted them to do.
And I cried myself to sleep because of the hard work.
I think  you had to be anesth esized or youre not going to work for the procedure.
So the villagers in Krupa  their reason to sign the petition is that they didnt want to do the work that needed to be done  and it was to let your father go so he could do it.

Mrs. Haas  can you talk a little bit more about what was going on with your sister at Siemens  the kind of work sh e was doing what you talked about what her condition was at the time.
And we were to be the -- and I don't have to tell you building roads  it's heavy work and here you were working with people who hardly got enough food to sustain themselves.
So it started to work the communist propaganda and it just ever ybody to believe that it was only the Russian and Russian and Russian and from excuse me  from this time out it was all thing everything what the American did what everything wrong  and everything they wanted to to take away everything from Czechoslovakia   from the factories and everything  becaus e so  it wa the sta the Russians started the Russian and the communist government started to br-brainwash the people in the Czechoslovakia  and most of the people believed them.
We -- we didnt really have -- there were some pr -- rooms didnt even have 64 beds  so we got thre -- three tier bunkbeds  and my father did a lot of work to make it more livable for us.

How did -- how -- did your moth er also then go out to work after 1941?

So what they did is they orga nized their crews so that about two-thirds did the work and one-third were released to given ex-extended leave to go into eastern Europe to either visit the s village or city where they came from  and to help Jews to organize  in order to get to the American zone  because th-there was no future for Jews in eastern Europe .
I dont remember this  and then we had a wonderful Jewish couple  German Jewish couple who were work ing there too  and he and his wife were the elders of this kasernierung Steinhart  Ed ith Steinhart.
Marcels wife speaks fluent French  was work ing for a big advertising -- not advertising firm  people who deal with money  and making up taxes for a big firm [indecipherable]  I forgot the name.
And the net and the next day we were called to line up  and we lined up  and our group went to work into a ammunition factory  where the air was impossible to breathe because of the chemicals.
And he was a very strong man and very grateful that they saved his life and he volunteered to work.
We saw in the newspaper that London was in flames  especially the lower east end where I used to work.
Now  you say that people knew about the gas chambers -- about the gassing.
So  I reme mber he had a job with the same company that he was representing before  but here  too  he had to be channeled into a different aspect of the operation of the lumber company  and there was only part-time work for him.
My work on this was physically located  if you will  in the old torpedo factory in Alexandria .
So that was going on for day after day you know and then they start taking men you know to the camps.
He used to come home exhausted  even when he was much younger  and go to sleep and get up at six o'clock in the morning or five o'clock in the morning and go back to work.
But what their work was exactly its hard for me to know.
but sometimes he ask for help when we have more work.
So  for a little while we had the illusion that they were taking people to go to work.
The prisoners had to build their own furnaces and do all kinds of other work.
And did you and so did you work in Auschwitz itself?
And uh how we managed to uh to sleep without a mattress or whatever  it's beyond me and uh working uh to uh outside when uh being taken to work in the winter time in these harsh uh uh winter 9 days in Poland with uh inadequate clothing and not having uh a coat and pneumonia the first time around uh it's beyond me.
The minute you got sick a little bit  you were taken out  and we alot of times when we went out to work and maybe 2 000 people  and the men says I only want 1 800 back and by the time we got back  we had trucks behind us that they killed off the rest of them.
The younger one  and what he liked  that he can  that they can work  were placed there to one side.
02:29:01 Before we get on the transport  even though you brought us there  let's go back a little to the situation and how it changes in Berlin with respect to your being brought to some assembly place and selections are being done so some people are chosen to leave and then you keep going back to work.
And uh  I asked General Rolf  and he send my request  they rounded up all the Jewish soldiers in the division who could speak Yiddish or German  to report to be attached to my battalion to work in the camp to assist the uh  UNRHA and the AJDC team.
And so that's how the work contin ued in France for the refugees and kept on that way  I guess  in 1944  when our Paris office was reope ned  when Paris was liberated.
IS: No  I think my parents and mainly we depended very much on this Carl Natkin who was a bit of a wheeler dealer and he  he brought in the food and  and arranged that both my uncle and my father were on work details which were  I don't know if they were in better or worse but they certainly was involved in that.
But I did work at Harvard on international organizations I was particularly interest ed in.
So you cannot imagine what a work  what we would if you if you would know that it takes so long  we wouldnt do it.
He couldn't speak the language  but he wasn't going 08:11 to be a burden to anybody or stay home either  so they got him a job and his first job was cleaning bathrooms in a service station and then he greased cars  before he went to work for my uncle.

A. The   the SS took the prisoners over to work for the war industry and there was obligations to the company  to the civi lian company and there was also sick people that 23 was already sent to work.
I work in this museum as a volunteer because I think it is very important that people understand how this Holocaust happened and th at it didn't have to happen; that it only happened because nations and people stood by when this injustice occurred and didn't do anything.
So when the bombing started my mother -- my father was already dead  my mother knew this guy at the farm [indecipherable] used to do work for.
We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp.
And we were there till about one oclock in the afternoon because the work wasnt too far from the -- from the working -- the camp wasnt too far from the working place.
What they meant by this of course was went to concentration camp.
I mean  how -- how do you get food  how does -- No  I didnt work any more.
So we had to right away go to work  and because his earnings werent enough  I had to go sometimes and help out.
Three times I applied  and they didnt let me give  so I decided  hey  nobodys going to hold me back  and -- and later  when I come back they arrest me  but the colonel comes  and releases me within -- and wants to put my commanding officer there in -- in my place in jail  because he says  ﬁHe was legitimately that he three times asked you  and you answer -- why didnt you let him go?ﬂ He says to him  ﬁI did not have anybody to replace his work  he was doing the work for three people.ﬂ So he says  ﬁWhat did you do on those days that he was not here?
They had certain bunks and so we  the the escorts started to work in the lounge in order to pre...prepare for the next morning because we wanted to be as helpful as possible to the immigration authorities not to have any hitchup.
Nobody was tattooed except at Auschwitz and only if they went to work.

And so I [ went to work on a railway building camp.
They told the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us they took them to a forest outside the city and they were shot.
The same thing until ‚42  we got the job  my aunt got the job in Kabelwerk work and we marched from the ghetto to Kabelwerk every morning  itsŠwas a cable factory  and there were different departments there.
03:41:00 Because they were taking people for work to Ge rmany  so with people with children can go out.
You see  they took care on us  they gave us whate throwing chocolate and candies and cigarettes  you know.
It says here  Jews at work in a factory at the Loch-g ator .
Wherever you work we go...go be...they put...they say this group goes with them workers  you know...when when you be brought into groups like  you know.
Was this very tiring work for you  or because you were eating more  were you less tired than you might have been?

I had to look for work; I had a small ch ild  I couldn't go to work  so just my husband had to go  to work  find work and that wasn't easy.
And I mean I knew some other people from the but what we did was  you know we didnt go to work so you spent the whole day in that house.
And then after you come from the work here on the roll call square  they count you again and son of a gun...you know  every day somebody was missing.
Did you hide him during the day  when you guys went off to work; or was this when you weren't going to work?
Then I was taken to an   that's one of those guards in charge  and I met the first couple  and I was told which barrack I would go to and you will be part of a commando  you'll do outside work and really there were many satellite camps all around because of all kinds of companies had established factories so prisoners would work  and concentration camps made money with the prisoners  the prisoners weren't paid  but the companies paid the concentration camps  so they had an income.
So I  when I finished with my work  with one shift of that  I went to the shirt manufacturing department and folded them.
Because people who went to work outside  they somehow got in touch with Polish people.
They were people simply that came from the Krakow Plas zow ghetto and were no longer the same people that were working with me in the enamel work s at Oskar Schindler in Krakow.
I did not k now after months I for the firs t time came out...out of the ghetto to work in such a battalion.
>> Bill Benson: That's all part of this remarkable volunteer work that you do in many places.
Um  I was working night shift that day  so I was home in the morning uh with--with that little--with--with--with that little boy  my nephew and my parents had gone to work and the night before again they had doubled or tripled the guard around the ghetto  so we knew some- thing was--was--was something was coming up but we didn't know quite know what.
I worked in the kitchen  which I couldn't work too much because I was so seasick for a few days but then I felt better and I went to work.

My father went back to the farm area with the old farmer.
Make you work for me and we pay you with the bed and food you're going to have.
Where they which camp they went to  Buchenwald or Auschwitz  wherever they or in some cases they were if they were young enough  they go back to Germany and they put them under work camps.
Because I was in a in a camp when when the war started and the Germans took over.
And they looked for work for us  or we had to uh  cut down trees  and uh  and we had to bring them uh  uh he avy tree from one place to the other.
So  in Belgium  I really didn't have a job for work and there was that store where they sold blankets and suits from the military  the American  it wa s very heavy beds  hard job.
And some over 16 as well  because you could just work around that a little bit.
They had to work  the ones that were able and the ones who died  died of either torture  malnutrition  sickness due to the malnutrition like we ha d dysentery  typhoid  and so on.
The daughter of the owner find us a nice apartment with two bedrooms; and we stay in the same apartment and went to work.
You just had to work and be on your toes that they wouldn't catch you like they would say  slacking off.
So they took me to Ellis Island  and next day I had the right to 19 call somebody so naturally  I called my brother and he got in touch with a gentleman who was doing this kind of work  putting up bails for people like me whom they took to Ellis Island  you know  as a student.
That was his first jo b. And his second job when we were married  he work ed for the  the as a translator since he knew English and Russian and French  so .
We had to work in an old age home  myself  with elder people.

And he worked both as a carpenter - he knew how to work with wood  he owned a lumber yard  and he also was very handy  actually more than handy.
And then in that one ye ar of schooling that was either kindergarten or first grade  I don't know which one  and th ey -- they used to come over and bring me school work.
This was not a concentration camp  this was a work camp.
And aside from the work ethic  I can't think of much.
Then the wagons start and they said that they will take us to north Hungary in the puszta [the Hungarian prairie] to work in ...on the farms.
You know  but we couldn't  but we didn't eat because we didn't want to eat everything in one time.
I mean we -- I t hought I would end up in Palestine one day  but -- in Israel  but it didnt work out that way.
I have to start to work in store and my father wasn't good for th is.
She was working in - with my younger sister - in... Sh e knew German  so she work in office over there - a Jewish community center.
So the Wehrmacht  an officer came down  and he asked people to go to work  you know  and we figured going to work  its going to be the best thing.
But I -- I was so grat eful to him that he -- you know  most husband didnt like their wives to work or make money  right?
My uncle was very  very strong and he felt its better if I continue to help support  go to work  and if I wanted to take night courses  which I did for awhile  I could  but he was -- there was no encouragement  and -- Mm-hm.
And other interesting thing I guess  now talking with you it's in my mind  a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the land  and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some land or farm  two  three  four  five miles from the cities  they come everyday in the city to market.
And in fi -- 59 I -- 1960 I started to work in the school  h-high school  as a teacher.
After the war  still could not work ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 in France.
And due to this family connection  my mother started to do a little work over over there  mostly started to kind of a a how should I put it?
While these people complained about the military and they didnt want to work  I did my duty and I was proud of it.
And in the meantime  I had become a Social Worker  and I was working as a Social Worker  and -- which was -- I -- I -- I loved my work  and -- but I didnt have the same background as they had  although  you know  I was very well integrated in my  you know  professional community  of where I work ed  at work  you know  there was -- I -- I -- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there.
25A was right next to the kitchen  the camp kitchen  and at that time there was a small yard in front of the kitchen  and one day and it was in the morning  you know  when all the commanders went to work and only on the blocks were the block elder and the people in the rooms you know and the clerk  and we saw through the window  because it was on the second  yes the second floor  we were on the second floor  that the SS brought out tables  and there were some papers on it.
There were many people who were well to do in the ghetto.
You were a student during the day  and you were work -- I-Im sorry  you were working during the day and you were a stude nt at night.
And he said  \ You came...you came here and...and we'll put you to work  and work is good for you.
So  your mother  even though she got a certificate that she was ill and couldnt work  was nevertheless called to be interrogated Oh yes.
But the work in Charity Hospital   you have to belong to the medical school  y ou know  its one of those things.
That they work hard and theyre trying to raise you in a very ethical way  very religious way.
And I did  I in my opinion and others I did good work.
Then we began to work a little bit with my uh   uh to wri...to wri... To erase?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 15 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: B Probably the next day.
Interview with Eli Dortort August 3  2005 39 And what kind of work did you do in New York ?
I   working when you work with people in the reference and I knew exactly how they would feel when they saw the names of their loved ones.
55 Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work  after returning from Europe  in New York?
You are surrounded and you are in in in in in a uh in a very bad situation  let's say...and uh the   we called always to be on the alert  to tell us  to signal us whatever they know in their dwellings or in their working pl aces  what they have heard and what they know  to bring us the news  so we used to concentrate after the day of work when they used to come back from the works from the pl aces  they used to to report to us on what they have heard that day.
They would call a -- they would close the camp up completely  nobody can go in to work  and out of -- out to work or anything.
So we found somebody el se here in Boston  who were very nice  and then what I was -- e-every evening I came ho me after work and cried.
In each and every poem  there is also a poem that describes...this is called advertising and it describes how the young girls work very hard to earn their meager portion of...of the bread and water that they are getting.
And that's what I chose to do because I work with families for 19 years in the county  and that has had a lot to do with it.
So  the whole picture came -- began to look like a two year long apprenticeship  with half a day of practical work in a textile factory and half a day of classroom work.
After eighteen months service  I started to work as a commercial traveller [ NB: a salesman]  which I did 'til uh 1942--with certain interruptions  because I was representing the firma...the company AGFA  photo company.
Instead  for some strange reason that the Germans had  they decided to evacuate the camp and forced us out.
They had working permits to work and live free in Riga in Poland  you know  and after the war ver -- after the war started  and nobody knew what happened  these people just Interview with Jack Bass October 17  2003 69disappeared.
Did -- Did you want to stay there  since that was home?
And on the first day  when we went to work  the man in charge of Holzmann  his name was Gr.
I dont know if theyll be successful or not  but with us  they didnt even let that ship of 900 Jewish -- German Jews  le -- they -- they wouldnt let into this country.
>> Harry Markowicz: As I said  it was in the summer of '42 that the Jews are rounding up whole 16 ROUGH DRAFT COPY NOT A VERBATIM RECORD families  everybody  not just young able -bodied men who could work  all people  babies  sick people  anyone who is Jewish.
And so in the morning when they opened  when we supposed to go to war  the guard took position in those spaces where they supposed to be  and they opened the gates  and we walked to [indecipherable] the holes where we work.
I really never worked in the Museum as such; but I did lot of work over there and a lot of paintings that are still there  because it was a meeting place uh for many artists.
That's why they're going to work for the German government as tailors an d furriers.
So if you didn't go to work  you get one soup less.
They work on a farm.ﬂ So I knew the family is dead.
We re they also doing this similar kind of work  as you?
So in the morning we didnt go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before.
I believe I was registered the first day I came in  because  you know  the Germans are accurate with their registrations and their book work.
But what they had done  they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners had taken some wire  some electric wire and us ed them as belts on their pants because we didn't have any belts.
Very many people died  not just from the conditions and work  but also from typhus.
Is it to work  or is or is it in in a gold mine  not a coal mine  so he says  whatever.
It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation.
We need people like you.ﬂ They almost forced me to go to work and I was worki ng in the factory Vulcan (522) in Israel.
As we walked by uh to go to the assembly area and then moved over to the new--uh to--uh the major part of the ghetto; main part of the ghetto.
And when I got there  well  we ha d to work in the concentration camp.
But by -- I would say by -- probably by mid-December  most of the -- most of the Jews were -- there were still 38 some Jews left outside by papers  who had connec tions as it were  with the Judenrat or were specially singled out by the Germans as desirable to -- you know  to -- for want some work to be done  or -- or special work to be done and so forth.
So  the warm sweaters and the coats that we left with them because  once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto  we met with Polish people at work  and if we knew people who were willing to take a message to them  they have seen to it that something was sent to us  even in this slave labor camp in Starachowice  even after th e ghetto  you know.
And can you tell me  what did your father do  what was his job  what was his profession?
And this was the work we are going to do and we work the whole day.
And mostly young people  because they never chose elderly  because they didnt  they only needed you to work.
My mother  like most of the women in the middle class  around a hundred middle class families  didnt work.
And that was in the top of the agenda  to find out if hes alive  because we know he he could survive because he was strong fellow and so the thing is this  we find some other people who came in in town  and they told us we should not expect the father  because he had he was in Theresienstadt for specialty reason and they bombed the camp  and he was working there as a veteran doctor with a frie nd of his  and he didnt go to work that day  he was taking care of the German horses  and the allies bombed the camp  and destroyed the camp  and they killed them  the f-f the first day of Chol HaMoed Pesach  and thats when we keep the Yahrzeit because we know exactly when he got killed.
And they know  they -- you know  they knew -- you know  Im Jew -- a Jew -- I probably know -- I was in the ghetto  probably if I know who was a policeman  who was this -- who was -- who was a collaborator.
Because they all work hard and they are terrif ic people.
He came into the house  asked me  \ How come you're not at work?\
People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to 8 actual work.
And he is the author not only of great works and the reinterpretation of Kant  but also of religious philosophy  of work in religious philosophy  based on the sources of Judaism  \ die Religion der Vernunft.\
Matter of fact  when I [indecipherable] And you -- did you go to work for them?
So  you know  it took days  when we were sitting down for dinner or for breakfast or something like this  you know  and we memorized it  you know  wh-when -- last time I had breakfast in -- in this and this camp  you know  and it was like this  it was like that  you know  and then we had to go to work outside  in March and it was raining and it was snowing  it was cold  it was freezing.
So  we would really study later on in the afternoon when they came back from work.
It didnt work with the machine gun  so I took the springs and I used to heat it up in the fire flame and wrap it in oil to temper it.
The women didn't work on that Saturday or Sunday or Saturday  and he went to work  and that man  that Lajzer ...came and that partisans  a lot of partisans  walked into that group to go into the ghetto.
And the two doctors got away from work -- from here -- there.\
He would cut open the boil  clean it and then all he had is like toilet paper  would wrap it up  and then you you just make first move and it breaks and falls off on you  and you go into such a dirty work with open wounds...we all had a lot of wounds because of lack of vitamins.
But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually works for me in a volunteer  one of his volunteer activities  got the GE volunteer award of the year  he and his wife  jointly  this past year.
448 After building the spur around Krakow  we  as a group of people forced to work were moved to Skarzysko-Kamienne.
And my husb and  especially  I think in a professional way  has brought the plight of the refugees to students  involved students in the work thats necessary to save these people around the world.
It's Sanson they gave us a break to do some maintenance on the tanks  and I shouldn't use that word \ break \  because we had to work awfully hard.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 13 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (rolling) (Camera roll 80  sound roll 46) (Take 18) EL: Yes  a very important movement in my creative work in the ghetto began when after Mr. Tory had talked to me and he introduced me to Professor Hy Nachman Shapiro who was in charge of the education of the  the art of the ghetto.
When ones husband -- when your neighbors husband is laid off from work  its a recession  but when the husband from this hous e is laid off  then its a depression.
There was no distribution of work or nothing  but it was like living in a big open place and no where to escape.
Now the interesting thing it was  that for me to work outdoors  shoveling things  it's very difficult  I'm not physically strong.
It was hard work  but it was not without some humor.
But she really wasn't  you see  that was the point  the only place where she didn't have the independence was financial because she told not to work for pay.
The child wa s locked up while the parents went to work in the daytime.
I work over ther e by a couple of years until I learned the trade  then I went for myself.
Well  on behalf of the United States Holocaust Museum  I thank you for your time and for your story.
Because right away  they picked out...you know  if they see you weak  you couldn't work.
Oh boy  this was a I told you  this was me my first wife  I told you that we we we have sh-she she got this she got this possibilities to to t-to to work more in her department  you know  and s in Israel at that time  psychiatry was not such a high level  you know.
Im gonna work on the same project with you guys Š and Im gonna be [? ]
And I was --in Lager I was going out to work --we still could buy something outside because Polish people were coming and selling on the black market.
We didnt go to work this day  and my mother and my sister and my nephew  they was at the quarters someplace in one house and my wife and myself were living  if you can call living  in a two story dilapidated building.
And can you tell me  what did your father do  what was his job  what was his profession?
I mean  like on Purim and some of these holidays  he'd work and what -have-you.
12 Did you go to that store also and work  sometimes?
The others went to work and we were kept there  and we found out why they wanted us.
I was going from camp to camp because they had these places  these displaced persons camps.
INTERRUPTION - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE I realize with all the work you did that there was no typical day  but can you describe what it was like  for instance  in the mornings and the evenings?
But at that time  we had to do a lot of things. (
You keep pushing wagons  and back and forth  and doing a lot of unnecessary digging and work.
How did you come to talk about it for the Holocaust Memorial Museum?
For one thing uh Jews could not work in the public life.
Then the other side  they lined us up; they lined us up.
Sf -- finishing -- first it was finishing work  which now doesnt exist  finishing  the machine finish it.
And -- and agai n  an odd coincidence that in 19 -- between 1935 and 1938  my father did not work with his partners at this location  but around a tannery  in a -- a rented tannery in Erda Parbenietska  wh ich is oh  somewhere in this direction.
So this man put us to young people what he send to work.
When I was assigned to work on the case of Baldur von Schirach  the Youth...Youth Leader  another attorney and some other and some of his people helping him  Major Hartley Murray had developed considerable amount of materials on the Hitler Youth and on Baldur von 12Major William F. Walsh  Assistant Trial Counsel  U.S.A. Information supplied by interviewee.
And um as we were struggling to survive  one day I came home from work and the people downstairs told us that we have to get out.
>> Patricia Heberer -Rice: And so did you get to one of those labor camps?
So I would like to thank you for coming  and doing this.
I went to one work camp  they went to another work camp.
Even the nurses from the school were take n out of the ghetto for work to the hospital  18 even to the German hospital.
So  my father  due to the fact that he was very familiar with figures and very familiar with the German language was asked by the Judenrat to supervise the working groups that were comi ng daily to work.
And what would happen to them if the Germans ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 32 had known?
I was walking very close to the university where I wasnt allowed to work  but I was walking.
For his work there he got the Congressional Medal of Honor  but he didn't live to see it because he died in Normandy of a heart attack ab out five or six weeks after the landing.
So whenever we saw him we did not go to work  because normally people -- other workers were coming  looking for people to work  9 taking to work  doing either construction work  or cleaning  or whatever  and in the evening coming back at home  you know.
So my husband came  and the doctor  and he had a -- a -- he was working  they -- a -- occupied him to be the main person to see to people that got wounded during the work  and so on.
Not only did Father Bruno hide me but Father Bruno--after liberation I was working in a soap factory to help my mother feed my two sisters-- came to visit and when he found out that I was work ing instead of going to school  asked me if I wanted to go to school .
And when the Germans came in Vilnius  the regu lation that no Jew is allowed to work for a government office came not immediately.
But in the -- did you work in the coal mines?
But we had th e room  but that didnt work out too good  and then something opened up that we were able to move into a house.
But we always was talking and never did real  some real work.
That was  yes they paid me more cause I needed money but very few people would have done what I did.
Mm-hm  and but he co vered for you for the few da ys that you couldnt work?
So  I went to work for my father in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work.
And when he was gone  the Czech guy told me that the Russians  du ring the interrogation  told him that they have evidence that he was not forcibly deported  but that he volunteered to work for the Germans.
Uh  after a short period of time  uh  part of us they sent to work in the garden...in the gardening.
He was trying everything  he was extrem ely energetic  and and he was even smuggling when the factory was when the ghetto was closed  to supervise the work  which it was there When when did his factory close down?
I told you in short and you'll work it out somehow  you'll stretch it out  I think you know plenty  now.
And then they took them to work where the army was standing there -like the army standing there.
I have work for a once in a while I have a little work.
I was signed in the books where I work and my name was right there.
So Have you gotten any special insights because of your work here?
It was not pleasant  it was very -- it was very  very difficult.
And to me it was clear that this would go to work.
My father  on the other hand  as I said remained in Auschwitz.
>> Bill Benson: Where did you go and what did you do?
I wasnt going to work  as I told you  and he never asked me.
Those people used to work in the cremat oriums  theyre Jewish people.
He went  he never had this  he never worked on this work what he went on  construction.
When you got there  did they put yo ur mother and your sister to work?
And as a -- at a certain point do you get a particular specialty that you work on more than others  or you keep working at each of these stations?
I seen him once more because in the...in the labor camps...so-called labor camps  because and that's the exact translation  is labor and tava is a camp  so it was a labor camp  where they did...I don't know what work.
Not myself  but I work for somebody who was in charge she used to have a show each week  Judy Garland in CBS.
Uh  which I did; and uh the paper on which I was working was very primitive uh war kind of a paper  which the ink spread on it and it just didn't work out.
In Auschwitz they still had contact together  but that was the end.
Til one day  one of the fellows came to me and told me  \ When you are coming tomorrow morning to work  you are not going home.ﬂ So naturally I didn't came.
Because those sadists would just make a toy out of her  because she was so clumsy probably in this work what she has to do there.
And we started to work in this ammunition factory  but naturally we  were starving.
And then we had to go and perform various sort of work in order to maintain the sustaining a living.
And then I -- Can you tell me about your work?
So I would get home from work about 6:30 in the evening and my mother would have dinner already because where she worked in this nursing home and hospital  she would start at 7 o'clock so she would get home about...uh...3:30  4 o'clock.
He can find everything and always  and I kept his records to such a point that he knew right away  like  he was happy with my work.
In fact  12 - 13 or 15 hours a day that I u-used to work brought me to exhaustion and the doctors wo uld send me to Jerusalem for 10 - 15 days of R and R. And those days I would visit the univer sity  which was then at [indecipherable] a big Catholic school that was changed -- was given to the university for beginners and just visitor -- visiting students.
Women you work ed with back then  and their families  and moneys tight and how you make it and dont make it  and so you have an appreciation for that.
Okay  all right  let me... I: Opposite the camp office  so it was very and he was an electrician  so under the pretense that he need  that we need some electrical work  he could go in and out  yeah?
Right  but when people go out to work  they we nt to different places in the camp so they could then tell people in other places  yes?
I could nearly talk to them  I felt it was so  but I felt that day I remember  gee  the Americans are coming  or the British  or whoever it was  but I wont live to see them  I was so sick of work  I was so tired of work.
The people in Ghetto were either assigned to work camps--Arbeitslager--which were subservient to Kaiserwald.
I went to a factory  and the factory took me right away to the place.
Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th  2016 96 So Important things.
And do you think that he might have been involved in underground work?
There was just work  go to work  get up in the morning  come back from work and try to figure out how to do the best from which you've got  to prepare a meal so that you will not be hungry for the next day.
One of the instances happened when all the men of our family were away on the work details and my mother was  that particular day  off and my grandparents  my grandmothe r was taking care of me when the German guards came in and surrounded a quadrant of the ghetto  and took us out for another selection.
I taught Russian and Ge rman there for two years  and then I work for Niyana.
It was a women's camp  but we had men in the beginning  then women guards  women  S.S. women started coming in and they also marched with us to work  watched us and like I said before  they were more vicious  some of them  than the men.
Our work consisted of just watching them prepare the food and eat.
I remember my mother went to work in one of the New York sweat shops as a sewing machine operator  and where one of my aunts worked  and she that wa s her first job.
And even as employees  you know  many of them  they try harder  they have to wo rk harder  they had to work  first of all  by starting with -- with nothing  you had to work hard to get up the ladder a little  you know  and its very hard to make a living.
People  you know  the Jews were not allowed to walk on sidewalks.
But we were -- well  we had to be sort of split up because my older sister was sent to London  and she went to work.
>> Bill Benson: While you were in the displaced persons camp  several things happened.
And since then I change  and I went to the [indecipherable] where I work with the arms all the time.
They keep them inside  and then when they recove r  they send them to the work camps  so lot of them  they was in the line with me  they got [indecipherable] you know  stiff legs and the hands.
They pay me for each thing and I got people from Spain  Spanish people and I go t Moroccan people  theyre [indecipherable] in French there  then I work  manufacture there.
Thats all pension  because I didnt work enough there  only a year.
The only person Gentile there was the supervisor who saw that we were get to work.
Did you do any work in that week  or No  Dachau was only  we were in this barrack  only few si-sis you know  few days and from Dachau were sent for work to first was Augsburg .
And  uh  we worked there and one day  of course  uh while we go back from work we had to watch hangings before supper.
It's interesting  the architect  the reason why he made the glass dome was because when he interviewed survivors  they were so aware of the sky -- which reminds me -- I'm sorry for digressing but we marched every day  of course  to work and back to our barracks.
He had guts; my father di dn't want to do it but he used to work for my father.
It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men  it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work.
They took me out to work and I worked in a certain place there and we had a guard  a German soldier with the machine gun watching us  we s hould run away.
And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their clothes to the black marketeers to bring  to bring in food for them they to have something to eat.
If they give the order in Warsaw  they need 500 people fo r work  the Jewish gemeinde  they had to give them 500 people  a thousand people.
Your brother  I know  but your parents  did your father-- He didn't have to work.
There was laying dead people from -- dying on typhus -- and typhus.
And since I was it was six day business it was  I getting up 7:00 in the morning til 7  8:00 at night.
They evading the place where not to go to work  and he kill all the four without even asking  nothing.
About six months later I we I was working on a...cleaning windows  standing on a long ladder  because in addition to working twelve hours a shift in the inside the factory  we were required to work in the evening  on weekends and doing other work and I was standing on this long ladder cleaning a window above a entrance to an office building when one of the German guard guards kicked the ladder from under me.
And its interesting to work with Lucy  who is from s -- from -- from Croatia and who is in her 80s.
And my mother  of course  those days she was a housewife when I was first born  but of course when my father uh was drafted in the forced labor camp  she had to take over my father's business and then after the war subsequently she had a jewelry store and uh after the communists took over she went to work for the government.
And I says he so and and his name was Chamelan he find out that I work for Albert.
People went from th e ghetto to work in the factory and back.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 37 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: back and uh and we started going back to Lithuania and we we through Poland and at that time  you couldn't go with uh terrain like you go in now  you buy a ticket and you go.
Sometimes it work ed  sometimes it doesn' t. We were lucky.
We badly need a secretary for the office of communications to work w ith the director and there is a very big tension between Latvians and Lithuanians.
We had to teach them the work in the textile factory.
And only once in my lifetime  for which Im even today very unhappy  is that very good friends of mine  in the begi nning  when everything was still very bad  and the new art [indecipherable] work detail in -- of those branch camps were established  and among them  one was called Boody  and I have helped an lot of girls to go to Boody  because we knew it is one of the branch camps  and there were never selections in Boody.
They didnt reduce the price  so I had to work in order to pay it.
And he -- he was born here when we were -- I dont know  we moved around Thanksgivi ng and he was born in May  so we were about half a year here when he -- and I used to go to -- Victors family had the business and they had industrial -- industrial cottons and I used to go to work in the business  before the babies were born  because the children were born.
We were not supposed to get out of the camp unless we had a work permit or whatever.
And then  but by the time we were sent back to Plaszow  we did not work in Kabelwerk any more.
And here they came  with their fur coats and hats; and  of course  all...the most of the work in Theresienstadt was done by young Czech Jews  because we were the main occupation.
And then I wanted to go to Israel to a kibbutz.
And then after I fin ished my work  I went back to McKinsey and told them proudly how I had finished Cornell.
I brought the kid home on third floor  but we couldnt it was close to go to work for me  but it really wasnt a place to raise family because third floor.
It was very hard to do this work for so long  for so many nights.
And th-the family  this was Fryman  and they provided work  lodgings and so on for them.
And they gave a whole bunch regulation  you cannot socialize with Italians  you cannot work over there.
Since it was a garrison town or they had military b arracks  the Nazi's occupied the military barracks and they took Jewish details there to work.
And then uh I felt I was not sufficiently educated and then I uh got a scholarship to MIT Sloane School--and uh just to tell you the attitude  although I was totally abjectly poor  I...you know  I wore work clothing that I...second-hand clothing--I refused to take the scholarsh ip.
So what did I  what did the people accomplish by working  some of them like to work w ith the Germans.
I remember it -- there was a lot of people from Spain  who -- who work with -- against Franco.
I had a very good job  I mean I worked until two weeks before sh e was born and they wanted me back and I started negotiating and they wanted me full time and I knew I co uldn't walk out of there at five o'clock and yet I had a child and I couldn't see myse lf leaving the child  so I decided not to work.
I don't do anything  I try to work  and then I cannot do it.
What else do you So now that youve retired  are you doing any volunteer work or I did not because I retired in 2010.
Usually  you know  it doesn't take that long  and we were st anding and standing and the door still would not  they were not opening  so all of the sudden  one SS came  comes over and tells the other one uh in German that they have um  an order to take uh a group of girls the next day  like  like the next day  to work.
Well  we worked  we had no -- this was -- this is the work.
And when we went to work there was music in Gleiwitz  and when we came back was music.
He was an engineer by training and he was so moved by an experience he had in Lyon  when he was part o -- that he was with a group of adults and children  had been arrested and although he was a ver -- Jewishly very fringe and very secular  he felt a need to work with -- to help the Jewish people in France.
They have the amnesty list and they give us all kind of work.
There are all kinds of professions who were ready to go and work some .
And then in graduate school he did some sort of a little extra work.
If I may jump into a little bit further into the future  he ultimately was able to prove that and for a while he enjoyed that privilege of continuing to work and not wearing the normal star -- the yellow Star of David  but a yellow little pin which indicated that he was a Jew  but a privileged Jew.
He never looked back  he was always never said he this was better there  and this better there  no  he was just he he the first money he made in America is hed never done any physical work before.
Well I took off from work the very next day and took the subway all the way down to Center Street  near Wall Street  and applied for form 57  for employment with the State Department in quintuplicate.
Those dug their own graves and then they had to line up and were killed there.
The appells was in the morning before breakfast when we waked up and after  at night when we come to work and wa s special appells in the morning and in the middle of the day too.
My brother was outside at the time that people had to go into the ghetto.
When people came to work in the morning they had to register.
So he carried in a lot of tea we should have enough  fever -- feverish and who couldnt work  didnt have to work.
And since then  with another partner and they opened their own business  and then  you know  sometimes partnerships does -- doesnt always work well  and after  I think  two years or so they separated and my husband went on his own.
And I couldn't work as a student  he couldn't work as a student  was not allowed.
In Auschwitz you didnt work but you w ere stand ing hours outside at night and instead of sleeping.
So I used to work there Thursday night  or rather  some weeks Thursday night  Friday night  Saturday night  because all those days I worked in a store.
But I stayed with that family for about six months an d once war broke out  we were allowed to do war work  and so then my sister had been evac uated by then  but my mother and I found rooms and we lived together and I went to work making soldiers uniforms and gunpowder bags  and so on.
Was there -- for a woman  was it different because maybe in addition to doing the hard work  you also were more responsible for the children?
PT: People were killed or sent out to other place for work like to Riga.
So they put the people in the ghetto to work knitting.
I -- I did not last one we -- I think I lasted about a week and then she took me back  and -- because it d -- it just did not work out.
I work ed there and somebody would suspect you  that was enough to leave the job for me.
So  one day on my way from work to the place where I lived  I met one of our members.
Then young able bodied people because they told them these people are going for labor into Germany.
Not made a good impression or not smiled the right way or whatever it was that this didn't work.
A. Not all time  but in the beginning I was work ing yes  I was working bakery and theater.
They demanded their work and they gave me a place to sleep and some food to eat.
And from 10 til one we will work  one oclock we have lunch  and and and and and And then I say A2: Goodbye. [
I was waiting for he r and I didnt work and was only at home.
The Russian soldiers were skilled craftsmen and one of them had made a wooden revolver out of a piece of wood  and I had my uncle  who was at that time 13 married to my father's sister  he was in char ge of that work area over there  and a Russian soldier gave him that  whatever deal they made  I don't know  and he bought.
We were the last Jews; they used to work most of them.
So it gave me a very -- and I think this was one of my -- of the best times  and also -- also  it ga -- instead -- instead I -- like I had to work  lets say  eight hours.
They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to work tomorrow morning  and we had to get out the names from the register that we had  which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are going the next day.
They were killed on the spot or exchanged like to another part of Majdanek for another work.
He dealt mostly with adult patients and he did some very early work on mescaline  which became a drug a -- that was used for  I believe recreational  but it was a -- a very potent dr ug and he wrote one of the first papers on mescaline.
I I wish sometimes that the work would be more intelligent  but then  if they need the menial tasks  thats all right too.
One sister did nothing but transport Jewish children to and from hiding places .The mother was engaged in -- imprisoned in underground work.
Thats when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the -- the first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father  to -- to go to a so-called work camp.
Little did we know that these policemen will be forced later  to participate in  you know  in shipping off the Jews to the -- God knows where.
Oh yes  I -- by that time I was old enough -- Yes  you -- -- not only old enough  my mother was work ing  my father was working by that time in Tiefbau  which means very hard labor  for wh ich he probably didnt get paid  you know  digging ditches  and construction  which was compulsory work because he had to give up his store in Dusseldorf  his wholesale store  because then an edict came out that Jews couldnt have -- couldnt own businesses any more.
I am so glad that I'm back.ﬂ And we had to march by this every day returning from work  and we had to see this.
And then youd go out  what  you would go to work in the To work  in the morning they take you.
I didnt belong  I didnt feel comfortable  I -- I me -- I mean  I am now a member of the Clinical Social Work Society  I go to their meetings  but its not the same  its a professional organization.
And otherwise  I enjoy the museum  I enjoy the people here  nice to work with them  and I know that my work here will help for future generations  that I do something constructive for the museum.
You toast Variokojos Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1  2018 241 Oh  and while because in between si this was a one day we woke up  and we said  oh maybe it would be be good to work on a ship  since nobody wants us.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 21 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: mans--the S.S. that were taking small children and putting them on the buses.
So you could  a foreigner could work for a Czech firm.
So we were starving and surviving but one summer  this was the summer of 1943  I was walking barefoot in because those shoes were so uncomfortable that I just  whenever I had the chance  I was take them off and I step on a rustic nail  and I was afraid to tell the German that was supervising him because only a Jew  or a Jewess or a Jewess girl could use  be use for them; what good otherwise we were shot from that...so when I came home  the infection started and from my big toe of my right leg to hip I had the red thing and my father knew a doctor  a surgeon in the hospital  so he went there and 10 o clock at night I had an opera tion and I wa s put in the hospital and I didnt work anym ore but I was in the hospital.
So like I say  my older brothers were doing all of that work on the business and  what do you call it  in the fields.
And the 26 Camp system (German) 15 remaining people all came to Berlin to work Zwangsarbeit  27 forced labor at the Siemens factory.
I promise you right here that me and all my friends an I hope also those who are not my friends  from now on we will work together and we will make this country as big as you want it  and thank you for all of you speaking to us.\
Peopl e who were taken out of Poland--not in concentration camp  but were taken out as a fam ily to work on fields in Germany.
These people were probably Ukrainian  possibly slave laborers  possibly all the people who had volunteered to work in Germany.
They went to middling schools and if -- if a person wouldn't work  they could be deported.
Come by  I'll put you to work \  and I said  \ Well  that's a nice idea  but I don't think the infantry would really like that and  furthermore  my father wouldn't like that either because he was a combat officer in World War I and he thinks that I ought to be a combat officer.
He was one of those who was forced to work there.
Generally  all the transports came to Birkenau  where there were selection made to go to work or to go to the gas chamber.
When I've been around yo u  I start to work household.
Well  it was bad because we were taken to a shelter first  although my uncle couldn't have put us  he put us in a shelter  and then his wife  fearful that we might cost too much money  put my mother and me to work in a factory.
Many priest was liberated from Dachau concentration camp  so they come and the one we have in our camp  and I was work with him in the school  in the church because also was so many families the German take to work on the farm  so they left the farm when the American came and they come to camp.
Before you were li berated  Sylvia   when you were describing in the cellar with the other 11 children   what do you remember what it was like for you to be in the cellar with just 10 other or 11 other kids while your parents are being forced to do the work they were doing?
You have work clothes and the clothes is not uh normal clothes.
You said you had done some work at the Holocaust Museum in Washington.
In fact   there was some ghetto  it was not as large a ghetto.
And he was but he injected the belief and he showed me many times in life I thought its not going to work.
All of a sudden when we come back the next day for work  they send us a different job.
Now  in all the work like  for instance  in the workshops where I was there was only one SS man in charge of the carpentry and one SS man of the whole workshops  all the workshops.
do your work there  and then when the war ends -- And the war -- -- you go home.
What kind of work we re you sup were you Oh  I su gre did you have to do when you were in the ghetto in Užhorod ?
And then when -- after work  the girls -- not always  I wasnt th ere for a -- for a few days  but sometimes we had to undress and so he looked th rough ours if we didnt take something.
Well  you know what the Hias is  and when I went to work to the Hias  there was -- aga in  you see  I was very  what do you call it?
The next day  you had to go back  back to work.
I mean  even if you -- if you leave your home there and you work -- and you -- you know these people work in the swamps  those pioneers.
>> Bill Benson: She was not able to earn a living at that point?
We have this 1939 Club  who does a lot of charitable work  but we also gather together  and we combine some worthwhile endeavors with a dance.
I remember once  we were work ing outside and it was cold.
No  it was not hard work  and if it was  it was the -- the -- the feeling of doing something  accomplishing and -- and being proud of it  so whatever assignment we got  it was fine.
I had hospital work  and bulk of my work was Case Western Reserve University  be cause of the research  and they eventually hired another secretary  she took my place as a matter of fact.
Because i -- I -- I -- End of Tape One  Side A Beginning Tape One  Side B This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.
Within t -- week or two he signed an affidavit for my parent s and arranged for my br other and sister to get to London and they even came in to learn a profession to work.
So from Plaszow  after five days  we were sent to the salt mines in Wieliczka  but th ey did not put us to work but it was the worst camp  I think because everything was dirt  you know from the salt and from the prisoners who worked there  never made it more than four to six weeks  they told us.
I remember that  that you know  you had to -- you couldnt -- you still free to move outside the ghetto and deal and trade with the farmers if you had a little money and all that and so you couldnt work already  a Jew  you had before  the arm band.
Further on we went to work so he gave me a pick and somebody got a shovel and we had to dig the ground there.. We didnt know whats going on anyhow.
So I went  I rented another place  Richard Adain  39  and I rented there and I put my machine  I start to work and I got like 16 employees  you know.
So when the trucks came to take everybody  that was about 10:30  11 oclock  because I you know  you ye you knew so  it was sometimes in the morning.
I did have  like I said  a lot of job  but I was making a good living.
Once you work inside  I mean  you feel like youre locked in.
And she was...got out of that village in order to find work so that she wouldn't be taken without work into captivity.
In some cases they nursed and came three times a day  but in most in all cases they had to work otherwise  and just came to visit their kids.
Did -- did you guys  when you were work ing the coal mines  and when you would come back to the barrack  did you talk ab out food?
During our work  we found many pliers that were used by the crematoria crews to pull out gold teeth from the mouths of the gassed victims.
They were taking the young people everyday to work outside the ghetto.
Were there any activities  anything other than work  come home  make food?
And allegedly there were two ghettos  ghetto A and ghetto B. Ghetto A were the people who worked  ghetto B were the illegals  who did not work.
They may have been work ing in fields  or digging ditches or storm 37 drains or things like that.
But you had to work hard otherwise it would fall apart.
You were killed  you know  either the room elder or the block elder told a Kapo because when you went to work  you went under different  you know  the Kapos were in charge of you and they told that this fellow stole bread from another prisoner he was killed.
It was a camp where young men from colleges were prepared for military work.
Only if he gives if he say if for something else to work  for something else to do  they come  they had to come to him.
>> Bill Benson : So tell us where they sent you and what you were forced to do.
And then morning came  and my 10 mother went into the camp  into that labor camp and ta find out if she could work there.
And he says -- he to ld me where I work -- where I been working  you 87 know  like a front yard [indecipherable] 150 yards  and he start -- hes talking to me in working  that this morning  he says  they took us  all the officers  not only us  but officers in the whole town who have workers -- officer who work here  and the -- for the germ -- German officers  they took him -- they took them to show the slau ghter [indecipherable].
I went back to a kibbutz  but this kibbutz were really of people who were not going to Israel  but they were waiting for passage to any other country that would accept them.
Needed credit  got credit  we didn't have money...\  That's how my  my mother was always active in this kind of work. \
So -- Now  Isaac would have been very engrossed in his work  which was fascinating work  but it would mean hed have less time to be supportive.
I showed him my work permit but what I said to him I do not re  I don't know.
So  after three years I quit and I went to work.
So I figure  maybe its time to leave  cause he is not going to be able to work much longer  and besides  you know  I just -- maybe theyre right  117 maybe I should go on my own.
Looks like the the children were the the came eh eh eh with the people who work for for the Ger German farms  you know.
And we got a apartment upstairs and we were so happy  and from there we -- every day went to work.
We were not ri ch  and I really needed to work.
Yes  yes  yes  yes  it can be  it can be.ﬂ And it already begin to work on people and people already begin to believe.
Not only this was not a long -term hiding place because people could see but also the Germans were going to liquidate the work camps and everybody -- everybody would have to go.
And from there they do a selection for a work camp in Rochlitz.
I suppose the kind of work you do here in keeping the memory of of those of the Holocaust alive touches very closely on my work as well  and uh so I have frequently interviewed  of course from a literary and historical perspective  uh those who uh either survived  for example H. D. Adler who survived in Theresienstadt and has written a book about it - I've interviewed him.
I mentioned before they took my clothes away t hey made us work in the factories.
If you dont -- we need to work the computer  I work the computer.
I mention -- the reason I mentioned work battalions  Hungary  they brought them in when they evacuated.
Like I work only for the Germans  I was free to go everywhere with my special ID card.
So people needed to work  y -- to be able to -- t-to survive  and to get some bread  get some -- some fruit  get some vegetables.
But I got time off to finish a semester of work.
The husband comes home  he -- he -- he -- he has so many responsibilities at work.
And if hear -- saw so mebody standing up  he gave us two hour more work  the whole group.
And she's e ngaged to be married  and she's finishing her Master's Degree in social work at Boston University.
So that was also through his number because the guy seen me at work  stocking shelves at Shoppers Fair.
Until it came to Dr. Serrett   who was a very famous psychiatrist for the National School s of Social Work.
I don't know exactly  but the daily work usually did the Lithuanians except that when we come to the ghetto  it was the 15th of August 1944  so there were the beginning hautios   and the huge population everybody has to deliver everything of money  gold  silver  and other jewels.
Well  I had known from my work with OSS and from contacts I made in London and elsewhere that there were Germans who'd been in concentration camps and who had survived who would make supposedly pretty good witnesses.
So I start to mix the stucco and ev erything and I start to work.
And I...I knew how to...I had experience; because I work ...worked like a um assistant to a very famous doctor  and so I knew how to handle um oh crazy.
There was no work in Stutthof  but they let us work.
They wanted this time like we line up for work every day.
Yo u know  we had four children  one after another  and the-there was lots of work to be done.
I -- I wanted to -- I dont know what I wanted to do  I dont know  I dont know  I just wanted my job and I wanted to work and I wanted to go to school  and -- but anyway  I agreed that -- you know  we all agreed because hes really -- he really was a person with depth.
Because the Polish people used to come to work and go home so that's how we knew things.
And  of course  he was helpful that I got confirmed for work.
He couldn't speak with the people in this cremetory  it was sonderkommando  but we saw  we saw the corpse s. We saw not the - and this  you know  as I told you  this  this uh bunkers  these adapted cremetories  stopped the work and the sonderkommando came  but not I must  I forgot to tell you one very important thing.
And then we had to go to -- the only thing I can remember is go -- they told us we were going to a concentration camp.
I strongly suspect that my father had heard about this a nd thats why he was so worried  because these regulations at work and so on and not using the sidewalk werent all that bad.
Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people are not being sent to work.
I figured they were all Nazis and I'm certainly not going to work for them.
So  we used to when walking to work in Birkenau we're going every morning to Auschwitz  four kilometers to Auschwitz to   and they told us to sing  what we were singing  but I can't sing so I'm going to just talk and it's like   you know what that means.
And finally we came out and I went to work and didnt have any money  any money so I went to work in a factory  an electronic factory.
So  I remember the date  May 1  May 1  1933 I moved to Munich and started to work in my uncle's business which was a business selling wholesale glassware and chinaware.
And actually I had my first ch ance to publish my work in 1952 or 53  when somebody in England heard about it  and I was offered that they would publish it  and in the State Department  being a very junior officer at that stage of the game  I had to at that time it was necessary to submit manuscripts to a review committee.
This was mainly because information filters down and they said if you work they don't arrest you.
We didn't know very much of household work and cooking and things like that  so my mother said you have to learn because we're certainly not going to have a maid any longer.
Can you take fa Patrone and help at least some aspects of Patronas work?
We didn't do work there  but we weren't fed either  I mean  just water  sort of  or liquid.
And he  they ran into each other in the ghetto and he arranged for them to work in a factory outside the gates  which was supposed to be a slightly protected situation so that every day they would all go out to work.
And I said to him  by the way  do you know that I was Jewish?
And then some may have worked somewheres else  but -- but in Birkenau say lager  where I was  nobody was taken for work.
And so now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform  and then we just  we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and th at didn't work.
He give us -- when he give us a signal  you know  we know we had to work fast.
So every day we had to go to work in the morning.
So you it was early spring  so we ate whatever we could find on the outside because there were quite grassy molds there so we took the grass and ate and sometimes we took some water with the grass and cooked look a soup.
All of a sudden  without any warning  they yanked me out from the work group.
I -- In a way  I started with tha -- doing these nextashear  put a lot of work into them.
Did you feel that -- that you were doing good work and other people were not?
They used to come around with wagons and pick them up.
He would go around and check  ask if we had enough to eat maybe comfort me once in a while  say everything will work out  and the staff was very nice.
And I started thinking like them  and now when I think of myself  Im -- Im -- you know  I feel bad about it  because if we didnt have that -- all these people  that they work so hard  a-and they were good  and everything  you know  we wouldnt have the things that we have today.
So  during the day men and women were out at work and it was not bad.
And he need people to work  so when I came he says okay  Ill be I get you a job.
Tomorrow come to my office and you'll work w ith me  and this was in 19...by the end of 1933 because in order to work as a lawyer  you had to to have six months preparatory in the court  but then in '39  the Lithuanian mini ster of justice  he was not...let's say Nazis and the Nazis themselves  and he picked out my professor and myself and they didn't allow any Jews to be uh to be accepted in cour t even like practitioners  but I was lucky.
And I dont know what we did for that round-up  maybe I was -- went to work  and it -- it -- it -- it didnt penetrate to our area.
No  because at liberation day I was still in this place; so there was not much work.... Well  there was a little bit of feasting  but there were no...no uh people at that time.
If you talk there too much -- And were they a -- were they a Jewish family?
So there was no problem with us but there were Jews taken who were very cleverly misrepresented because they were taking Jews to Galicia and then we found out they werent taking them to work  they were taking them and they dug deep trenches and shot them all.
But if you want to go to that school   I have to work in order to pay for you Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22  1997 44they should take you into school.
And they work ed with the Zionists and they worked with ou r little group  and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish resistance  and Kormus was the head.
So your fath okay  lets repeat that so that we hear it on on tape  is that your father was actually not only not deported  but taken to work as a chemist.
Interview with Richard Peterson April 6  1999 29 By that time had you he ard of anything any news about labor camps  work camps?
Luckily my work was inside the barracks sorting goods and I didnt have to go to the rail siding to meet arriving transports.
So they didnt make a ghetto  they took out the people to -- to each  to other ghettos -- I was in the ghetto in Novidburg in that time.
They said that they are going to a factory for work.
Well  she pulled out an an amazing feat of courage and and goodwill from people around  she saved the business  and actually established a very prosperous life  and married for the second time in 37  when she when she was sure that everything was going to work well.
One of the accusations was that disrespect for Christianity by having the workers work on Sundays to pro duce Monday's paper.
I decided that it's not going to work out for the simple reason that you just cannot get food.
In the morning of the holiday a Russian guy came before we came and said  \ Go to work \  and we had to work.
So  in the two and a half years in ghetto  what we call now the Big Ghetto -- at the beginning I remember that we when we have leisure time  and we have some after the work  or it was a time I should not to go to work  because I was not 17 years.
So I had a little idea  I had some idea about dental -- dental technician work.
From there it's already 11 hours and we were in the command and was mostly shuffled  work.
And  and mention that none of the Jewish academicians or professionals were allowed to go about their work.
What did -- what did you give to the museum  for example?
Twelve years  they can still go on at the work .
I could hardly walk  let alone do the chores or the work that I was required to do.
They were not eligible but in my case they made a diffe rence because I did work for the Nazis over here.
I had to report to an office every morning and they assigned you work which you had to do.
Moise Weiner: Houses; and when he came from work  he took a glass of vodka  maybe a little glass of vodka.
You see  as as as they came closer  the Germans I mean  the Americans  you know  occupy this part of Austria and this part  they came [indecipherable] closer Im talking months later  they used to take us out to work on schutzengraben .
So  I started to manufacture them  but it didnt work out  because there were other companies  there were too many for a little job.
He immediately looked fo r some opportunity and started to work for a co-op  a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who banded together and formed a wh at you would call a  maybe a sma ll enterprise  as long as they worked under the ruse of a coope ration and everything was divided  the profit if there was any  and they paid their taxes to the state  this was what the communist s considered kind of a happy inbetween of state farms or state en terprise and private enterprise.
He was working by the kitchen because they gave him a break but that time when we went to the work  there was no more on the calendar to work.
And when we got to Ebensee  within one day we have  one evening we come back from work and there is the head count  Appell as they called it and one is missing and whenever one was missing  there was circus  everybody had to stand  remain standing  all formation and it was  it should have been so easy to find who was missing because every barracks had a book on which the clerk wrote how many hour in the barracks  you know  and the SS counted them already  how many were and checked off that yeah  there were so many  so one of them didn't count properly and he should have known which was.
And I was a very clean housekeeper so there was a lot of work at home.
I began work as a carpenter in th e Flemington area.
Well  first of all  I was too young to go to work.
02:06:42 What kind of work did you do in the ghetto?
Oh we -- oh we -- he always said  you know  we got to learn all the work on a farm  no matter what  and so we had to do everything  specially near the time when the war broke out  when it -- it got ba d. We couldnt get any workers  so we had to take over  and every girl had their j ob  you know  in a -- anything in a farm.
There were artists  you know  in the paners and we had artists who came from the Polish School of Academy of Arts  professors  beautiful work.
I mean  I enjoy working in the hospital  I got good relationship with the people I work in  and know everybody there.
But it was -- most of the work inside the camp was taking workers around.
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION My father  Shalom Joszef  from the picture of the camps when they took him to work camps in front of the cattle train.
And we taught how to milk the cows  how to fish  how to work in the garden  how to work in the fields.
But anyway I came  like I said  and for the firs t six months I didnt do any work  all I did was go to cinemas.
But we went to work and we started a new life  and we got into the mainstream.
I mean  if you were called  not every day  but there were all kinds of jobs that required on the part of the German Nazi administration that needed to be done  and the boys who were at the time 15 or 16  instead of having their fathers go and do the job  they went to work.
I don't know how the deal came a bout  but my parents...my father used to go out and work sometime on the farm.
And so I said I want ed to major in sociology.
We didn't for two years  but the rumors were flying around that they were going to sterilize all the young women.
I went out  went to a bakery to wait for bread.
Some of the them wanted to stay in Germany and work on the German economy.
Not -- I didnt grow up like a girl that had to work  you know?
I did not work to get honors and positions and all that.
Once those letters were written  the work to protect these people just got started because they had to be protected day and night.
We didn't march out to work uh so it was a beautiful day and uh Auschwitz was not far from the Mountains  beautiful area in Poland  and the air was so clear  blue sky...you could see the mountains and their beauty  and somehow that affected me a nd uh uh uh gave me gave me some courage and then on that day for one reason or the other  uh we got bread and some marmalade  which was not given too often and uh when one of my friends from the youth movement said you see  on 46 that birthday...it's almost better than cake a nd that that that happening somehow  that that was really a...you see  you you are...every little bit was was was helpful in order to to to uh to to uh strengthen your your spirit of...your spirit of ...your your...yeah...your spirit to live.
My father had a butcher shop  and he used to like be a middle man  selling cattle  buying cattle.
A. The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day  that I was at home  and I worked in the office  and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the Ghetto  if I had to go out for something.
A place of work that was a factory  and they been working at the factor y. And I don't remember the -- how it was in the details.
That was Manfred Greenback  who is still alive and who is still in Amsterdam and -- and who is actually getting a pension from the Dutch government for the work he and his sister  both -- she also s -- also has a kind of a small pension from the Dutch government  for the work that they did during the war.
He ha d a -- like a -- he had a foreman who -- who done all the work over there.
Now  at this point we were kind Hof scared because I was afraid that if they take him to work to Germany  we will have to go to a doctor to see if he's healthy and then they're going to find out who he was.
And there was a lot of Jewish soldiers fell work battalions who came from our section of the country  western Ukraine  Jews.
And they told me that they all were sent to Auschwitz.
Well  with the -- well  that was about the work that could be done in Germany from the cradle to the grave  but you know  the people who survived what they had gone through  I think that there was a principle of natural selection that wa s involved  and the people who came through  managed to come through.
Well basically when we started out in the Bronx and wh ere we had a one bedroom apartment and my firs t son was about a year and a half old  we moved to Queens  we bought a two family home and we hoped that we'll be able to support it  both of us working and... You didn't mention your work?
We made even business together  because she was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing  you know  from the gas chamber when the people arrived.
When you first -- you saw the ghetto  well  people went out to work  and this was one guy who -- a tailor who had his own shop  and it ha -- got in a -- when he -- they want him to give up 76 the shop.
I think that the ones were hard and came to work with the children were very  very much aware of what had happ ened  of where the children came from  of how they must be missing their families and I think that they -- that they worked very  very well together  and I think the children appreciated that.
Interview with Marc Samuels 19 July 25  2014 Carol : He split rocks I stayed there and they didnt have any special work for me.
Now  I want to go back to the ghetto a little bit.
And my mother went to work al most immediately in the garment district  sewing in a -- in a shop  making childrens clothing.
That that was our job  that you didnt do no work  no nothing because you couldnt we were not allowed to go outside  only in the barracks.
Minsk  they would bring these people from the railroad station in moving va ns  which were with a chimney and windows painted on it and they said we bring you to our farms to work here.
So  there was some work has to be done in order to eh eh occupy the children  give them teach them.
Oh  he was not a member of the Nazi regime  so it didnt work.
There were...uh...there were labor camps and Jews were forced to go to work in labor camps.
And you were working  cause you were [indecipherable] No  Flossenburg we didnt work.
In New York  after I got off  I was waiting for my sister.
And finally  it was going fr really fast  you know  the the work was done  some distance from Panevžys   and that was done  you know  my task was finished  I back to the staff  Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14  2010 165gave back the rifle  the ammunition  the armband  was done.
One of the things she wanted to do was offer herself for work in Germany.
I went to a Polish man who used to work for my father.
What I'm trying to bring out is  that was my upbringing  the work ethic and so on and so forth.
And one could assess this  and gradually these people came in to work in the camps.
She worked very  very hard and -- but now its not necessary  so they just bought a second home on Chesapeake Bay and we keep hoping that something good will happen and they dont have to work so hard any more.
How do you personally feel about going over there as a Jew and the work that you were able to accomplish  or what you saw?
It was a crazy idea  but this is the type of crazy ideas you had to have to work.
If there was a two-car train  we were permitted to take the last car and the platfo rm of the last car to go to this work.
The plan was that everybody kills his Nazi at his place of work and puts him away where nobody can see him.
Uh to cut a long story short  uh uh negotiations were started between representatives of the Claims Conference and and it settled 53 in a so-called amicable settlement of thirty million for all survivors  for all those who had survived on the basis of that in addition to claims they could make under the German Laws  they could claim additional five thousand marks for wo rk they had performed for in Auschwitz  and a whole mechanism had to be uh uh established to to work on that.
Well  there was over four years terrible hard work and far away from from family and with strange people  and most of them was uh were hardened with hunger because it was...everyday was uh think about uh bad...was was uh hunger all the time because it was very short of food.
I 27 think anything above 10 -- they had to work.
Incidently  I received a call from a very erudite professor at one of the Eastern universities a few months ago saying  oh  I read in the bibliography for Saint Irinae that your uncle's work is the basic work for people who research Saint Irinae and I was very proud to hear that his name has appeared in this  I forget the name of the man  but I've got is someplace.
That was  yes they paid me more cause I needed money but very few people would have done what I did.
Or theres some report that some part somebody doesnt work  they Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 68have to report to them.
Oh  three hundred maybe people  they come around for...for...and we stay in this...the Germans what they was doing in this time  they said  \ Who left in life  come back.
An d they -- and they stay right behind you  and they look at you  y -- and they -- you know   and you have to work hard   very  very hard  I cannot explain to you.
When they began acquainta nce with receiving from him dollars  most of them didnt work.
While you were raising them  did you also work outside the home?
So I would go and like the work was very hard  but I do it  and -- but one time I catch -- I took the money in presence of the women  and shortly after I got fired  because I was taking the place of a Gentile woman.
Now washing is a big work because we had high  uh  uh  wash stands on high heels and you had to climb in there and then there was come cold water.
So one day I cam e home from from work and one of my friends told me th at a friend of mine I used to work with together  you know  we some of the times we used to he is th-they put him in the death barrack.
Or if they didnt have enough work  they may have just said  hey go.
When you work on a $10 000 or $15 000 watch  you can't make any mistakes.
But  sure enough  we got used to the hard work  and I learned to carry those hard big heavy buckets of pails  and carry them out into the camp so that the uh  uh inmates could carry them to their barracks  and uh  and this is how we worked there for about 4 or 5 months  in the kitchen with the Belgian girls.
But he didn't resign from a bishops duties  he from the villa he just did his old work as a bishop.
That he found a work brigade that worked outside the ghetto.
So  that day somebody threw water at you  did you come to work wet?
We just didn't want to suffer  but we didn't care  but we did suffer because they saw we used to go to work every morning.
At ll o'clock somebody knocked at the door; and they told us that the last man  who had a permit to work in the...in th e country as a saddler on another big estate  was brought in by police.
He couldnt fit  he couldnt see -- so he -- he -- he sort of made me work through the fitt ing room  which was sort of [indecipherable] working out  and to take a look when he fits and see whats wrong with his -- what his problem -- where the problem is  and late r I could fix it.
I did work my way through college  and I did work my way through grad school.
But the only thing that I remember distinctly that it must have been about two o'clock midnight when we start jumping because it took them time to work by the doors  to open them up.

I was with the children's kommando  and so we walked on this day...that was in October 1943...with the children to work.

Then he he used to work  and a a couple week s  or a couple months later whatever  he took a Gentile and he put him in wa on this place.
It didn't necessarily work smoothly  but to the extent possibl e  continued in both zones.
And since w e had to work  he always kept something in reserve for my mother when we came home from work.
Anyway  I thought about it  I went to work in the hospital  and I thought about it  and thought about it  and I said  ﬁWell  what difference does it make?ﬂ I want him to come.
Now something new is working now with the Israeli government where they want to give reparation for people who are older and Israel is trying to work out something with Germany.
Now the work was done and they didn't pay for it.
And this is where  and I dont know  Chris or Hania would remember bett er how long we stayed  but this was absolutely not a camp that we lived in because by then we didnt work anymore.
And did your mother ha ve to work or try to?
How did these rocket firing craft work that were on our left  and so on.

Uh  now after so many years  when I recall how it was to be a child  it's  maybe it's different and my last years I went  and I grow and I leave and I work in very big cities  but at that time  even I know that it was a small city.
I've known Henry  I've been lucky enough to know Henry for many yea rs and work with him in many presentations and he could tell us all his life story for hours and hours and hours.
RJ] Everyone knew about it because we used to talk about it and another thing we used to see because the Jews in Monowitz who used to work in the works were on the other side of the football field when their life in the factory was over  we used to see a lorry go up the road with them all standing up in there and we used to say  ﬁOh theres another l oad going up to the gas chamber.ﬂ [DL] And how often would you see that? [
I jumped my report to you  because that was still when we were going into  every day  to work.
>> Bill Benson: I think you said she'd heard through the grapevine that being able to do that work was your ticket to maybe surviving?
I don' t know  it seemed to me like all I did was work  come home  just waited.
We did not do any work  we were not allowed to write or do any manual labor  5etc.
It was a camp  yeah  but they did not have  like I said before  they did not have the gas chambers there.
So when they came they even told us that everybody sha should stay together  families  becau se the young ones are the one who will work and support the old families.

Manny is a graduate of Temple University and did his graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania.
But anyway  I don't work there too long there  you know    you know.
That morning when I came through the gate to go out to work  I saw trucks outside of the ghetto.
So I mean  I did a lot of -- a lot of work there.
Uh kitchen...we have to have...people have to work uh by uh in order to to survive...do everything by themselves in the camp.
We said  how long would it take the Russians to get through our work?
I had three-hundred women in my block  and I had to take care of -- that they should go out to work  and shouldn't run away  a nd they should be there.
If you didn't work it like  uh skilled uh weavers would have 2 looms  we had 4 looms to watch.
In your testimony you talk and give many instances  I think of your mother saying  this was when you were in the ghetto  dont go out after we get back from work because . . .
Wi -- it -- the award men tions your -- your work in the underground as well as your -- Yes. --
They were in Lodz ghetto and they perished and they probably were the first to die from hunger because they were not able to work.
We...that was the work fo r maybe for a year or two  just...uh...the 13 underground was a cultural organization.
The Germans swatted her and said  You go where you're told.
And I remember my brother was one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before  and her father had to go a work camp.
Yeah  the next day  we went on duty right away  the next morning.
The other work parties were nothing to (you know) to desire.
So they made us switch  they took us for work and they took th-that transport that was supposed to go to Nuremberg to the gas chambers.
And in the morning when they would come back  we would leave their bed and they would go to sleep.
I said  \ I noticed in the evening about ten  eleven o clock that he is missing  but it's really quite often he stayed in the main camp  like I for instance I went to visit my  after the work I went to visit my friends  so I came late home... \  this is all  we were the only ones who were allowed to pass  because we had our bands and we were in charge of the  but no other prisoner could get out  but we were allowed to go from one camp  from my camp to the other camp  to the main camp  and I said  \ I didn't know this  in the morning I see he  he is gone.
I was going out to work and there was a I men  already a Jewish man.
Another reason  its -- the -- the s -- well  the atmosphere at work changed.
I went to this was not my choice  I had to do work once one month every summer  work we got paid in industry.
I -- Im no -- Im talking about the east  but primarily the western part of Europe  and Greece  doing this consulting work.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: After that I went to work in the factory.
And in New Jersey at that time  you either had to work 10 years for the US government  or three years for a CPA firm  in order to qualify for CPA examinations.
So  I remember coming back in from work and it was very cold  and somebody gave me clogs  wooden clogs  and I couldnt walk in them.
The counting was just a regular routine  and they told us that they need workers for them to work.
That didn't work  so I tried to find anything sharp and I tried to commit suicide  well I couldn't  I have scars here  all over when I look now.
And so in Buenos Aires  according to records that I read  he actually tried to have a hair implant done of the high part of his forehead  try to shrink that down  but of course that didn't work.
The next mo rning I had to go--remember we had to report to the warehouse that we were still there  we had to get a stamp on our card; otherwise if you refuse to go to work  you could be arrested.
I mean  we had food for whatever time that we had food  you know.
They -- they -- no matter what -- they might have been talking in private to one anothe r  but I dont know what the -- everything went about the regular way to work and co me home and thats it  they didnt bother us with the  you know  from beginning [indecipherable] was still to go to synagogue still  but this -- we went all - later on  we s -- they -- they stopped all that.
All I did was most of my work there for them was to to go with them and trans translate things for them  you know.
Did you work with other U. S. organizations like the State Department or the OSS or -- Yeah  yeah.

She sa id  ﬁWhere did you learn that?ﬂ I said  ﬁWell  I just  you know  have my ears open.ﬂ But when you was at work  I -- I -- I got someone at the door  and I opened 62 the door  ﬁAre you Mrs. Gardner?ﬂ I said  ﬁNo  Im the housekeeper.ﬂ ﬁOh  you look much better than she does.ﬂ Now  I didnt know that guy  he just knocked at the door  so I mean  a -- a -- a -- a -- I already found a lot of things out.
>> Bill Benson: You had been gone for two years already.
And we did little work  like taking care of the livestock  feeding the cows  feeding the pigs and watering the horses and preparing.

My Uncle Paul let -- went on -- on a Hakshera with people who wer -- wanted to go to Israel to learn farming  to learn -- yeah  farm -- farm -- farm  do farm work.
And in the work room  the Nazis had written  ﬁVeer capitoli ennee.ﬂ We never surren-surrender.
From Sachsenhausen we were sent to work camp because Sachsenhausen was not a work camp.
Work sets you free  ﬁArbeit macht freiﬂ. And we marched -- we didnt know anything  Birkenau or not Birkenau  because they -- that probably the train stopped in Auschwitz proper and we were marched to Birkenau.
My father had gotten some work th-through si through the relatives that were mostly members of Washington Hebrew  and were in better circumstances.
He said  well  Ill hire  I got a girl over here  a Polish girl  and shell work with you together.
A nurse came out and told me not to think about my brother anymore  and also said  ﬁYou should eat your potato.ﬂ During the night  a truck had come to take the very sick ones who could not work anymore  and they were killed.
That work ended after four weeks when I developed an infection on my face and was admitted to the sick bay in barrack no.
Th-They work there in in that in the in that place  in that hospital.
And I went back to the Jewish Social Service  and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available  and th ey said  ﬁCome  its part time  if something opens as full time  well get you as full time.ﬂ I was just going to ask your -- your Masters degree is in -- is it -- Social work -- social work at Catholic University?
And what did you do in Stutthof   did you work in st No  in Stutthof for a while  for a few months  we were waiting for our and then they took us to different camps.
Where the ghetto police essentially cooperated with the Germans  here the ghetto police's mission was to try to save the Jews.
In other words when we went on Appell  we tried to be together and  when -- after work we were together.
And then and so  in 36 they sent him a notice that he had a special position because you couldnt expect that Aryans would work with a Jew.
So he started right away to work in the camp as a barber.
And Im really angr y when I read that  you know  the Jews didnt want to leave their jobs  they none of this is true.
It was the Korean War  and that was a quite traumatic for my parents  that Now  bef before that  in the first few years in Vineland  had you sort of expected that you would continue in that di rection  or did you think about going to college at some point I did think about it  but I I I it because of the move perhaps  and and then the other thing was  my parents found  as I said  the business  the the the poultry business got eggs bu siness got to be rather poor  and they had a great deal of difficulty making ends meet  so I went decide well  I can just go out to work.
>> Regina Spiegel: At that point  we in Auschwitz  it wasn't yet any work  because as I say they just brought you to like another station  because I didn't stay in Auschwitz more than six weeks.
break] Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24  2015 133 the Germans were were leading some prisoners along the road  from one place to another because they were  lets say  taken to do do some work somewhere.
And I had to go every so often to the military for  to the army for six weeks and I had enough with the camp  with all the kind of things  and I didn't feel like that  so from the first day on my mind starts to work how to get away from it  how to go America.
There was a tremendous depression  because of thats how many people were all of a sudden  you know  out of Out of work.
And before I knew it  all of a sudden I was yanked out from the work group and put with... We were about 13 in the camp who were still...uh mana ged to hide until now.
So I went to a technical school   after a year and a half I graduated  I went to work.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 28 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: Verchstaten--you know where they uh--and there we even met up with a few of our friends.
My father used to work with his brother i n the same factory i n Zgierz before the war.
I had a contract in the work brigade  in that time  with a strong Jewish  physically strong Jew by the name of Chaimke Lipman .
We all thought that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come back.. But the whole thing was to trick us in  to trick us in.
But there were also many people who got money from the Germans if they would tell them where the Jews were.
No  no -- No  now youre work -- -- no  no. --
When were released  my husband ca me from work and so he start telling the head man  he then took all over   and then they rele ased us.
A nd I met a professor of social work  Hetta Calls  from Czechoslovakia.
And the way it would be is  in each group  we work with group -- we had always about two  three of Germans what supervisor of the watch does.
20 people  kids that got a little older or the sick that got a little healthier could go out to work instead.
They became like millionair es and they just out of their own hard work.
And then the next morning we had to form a circle in the fact ory yard  and the German foreman stepped into the middle of that circle  and he looked around  and he decided he didnt like anybody to work for him in the factory who wore eyeglasses.
Which was kind of very heavy work  uh but I think... And she's a very hard worker  but... And I think it was not so much the hard work that bothered her; but I think she was...she was very  very bothered by the kinds of people that she met in the factory  and she felt totally alien from those people.
What kind of work did he get when he get when he -- when he [indecipherable] 37 Well  he couldnt practice law because Engl ish common law  like American common law has absolutely no relationship to German law  so he could never practice his profession  and I think he was too old to -- to start all over again.

After two weeks  they took us to a place to work and there were huge rocks  and they told us to take the rocks and transfer th em to the other side of the big field.
So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him  and he told me  \ There is a guy who lives next house  and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the airport.

I went back to Marseille after the armistice to se e whether there was any work that the JDC could do with the French-Jewish population  especially -- particularly th e refugees  who were coming down there from the north and from Belgium.

But I was involved at sometimes seeing them  going into work there.
Tool makers and whatever other tools th ey had that came in handy for the war effort and for that reason I be lieve that they had preferred treat ment at work.
But sometimes something happen  like on e time electric motor would burn up with cinder and the air conditioning stopped work.
They would take our young people on a work crew I was too young  but they would take most of the young people and they would take them to do forced labor.
And its difficult to say but you want me to be honest  Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 5 that my work came first  my career came first  and my family came second.
And the people selected for work  as I said before  were a relatively small number.
Each work detail that returned from work to cam invariably carried one or more dead bodies but they were stretched out.
The reason I'm asking you this is because I und erstood that in certain camps  if the Germans were still there when they were liberated  a lot of the prisoners retaliated.
A lot of people was living in this uh living with this possibility and this was a big possibility for the Christian people to get a not to work and to get goods already  so everybody was in this way quite happy  the Christian and the Jews  so I will continue.

When we came from work we ran around into the -- into this washroom or whatever  there were hori zontal pipes  went to clean up  and maybe we washed something.

OK but you were telling -- off-camera  I want you to tell me on camera -- about the fact that people in the lower classes who had work skills -- I'm not saying \ lower classes \  people have skills.
So  a doctor came from Georgia and I was introduced to him and he was ra ther complimentary as to the fine work I had done  and I told him that everything I did was based upon common sense  but I had no schooling in wate r therapy  but I would like very much to pursue some kind of course.
SL: I was healthy  I used to work like a horse  right?

So he was making all kind backs  so I said Nathan  if you would like to be a friend  give me a little bit work for a few days because Im going back to Germany  I cant find a place here.
So  I arrived there  and I walked in there and that was around 7:00  8:00  and I registered  and I told them I want to work for you and they said okay  go behind there.
I dont know what they were building there  or they were -- they were doing some work there  I dont know.
Well  at that particular time  as I am about to tell you  the system still did not work officially under the Soviet bases  but it was just beginning to be.
They decide that the men should lined up for the following day and that theyre gonna be taken to work.
So my -- they arrange for pape rs  my father started to work in hospital and see my -- the first -- we used to live with my father cousins.
And by that time the Nazis instituted thing s. They instituted for Jews something called forced labor.
Now in  when we arrived in France  I was put to uh work in an ammunition factory  and in that factory they were making  it was and build a  I don't know exactly if the V-2 rocket   but rocket which was designed specifically to shoot airplanes  and of course  mainly the Ameri cans and the Russians  and that was su-a such a tremendous force  they would  they would all the  all the uh the airplane if  if it got in contact with a rocket it would be torn to pieces.
But we didn't go as  you have no idea what  what resistance there was even in the ghettos.
When you were in hometown and you were working  shoveling snow and doing all kinds of work from '40 to '42  how were the Germans treating the Poles  that is the non -Jews?
Put in some colors in the -- Did it work the first time?

I thought it woul d be a good thing to do  I wouldn't have to work maybe full-time  you know  raising kids.
I met -- my father managed to get me a place to work in that particular organization.
So  as we marched on this dark place from work to camp  there was one kapo  a Jewish guard.
And my brother was more involved in it than I  yeah.
And her boss was great  because she did many work what she hes supposed to job do.
And this went on; and I did my job  whatever I could.

As I se -- But I started to make money -- to earn money and I was happy  yeah.
I I you know  I did did good work  and he appreciated it.
And if you were good with all of them  you work together  you were not so lonely.
And maybe a week  or maybe two weeks later  I came -- I work at night at that time.
But  unfortunately we went to work in our work clothes for the night  not knowing that the liquidation would be that night.
So my sister was sent to London  and she went to that home.
He says  you come and work for me in the clothing store.
Did he remember you as the Jewish boy th at he said was too young to work there?
Then my father and my uncle were work with the horses on the field.
Since they always picked out the most looked a little healthy  you know  able to work.
So  I picked up work  kept on working the right way and they come around  the inspectors  the Nazi inspector  they came around and they checked me out  how I worked.
I havent done anything.ﬂ He was at work that day  came home from work.
He was in a position that he knew how to handle the  the Germans in power.
Well I was working at my fathers then and in 50 I started to work at the So there was a state o f Israel?
And then my husband started to work  also for a different place in Belgium.
But the -- it is true that - but if you were an real professional  and there were certain work details -- constant work details  that -- that the -- that was an routine -- it became routine  yeah.
And  could you speak a little Russian with the Russian soldiers that you- Yes  oh  yes.
And how did your mother also work to support the family?
And they have to live inside  sleep  and do work  undern ourished.
So I took the job and it was very difficult at the beginning.
And when the big bombing in London started  it was impossibl e to get to work because there was glass everywhere  water  and you couldnt just go anywhere  it was -- and things were burning and that really brought the war very close to you.
They lie and say they are going some place and it would be changed and for other people they were going to work.
So after the liberation  she told him here  you got a place to work  you got all the machine and fabric  and he start to work.
Yes  as long as people were going out and co ming in  until the last shift went to work  I had to be at the office  to give them the list and then I went home.
He left me down there to do the work  so I did the work. [
When we came to that field where they're they're separating...right  left  right  left...I found out that one Judenschein can save one family  and I had four of them  because I had three from us and one for my father that was out to work in the brigade  so I kept running around between the people  but they already took away both my grandmot hers and both my grandfathers.
22 But did you see groups of people marching  going off to work?
ﬁWe are the best of the best.ﬂ Were trained in sabotage and demolition and the underground work.
And then they forbade Jewish girls to work in Germans houses.
That was my first set of documents that I was made four years older so I could go out to work.
I was still on the  on the care of this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had from the Germans that I cannot work so hard.
So she decided to apply for a job in this military camp  a German military camp.
We -- we lost our en -- en -- and a -- nanny and we lost our maid because our maid said that now everybody is equal she doesnt have to work for -- for rich people.
Well  we used to there was a camp near Stuttgart we used to go to work every day  and we had to go to a village.
So  our camp was one of the camps that provided labor to the area.
Well  sure we know  because they were all prisoners who were kapo  you know na da well  not kapo  the kapo was at work  we were not working.
Imagine you go to work  you come home  and there's no house.
From there al so I took the bus into town to my work.
And in the course of that you could work in the pas -- specific questions that colonel -- Justice Jackson wanted answered for his staff.
And you know  if you cut your head  mean the hand wont work.

Food was delivered daily to the work place  and in the evening at Zahlappel  we were getting our bread and the coffee in the morning.
And that was outside the ghetto  or inside That was part of ghetto then  yeah.
And many times other women  especial the cousins  took the hard work instead of her because they worked  for example in [indecipherable] to do certain amount of wo rk  and she couldnt.
It's one of the couples from Shanghai that I was able to get out in the last minute through my work in the Consulate through their uncle in New York.
I wrote the story about a day in Auschwitz which I called ﬁOne Ordinary Dayﬂ  and its a very it was a very typical difficult day  and we went to work and we worked cutting down marshes along the river to clear the view of the watchtowers because it was October already of 1944  and there were underground activities  and people were escaping and some people we re successful  and some pe ople were not  and those who were not successful were brought back to camp and there was a public hanging or they were shot or whatever  but we were cutting the marshes and it was pouring all day and we stood in Zahlappel and got wet and went to work and even got wetter  and we stood in the mud that was coming up to our knees and the capo was in a horrible mood and the German SS men who were es corting the group with the dogs were horrible  and after returning from work  we were told to sing  and we couldnt sing.
And we had to do as I was at that time 13 years old and I had to do my father's work because we still had to live on to survive  and my father was away in labor camp.
So we were sent there  but they need -- there was a camp set up not far  three miles  maybe two miles  so we could walk every night home  and every night go back to -- and every day go back to work.
From that point on for the next three years everything depended on my mother who quickly found out that her knitting work could be sold by my aunts living in Budapest at much better price than she could sell in Subotica so she developed a major enterprise  cousins  friends  etc.
He said they should have chosen death rather than work for the German war machine.
Did I I assume your husband had a career after the war as well No  he didnt had a career  he took any work.
For the Romanian s he didnt work  he -- [whisper] He said what?
Were they -- Well  this was when we -- they count us inside  we werent yet in the camp.
And I was shiver ing  but still it dries for the next day to go to work.
My father remained there interned and after two months he was set fr ee and allowed to go home  but he wasn't able to find to work and it was very difficult to live.
So how did did you eventua lly how long were you in the DP camp?
Yeah  he got his his start with Mountbatten  out of England   and he got his commission out of England   and then eventually was transferred to a navy commission and and there he started doing his dirty work.
So we went to the Jewish Federation  that I work now for  at that time  because we came with the affidavit  so we got nothing from HIAS  nothing from nobody.
Now  this civil defense work was done because they were afraid of the Nazi attack  am I right?
There were -- there were various Germans  quite a few Germans.
And it was the you know  to repair the socks for SS me n. It was a hugeh and so I got this work and in two months I could restore my health.
I work on the on the autobahn   you know the autobahn in Germany?
Secondly  it gave me the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a farm.
But neither Henry nor I decided to go back to work.
And he -- in the meantime  he was awarded by the Department of Defense -- he worked this summer  he borrowed all the money to go to Georgetown  because I wasnt willing to pay for Georgetown  hes 30 years old  he can do some work in the meantime  which he did.
I think you  I was using Joe Frederick at the time because when I went into the theater  you couldnt have a very ethnicsounding name if you wanted to work.
So we managed to go there with the papers  and we got onto a train that was loaded with German soldiers.
He's a very blunt...uh...guy who had given up a place on a Federal District bench  a life appointment  to take on this temporary th ing  to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish things.
Q. And where -- did you work in a warehouse or -- A. It was a big room.
So thats where they sent took us to and forced labor camp.
His  his nose was out of joint because he was jealous of Justice Jacks on  and he didnt want to play second fiddle to Jackson  really and so  eventually he withdrew completely  but th at didnt stop us  but we were left in place without Donovan  to finish the work that wed been asked to do. (
We have all the time a little...uh...people...were...were fell in battle and...uh...the Germans were...were very happy with their work so they give them all kind of ...uh... sugar  things  other things what there were shortage and but we decided if you are working with the Germans  then we'll ...we'll give you a lesson what we have to do.
But um  yes  um the young people still were able to see  had the energy or interest in seeing their school friends on the only day they didn't have to work.
This was a huge brigade  some thousand  twelve hundred people to a unit  and I don't know how many people were in Ghetto  but we used to go out three or four brigades to work at the airport.
The other camp was Kownitz  where I did a great deal of work  probably more than I did in Belsen  and Eilshausen  the vil -- the -- the center itself .
We had to walk  let's say  maybe 10 miles a day to work.
And um...uh regardless of your beliefs or  you know  race or whatever  you can really achieve whatever you want if you really want and work hard  you know.
The same thing and they opened the ghetto and they heard we were free from work  that the ghetto was open  the miller.
I mean  the more information we got  the harder we had to work in writing it all up.
And then  of course  I was in Montreal only fourth  fifth  sixth  seventh -- four years Interview with Renate Fischer Chernoff June 23  2005 82in Montreal and then we moved to Saint John  New Brunswick  where my father got the job as an intern  but we were not able to join him until the four years were over and h-he was able to get an apartment and get enough money to support us  because my mother did not work after we came to Saint John.
But -- and so Im -- but I s uppose able to obvi -- obviously speak fluently and I was required in th e Czech government to write and to work in Czech.
We have nothing what to do  and...uh...we would like to remain here to work and we will accept an y work they want to give to us.\
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 31 We didn't have much reason to.
When it happens  you're surprised  but then they were sent to Gurs  and I remember--oh at 16  I had toI had to go to work  and I did.
We couldnt 9 work  and -- but somehow  I was young  I still went dancing.
I was assigned a work place so I had a work card.
We know that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough  so we want to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are now only for those who don't work in order to make sure who is...these who are working  so we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto  th irty thousand  should report on the 28th of October on the big square democratic  families-wise and groups of working-wise  you see  and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one place those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't work will get the same rations as now.
Not that we dont take time off to have -- you know  to do nice things  mind you  but -- but when Im not doing something specifically  Im work ing.
Well I think they only wanted us to work ha rd.
But the the overall  the the the people that I knew that were enlistees tended to  I thought  be a little bit easier to to to work with  and get things done.
What what else is so  I say youve been doing the same kind of work for the museum since you started the translating?
Then every night I was at home  have to go back in the morning.
Then the depression was and peo ple were out of work.
And the peril to the work  the var ious events that we get to participate in like the president coming to  to speak to.
And the pink certificates were given at the work where the people -- at the working place where the people worked.
I said  \ Well  to give you some idea  I work for people who need help  who are very much in help.\

Yes  I had - you know - they were all kids  but you know  a fourteen  thirteen year old kid can work pretty well in the laundry  believe me  and that was just as well slave labor as anything.
Then the next day  I would go to work  and when I was working  there was always a chance you could sneak in somewhere and get a pair of -- get another sweater and put it on and then I had something.
So I start seeing the brutality of Amon Goeth  and he said I'm going to shoot every Jew if you're not going to obey  if you're not going to work diligently  so in that time I I saw that we are in for a lot a lot of trouble.
The only reward that we students had  about eight  10 of us  for all the work was to be -- to have dinner after the concert with the visiting artist.
If you sa y you're a furrier or a shoe maker  fixes shoes  you got a lot of shops but you have to know the work.
Okay And I came home in the evening  and he came to visit me.
I mean  they respected her  and she was very much involved in  you know  the work in the kitchen  the making the cheeses  the probably smoking the meats.
That lasted for a week and then I had to go out to work.
And your mother di did she go outside the house to work once the war started  or she stayed at home  still?
So I -- In meantime  I hads works -- I had work done in two fields.
It was a difficult circumstance  so people have complicated ways of -- Look  the people amongst themselves in the barr ack  if th-they were living in an barrack  and worked in the same work detail  yeah  are so ti red at the evening  and we re so busy to look after their own business.
In Holland they moved around from place to place  wherever Pop could find work.
But eventually we were being set up in a sort of lab to work in  in Flossenburg.
He was awarded a United St ates -- so he went to work for the museum  and it was very difficult  but he says he wouldnt quit  or trust anybody with the job.
But to me  he was good because this other friend told him to do it  so he picked me up and they helped me go on the truck and they took me to work supposedly to the Bembitza to bring some merchandise or to bring some supplies.
So you think that it was the quality of their work or?
I got in the little town  there was a little village.
I was uh in \ Arbeitseinsatz\  [NB: \ Special Work\ ]  which is uh a uh labor relation office.
I like to work for you during the summer.ﬂ This was just  you know  when th ey had summer vacations.
In the beginning I didn't work in the kitchen so my girlfriend Hannah  no another girlfriend used to make pancakes  no potato pancakes threw them in a little oven there and with the sand and the dirt and everything just like baking them and we were supposed to swallow them because you couldn't chew them.
We envied those lucky enough to be chosen for work assignments in Auschwitz.
Yeah  you figure everythings g onna work out just fine  you know.
They want to immigrate to Israel   but thats -- it didnt work out.
We went out to a railroad track or we had some meetings and so on  so on and daytime  even back to work  no one did know that we are farmers  although in daytime I used to deliver leaflets  I mentioned.
She and him got hooked up to work out some way that we going to try to escape from that place.
And he was ma king a good living so I really didnt have to work anymore.
This is again  ironic  because Auschwitz was already operating  and going to Germany was probably not a bad thing at that point because it meant going to a labor camp.
I was there for close to two years  then later on I came home and I went to work as an apprentice tailor.
Filled out the form  and then every hour a policem an would come out with a stack of forms that had been at -- ei-either accept or rejected  and he would call out the names  and so I had to -- took time off from work  just stand there and wait  because I didnt want my name to be called every hour because there would be enough people to -- who would recognize it  and I might be in deep trouble.
They escaped and at the morning count when they saw that the six people are missing Karl Rheinger told us that when we come back  60 would be shot and now go to work.
Oh  I was -- well  yes  but when it came to th e vote in the room  the Czech work orderly and I voting no swung the -- sw-swung the balance.
There was what was called Factory Gestapo  Work Gestapo  and they had noticed that we had loaded this  and they noticed that we transported it and behind the Gestapo came SS man.
Every morning w you had to Interview with Noah Roitman April 8  1999 28come in the front of the ghetto  and from the ghetto they took the people to work.
And I went to work one time  the the Wehrmacht...the Wehrmacht was standing and...and watched us all.
They like to have farms  and -- and -- and -- and land and -- and animals  and have somebody else do the work.
The Fr ench government fed us and the Germans made us work.
His paper appeared in the morning and  so he had to work all night.
So we went visitor services is is the work that we ended up doing.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 34 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: They were washed and--and that was done  not only for festi--for festivities--that was really our ma--some- times our main dish.
But the people didn't really come back to Auschwitz to sleep  but they went out to work with another small camp  was also run through the Auschwitz uh management if you want to call this right.
Some were trying to actually work their way to get into Russia.
Did your parents have to work at that time  outside of the ghetto or inside?
But he was quite successful in his -- in his work and he loved every minute of it.
We will work for the war effort but we will be treated well.
I was in ghetto with my husband three days and then they took him to work.
I was not there three months and there was a sculptor and he was making a face for Hitler  and I was talking to him he was a because I was going on what's going on?
So the second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh some kind of carriage...carriage uh platform   two wheel and somebody was personally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this war factory and uh some some uh margarine  some very important cleaning things  again supplies  games...several very practical things  and he put these in and it was a little bit interesting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying convert  and he is making what is necessary to make  so to ask the leadership that I have right to buy these or to bring these in  so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in this in this chil...children home.
Oh for one thing it was an economic move because that was the time of  you had the depression here and my mother as a matter of fact  took work.
Were -- were we going to be sent over to the camps ourselves?
I remember we barely got there and we and they made us go to sc hool  and they made the adults work.
And after I had also to work very hard outside in  that winter I didn't have classes because I took only one lesson.
And I did take a test to work with the Nuremberg trials  actually.
The work was very interesting because that was at the time that semi conductors were just becoming useful and the university--and actually took some courses at the University of Redding on semi conductors because the work I was doing in that research lab was growing semi conductor crystals and whatnot  so that was trying to duplicate the work done by Bell labs.
I mean  we saw the barbed wires  the watch towers and the other inma tes  and -- but we were  we didn't have to do any work.
I used to help out in the Judenrat   my father asked me to come and do some work there.
I went to work for him and by the same time  I went to get a degree.
So they said that they have received some supplies from from parachutes that they and they had some assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going i f they are going to be close by  they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage sabotage work.
The city had a gardening establishment and we were given them to garden there and -- What kind of work?
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 46 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: whelmed me with  with work yes.
And my dad  who was also from Hungarian background  he was actually work ing in neighboring town as a manager for a Jewish bigger firm  like a little wholesaler  but a bigger town than ours.
Some people when they receive the paper gave us  I dont know  they gave us 20 dollars or so  or nothing  we dont ask the money  because they see how much work it has.
So  23 in order to get Eka to Paris was about six months work.
I used to work on the fields also  on tractors  used to repair  I learned there.
What was your job in the intelligence work  when you were now on company level  I believe  and you were part of the what did you do?
So  you say -- youll say dep -- theyll say deported so you kn -- you know [indecipherable] in the beginning people were sort of told they should ma -- they were deported to someplace -- the German told them so  they being deported somewhere to work  you know.
In this place where you used to work came Gestapo and asked for you  and if even if you are converted  you better run away  because they are after you.
Do you remember the a -- the orchestra playing when you went out to work  or not?
At least she didnt have to work in because the all the other and the other industry was logging.
The first feeling is one of being relieved and the second feeling is oh my but how is this really going to work out.
I mean  she didn't work all night  its the next day.
Uh it was such a i ntensive life  because even with all this long work  and all the social things and all the personal things was going on  and all diseases around you.
And they had two children  4 and 7  and I could work in the laboratory and I could go to the Southwestern University  er  Methodist Univer sity.
If you work  uh... Georg or the German from SS called Bartz  they got  nu  sticks  rubber sticks.
>> Bill Benson: What were you forced to do when you were there?
And Otto had to work hard to keep Edith happy and to .to keep everything going.
Here I am doing extra work for somebody and I don't see anything.
They were looking for allied spies  they were looking for -- you know they had millions of foreign workers in Germany also  th ey had been forcibly deported to work in the armaments industry.
I -- sometimes to work I had to have my fathers shoes in -- in winter  because I put newspaper -- paper  whatever we found in  because we were working cutting re -- reeds  and that was standing on ice  sometimes little water.
and from time to time there were small aktion  and they came  they took Jews to work  the camps  etcetera  the camps that were around our city.
And in this unprecedented catastrophe  it was certainly important for the American Jewish committee -- c-community  to have representatives in Germany  for observation  for suppla -- for relief work and even though it could not bring -- it could not -- there was not the transportation available to bring over supplies from the States  to help feed and so forth  we -- we could do immigration counseling.
And uh we were there two years ago  and I asked what were...what were the camp s around there; and they told me there was a great many camps there.
And he agreed to it  and he kept me there as a farm's worker  and I just did farm work.
But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition  and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months  which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the factories to work or to the -- they had a stone mine there that they were digging from.
So I went to from the  from the Altestenrat to the  to the work- shops.
I find some water  washed away the blood and returned to work.
We had to   we had to dig and it was a hard work for a child.
Did you stay on this road work the whole time -- I remember  yes.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 15 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: know to write it.
And so I went in to work and when I finished my work I walked down to see whats happened.
People take a long siesta and I said well  if I work a little for him during siesta time and I have a little time in the evening and work for myself  and he had about 20 acres  or maybe 30 acres.
A nd they bring them up when we come from work.
Produced wrong information  cause they engage d in so-called consultants  a famous from Auschwitz  who didn't know the difference between an  an  Jehova h Witness and an Jewish and a non-Jewish person who had a love affair with a Jewish man  they were differently marked  the women's camp had their own  yeah and I will probably sit down with you and explain to you my activities and my functions and my work in the drawing office.
But they got burned in no time so we still ha d to work without anything  with hot hands.
You were able to get -- Its a -- matter of fact  when I went in -- when I work in [indecipherable] think the Germans were more scared of me than I wa s of them  because I spoke a better German than those -- those volkdeutscher who came to him.
It didn't work out too well because they locked us into the apartment  which is not the worst thing  but there was no food.
They were unable to work  but if we would have left them without registration  without i.d.
I came on a Wednesday  and on a Thursday  I already had a job.
Another thing in those camps  in Auschwitz Sunday when we didn't go to work even if it was cold  we had to stay outside the hole day.
That made them do double work and they put up barracks and we moved into the barracks around December.
My sister stayed in -- in Newark  thats where my aunt lived  to see - she says  ﬁWhy dont you go and see what its like?ﬂ My relatives in Newark said  why dont you go and work for cousin Joe?
My sister  my brothers and sister they went to work and they came home.
Since I didn't know the language  I work ed in a shoe factory.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 I was working  but I couldn't work with people  because I didn't speak a lot of English.
They used to catch men and take them to the camp  to work in camp.
We were counted 300 people  and as I said  I assumed we're going to work.
And -- and concentrating on it  you know  while thinking about that  doing all your work  youre not making mistakes  you know  you didnt want to ruin the piece of leather  it was very precious.
But they wanted to have something from the farms  so the farmers used to go over there to work  and at night they went away.
They were right away looking for Jews to go to work.
And they find out about me  and  you know  some of them had money to pay for my work and some of them didn't have any money even.
So we didnt want to fight  so we decide okay  well work with you  well be [indecipherable] Ill be the sergeant.
Because only a group of men can go out to work.
So they could work people to death and then the bodies  I don't even know what th ey did with the bodies  whether they were taken to a crematorium in Auschwitz or not or whether they were ta ken care of locally.
He called me out and he said  'Do you want to work for me?'
It was lots of work so in Demmark at that time one had to have a vocational school of this sort as a uh resident for turning up for the agriculture school.
I did all the work for my master's except I didn't ha ve time to write it.
My dad of course was still work ing on the pier.
And they announced the names you know that was also the work of the Committee they made 8 the list  the passenger list and they divided the passengers to wherever they wanted.
Uh  the life was there  uh  to be honest  in the beginning  in the beginning when the transports came before me  there was no any group  work group  in the  uh  Sobib or .
They were in prison for murder  and they were in charge of us  so there was one particular guy  we used to call him Mr. X. He used to take a group of hundred  two hundred people out to work every day  and for sport every day used to drown one or two of them  just for the sport.
When I used to work for SS (17) with my father  I used to-- I took him  I says  you better come with me.
Now  the Haganah organized two departments to work outside of Palestine.
One of them was the Royal Palace  and when one looks at photographs of the destruction  one sees that that was not regular mining work done there I have establis hed that a special sort of coal dust was pumped into the basements of such a buildi ng  which was then detonated.
I was very weak and everybody was laughing because I cannot work too much.
I -- I -- it was a nice -- it was -- it was a nice -- it was a nice life for a child and certainly it had to be for my parents  you know  because they had a position in the community and -- and that wa -- that was -- You said your father was a cantor  was that his full time work?
What was the Oh  the different camps had different the work  more different.
24 But it is true that the day of the Nazi Plan screening I was very  it was like three months of work  it was like your movie is about to open  and I was very keen to get there.
And while I was not going to work because I couldnt even walk  the order came out that we had to get out of this particular house  because in the meantime maybe thousands  maybe 1 500 were deported.
And if I tell you what my first work was  you will shutter.
After awhile I -- I went there  and I learned a lot of things to -- to do with my hands  to fold paper  to -- it was a lot -- you didnt learn any reading or writing  you played  you sang  and you did a lot of handy work  too.
She had come to this country to unite with family and it didnt work out  as so often it didnt  but she made a life for herself.
Now  we are coming to the new place to work  and there is no room for us yet because the other women whom we are replacing are still there.
12 In Flossenburg  the only work we did  my group that came  was bundling up the uniforms or clothing from people who they killed  coats  coats  pants  pants  shoe s  shoes.
I stayed home with the children  and he didnt gi v -- my father was that time in -- my father went to work  and he said  ﬁI help you threw him out -- thray -- threw him out -- throw him out -- throw hi m out.ﬂ But I -- you know how it is  he didnt let himself be thrown out.
Some from the...from the guards  they said  \ Oh  you go to work somewhere.ﬂ And we thought  oh  the same way--we go where to work.
In other camps when people arrived like at Auschwitz there was a selection made  and mothers and children  and people of 50 and over were often k illed  but people who were able to work were chosen for work and for life.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 23 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: full concentration.
Were a lot of tailors and carpenters and all  was not steady work.
They're gonna select thousand woman and take them to...to that work  do those trenches.
One day when she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing.
So I went to work in the taiga--you know  in the woods.
But since they wanted to have us work for them  they brought in new machinery.
And this was six weeks there  and after six week  we have to go to work.
And the professor who had taught us physiology was just amazing and I wanted to work of him in the worst possible way.
It was that kind of abnormal societ y. There was some other work going on and we were fed reasonably well  comparatively well  comparison with later food.
You know  I have six business trips between now and November  which  if Damon were not ill at the moment  is probably  you know  not an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 116 awful lot  but I -- you know  I have to do some prep work for some of those and so when do I fit this thing in?
She had to -- she was our boss  you know  our blockalteste.
And by that time my sister was fifteen and she had to go out and work.
I had a cousin there  and I didn't tell her; and the same day she say  \ I will make some food \  when she work in the where the laundry 20 for the Germans and she had a chance to cook something.
Everybody got a meager ration  had a ration card but everybody got a bowl of soup by the place of work.
So one day before we find out  when my boyfriend went to work  they took like seven or eight people and they didn't come back to the ghetto  they run away.
We did all – all  whatever – whatever work we did for this time; and – an d from Flossenburg  they picked some kommandos.
He had a hat with a feat her and I would motion to people that the feather was coming so everybody started to work  so -- because I had seen him beat Thomas Buergenthal 7 November 28  1995 Page 7 a lot of people if he caught them not working.
I didnt want him to feel  ﬁWell  I work for Dad.ﬂ First show that you can do it on your own  and then you can come talk to me  and then well -- well see where we go.
I left everything...everybody  because you were afraid because you want to work for the underground and now your own people for whom you are working so hard are calling you to be a Jew.
I ha -- I -- I was not -- not a hard worker  I -- I didnt work at all  I think.
But hes -- Well  you have the letter  the Americ an  and that was an Italian that -- An Italian -- work with us.
>> Alex Schiffman -Shilo: She never had the occasion to work as a Hebrew teacher.
Now  I used that word 6:00 to 8:00 because we did not have prescribed hours that you work to 10:00 or until 12:00.
I mean  obviously it was because of the conditions that you were in  a single mother and having to work and go to school.
And in the more eastern part  where the farms are bigger  and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work this time as a real farmhand.
Was there other did he hire people outside the family to work?
From there on we started to do our work the following four years about.
And did your parents was your mother did she work outside the home  or No.
So first of all we start to slow down the work  and we start to talk to other people around.
Theres some Germans who work there on post  but you know  you dont have to mingl e with the German p opulation.
Going in from work   thats a new one  a Ukrainian pulled him out  stripped him --they stripped once my uncle also.
And the first six months I didnt go to work  I did nothing  but it was the worst -- one 54 of the worst times in my life.
I say  \ You want me \  I say  \ go to Israel  vote for you to secu re the life for your grandchildren  and my grandchildren shall work for you?
But then practicality took over and they figured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them  lets work around that basic law and make a second law.
And Ma rcella Kubilutai also in this house  which arranged my -- me to work there.
She was caring for me and she was trying to care for my baby sister.
He could not work on our farm  because our farm was within a village and too many people would have seen him.
I was never able to get an advantage in any way whereby I could work a little less or get a little extra food  I was very anxious to preserve that for myself and not tell anybody else about it and so  if anything  that mentality was probably one of the ugliest aspects of our im prisonment because we became totally oblivious to those around us -- sometimes to the extent that if you saw somebody who was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the feelings that would come to your mind fi rst was boy  am I glad its not me.
And since we didn' t go to work and had some food  we were probably in much better physical shape.
So my mother and sister and I got permission to work in a factory.
Most of them are living near the factories because their parents are working there  and our connections are more based on our school work.
Throwing the empty shells on my f ace  because I fell asleep because the hot  the heat from the oven staying for twelve hours work ing.
I was very happy that I could do such a thing.
They worked  they sent them out  since he became 12  he worked  came out two or three times a week to go to work  in the winter mostly by snow a nd the summer on the roads and other things.
So I asked him  can I please work in the sewing -- on 7 the sewing machine.
But then the boss pulled me out of th ere and he gave me a job in the office -- as -- in a supervisory job and -- so that was pretty good.
After moving to the United States in 1961  Nat got a job as a dental assistant with plans to be a dentist b ut a job offer to work for a major toy manufacturer began Nat's long career as a businessman and entrepreneur starting several successful import/export companies.
Interview with Wies 22 August 15  2018 But that was rather recommended that to work together with people whom you didnt know before and used pseudonyms which were different arrested  you are beaten tortured  you couldnt say if you didnt know.
When you were working for this family  wh at kind of work were you doing?
So peopl e doing this kind of work were called gandy dancers.
Did you have to work at all while you were there or did you -- were you hiding most of the time because of the -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 20 No.
They had work details  is that what these were   they made them go out to build roads  is that what they were doing?
And he had an easy field because Germany was so bad there and people couldnt find any work so he blamed everything on the Jews.
And we literally would have to have groups of guys because to cut telephones  there would be enough to send a group of two  three guys; one at that stay watch and two to do the work  cutting it down.
I didnt know -- they were [i ndecipherable] were telling this  they go for a -- easier work  for a better work.
And were then sort of detailed to work on railway sites that had been bombed  to repair them -- very often  with time bombs going out -- going off at place-places.
I have one thing in mi nd  is to work  and to make money  and not to be poor any more.
05:03:53 They gave us some watery soup  and mostly we  we picked  there was spring already  and we learn how to pick what  what work  was edible  like some berries  and spinach.
Rife was rumors that something is going to happen and uh it gave it it caused us all to be very active  to run from place to place to to listen for some rumors  and I remember being one day uh together with my brother who was uh twenty at that time...I was fourteen...in front of a building  in that house the German work office  labor office uh and people...whatever there were there...maybe two or three hundred people standing and milling around.
Yes  she actually for a while  she always loved to stitch maybe a pillow or something  and she was offered something if she wanted to do even at home  if she wants to do some stitching on mens jackets  working piece work.
It actually ORT is doing this kind of work now all over the world  not just for Jews because now Jews go to colleges and they theyre what So its like a trade school.
The bad ones used to be  like  big  ol d. And one day  I went to work.
Yeah  it'll work  but it just keeps the du st out  it keeps it more protected.
I mean  they didnt gas them  they put them in the gas chamber.
We want to conduct ourself properly  we want to go by vote  we want to go and work hard and perhaps we will succeed.
It looked like Vaseline  but I can't believe that 79 Vaseline alone could have cured  but anyway  at l east the things were not full of mud and dirt  which I would have gotten in the regular barracks  or even going to work.
A nd then we embarked in a place that I found later on was called Plaszow.2 Plaszow was a combination of work camp and extermination camp.
And work in legal services  where youre essentially trying to do something similar to that on an individual basis.
And it wasnt that easy  English was -- so I had to really learn to read and write English  and so it took -- took a lot of work.
But the men were all assigned to work in the camp and the girl s were all assigned to work in the new  you know  recep tion center in the hospital.
I've had to do a lot of work on that  but it helps to talk about it  and it my talking about it helps somebody else  I'm glad to do it.
And so when they stopped everything  we still were waiting because the railroads didnt work  and this didnt work.
So I had to work it up  I never had a course in modern history in my life.
And then I went to meet up with the Dalchovitz family  and at the time I already heard that three girls from Debrecen went to Baranovichi and they situated themselves with work over there.
Well  there were the   the  there were really different kinds of camps  concentration camps and death camps.
You cannot criticize -- well  the story was ma -- my husband needed Q clearance for his work  and so ah -- I -- I did take out my citizenship and it was a very formal thing in Knoxville  Tennessee in the old-fashioned way and it was wonderful.
Later on  the German wouldn't allow it  they would allow only work  and they demanded work of children who were very young.
Harry knew that in Castelnot theres only farm work  thats no future.
RL: Very hard working  the man doesnt have to work any more  hes still working  hes still pushing th -- and he doesnt need the money  its not the money any more.
They didnt and the ne xt day as usual  as before  whoever is sick stays in the barracks  whoever is good goes to work  thanks to Henklewerk and that SOB Fiess.
I went to work for G.E. and in 1955 I became a nuclear engineer.
I climbed down  climbed down and they said  \ You tried  but it just didn't work.\
But we came out the other way of the -- of the room  and we didnt have anything.
They said that this group will go to work for the Germans.
And then you would -- did y ou march to the place of work?
He send me a letter  he says  ﬁIf you wa nt to come and work with me in Tokyo  Ill have you any time.
I got a little bit of soup and a piece of bread  but there I couldn't lay down.
Well  shortly after I arrived at Camp Ritchie it became clear the govern the army had decided that the program of dropping people didnt work  the Germans were too well organized.
And we had a big yard in front  so we got up in the morning and I said to th is young girl  you'll help me and we 'll clean the good in front very thoroughly  so tomorrow  we won't have to work.
Your parents are in different camps  where the work is lighter.\
They took off the cast from my leg because I had to go to work after that.
And for money  they could make it that it's not for myself to go to every day to work for Zwangs [NB: \ compulsory\ ] labor to be assigned... to have my assignment; my labor should be to the factory.
We were  we had  for instance  in Sachsenhausen  in Auschwitz  on Sunday when we didn't go out to work  Saturday  they had to go  I never worked in Auschwitz because I was always in the hospital the  the  the re-re-reeducational camp.
The report was work product for the attorney and for the historian.

They were selling  if they had any jewelry  they were selling  so I don't think at that time  and look  I was a young girl  and I was concerned with working and meeting boys later and so on  and doing some school work  so maybe I did not delve into that too deeply.
We did not eat  in spite we get anyhow  almost nothing to eat  but we did not because we kept it for the evening  we went out to work  but we did not eat  but in the evening when we came back  the camp  the  the blockeldest kept the food for us because you know  we didn't eat  he gave us the food.
07:03:36 Well  I figure  well  I know my work  and I coul d make a very beautiful sample and stuff like this  anyway  I figure out  what I do; what I do  I  I went for the interview.
We were put in a barrack and the four hundred and fifty of us were assigned to work in a in a in a warehouse where iron devices like uh axles for trucks and so on were being stored and we were caused to move it and required to move it and assemble it and pile it and so on.
And their horses were my father was taking care of the horses in the as blacksmith to put them shoe the horses.
Uh  in some cases  people who did not work received half of the normal rations.
First of all they came in and took my husband and two brothers to work  but they came right away back.
Was there a ghetto -- when they came in  the Germans came in to your town -- did they set up a ghetto immediately?
And each time later with Nazis entering in the same way and going through the selections  right and left  and being beaten up  and being taken to Slonim to jail  and then winding up in a work labor camp until the partisans freed us.
The next morning  I met the people I should work with and I came back home and I said  we really thanked them from the bottom of our hearts  but we don't stay here  this is not for us.
I...I can be committed to a goal  but it still is harder for me to work towards  because I'm just a humanbeing.
So at one point when the allies were pushing the Germans back to Germany -- actually  at one point the Germans put the Iron Guard inmates on a train bound for Germany where they were going to send them to a camp.
Was she both proud of your work and yet mi ssing you a great deal  wishing that you were in London with her?

I w ould like to work because I heard that there is wanted a boy his bakery.
She too was educated to work in a bank  and there she met Ljudevit  who was 10 years older than she  and they fell madly in love  and he  as everybody else in Ludbreg besides the Jews  was Catholic.

So these -- so does that answer your que -- and these were the Jews that were in these camps.
I was two days in th is country  I went to work.
So some -- at night  when we used to hear some trucks would be come in to the ghetto and we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0011 14didnt know if this is theyre coming to grab some people -- to grab them from the ghetto  or te -- or to -- they are people -- actually Christians who are coming back from work.
Because  you know  not having a name  you are always referred as a number  and when they call X number of people for detail or work somewhere  you happen to be in the same unit of numbers  so that was lucky.
She gave us everything what we wanted and we helped in the business  I used to go to school and excuse myself at 12 :00 and be home and work in the business.

Becau se what he did  he withdrew from the League of Nations  as you know  started building up all this war armament  opened up all these factories to build all these weapons  and it made it possible for a lot of Germans people to go to work.
You know  a lot of German Jews  they didn't want to leave because they were German first and Jews second.
And then they put me on -- then I had to work on documents di -- di -- that was already in preparation for the war crime trials in Nuremberg later on.
So  they used to bring in the camp  and we used to share.
And what we had to do is we had to work with the food  so that the food had to be ready by 8:30.
was that the work detail was where the cardex of all the skills.
>> Bill Benson: I think  during that time  your father lost his business.
I went a little bit forward  and let me see  where was the first -- But what did -- did you work?
And then they had that is where the ghetto was formed.
So the apartment changed in a way  and Dad did this that is to say  did this kind of work from 1934 until my parents left Germany in the spring of 39.
I I wouldnt work for those people  I well  I knew them  I had worked with them before.

And a lot of people from the villages were coming to Starachowice already in the ghetto to look for work  but they had to come somehow  maybe they were brought by the Germans  I couldnt tell you  but I know that we had an Arbeitsamt  which is a labor bureau  whatever you call it  where people were co ming and asking for work because they knew from the other places that only the ones that will work will live.
When the next morning when they woke us up and lined us up in front of our barracks  they told us after breakfast  you're going to report to work.

But in Lichtenstein  the work was the killing method of people.
So very soon the family had to depend on selling whatever possessions we had  including my stamp collection and handy work that my mother could organize  which she did extremely well.
And then there was the guardhouse and all the big chain of commands when we went to work were taken out and taken back to the barracks  you know  they were free.
And I told him  you know  he give me something there what I didnt like the work  you know  that cutting.
They had...they sent recruiters out to the various chiefs and got people to work.
Probably -- probably not at the time  because I was so involved in my own work.
And that we could -- that we could do duty in the -- on the trains ourselves  so the SS wouldnt have to do all that hard work of herding the people into the -- into the -- into the -- into the freight trains.
They would wait for me outside my apartment  when I came back from work.

We were constan tly running back and forth the whole night and four o'clock in the morning we had to go to work.
It wasn't like in the United States you could go to work and get on a train.
And on December 22nd  1942 I was given papers to a work camp again in the French part of Switzerland.
Also  the mine  the people who was the regular job  we took their coal.
I had to work very hard  24 because the French school system at the time was very difficult to get through.
So then my father eviden tly spent another year and a half or two years - 41 until 44  I guess - to try to get papers to come to Israel since the American plan didn't work.
I think Father was at work  and my mother burst out crying.
How could you be the -- werent the people on work details?
One thing led to another and I started to go into schools and I started to go into universities  started to go into synagogues and I started to work with Mayor Daly  our mayor in Chicago.

Harder work and then stayed in Buchenwald for a while and then they How long were you in Buchenwald?

I did go in -- they picked me to go work for the gentile hospital.
So instead of really speaking German the way I knew German  since I also li ved in Danzig  you may recall  I would kind of speak a broken [indecipherable] German  which helped me also to get some bread  you know  from the Germans or some food when I had my -- my paper as a vol -- as a future volunteer  you know  in German army.
And because of that our families were put in a camp.
Or was that–were they happy to see the Germans or was it just usually the ethnic Germans?
So we always instilled in them that it is important for everybody to work for equality  not just for yourself or your own group  but for all groups.
So I went to work and  when I had already a job for the three of us  and an apartm ent  I got in touch with my friends and I brought them over.
And then the Army went to England  and my father continued to work as a doctor  and everybody had families.

I 36remember one day -- I used to work on the night shift  and I ve seen some guys used to go down near the camp.
Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 80 Hard work  because they they they live outside.
As a matter of fact we all did very little work.
We had in the ghetto a civilian administration which was in charge of the sanitation  in charge of police  employment agency and whatever  and every morning people used to line up and the German or Latvian guards came and took people to work.
And...uh...in my case as the Polish priest  also  we had to work everyday in this so called plantation.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother  when you described her  what she did  the courage that that took  to not only have a hidden identity  but to go right into the den of the enemy  right into their camp and work.
First of all you dont know that they ar e taking you  they say you -- theyre taking for work.
There was a lot of time she brought the kids home when I brought the kids home from school at night all day she was working  and when I brought them home at night  I took over and she went to work.
>> Bill Benson: So what -- to your knowledge  what did your mother do now?
So lets talk about what you were doing when you were [indecipherable] So we ended up in that we -- we -- I guess we discussed it with my uncle and my grandmother  and we decided I sh ould go and work.
And what did you do during the day in the ghetto?
He was shot soon after because he wasn't able to do that kind of work.
I don't know if my father worked for him or anything or if he did any of his work  but I'm sure he helped him if there were any problems.
And this was everything and th ey took me out to work.
So  it wasn't a tremendously successful thing for me  and besides which  I didn't work there very long because I got sick again  and I came down with Para-typhoid  and this was the last  these were the last weeks of the camp  and  if anybody ever tells you that you cannot survive without food for a long time  I don't think that we were given any food in that camp towards the end of the  the  the occupation.
A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary  to have an accountant to work for him.
So I went to the elevated stat ion that we went to when we went to work at Siemens and 72 then walked toward the factory  but didn't walk all the way  but sort of hid in the entrance of an apartment building which was still a bl ock or two away from the factory  but where people at the shift change would sort of stream past.
INTERVIEWER: Did it take a special kind of person to do the ki nd of work both of you did?
There were only a few lines actually  we haven t heard for such a long time  are you well  Im sorry you have to work so hard  write  and you know that s just these few line s. And my husband actually he died three year s ago but before that went back to Poland because apparently they have quite a few archives there too  to see if he could fi nd out what happened to my family  but they had records of people who died a natu ral death  but not records of peop le who were eventually sent away or deported so we ne ver found out what happened.
What happene d in the ghetto of Siauliai  Lithuania on November 5  1943  SS and Gestapo with the help of Ukranians  Ukranians that left the Russians and joined the evil cause so many of them just came -- so many of them just came and joined to kill Jewish people  it was terrible time -- they went into the ghetto  they found every hiding place  they went in  they broke every dish  every pillow  made every single person come to the gate near that place where you gathered for work  all the children  all the elderly  all the sick  all the babies that were born illegally in the ghetto.
They used to even take him into the partisans and let him work there as a barber or as a tailor or play the violin for them.
So we try and work together because Jewish people and Polish people go through the hell  through the second World War  and we should understand each other be tter  and -- and help each other  you know  in a many -- when you -- so-called political matters.
Because in the kind of world that I lived  children were the work of the mother .
The other one what I remember from the ghetto  when we went out to work.
This was like -- the ghetto was already -- no  the ghetto was not.
And I'm happy till this day with the conviction I made not to work against the tide  but to go with the tide.
You see the SS only was the guard  while the prisoners themselves were the people who did all the work inside the camp.
So there was no steam coming fro m Marburg then we couldn't work.
The work was more or less the same  working around the clock.
And I went back to my work in the asbestos mine.
And as Mira was saying  there was no one else f to work for them.
And so when you were in for forced labor  were you living in the ghetto?
One day we coming up  we coming to the camp after the work and they saw already  in each place from the Appellplatz was the German with the rifle  with the machine gun  and we say  ﬁOh  oh  something happen.ﬂ And three young boys was hanging because he say they want to escape from the camp.
And you know  that was a voluntary confession that you cannot work any more  but I didnt care.
And to clean  to work and maneuver to work in anything.
Like when she went to work in New York in the morning  she would get up I think at six in the morning in order to be able to leave the house at a quarter to eight.
8 What we have not in this -- the United Stat es  I am scared because my children learned the French and now if you like ask for some French -- It doesnt work.
A nd they came back and said  in that case you will work on the land.
Well  I want to thank you very much for taking the time.
From the regular work you could be sometim es selected to do some special work like maybe cleaning the pit toilets or  or doing so mething around outside the camp.
Went down  I applied  got the job  was able to take I was not allowed to work unless I brought til my kids were in school  home for the kids after school  those were the rules.
I use to sit on the bench and work and my mind use to be  then it got to be so good  so fluent.
Did your grandmother help your grandfather in this job  in this work that hed had for this I ha dont know.
Now  wont you tell me about what your day to day work was?
There were telephones  of course not in great use but still.
An order came through from headquarters  everybody at the age of 12 and every man the age of 60 had to assign themselves to work.
So I rather concentrate on the Master Gardeners Association  where I can do something  actually work.
Six years when I met you so eight years I guess  and it was interesting work in a way that I had to do anything from designing circuitry to supervisi ng the assembly line to designi ng the cabinets and having them photographed for of the advertising brochure.
I clutched  in those days I already wore glasses  and I clutched them in my hand because I knew if I don't have glasses  I wouldn't be able to do any work  I wouldn't be able to to see very well  so I clutch  and thank God no one ever uh discovered.
He replied that...uh...he would be willing and happy to work...to have me work with him  but he couldn't pay me.
The real problems came in 1942 when -- in 1940  first my father was to go to work camp  but that was a very minor and -- We'll talk about that.
There were rumors that people who are not working will go to work  uh will be compelled to to go to some labor camps outside of the of the ghetto and to to work in the forests.
And then I went to work as a full-fledged fur-furrier in Budapest and  and  and Miskolc.
So  are you doing this work at the same time that Mario went into the army?
In your years of social work  I wonder if you might tell us a little more about what the scars are  and how serious are they for the children and grandchildren of the survivors?
And...uh...some of this will later maybe explain why I even got started in the work that I did much  much later in my life.
They actually did later on through the war did a dirty job  a dirty war for the Nazis  because Germany or the Nazis did not occupy Romania per se  but the Iron Guard did their dirty work.
And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being trained to do parachute jumping  to do signa ls -- signal work so they could send out messages after theyd jumped into Germany  and so forth.
Well he went to study  post graduate work at the University of Vienna and he met m y cousin and they dated while he was there.
There were then only two of us who wanted to work the I. G. Farben case.
In the meanwhile  th -- since then  Ive done a lot of genealogical work out -- one of our sons is very interested in that and he is on the computer and doing all kinds of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 79 stuff.
They said that they are going to work on a -- work in a camp  a working camp.
I also learned how to do very fine Carpentry and after a while  I was good enough that I went to work in the shops  which is obviously a safer place.
You know  when we came to camp  we had to make sure we had to have a plac e to sleep  and everything is there.
So you never know  I mean the dead ones don't talk and the ones who killed them wouldn't' talk  so  and with this guy I'll get to  I'll tell you my philosophy and the suffering which got me through it  because when we carried those pre-fab sections  it was horrible  real back-breaking work  I thought  it'll kill me and I couldn't believe that I survived it and I didn't want to die the next day  because I said if I survived that  I don't want to die now and then it was again some very hard work and somehow managed to survive and then just didn't want to kill myself  but it would have been a way out  so it just  one hardship after another hardship  sort of just kept me going.
And she had met her...she works now as a representative for the Polish people that work in the Embassy.
But when somebody is si ck and couldnt work  then they found it.
And I worked for a time -- that was brutal work and I saw the men -- th-the Jewish men work at the open ovens  you know  where the -- the smelting was done and where -- that was in-incredible -- that was just incredible.
You know  there were quotas involved and all that  and so my brother went to -- to a -- a commerce high school  you know  tried to get a degree there  and that didnt last very long  but my father -- my brother never mentioned any -- any overt or direct confrontations as such  because again  the Jewish community  even though it wasnt a modern city like Lvov  was still very  very closely knit  you know  and there was very little interaction  except for the -- some the servants that would work  10 or some workers that would come to work  etcetera .
>> Bill Benson: And when you went  it was intended to be just a short stay but it didn't work out that way.
In the summer of 1941  perhaps even in the la te spring of 1941  the Topor ol organization  that organization that was dedicated to the agricultural work  sees an opportunity of utilizing all empty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for the starving ghetto.
So the first thing we did is -- we got -- when I was permitted to work  I got a job and we lived in a city housing project.
We all had to work and as long as we were able to work and be of help to the Germans we were -- we would be aloud to work.
And so we -- we got married and I didnt quite know whether I want ed to go into social work any more.
And he say when he goes to a work camp  I go too; when I can help him.
I hadnt done much work in machine shop  but I was interested in those things.
But for us it was very difficult   so it was a life which is almost difficult to understand.
You went to work in the fields when you were twelve  then how long did you continue to work?
If he decided to do something  he would he he didnt have second th oughts  he would make an effort to make it work.
The only thing it is to work and get food for it.
I continued my work at the villa bringing back news that things for the Germans are turning bad.
And my sister lost her job  she couldnt work because the if -- there was no work  and my brother -- and my brother also didnt work.
In fact   there was some ghetto  it was not as large a ghetto.
Doctor  tell me what is and she kept him and he told her I have to go to work.
For instance  the high holidays of course my father  that was his work time.
But And you said how long did you how many years did you work for the navy?
I was in  I think it was before we reached Luxembourg  because I recall work on Adolf Hitlerstrasse in   which is in Luxembourg.
Because the same organiza tion picked up the children and put them in other the reason we got why how come from Germany  we would have to take her off the train not that we mind taking them in  because in 38 we were still innocent  because the parents would have to work in different states  so those children needed a home.
Uh...Now Everybody by that time was killed and the...my...uh...during the war  there was  of course  no...not much money because my Aunt Etty...uh... husband worked for the...they made him work for the German and they didn't pay.
And -- and this is when I told her  you know  was all -- you were not also allowed to divulge if somebody was sick  because if you were sick  then you were not of any value that y-you could possibly still work.
Women in Columbia play Canasta all day long and men  who work duri ng the day  I mean work  this wa s  my uncle was a very rich 33 business man.
Uh they were  once another group of men were sent to another uh transport in some woods to do some very hard work.
Suddenly my father comes back  having already left to go to work  in panic.
She's work very hard  and she has a  a little sister.
And then from over there they made the selection and shippe d the number of people to -- to a concentration camp  the remaining number they situated in different areas for work.
He was in  he stayed in that barracks with the night tunnel  with the rotating shifts and I was able to see him on  sometimes when he was off work and on weekends  I mean weekends.
And I almost got into trouble work -- I worked for a government agency there  for calling some of the African-American employees -- I worked in the employee relations office -- for calling them mister.
We werent rich  but -- Did you sign up for a certain time period to work there?
The Ukraines for instance  they volunteered to be work for the Germans and the we we were running  and theyre having those big peitsche   in German Oh  whips  or or clubs  clubs.
You know that since we went to -- still to German schools in the beginning  we took all these things in  and when all the young people were se lected for the youth -- the Hitler yugen  and for the gymnast -- gymnastic classes and so on  no Jews were allowed to enter  nor half-Jews.
If you did not work you didn't get your ration to begin with  but if you worked  you also get a soup.
See  in the camps  particularly the officers camps  the officers were not allowed to work.
We asked him who he was and he started to tell us this story how he came with his parents to Treblinka  how they were brought on the transport to Treblinka  and how his parents were separated from him immediat ely upon arrival  how he was put to work to unload the belongings of the people that were brought to camp  and how he realized that that was the end of the road  so to say  that it was an extermination camp.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 19 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: bit better because we were getting a little bit more food since being in the ghetto.
And they made all the prisoners do the work for them.
That was her daily work to see if she could get out.
If it got cooler  the machine would not produce as as much soot  carbon than it's hotter hotter temperature  and we would get stuck with clothes like you would freeze and there were people who wouldn't and I don't think and not being a prisoner like we were  and free work...could work without having a mask on their face  and a lot of people would die from lung diseases because we were spitting out...we'd we'd come in.
I forget  you had to do volunteer work too  didn't you?
We ll  uh so uh uh especially  as I say  uh uh at the beginning uh life or the day in in Auschwitz was simply a day of getting up  starting to run  uh being exposed to uh to uh the whim of the blockalte ster or kapo  so hardly be able to to sit  uh watching what what what uh left and right uh what what was happening so that it shouldn't happen to you and especially uh to to try to to do the work  which was not work  which was really slave work reminding you somehow of the illustrations you saw in the when the Jews in in Egypt were building the pyramids.
Anyway  I became a sergeant  and I did my work as a social -- in the social service and took care of the kids.
And and so your mother wa s involved in a lot of charity work?
I just got up in the morning and had to get ready and get to my office.
Then on Sunday  when we came back from work Sunday  the day off  we had to put our clothes  button up in the back and put in a lot of sand so one place we ﬂslept to another one.
And they found a driver for me  and finding a driver and finding a tr uck in those days was hard work.
Germans used to come and he ------------and they told  \ Fix me up this horse for riding \  so he came he just stepped up  and right away... Tell me when you were working in Treblinka  tell me what a typical day was like  when you had to get up and how long you stood on the appels  when you went to work  and when you quit.
I cannot remember exactly how it started out but what happened was that you no longer could pursue your work in  in non-Jewish businesses.
I left the ghetto at that time and went back to the little ghetto to go to work.
There was a special place where Jews can only buy bread in a certain bakery  a Jewish bakery.
A gate with a half moon sign  that says \ Arbeit Macht Frei \  work makes you free  or gives you freedom.
So as I say  I do a lot of this kind of wo rk where in the evening lots of times  so thats the on thats the reason I only do it once a week in the museum  because if I worked long more time  I wouldnt have a ny time to do this and I feel like this is also very important to do this and oh  and this is this we got from Miles Lehrman  an appreciation certificate for  you know  because for our work.
We still had like a months work  even killing ourselves with the work.
And he used to work in there putting stuff together like that.
So our brains started to work  with this coffee  maybe they can register us in American sector.
Naturally women cannot do physical work the way a man can do so but everybody was working.
In the morning  he gave us a sandwich and he sent us; we went with them to work on the field.
It was such a delightful thing  and especially when it was on a weekend  on a Sunday  when we didnt work  because there was no personnel there.
So on that cemetery  they build barracks--factories  that they make shoes  uniforms  brushes  whatever they could get the work out from the Jewish people.
Upon Regina an d Sam's arrival in Washington  D.C. in late 1947  Sam found work as a sheet metal worker and over time built a successful business in the construction industry.
And  I thought  well  good job  I had a good job  I finally made almost a hu ndred dollars a week  which was almost a hundred dollars a week.
And after he finished the college  he get a good job  he work for the big insurance company as a safety inspector.
They were not with us  but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one of the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people were coming in with various ailments  there was one lady who was from Germany  had lost her husband and child.
And but the son was a teacher  they had a daughter who was taken in as a how how do you say  as a so they wouldnt feel the persecution being Germans  she had to work in Berlin.
As a st  one morni ng we walked out to work in the fields  somewhere collecting cabbages or whatever it was and we came back late.
You know somebody said you have to go to work 5:00  I would be there 5:00.
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 That also is part of the background.
The Jewish council was responsible for every order that the Germans gave  they have to do the dirty work.
And we had that -- it was very interesting because the camps for the north -- there were camps in -- further north  above our camp  and -- And now youre talking about -- About the work camp.
I pretended to do it in the office  I took the work home  I worked at night  brought the work back  and learned.
What they need some work  they did it; like the goldsmith that did for them good different things  made for them up rings.
So when the Germans take over  and its -- The Germans didnt take a -- start to -- they give carte blanche to the Ukrainians.
So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private pr actice  because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than than working for the government  a rigid grade system and all that stuff  you just got so much money and thats it.
And you were -- what -- what was your job in this?
They assembled 9 000 Jewish men age 15 to 45  and they humiliated them  they tortured them  they -- and -- and then they started forming slave battalions in -- wh-which had to work under inhumane conditions.
How you were able to stretch human end resources to make your work effective?
And then I -- I rushed from work  I arrived in New York International  her brother pick me up.
They were so solidly  you know  brave  and they continued to work  even when the bombs were falling.
But in the Polish located camps  Germans  of course  brought Jews from other countries.
He went to work for the HIAS  and then he wanted to go to the Columbia University.
They would have broken the code in no time  but she wrote  \ I will sabotage my work as much as I can.\
First we went to a ghetto  which was a short duration.
So we were very hungry and ve ry  you know  look ing for a...what can we do and I did not think that to join the other groups which were tr aveling by trains selling from one city to the other.... We believed that we have to earn our living by work.
I must have been already like into the fourth day of my typhus fever when Father returned to work.
The Germans came in right away  a few days later  the Germans came in.
Yeah  he saw it  and [indecipherable] When you were when you and your sister were born  did your mother then stay home and take care of you  or did she continue work as a teacher?
Interview with Wies 63 May 23  2019 hoping to come and return to work on my PhD and so on but things after arrival to United States So did you get your PhD eventually.
And now that the wars started  we have to work for the war industry.
There they count us in 5  a hundred in a group  and the SS with the dogs took us to work.
It was supposed to be an incentive to work hard  to try to top the quota  and in the end to please the Germans.
Then in 19454  when the war–when the Romanians–came in–no Russians liberated it  and allowed us to go from the camp But she continued to work on the farm until then?
And so those who didnt participated  so they had to do local work  chop wood and stay on posts.
And he calle d me on the phone one day  and he said that one of the -- the subsidiaries  who were doing work in -- around the country  they were -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems.
Now  throughout this time you were work ing  your wife was working  what was your mother doing?
He offered me a nurse plus my salary to go back to work  but I just couldnt do it.
The foreman couldnt work anymore so he gave th is to me to operate  so I operated it.
So he knew how to -- how to work for the government because he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces  not too many people nowadays know this.
The reason why your family  your folks moved to Skala was Interview with Adi Eisenberg 10 August 29  2014 Fathers work.
So  but uh  and  and we  but we still had to stand uh roll call and uh be selected um for  for work  but they did not select uh to the gas chambers there  so my sister was uh working in the same factory where I was  and um  one day  as we were standing roll call  they selected a group of girls to take them to the  to the bakery to bring back bread  and they looked always for girls  for some reason  I looked apparently a bit better than  than some of the girls because I was selected also  to go into town  to bring in the bread from the  to take bread to from the bakery  and it was loaded on the wagons  and we were  we were  it was on uh these wagons that uh  wheels  and we were bringing in these wagons with the SS of course uh guarding us.
And the ta -- the time came that -- when th-the -- the Germans started to recruit the young people to work -- the famous [indecipherable] organization  you know  to build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build fo r them things all along the border because we were right on the border with the Yugoslavs  you know?
Somehow Im dissatisfied with people who right now go out and theres no not enough work in Poland  so when they can go anywhere in Europe to to work  they do.
>> Bill Benson: Were you in there with your whole family?
And I went out to work I came back for the two Kurt Langer  says how was it.
And we started to walk and on both sides were guards and th e Nazis with the dogs  that went with us to work .
Work in the morning and come back at night and stay  get a little bit soup and bread  and -- So the guards disappeared and the gates were open -- Open.
All I wanted was to work for the Joint for the rest of my life.
But if I went to work and came home  and then didnt -- it didnt occ -- I -- I died  and nobody was the wiser for it until after four dee -- days  it couldnt be hidden any more.
And she would work late hours to support the fleet  typing by hand  you know  three and four pages  before we had a word processor  for [indecipherable] make sure that the [indecipherable] fleet has all the parts.
So she knew she would have to go out to work.
And on the very same da y on Thursday  some people returned from work and they received a it was called  the German called it a schein 6.
The Hungarian people were only one year  that they  you know -- it was on -- they were people only one year  but they managed to kill most of them because th-they were not even trying any more to send them to work  they were only killing them.
We -- they were -- we were told we have to -- we will go and do some work in the fields  or whatever necessary  because theres no -- not enough manpower  or woman power  or whatever power  work.
And if it didn't change  then that meant you could continue doing the work you were doing.
And he take over our monument business and he work there.
And then he said yes  the Americans had that this and that and the other  so I said to him  as long as youre talking to the Americans  ask them if I could work there as an interpreter  and I did.
I have recently encountered a woman who lives in Richmond  who was a child in Rivesaltes who I got out of Rivesaltes and who I placed in a convent later on and went back to work with me in a children's home that I had later.
And uh that took a long time  but it work ed at the beginning but then starting with the deportations  these letters didn't arrive anymor e from from Germany and the children  you know  are quite desperate the events slowly realized that some thing must have happened  but they became fully aware of the s ituation only after the end of the war when the truth came out.
Because one night I came home from the -- from work.
Yeah  the uh  we would  we had all kinds of different work that was still in Auschwitz  but  yeah  I think so.
When I drove to work through Rock Creek Park  I used to work -- before that  I used to drive to work through Rock Creek Park  and I used to say to myself almost every day  \ This is very pretty  but it is not home.
Well  um  I think the war broke out  which  uh by th e way  I went  I went also to  to Sweden a couple of times because Sweden took a s-a couple of small groups into their country  uh  but  we were able to bring out just of Germany  and we were not allowed to work with the people in Austria or in  in Czechoslovakia  but we uh  war broke out  I think when we had reached approximately the  the  the number of 7000.
And next day  you -- you said according to -- we worked out -- we-went up like we were going to work  and after that  everybody took off the -- the -- the yellow signs  and we were -- went -- we had a woman who was leading us out of the city.
And I think we had all taken something to eat  some lunch and so on.
But this we had thought this until we go to work.
And they would come as day laborers to work on this Day.
Many times you hit into the earth and you came up with skeleton or piece of bone and heads and the work was horrible.
Well  somebody that you work -- happened to work with before the war even and -- yeah.
To me  I dont even have to look it up  because if it deals with the war years  I really  truly have a better understanding  because you dont translate words  you know  you work within a framework of a -- a concept.
I very hurt feelings and very -- not bitter any more  but -- and I went to work in small stores with alterations  which paid very  very little.
And I had gone to work   and he said to me  go to the police department and get an armband  a Red Cro ss armband for me  or something which was on the other side of the river.
So my father was assigned to work with horses  to do some work.
We got prepared when – when Satur day came Š the Sabbath  we – we couldnt do any work.
But the only thing is  he wanted her to do a lot of extra work.
>> Bill Benson: You have to explain why you were allowed to leave.
And the way this works  it's not that you work in order to earn a living.
>> Bill Benson: You had told me that  something your mother who did survive told you later  that when she was working at the Philips Electronics factory  in order for her to be able to stay alive and work there  she convinced this them that she was an expert in assembling radio tubes  which she'd never done in her life.
Sitting there  a person who used to work in the kitchen  we knew each other  she came to me and she asked me can you sew.
On it the note informed her that my father had also been selected to work in the gas chamber  to pull out the bodies and to do all the gruesome work that they made  the Germans made our own people do.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 38 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: had a few pennies there to buy uh a small piece of bread.
I work in the shop for awhile and but my future.
So it went so far that they started to uh work against me. '
I think that even were my mother not a survivor  given the values that were imparted to me and Paul as children  an area of law that is somewhat related to social work  as mine is  would be the type of thing that I might have enjoyed doing.
Now  after so many years  so much work you put in being a teacher  now you want to be a . . .\  \
That was not so good for my English  although  as I said  I did become friendly with some people at work.
I didn't men tion that I'd been directing the work of the Indiana Jewish Historical Society since 1972.
And they walk us to some school  on outskirts of the town   and next day they have Gestapo  and somebody else they got  they check and th ey release those who are working in the town  because Radom has factories  armament factories  so the many people work before the war  so the Germans naturally used that worked there.

And then from those wagons  the people would be taken somewhere.
And start to work with double energy  went to t he commission for investigating  investigating the Nazi crimes and talk with them.

Because a long  long relative  cousin picked me up and made me work for him.
In the middle was a big furnace  iron furnace and the prisoners came home wet from work and everybody and I...I...around the oven warmed hims elf and dried his clothes.
You know  the Russian  when they came in ‚39  they were taking the young 5 Aleksander Bielski 10 people to the army for work  whatever.
But in the evening we co uld sit together after dinner  when after work we had dinner  the food was brought in very  very big . . .
And so I applied for Harvard and of course several other schools and  for my graduate work.
Beautiful  good looking  tall and he went to work with another twenty-seven I think or twenty-eight or twenty-seven boys...or men.
I can get along in Polish and I speak Spanish quite well  really  because I had to work in Spanish.
She has no guests  and she has to go to work.
And you know  and go home  next day you had to go to work.
It was they took me out from there  me and my girlfriend  we had to work in an old -age home.
And Im thinking  do I really want to work with older people?
And I myself  you know  I work at as a volunteer at the museum and Ive been asked lots of times  how how can you work here?
73 My father was at work and so was my sister  so I called them.
People work and they...the baby's gonna cry and you couldn' t be here.\
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us what happened there  at this camp they had made you work there  too.
The work there was very  very hard because it was at night.
He said that I was doing a great job  and normally he said  ﬁTheres an officer  but I cannot promote you to become an officer  you got to go to school  and -- but Ill give you another promotion.ﬂ Got another stripe  and on -- once a year you have an inspection of people who don t normally wear a uniform  who -- who work in special units  and my boss came around for some genera l took once a year look at you.
So th ey asked this  he asked them  how can I approach this that I wanted to work in x-ray?
And what -- was she [indecipherable] And that she was insecure and she didnt want -- and she wanted to save the money and she wanted me to go to work rather than go to college  so that -- not to waster her money.
CY: I used to work  to wash the floors by the guards Video Tape No.
I did office work always because of that little English what I had it had me not to start as a physical worker.
When I met her  she didnt work on a farm any more  she knew enough English  and she attend the Heidelberg Universitys English Institute  where they taught English  proper English.
So you went to sleep with the wet clothes and in the morning you went back to work with the same wet clothes until it finally dried on you.
We couldn't tell them that if the police come down and arrest one of them  that you go down to the police station and bail them out and use a good argument  but these were people who learned on the job -- although coming with I had a two and a half month course at the University of Maryland and everything from cooking to social work  to 13 warehousing -- I remember one of the questions that they gave in the test was  \ If you are in and you get a cable that in four days there will be landing in thirty-seven tons of such  such  such procure warehousing and setup procedures for distribution.
So thats the Russians kind of influence  a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before  and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis  or Germans  and Germans beating up their comp atriots  or so  and with full vigor  I mean  just reversed direction.
After that  it was establish a camp -- a five miles after our area where we lived  for turf  work with the turf  you know whats turf?
Our work consisted of selecting  you know the people who arrived they to ok away everything from them.
I lived there and during the day we were not required to go to any work .
So you have to go to work  you have to go to the forest and cut trees.
He started questioning me very nasty and he said he wants me to work  to be responsible for this apartment.
And by that time he had also got bitten by the government bug  having been in the Foreign Service for three years in India so he went to work for the government.
And the reas on for saving was not so much that I liked to save to get -- to put a lot of things was I wanted  and fe -- and have feelings that I cannot afford to satisfy this  but I know it can come a time when are -- you are not able any more to do work  whatever it is  and you fall -- want to fall a burden or nothing.
The orphanage -- the people were still sleeping while I was going to work.
And what about your brother  your older brother  what was he doing?
Somehow Frenzel  when I had very heavy work we has also to go in the woods and cutting trees and bringing from one place to the other  or filling up these trolleys  what the people came in  with sand.
But at that time  where we was  you know  they never saw people going out to work.
Course the governor goes to work at 11 oclock in the morning  but -- ah  so I said  oh  th-th-this thing is answer  you know  you have punch tickets in ev -ev-every toll gate  with ro und holes.
He was organizing people to go to work and things like this.
You know  you could become a work in a amat mokykla .
You cant do nothing about it  and so I covered -- paper ban -- paper bandages for the prisoners there  as l ong as the supply lasted  and I put it around it  and I went to work  and I put the sa -- my socks on the bed.
You know  you work and you eat and they deduct the money.
Why don't you start where you get put into the trucks where you're taken for work  and then go into how you got sick.
This is tape number three  side B  and we were talking about your experiences at the museum.
So she was -- she says  I'll go and the Germans said this is going to be to work and then we'll let you go.
That's where my father was engaged to work in the factory  sewing uniforms for the military  and so my mother.
A change  I mean in Grenoble  that was a big change  because in Grenoble you had to eat  but in Montpellier it was very little and the only--the reason is that's why I work ed in the gardens  and with the farmers  because that's the only way I could have eaten  and see when I worked with the vineyards  we would get wine as part of a salary and I would exchange the wine for food on the side.
It was useless work  for all practical purposes; but it kept us busy.
Ordered to come to work so rt of  it's an or der to come . . .
And that moment  the German horse whistle came over the radio  and we didn't hear Horty's voice; I dropped my glass and I ran out because I knew I had to go to work to the hotel.
Did you make up the work lists or did Vaschek tell you who would be on it?
And Ill work with you  edit it here  there --ﬂ And in fact  in the book  he wrote a lot of the -- the historical aspects to it.
But then [indecipherable] not more work in the Interview with Eli Dortort August 3  2005 33bank  they went bankruptcy.
Because without her being in on it  there was no way--that wasn't going to work either.
He was young...nineteen and we teached them on the farm and we we teached them to work and how to speak and... How were you able to talk to him?
It was a hospital very similar to  those who have seen the TV show and the movie  ﬁ M*A*S*H .ﬂ Field set -up  doctors work working Interview with Robert Max July 14  2015 117 under very  very difficult conditions  but providing great  great service to men wounded on the battlefield.
Uh what happened in kind of...I...I got...in June  July  we kind of were informed that the first people in the Hague would be shipped and these were the young men  sixteen years and older uh to work camps.
It started off with people from Prague and -- Well  I was working for a lawyer and he kept me for as long as they let me work.
Did they work alongside of you when you were doing the rock work?
And then  you know  and my sister  my brother  they went out to work.
I didn't even miss work even when I was running a fever  I went to work.
Basically  I spent most of my time in kibbutz  living in a kibbutz.
So we were shivering like -- like this and my mom had to work and we were locked in the room by ourselves  me and my brother.
Then  word came around; and we said  \ We have to work.

We didnt reach Germany to work in a factory  but that was the intention.
And did they know your parents were Jewish  and what that meant? (
Uh a certain segment of the population from the ghetto was taken to work either cleaning or doing whatever the Germans needed done...laundry or uh some of them were shoemakers or uh tailors.
>> Bill Benson: What were you forced to do when you were there?
So they pushed him to make one pe rformance for them  for their hard work  so they can enjoy performing it.
And I  working in a plant that was doing some military work  had a pass to get out of the -- the ghetto.
About four or five weeks late r Mama managed to find some work and I was sent back to pick up my sisters from th e convent.
At one time I went and I took a course in bookkeeping.
Working with them  they were trying to be close to the meister  the boss  and they shouldn't work.
October or November  when the Wisa froze up they had no work for him on on the ships no more.
Well  I did work in the office for a little while and I thought I had it all made and that I was part of the camp and I wasn't shipped out.
And they brought us to this camp  and we were there.
>> Bill Benson: They were told you need to leave here.
The other refugees had to work for the British on their farms way out in the bush.
Yeah  and they were bringing us chocolates and cigarettes you know  so -- and you know that -- that mind that work  that -- th at -- to steal  you know.
In 1967 I decided to transfer to Washington  for I had enough of travel assignments which are a consequence of work in regional offices.
And the guy who I was working for  only about two or three days  ﬁOh ﬂ he says  ﬁy-you s -- you cant leave.ﬂ He was a Greek and he spoke some German  and he says  ﬁYou cant leave  youre doing such a good job.ﬂ I said  ﬁI cant stand here  you know  s -- stand in that one spot doing nothing.ﬂ So I went down there for the interview  and I -- he hired me right away  and now Im -- so I went to work over there  and he paid me 75 cents an hour  and I did -- you know  whatever I had to do  and one day they were trying to do something  to solder a certain part and a -- it was an al Interview with Alan Kalish October 24  2003 121-- a lot of them  and nobody knew how to do it.
And I think that probably motivated many people who came overseas to work with us  and I think that that accounts for the quality and level of work which they produced for JDC and contributed to our success.
There were a lot of jobs what I didn't ha -- I -- I didnt know why I -- where I have to do it  but I dont remember who took me  who asked me to do it  but I went to work for one time.
So I ended up by trying to work for every person to be free to practice their religion  or political belief  or ethnic pride  or what have you.
So that my father was assigned to do this work  but that he had already been dead because he did not fulfill the job well enough.
And when I started school  it was at nighttime  so they couldnt put me I used to work either from six to two  or from two to 10.
In the four transports within every week two transports  and they cleared up the big ghetto  the large ghetto and everybody was left who had a card to work  they put in the small ghetto.
Now carrying back dead or near-dead bodies from work sites to the camp was a co mmon sight.
What was going on with your - your father and I dont know if your -- I guess your mother wasnt working when the Russians came  but what happened to your fathers work at this stage?
I wondered if you want to say anything else about the desegregation work you were doing in Houston?
You get a little piece of bread in the morning  black imitation coffee.
So I decided I wanted to go to work  to learn something so I could earn a living when I get to the States to save up some money.
All these things have been really a great place for me to work and for the lawyers who worked in this program.
it was just the government took my father to work in the ditches and my dad was coming home Interview with Margie Rosenthal 17 very  feeling not well.
I think I had mentioned that the pickup of Jews fo r deportation was done by a furniture van  a furniture moving van  of the firm Scheffler a nd Brandenburgische Strasse  as I said  was the street where my friend Hans was living  although that was in midmorning and I knew that Hans was at work at Siemens  but his wi fe  Valli  did not work and might be at home.
That eventually we could work out   and develop more programs that would encourage people to spend their lives in this sort of work.
And I was always instructed or taught that if you work you live.
In 1943 came a transport of people used to work around Vilno and they brought them ---------.
Kept falling off when you work  you know  and things...we had wooden slippers.
In fact  they used to bring new ones from the area  very nice educated kids  those who were qualified they brought into work.
One Saturday morning as I was going...about to go to work and I came down from upstairs where  you know  we already had moved into a larger home at this point in a very nice neighborhood.
And the ones that are still  were still in good shape  were in barracks  but we didn't work on anything.
This man was a very religious Catholic and he decided that he was going to go to the work camp.
But I t hought that was a good idea  she wont work  and shell be better off.
If things grow by themselves  then sow them and then go and harvest them  but you dont have to work in between.
I did some important work for the German armament industry  and they (laugh)...I had to commit myself half a year to serve in the air.
And after that came trucks and they said they gonna...they took us to work.
They -- Sarah -- Sarah was going with her aunt too  to work by this woman.
One time each house had like a committee  and they were directing all the rule s. One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work.
She said to me -- I come to work in th e fields and the one that I told you was in charge of me  says to me  ﬁToday youll work later.ﬂ I said  ﬁHow can I work later  how can I get to the ghetto later?
And on other occasions were injuries or sicknesse s. But in two occasions I know that two or three occasions I remember that people died  but I I dont remember how far it was connected with work  what we were doing  or because sometimes its true in some places where we were oh  what is that not far [indecipherable] in a village  I think it was Baltar or something like that.
So England... A (Adam): We work in Chicago  y ou know  in the community  in the Jewish community and organization for Israel and so on and... A (Pela):...I was treasurer of the foundation of the State of Illinois and I uh I am very...I was president of American   so I would do...we try to pay back...the people who lent us the money  we cannot...we don't have to pay back.
In the morning at six o'clock  I had to be on the subway in order to make it to work that started eight o'clock.
Because I knew that I don't look Slavic  I could pass somehow as a German girl so I was advised to work in the lion's den so I worked for German companies.
>> Bill Benson: How did your mother do once she came here?
After that I worked for a year with the Dutch customs office in Parimiabol   and I was then asked by the Netherlands Embassy in Washington  D.C.  would I come to work there.
Why were you in Germany so long - after the war?
You had to perform already a certain work with every bit before you could break it.
Because maybe a lot of precision work were made by women  while the more rough work was made by man.
But it didnt work that way  because it just didnt wo rk.
So they wanted to separate the Jews from these other people until they -- Which we didnt know  we thought prison bec -- now  those who had to -- who had work outside  like some of the engineers  who had to -- their job was to increase the capacity of the utilities  serving currently 8 000 people  to accommodate 60 000.
But  as I say  what they were able  you know  to search through newspapers  and si and there are some books and theres a chapter or something about me said in in there  on the War on Poverty people who wrote books  so in se veral books was something about me or Interview with Lena Gitter July 21  1998 31my work  you know  so so thats how it came.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 29 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: And for the most part I did that well.
Uh  the I was in the things where we were concrete work  concrete you see.
So they didnt make a ghetto  they took out the people to -- to each  to other ghettos -- I was in the ghetto in Novidburg in that time.
And there was lot of work to do  we still had to have the vegeta ble growing  we still had to have -- feed the people.

He was taken away to work in town  but he could sleep at home.
How do you feel about being Jewish now considering what you did go through in the w ar?
You know I worked in an office afterwards and I was not mistreated  although I didn t have any more food but I  I had an easy  easy work.
>> Bill Benson: The career choices you've made  the things you're still doing with your work internationally to this day.
And most of the roads were clogged with this and you couldn't get you couldn't go to work anymore.
As soon as I start to work  I got a beating and 5 was bleeding from my head and face.
How were you treated by the Germans while you were there?
And then everybody start to work  to find something -- work.
No  I don't mean then  I am talking now in the ghetto.
I had to work and pay for it and they get it free of charge.
One day a good German who I used to work with  engineer  a civilian  a nice guy  he came in.
Irving Hass: He tried to run away or not to go – not to work.
So we went -- I went to work in east Baltimore  which was run by the state and fu -- really funded by the state  for really the -- the -- the -- you know  really people who on Medicaid  you know.
I work all three machin es  four machines  and I know -- and I can do -- so she says  but how am I going to make a living?
When he got up and begin to shot  and the...uh...gun didn't work.
And when we finish there the work -- this was in 1944 -- same thing because I had already registration as a professional worker  as a electrician.
And the cadavers and me  that just didn't work out very well.
He had to go to work because he was an orphan at that time  already.
Okay  since I retired from work  Im going to do something.
I said  the prices you charge  I have to work in order to pay it.
Uh... right away  the..the Germans put a wall and there were gates and you could only go out from the ghetto if you had...if you had a work permit.
He say now while you are here  you're going to work twelve hours.
We ain't gonna do... We put you all to work and...uh...you're gonna work.
10 -- so -- you know  Saturday was a day free  you can go out  free from work  you go out and whatever you want to do.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 29 What -- what -- what happened then?
What did your mother and the remaining members of your family do?
What they felt they're not good to work anymore  so they shot and us they took and they were going  driving us and we didn't know where.
But when it was the day before those holidays  we are not allowed to work  not to do nothing.
And my -- my br other -- my brother was black hair  black eyes  and -- and th -- because our school didnt work on Saturday  so we were -- it was open on Sundays.
A-At his work  at his office  because two SS men came.
You didnt even go to undergraduate school?ﬂ And I said  ﬁWell  thats what they told me -- thats what I should do  I should take non-matriculate courses and see what I would like.ﬂ So I took a lot of non-matriculate courses and I -- and eventually I had to matriculate and work very hard on a whole summer on calculus and you name it and I dont still ta -- after that  I dont know what happened  you know [indecipherable] What year was it that you graduated?
So me people probably had more  you know  heavier work  I was just lucky to get this machine.
Now  Uncle Harry couldn't take off work so he didn't come with us but Allen and Auntie Dot came.
You don't know for what  and what because you work  no food.
Act young  perk up and so fort h and you will yet go to work.
The gate said like all camps  Arbeit Macht Frei which means work makes free.
So I was waiting til they will come back from work.
Of course  this doesnt happen now that much  because most women work  so its very hard.
You could live there  but you could not work there  that was the problem.
So they would allow Jews  refugees  to work only in three or four professions  where there was no unemployment.
Pink effekt because they were where the Jews where when they took all the clothes was it was called Kanada  and it was Red effekt   but they - we didnt work in this department.
Naturally  in 2 or 3 days later  my father came back to Warsaw and...uh...immediately got...engaged himself in the public work and then making a living  buying  selling  whatever he did and that's... A week later my uncle came to me and says  \ Listen.
We had the -- the German supervisors  you know  people who used to work in the factory before were supervisors  and of course we had the guards.
They were herded to a place  compelled to work  or left abandoned there  fell on the ground  found someplace to sit down.
We should worry that people would work uh on the in the ghetto in proper way or just a small...it was a...it was not the police  but something sim ilar.
35 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD >> Bill Benson: OK.
Fo rd was forming this outfit  the called the Navy OSS Photographic Unit that would work with the  in the OSS with  w ith photographic in- intelligence.
And then I worked for a while in the woods with the other kommando chopping woods which was a little heavy work  and that's basically what was going on there.
End of Tape 3  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 32 32Tape 4  Side A This is tape number four  side A. Did you  did you have  what kind of experience did you have in Belgium  just as far as– were you just work ing all the time?
I went into a school after the hours of work and I finished it.
That time  I made up my mind if they shoot me that's oka y. I spoke to the young man that you used to go with women and men out to the factory to work.

>> Bill Benson: Before we talk about that  you remember him leaving.
Well  my father used to play the mandolin  and he at times would play  but mostly th-this work -- what  in Ladino and Sephardic culture  are called canteegass  from the Spanish word  which are -- believe ballads  a lthough there are differences.
Ther e was so much to do and so much that needed to be done  that very few others were doing  that the work was very  very interesting from the very beginning.
And uh so she did all this work  and then she...she did this incredible bookkeeping thing every night.
END OF SIDE A  TAPE 1) We stay maybe after thats enough from the fi rst pogrom where they said you will leave and you need to work.
Those times were gone that we were coming home from an outdoor work and the blockelteste to ld you  ﬁWe have no more food for you.ﬂ Yeah.
I mean  there are other things in your life that have to work  interests  and what -- what has happened to your life?
There were various places in Bohemia where we did this work.

We were taken to work down there near a train  and every week a train would come from Holland enclosed wagons  they had some wires across and there was a bag for water  and all the boys  including me  we were running to get some water  because these people I knew they were Jewish people.
But after that Jean and I went over to Montgomery and helped work on another  on a school case for several days.
He -- he also has this personality that people like to work for him  and the people who are working for him -- and it was very strenuous work  told him that whenever he wants to  they will always work for him.
And the one night there was a ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 22 commotion.

She was so -- she was so bipolar that she ended up being on social -- she was -- went on social security because she could not -- could not work  and she died at Interview with Paul Halpern 25 the age -- one week short of her 70th birthday.
So I went to him  and I says   \ You know  I am Jewish.
Because Olim Ha dash have a tax break  a big tax break but of course my father found work.
Q. A little bit more about the job you had at the displaced persons camp in Homburg  but first I wanted to ask you -- Umberg  if you could tell me about some of the friends you made between the time you were liberated and the time you went to work at the displaced persons camp?
I did  and he asked me if I want to work wi or get a work with him  get a job  its called kapo .
I did work for other people  then I did work for a Baltimore firm when they were doing the Baltimore City Hall.

And certainly other work that I was doing in the museum  its because I was I was I could use my mind  basically.
So then everybody said why dont you go on your own  why do you have to work for him.
Nu  and I begin to work in the same city...uh...nu  and the final what...what in this time what I can do.
In those days  when you opened our main newspaper  on two pages were hundreds an d hundreds Lithuanian army personnel out of work  out of work  out of work.

It was the time of the quarantine yet  and we werent yet taken out of the camp to work somewhere else  and the smoke was always th ere  coming out of the chimneys  and then at night you could also see fire not the smoke so much as during the day  but you could see fire.
At home  did your mother keep house  or did she have help in in keeping house?
Okay  so there was no place there wasnt a place he had to go to every day to go to work.
So they said  \ Let us stick together  and let's try and survive.ﬂ So one day...we were doing over there very hard labor work.
To bring us more up to date  beyond the period of time that I had gone to school  and when I started to work for a company in Nuremberg and that was in 1930.
Well  I was at Washington University and I remember my fir st major was chemistry and that didnt work out so well.
No  once the na -- Nazis came in  this was en d  finito  no work.
Now I went -- I went to work to a governme nt -- a government shop.
And we started to talk and it turns out  hes told me he was Jewish.
He did very well  but then he changed  he went to work for San Francisco Examiner   and after awhile he felt that the only way to complete his rise in the -- in the profession  he had to come east.
So -- so we managed -- you know  went to the farmers  they saw we are Jews  but what can they do?
He promised to take this group to his place of work and spare us Auschwitz.
They want me to co me Saturday to work if I want money  even it's not right but I should come.
Well  I've already more or less mentioned that I'm speaking because I feel that this has to be my contribution to people  to warn them about being vigilant and to work so much harder for the better world for our children.
And they put me on on cell number 12 to learn how to work out and make pieces out of the granite  so my fi rst teacher there was another prisoner  old prisoner  a Czechoslovak.
What did you do  what was an average day like for you?
>>Bill Benson: As you explained earlier  of course your father was gone but your mother continued the business.
And the partisans gathered the leftover Germans  the leftover Russian people who wanted to turn into Germans and work for the German government and they were mean to everybody.
There was a Jewish printer in town  and I did did some part time work over there  trying to ki my parents obvi ously try I tried to keep me busy  which was pretty valid.
But it -- there were such shortages and they didn't -- I mean  my mother packed a lunch which was probably worth about two hours -- two or three hours work.
Well  we did get to to the concentration camp of Heidelberg  unknown to me at that time  but made known to me later that as we were on the Wilno grounds  the commanda nt of the concentration camp called 32 the commandant and said  \ Hey  I killed all my women in and now I have 200 hands to work.
People working in Treblinka  there wasn't a job that you work  you gonna work tomorrow.
Gideon and his son  who also volunteers his time and expertise to the museum  are collaborating on several computer projects related to the museum's work.
ﬂ And I saw they want Jewish policemen from our city.
I got some job on my license from there  you know.
Of course  they could have been killed but they were not in the ghetto.
So your -- your parents left  you stayed with your wi fe and continued to work  and then -- Yes  I continued to work -- -- and then what was your reaction after the 67 war?
You had to have special permits to go outside from the ghetto even to work.
Now  Ill just mention it  because if somebody died  was killed  whatever  most of the people were very strong  the ones that committed themselves to work  so they didnt die the nor mal way.
I was out of work  looking for a job  and employers were very hesitant about hiring young men who had not had their military service  but the draft system had just kicked in a short time before that  and they did not want to train new employees for two  three  six months and then lose them to the military.
I just -- It -- Its very hard to go into it  and very personal  so I -- it just didnt work out.
Because even if small or sickness  they sent them back and brought another one instead  that the 800 should always complete to work.
And my brother was at work  and -- I guess we have to stop.
On one occasion then while I'm in the midst of very serious work and I've got all my own problems I'm thinking about anyhow  one of the lawyers there was from Chicago  a major  a Bigelow Boison.
One day  I come to work and I was comforted with my mother (crying) and Mary--my bride  my sister.
So that day they came at lunch hour and they picked out 10 -- no  they picked out six men from our ranks from the work  and they were crying and begging for their life.
Now  the work they did had almost a total emphasis  the Jewish Labor Committee  on in some way getting around the restrictive regulations which prevented Jews from marching  from leaving.
I was at work  so they a they asked my sister  who is the little boy?
My father could not contact him personally because my father did not work inside the ghetto.
And then I couldnt go to work in Sandusky because I was marri ed to a doctor and I didnt have a profession.
Work -- there were gr oups of Jews which worked for Germans.
Uh  the other civilian Germans that were not in the camp but when I uh  it comes back to me very clearly again.
We had to take care of the elderly people because the nurses and caretakers who used to take care of them had to work for the war   the factories.
After we finished a day's work at Canada Kommando  you just couldn't go home  back to the camp  without being searched  first at the work site - lined up  stripped naked in most cases.
But they were manual tasks  and electrical work  y ou know  something like that.
The representatives of Joint were there  and uh uh they did a little work.
But I was doing secretarial work before I got married and also after  until our first child was born.
I used to work at night in [indecipherable] to took out two or three trucks milk to the for the ladies who who sell milk  yeah  in order to make five pounds.
This was the end of wandering for me  I go to Stuttgart to work with the Joint.
He put me on that transport to that work camp Allweiter Rodgau  9 in Hessen-Nassau [province]  where we had to work.
I mean it's his own store  but he's in the back office  you know  doing the paper work and the ordering and and the scheduling of things and who gets what  because you know  there's rationing and it becomes very complicated.
And so you -- when you first got to Israel -- Im sorry  my s -- my history is very poor  was that when -- was Chaim Weitzman  and did you work for him then?
And they fed me  and and I went to work in a fur shop  because I knew how to sew.
Trust me  forced labor is you lived at home and you went to work in the morning  not work of your choice  but the work by assignment.
Shed come in shed come from work an-and shed sit down and shed be shivering for  you know  a period of time where wed cover her up with the with the the straw mattress that we had  and whatever we had wed cover her up.
So I -- I arranged -- I dont know if it was legal at that time  now it is -- I didnt -- dont know -- I arranged that they have to work civ -- do civil work  because there was so much to do.
And we saw a little bit the  the result of our work when we were able to take some of the displaced persons out of a camp  those who had been rescued from Buchenwa ld  from Auschwitz  from anywhere  and we were able to transport them illegally through all the borders of Germany at that time that existed at that time.
I stayed by two big machines and I made the ammunition and you had to work twelve day shifts for the shells  you poured in the shells like small  and they came out this long.
Yes  they took everybody to work  in the camp  everybody went to work so they took us to the railway stations  and some used to carry bricks.
I -- I did since we wound up work -- after all  after the two weeks were up  we were back in Boronivitch  he to the militia.
Its letting always your clients come up with a plan  always have them  have them come up with the ideas as much as possible about whats gonna work for them.
And then they  we went back and they took us back home.
He took the worst elements out of prison  the people out of work  hung a beautiful uniform on them  ni ce jack boots  nice cap. [
So  actually  I can be very grateful and thankful for all those people  to my wife  because it was her idea  and s-she makes the lot  a lot of work.
And you stayed there for about two years and then the German invaded Poland?
But every day Id work on that story when I went to bed.
inaudible] And -- and then how lo ng did you work at repair ing the sewing machines?
Now there are prisoners coming and going every week  other people coming  new peopl e and other people going home back to work  and mostly young ones I tried to help.
I pay people to work for me.ﬂ ﬁWell  how can you afford it?ﬂ ﬁWell  see  Im great black market operator.
What work do you do for the Ho locaust Museum in Washington?
Until the middle of 18 we still could work together in the lines.
And then  sixteen or seventeen that I was  I went to work.
Is that common for people who are in your sort of situation  where they weren't in camps?
So  she said  ﬁWell  you have to wait til my husb and comes home from work and I can tell you tonight.ﬂ So  as it happened  their oldest dau ghter was going to leave home  and that is very important because in those days  you couldnt buy beds  you couldnt buy linens  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 11 you couldnt buy blankets  yo u couldnt buy anything  even if you had the money  it wasnt available  and so they could only take me if they had a spare bed.
These were very hard days for me because I had to work doubly hard  you know  to prepare all these dishes and clean the mess after them.
And somehow  as we were going from one place to the other to work or something  we exchanged ideas or notes.
What had happened is  I went to work for Pacific Gas Electric because of getting deferments from the Army and as soon as I got there they cut out the deferments so I got drafted.
The majority from Russ ia and also some that were sent to Germany for work.
From the beginning of living in the Kaywood Garden in Mount Rainier  I joined the democratic party  which helped me in business  and I became in Silver Spring  precinct chairman and did as much or as little as I could for -- i-in party work  but at least I was connected  and met people.
We had seven to seven shifts seven in the morning to seven at night  or vice versa.
They were given the role  not that they asked for  but by the exhaustion of the older generation of their strength by doing that work for a year or two under conditions of hunger  losing weight  illnesses  the younger were coming up  they had the strength to work.
When I came to work there  I worked there for a while  because right  because we used to run up and down the steps because there was no elevators  so we had to carry the mattresses out  the blankets.
Eichmann  who left Budapest in July  came back and the first thing was 10 000 younger women in about seven days after this failed coup were round up and deported for work  supposedly.
They required all kinds of assistance so that they could work again.
We were not really sure who were they  but we were -- we were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack  and the -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered  and we were not let out to work  and as well with the sick bay.
Those of you who have studied history and some of you that will study history  you will find out that they formed collector farms  having the people work for most of it going to the state  having very little reward.
Can you tell me can you describe what the DP camp was like?
My mother went to work as a bookkeeper and we three kids took care of each other.
Anyway we registered and all the inmates did all the work.
A. But I think the others were  too  becaus e I think it was a necessity  you have to work together  you couldnt do it on your own.
And we worked hard  and one time  we had to work outside  it was called \ Aussenkommando\    meaning \ working outside.\
A subcamp where both men and women were housed for work on the airport  7 know  some kind of beds  some kind with straw-filled uh  mattresses.
Uh  my grandfather was a tailor  and very often he'd bring  uh  work home to the house  and on  on Sundays  uh  I might see him at his sewing machine  uh  hunc hed over the machine--he was a rather large man--uh  working to support  uh  his own fam ily.
She had had such a terrible– Oh  at first she would say  ﬁOh ﬂ she would say  ﬁits only one month.ﬂ Then she would say  ﬁOh  its only three months.ﬂ Then after that she stopped saying  ﬁIts only–ﬂ She knew it was going to work out.
And some you would work through the local German military authorities and they would supply . . .
But I -- I -- I found -- she was gone.
He used to work for the KGB in the -- on the railroad KGB  and her parents were also from the same city  from Chita.
Right where the ghetto ended you had a Jewish policeman and a P olish policemen at the gate  yeah.
Because my mother want ed to make sure that I would qualify to go to work.
But we didn't do a lot of work  because we didn't got any raw material.
When you received going out to work in the morning  a black coffee  so -called coffee and with this you had to go out to work.
You can write home that you are here in Sobibor and that you are you go to a work camp.ﬂ And we have to take a shower because the it it's better for you that you take a shower; so we can  we will give you other clothes.\
So they took people who were not ab le to work  is that what you say?
So we took USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 13 that -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it worked  because -- well  it didnt work with me  but it worked  because I later on found out that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the United States  I found it out and  you know  and -- but  by and large  a lot of people died after the war  from being fed by the English army  more food and fat food th an they should have had.
When I start to work I told them it will be the best.
The im portant thing was that we were free  that we could live  we could work  and I could study.
And while talking about Chaim  I can also talk about Eggenfelden because this is an example of what kind of work I did.
And I did get invi -- it wasnt Israel  it was Palestine at that time.
And months later we find out that they took him to another camp called Jawischowitz coal mines  in the coals  working in the coal mines at night and getting -- going to work in chains.
I uh ...or they didn't allow me to stay there long  because I was sent you know with a group of approximately uh  four...four  five hundred Jews to work in the port of Gdansk.
42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well  we need people to go Ost [NB: to the east]  means for work.
72 Didn't you have any qualms about going to work in the intimacy of a German home?
In California   and then he left for Mexico   and and he went became a director of fa public work  for the state  and and the chief construction of highways for the Pan-American highway  which is that 45 that comes through leo through El Paso   yeah.
She told me that Himmler exhorted the prisoners to continue to work for the Reich an d that as long as they continued working for the success of the Reich  nothing bad would ever happen to them.
She made sure  in the morning [indeciphe rable] I leave for work  that I have hot cereal.
But when you have a calendar that is related to your work  youre limited in that ability.
Hes a very talented young man and did really excellent scholarly work on the -- on -- on this particular part of Croatian history.
Somehow she did it in a very ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 short time.
But  was there maybe the ghetto and also you had to have a permit to go out.
And we were able then to get  with two salaries coming in  steady work coming in  we were able to get a better apartment and we moved to the Bronx  to a very nice building on the Grand Concourse  which was really a step.
I said  \ Well  I've come down to work out with  uh...with Eddie O'Sullivan.
But they told us we won't...we w on't be able to go there  but we're going to work someplace else.
Laughs] So  I had to come to work  and that was his way of  but he still called me all kinds of dirty names.
10 I used to take some -- I tell you -- I used to go to work  I always  my feeling  Ill go find my little boy.
Maybe I  no  I don't remember whether I  I think I wa nted to work in the kitchen.
The men were -- were supposed to report to work at seven a.m. in -- every morning  and so on.
First of all  they put us  we have to give a day's work  everybody has to give a free day's work.
It was indecent  but the implication of what the selection was all about didn't hit me at that time  you know  younger men  older men  different type of work.
The kitchen was there and the work places were they set  so in the evening when we arrived they gave us to eat something and  and then we have about nine o'clock or eight-thirty depe nding when it was dark  we had to go and sleep in our barracks  so the few hours between eating and sleeping so we could see each other  walk around in this half of this  court  court round and we could talk with each other; and I  and I met Selma.
They al ways had work  but they had to do what they told them to do.
She wa s fainting and I had to do  to work on her.
But after being two  three days they show what [indecipherable] they start beating and taking people just in the street to work an-and to ro clear th everything what in th done is not in or der  you know  and everything the Jews has to do.
They got three groups  workers men  work ers women  and others th -- and the others  theyre going to the crematorium.
So we really didn't know what was going on in the world exactly.
And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work.
And did he spend a lot of time doing this work for Uruguay.
Then we supply as much as we can  and this time  in the beginning  then German take Jewish people from ghetto to different work  outside the ghetto.
And at that particular time  I used to talk to my family  why don't they try to go ahead  go move further east  but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one  that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run away from.
One action  one such action after my father was taken  took place a few days later  and everybody was at work  the adults and the children 14 and over  and I found myself alone.
I -- I need to get a social work USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 19 degree.
And then I started t o work at  in admissions at the Rodef Shalom School initially.
So  if I can repeat a little bit  just to make sure that Im clear about  she had to work as a lumberjack?
We didn't work  but he kept us longer and he phoned into the lager that we are very busy  that we have to stay longer  and so probably he saved many people.
And another event which strikes me as perhaps noteworthy is that as the camps were about to be liberated  the Germans tried to move the inmates out  those who were still able to walk or to work.
But my work was on the other side of the city.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 13 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: SB: We have to put another roll of film on here.
And th ey took him to work  and they rele ased him.
You k now  that other kids would want to sort of play  and he would want to have my mother read him the street signs and explain to him how that -- why certain words are spelled in a certain way  and -- now  I dont know what came first  but I -- I do wonder about this  but they started him on violin lessons  I think when he was three years old  and that didn 't work out  so they stopped him at the suggestion of the teacher  and then they started again  I think when he was about five USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 20 maybe  or six.
This factory began to take shape and some work was being done  disassembling the old textile factory.
My mother never had to work  basically  my father was always making enough money and she enjoyed just being a housewife.
But if you didnt have any educatio n  if you didnt ha ve any professional education  you were not a tailor  you were not a [indecipherable] you didnt learn anything  then the only thing that was left for you was to work as a porter.
Now  somehow -- How did you end up in the DP camp and tell me about what that was like?
And thats when I stopped work ing in the dress line  when Jerry was born  two hours af before he was born  practically .
And Father again went into the office to do book work for the .
There was notn 4 D too much work for us  I believe.
We had some people from the refugees who started to work in the...in the various departments getting visas.
The Kovno ghetto  the Vilna ghetto and the ghetto  but there was no communication so the first work what the Zionist underground have done  to establish a communication between the Kovno ghetto underground and the Vilna ghetto underground.
The horrible things happened  the people starved to death  you know and they're worked  and also two of my cousins had been in work camps and again the one that jump ed from the train told us about it  so we knew about it  but I can't precisely know how it happens.
I mean how could I have said  told that when I was digging ditches  after  when the raw material in the factory ran ou t and they took us out to dig ditches  foxholes for the German army.
That year in the center was a marv elous year  and influenced the -- the rest of my life  Joan  for all my work subsequently in the States  yes.
The remaining 300 plus stayed and continued to work for the army.
Rausonk  let me tell you something  I asked the same question of every person who was responsible in our rescue  and of anyone  I  w ho did any rescue work  even when at the premier of Shindler's List  I had the oppo rtunity to speak to Mrs. Shindler because what happened is  I was sitting with her and talking and a lady walked over and said  will you still talk to me after the film?
Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't  I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities.
So anyway  then she said oh yeah  she needed a maid.
And that was the end of his work  15th of March.
And I pushed the statistician out of his job [ind ecipherable] riff procedures  w ho knew all about it  and then had to work under me  at one grade less  and wa s a terrible situation.
We never did like living in a big city and so we thought we would try our luck elsewhere and we sent for different fold ers and wound up going west and it turned out to be a disaster because there was no work there.
The only thing I thought is they were taking all these people  they're going to take them to another area of camp and -- because they're not going to be able to work.
We didnt because what had happened was that my husband  when he met me he was just returning from India where he had spent a year as a Fulbright doing [indecipherable] work at the school of tropical medicine on Calcutta.
In addition to that  your work as a an interpreter usually  maximally you could do this for it was for about an hour and a half.
This is tape number three  side A. -- to go back to my work  I walked every morning from my residence to the office  stopped for a cup of -- for breakfast at a little Greek restaurant and it was tough to make ends meet with the pay I r eceived at that time  which was originally quoted as 50 dollars a week  but m -- no  it was quoted as 200 a month  200 dollars a month.
And so from there we went into the gas chamber and as we looked around the corridor of it  there was a  uh  nozzles of gas and the thing that  that um  I-I wanted to share with you that these people that were in the barracks were required to work as long as they could possibly work.
How -- How was that for you  to be back in -- in Auschwitz  specifically?
When we give them to the municipality  there was a note also that those who were loyalty to Hungary would not have to be -- will not be deported and will work in the fields.
And while I was on that -- I received a red point which meant in th e distinction of the camp meant hes not allowed to work outside the camp because they called us Flukfergocht which means suspected of any escape.
And then  did you and your husba nd then get your own room in the camp  or how did that work?
And then when the -- by the way  in the fall of that year we were also asked to sign up for work if we wanted to volunteer to do harvest  wine harvest  and we did that.
Everything  you go out to work  you got something to do  all this.
I used to go in the evening after the store closed to work.
He would see one person  you know  work a little slowly  you know  you all would be gone.
And food then -- then -- at work we -- we had to go for lunch and get food  and so on  yeah.
The same factory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz.
A. My mother said that they took away her sewi ng machine so she couldnt work anymore.
My brother got a job my older brother  together with my father in the same place.
Did you work with him on the stage  or was he no longer acting?
She used to work as a cashier in a bakery before the war.
But things actually  to thinking about the Germans  they have been so organized  everything.
And uh and I got my  I established my contacts with my friends that I used to work for in Japan.
Lay down in the bed  and from this bed people who don't go to work  they send to Auschwitz   for your information.
And that organization -- yes  the organizatio n got the -- got the museum and theyll find work for this community.
The  the Germans could do with us what they want .
We came from work  we opened that gave  some shared with the uh barrack oldest  the blockoldest  and we  we se  let down  and we sat down on our beds  and ne-next to me my friends and we shared it.
Bu t he always and he told me that just before the war he was supposed to go to agricultural school in Palestine and it didn't work out for him.
So when she woke up  she saw all these mask with all these lights  and she screamed  ﬁAyuto  ayuto  ayuto.ﬂ And -- and all of a sudden  a -- several young men in trunk  because it was hot  arrived  beautiful young men who were waiting to pass through the Italian-Swiss border  to come to Italy to work.
Interview with Marc Samuels 18 July 25  2014 What kind of work did you do?
We didnt where we were going  because I believed that we were going to another camp to work  like  to another labor camp to work  but that was me.
Oh  Friends of the Sound is your -- re-really  your -- the group that did all this work with the rescues and the boats  or -- No  no  no  that -- that is -- that is a -- a union of all this who did.
She came to New York and she start to work over there.
The majority of the people in the underground wh ich did the work what we we re doing is sometimes maybe much more heroic of what I ha ve to tell you  did not survive.
On the third day  I went back from work  I worked with my older brother  I walked through the fields  not the city.
I [was] probably too young to work  typically as an eight year old; but they did not  they were not turned out to work every morning  which was the major reason that the starvation rate was limited.
When you come into a new country  he wanted them to know the language.
Every time uh  something really  I thought 'now I'm going ' and...I  they didn't shoot me  I went back to work.
The family lore is that the two of them met when she started doing commercial work for the paper  etc.
So there was a pump a pump  and one side was a guy  a kid an d me  and we were going up and down like this  and pump the water  thats what we did the whole day  up and down  up and down  til they changed us and some other kids came that also do work.
After one year I had to stop there because there were also German women working a nd somebody must have said how can you let a Jew work with German women together.
Well  we m oved back in  but now the the Germans of course came came in that very afternoon.
That was the biggest  you know  as if she won the lottery because - because if she is going to work in the kitchens  we would have what to eat because we just come from a place where we didnt eat for three days  and from Auschwitz where the food was so scarce that we were fainting most of the times.
Yeah  but before that  while you were still in the ghetto  were there previous deportations  previous taking people away?
They started assigning people to work  so we were assigned to Northern Sweden.
Kapo had three  four groups  and he walk from one group to another  you know  to check on the vorarbeiters and we work.
You got a slice of bread in the morning  we got a little bit of watery soup  and you got coffee  maybe a slice of bread at night.
Two days later  I don't go to work anymore  I became a painter.
Well but they transfer me from Auschwitz to Buchenwald   and in Buchenwald   garden was very bad place to work.
Well  then we came here  you know  here was you started to work  you went to school  learning English  accounting  expressions  and English to begin with.
I mean  were you aware of what was going on in Germany?
Okay  they paid me with something less  but I was happy.
The Germans initiated something for Jews which I call forced labor.
So you had to work 3 years with a little pay in order to become a businessman.
And I was able to go to work and manage reasonably well.
He did come back from the work camp  but I always felt for years and years that guilt that I had sent him to a work camp and we did some corresponding and he said that part of his decision was adventure  but he suffered.
So I had a group of people and...uh...and this was a good place to work because this German didn't beat.
And we went to work and by work they said that we're going to live...I mean people just gossip...til July 22.
I didnt have any pass so that if I was caught  I probably would have been shipped out to Treb linka too because we were simply assembling every morning before the action started  however   early in the morni ng to go out and were brought at the end of the day  to the point  to the gate and then we were on our own to get home.. But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two  once we came to work  the captain said when you co me tomorrow to work  br ing your things with you because youre going to be here  interned for your own protection.
They made outside of city  they made somehow as -- a collective workers who could work 7 like all kinds of  how shall I say  shoemakers.

And I  we woke up in the morning  was dark because it was in October  and I noticed father and son was praying  religious Jews  pray  they  lots of Jews were praying  because there were lots of religious Jews  but not so openly  they were standing on the side of a barrack facing Jerusalem and they were playing uh  uh praying  and they German came  he said  \ Los  los  to work!\
It was alr eady the Jewish (unclear word) agency work  the Sohnut (unclear word) and we were brought to Feldafing.

And I he was nice to me and I work  I make money  and he order me suits.
And you will ne ver work  and it will be all a waste of money.\
Thats the way we part ed and I went back to the ghetto  coming back to the ghetto.
You have a foreman  the foreman has to accept you to take you out over there to work.
So Eva and I did what we could over there after work.
I we nt to work as an assistant chef to a place which was very well known at the time called Pioneer Country Club at Greenfield Park  New York which was kosher  strictly kosher.
But they then refused to give me help in the work  because the computers did the work  and as a result  I didnt have enough time for my own insurance business  and I had to consider leaving.
You know I think even small children when theyre living in a situation that is that extreme understand a lot more about what they are and arent supposed to and if you think back to the fact that in the 19th  well even in the 20 th century  fai rly small children would be sent out to work in the factories  in the fields and so forth.
We were sent to work together with the farmers  to to help the farmers.
And it was bunch of really dangerous people  be cause many people who went to work in Germany  not Jewish  were people who -- who -- I -- I mean  I dont want to denigrate anybody  but people in lower level element.
And it's very  very meaningf ul for me to work as a volunteer  because I feel I survived  and so I have to give back.
My si ster recovered sooner and she kind of took over the roll now of the oldest sister and she took care of me and she asked to work in the hospital kitchen so she could stay with me.
You know  in addition to the fact that people had to work  they were always catching people  if you will  for some additional work  but in the ghetto  as I say there was a militia and we were again  ...how shall I say?
Even other people had other work  outside detail work details  but all having to do with the army.
She want to quit that farm and go work in a city for the airplane factory  more money  more time  you know.
Tell me about what you were studying in school [talkover] an d what you were doing for work after?
Hachshara was a training for Israel  to work on the land.
They had picked up all the...as the parents when they went to work  the children are left.
Wherever they have a group of people work on the highways  once you were there  you were safe.
Uh certainly you had to ha ve the the will to survive and I mu st say after the first couple of weeks or months  where very often I was confronted with the question  will I be able to make it  or should I rather uh uh uh put an end to my life in order to be liberated from the misery  but then after one year or so when I got the bette r job and could work as a welder  and also was able to uh to uh get some additional food here a nd there for certain activities  fo r instance  when I was was uh appointed a bed-maker and and also when I was appo inted to be the secretary of the block in order to keep the records  that gave me a chance uh then to to uh somehow keep myself cleaner and and uh also to...my my I would say was was strength ened by by by that... How did you...can you tell me about becoming...how di d it happen that you became the secretary of the block?
So they couldnt speak a work of eng -- of German  but were SS men from the Baltic.
I got back  I got back with the train which arrived at 6:00 in the morning with  when the work star ted.
So  in 1942  you graduated and you went to work in the pharmacy?
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003 15 15 Outside  outside  yes  we used to go from the Zahl Appell from in the morning  they used to take you to work by groups.
Its hard work but then the camp commandant a nd the doctor took all the teenagers and sent us to the trade shops and I end up in a cabinet shop.
Tell me a little bit more about this work  because you were doing the same work for a year and half?
But  there again  I know that these children look for that every year  who can be the best  and they do work 4 yrs.
Well  we marched through the city to our place of work.
Actually  some work even in the coal mine  their heavie st work.
But we were meeting and we got a small grant back about 1990  maybe ‚94 as a result of this work and this group that kept meeting.
SL: No  because if youre sick and you dont -- you have to report to work  right  you work -- she used to work in the air field.
And one day when we came back from work  we have we we just defected from the from from the group  which was large group  when we came back from work.
And the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners  German prisoners.
And my concern was always  I left an eight year old child at home alone while I went to work.
At the beginning I used to work in the  I was responsible for the cutting room.
And people were going to work  and taking  and couldn't understand this.
In 1943  before the uprising  because I attend to this school -- lets start this way -- when I attend to this school  the German sent us for vacation to work for the German factory.
But uh I always wanted to work in research because this is how I was trained.
I remember having to go to Studtgard to the American consult as a family to see if the quota  the number would work.
Do you know much about your mother's family  what they did?
Because the things were  the gas chambers were located was camouflage  nobody has any access to it  except those who work there  so the average prisoner did not know much.
I guess he had formed sort of  I guess you can call that a depres sion or something  but  like  well  who should I really work for  kind of thing  you know.
You know  as I the -- the -- the people that were in camp  were assigned to work positions.
Then they used to bring back a lot of dead people from that work whatev er they did outside.
Assuming that you were designated to come to work on Tuesday  and either you were too busy or you didnt want to  as long as you were able to pay another person to fill in for you  it was okay.
I was young  but people had managed  30  40  they looked different.
Also  you know  wood and such and there were mostly barns and people were housed very crowded in and every morning the younger women would be marched out at daybreak into the fields to work  and the others were left in the camp.
I had to go to work every day  to dig ditches.
And what did the psychiatrists tell you in their lectures  what Well  I re I remember that the time we le we were there for a while  we got a received a lecture  say  you fellas are getting a 90 day resting period  and and Interview with Anthony Acevedo October 13  2010 82 you must you must not go to work  you must not get married  you must not go to school yet.
I did that and when the...looked like the war was winding down a good deal  I moved over to the Labor Branch of the Department of the Army because there were tremendous manpower shortages in various industries: aluminum  forge and foundry work  and so on.
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 41 From the Jewish community  yeah  Jewish community for work with immigrants -- work with immi -- so  this was the largest gathering of Jews in the sta -- in the history of Portland  over 600 people there. [
And  they were dir ecting them to work  although they were  they didn't know nothing what about the e h  eh  eh characteristic of that work  but just the--standing there and shouting and beating the prisoner or killing them because  you know  sometimes eh a killing was a eh prescription for the  for how  how the  you know  the commando eh  eh should  eh  should eh  eh  look like after they return to the camp.
But we were taken in in the same process like when we arrived to be processed for work.
>> Bill Benson: Bob  during that time  what did your mother do?
So while he was over there working  he made arrangeme nts to obtain the permission to work in Holland  which he did.
And when the German came she started work as a prostitute.
So apparently -- I realized the next morning when the -- we hear d about the attacks on -- on the radio  I realized why I was made to work late that day and w hy we suddenly worked on these air raid shelter plans.
Then they turned around to us  the able -bodied people  the people that have ID cards  turned around to them  and also the people who they saved that was not with ID  they did other things  maybe shoe makers  maybe carpenters  maybe bakers  who knows  but the able -bodied looking people that were able to work so they saved them.
You went there to find work  you went to the conservatory to find work and you im mediately got married.

We lived with her for about a month till my parents found work and our own apartment.
The parents could not work because my father  by the first time he lifted up the -- Saw? --
They slept in the woods  and they were doing the mine work.
No  I think that what I -- the work that Ive been doing has always been kind of something that Ive done by myself and I really have no contact with the other volunteers at all.
Then I thought  \ T hat's the work of Hauptsturmfuhrer Doctor Wirths.
Couldn' t. We couldn't work on the railroad  we couldn't work on the streetcar.
On all kind of work  whatever's got to be done you know like clean the stables ... PAUSE Tell me about working from the fire house.
You would gather doing work and you would...somebody would say something  but then one night indeed they took us on a train and this train supposedly was taking us to Auschwitz.
He had only permission to work  my boss   cause over there citizens dont go they dont give out citizens just like this.
We will find for her some light  not too difficult work  and she will work.
In the end of June of the same summer  a call went out from this organization for able bodied men  whom they ha ve on their roster already  to report for volunteer work in the states around the Lublin district to help with the harvest.

Then we have recently done some work in connection with the claims by American soldiers at or Americans who are seeking restitution from Germany for incarceration in concentration camps.
And coming to America and being in New ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 24 York  the only place I wanted to work was 5th Avenue.
And in the morning  we -- that was -- we -- when we came in  it was there at night  too.
Then  when I finished my night shift  some of a little bit earlier  before the men went to work the day shift  so I sneaked into my fathers barrack.
I said  \ Listen  tonight release all the young people who are able to work for one night.\
So you guys make those saws huh  and they work huh.
And every day  I wondered  \ How long am I going to remain in the work group?\
And he died either in Bad wamvorn which I guess is a work camp or in Auschwitz.
No  its not the work  the work was very much what he wanted.
But uh this way she was able to get the job in the library in an art museum and that's the kind of work she still does today.
So he went to a Pollack to work for him  and he worked for a little.
But this is again  as I told you  freedom without justice does not work  therefore  because innocent people get hurt.
She made an agreement they had to put down about $5 000 I think and I should work for them.
And that was special some woman who looks for a work for a girl or some sister.
And we came to a camp called Strzelnica  that was within the premises of the Starachowice area  where the Nazis were establishing a work camp for slave labor.
And everybody who used to work with us  and who is here  and I t -- I telling the story everybody.
I said  I dont know  because my husband didnt want me to work.
>> Bill Benson: What did your mom do then with you at that point?
So they in the summer they send us to a camp where we could help  you know  with the harvest or whatever  to work there  or do something.
They demanded -- they demanded people who could work and so forth  and periodically they took.

>> Henry Greenbaum: Well  they wouldn't let anybody go to work.

And they started to work  and Cotts was informed  was the President of these ateliers.

And -- and then  of course  when I came to the United States I had to work Saturday right from the start and it so -- it so -- And that -- you were working for a Jew in a kosher store?

You know  they took the Jews to work to put the names in every building  you know  who were and he was there.
And a lot of people didn't work and a lot of people worked  of course  the pay wasn't much  there was like a  you were more on the rations they were giving out food or clothes and things like that.
The Germans put the Jews to work in slave labor and it was very hard work.
Very shortly after I started  I was efficient enough at it so that I asked to go on piece work.
>> Susan Snyder: You and your mom  your mother's doing this work  actually trying to help this group  you know  cause a blockage and create this problem for the German Army.

And so David Maxwell-Fyfe 20  later Lord Kilmuir  the Lord...the Chancellor of England came over to see what Jackson was doing because between the time of the London Agreement on August 8th and the issuance of the indictment on about October 17th  or something like that  of 1945  there was a great deal of work had to be done.
I think they sent them to some work camps  but not too many.
And you talked about the development of the community in David and Im wondering– and you also talked about the establishment of the Kentuckians for the Commonwealth  which was called Fair Tax Coalition first  and the work that that organization started on doing.
ﬁOh ﬂ they used to say  ﬁoh  you go probably where you going to have to l -- be over there  do some work  labor.ﬂ [indecipherable] all  and we didnt know it until we arrived around midnight  probably  over there  and the firs t thing I saw it when they brought in  they opened the gate  and it said  the gate said ab ait bakt fry.
We tried to bring her here for vacation and stay with her but visa did not work.
Did she have any help at home  or did she do this all herself?
My uncle somehow managed to c onvince the Germans to to come with him and bring some some papers that Mother is needed to work in the kitchen on the railroad tracks.
My pare nts were assigned to do work  slave labor  for Philips Electronics.
I sat right next to him and he was the most wonde rful person you would want to work for.
So  there was a very careful vetting of each individual  and I think there was a fear by the officials involved  that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the former concentration camps  or in Holland  or in Greece were somehow either a provocation or a difficulty  an embarrassment  difficult to contro l. Whatever it was  it was difficult.
And they didnt have to commute very far to go to work?
And I came here on a Tuesday and Monday I went to work as a finisher.
And they respect me  because I did my work real good.
And I was getting offers from people to work in different capacity.
There was no uh uh opportunity to to start at the New York Times then  so I decided to keep on working uh as a waiter and start college again  and I uh uh started  in uh '46  I started at Hofstra University  then Hofstra College  graduated in '48  uh went on for graduate work at Columbia uh and uh then uh got my first job uh and ultimately became both an administrator - I was  I wrote uh on on the field of Germanistics   and here is where really the experiences where I had to make a personal decision  and it was sort of a watershed and I was at Columbia.
One was the hay  and then there was another one where she was late for work  cause she had gotten like gone back to get a jacket  or something  because it was starting to rain.
Anyway  lets see  I s -- I sort of didnt tell you anything about my life  but anyway  I -- at one point  I-I started work -- when I came back from the military  I started working for the federal governme nt  and in the college  I had taken up USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 75 accounting  that was my major.
Oh yeah  there -- there was -- on the jo b. And as a laborer  you -- I mean like one guy  which was retired from [indecipherable] company  went to work for there for driving a taxi  and they call him Hebrew  y ou know?
Hazelwick  I want to work  but this would defeat the purpose.
When your mother left to go to work  were you upset by that?
An organizer  not the community organizer  but in the time that was  we work on making units of the soldiers.
Did you work on the farm  and if so  what did you do?
01:25:20 So then you were put in with a work group  or separated from your... Family.
And we started organizing  and after they came in and the plan was worked out that everybody at his place at work--usually wherever we worked  there was an SS man watching and a few Ukrainians--e verybody at his place of work has to kill his SS and his Ukrainian at the same time  the same minute also.
All kind -- and manual work  it didn t mean anything.
So Masha went to work in a kibbutz in Lodz and made friends with the Brichah and took a transport in 1945...I wasn't even fifteen years old...in July I was fifteen.
They have an agent which introduced in our organization  and to the agent that we work with him  probably was wired to some people.
The...we did not stay too long in that particular camp; because as work progressed  we were sent to a different camp called Larche.
So there was no work so we just did useless work  which was very  very hard.
Had to start all over again of course and I called it quits  and when I was eighteen I went to work.
And what were you doing -- what kind of work were you doing by the time you left?
Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up  and from there well be able to go to Palestine  and so on.
Can you describe your relationships with the other volunteers at the museum  who are survivors or witn esses to the Holocaust?
And this was a godsend because we now had to work indoors.
That lasted until January '45 when the first wave of American bombers attacked and three quarters of the city was bombed and fire and there was no work because the factory was not destroyed.
And -- and we worked outside and then la -- on the -- on the -- in the gardens and grew our own vegetables  and it was -- it was -- it was an absolutely work place.
Well  it wasn't appropriate  I guess  for somebody who lives with the boss to work with these common people who work in the sewing room.
Eh eh so eh eh it was in that I did that work yeah.
The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day  that I was at home  and I worked in the office  and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the Ghetto  if I had to go out for something.
He is very successful in his work  but you know  he makes no money hardly at all.
12 hour work shifts  six and a half days a week.
Did your mother have did she work with your father at all?
Let's run over th ere  take a shovel ﬂand a...and a broom and see...pretend that we work here.\
She would come  take care of the baby so that my mother could work the fields with my father.
We will talk about that more  about your work  your legacy  a little later.
So those who 83 worked for the German [indecipherable] organi zations  German [indecipherable] could go to work.
Then  after the work is all done  you back again and you count if nobody is missing.
So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.
And she was -- and she was sent to -- she was sent to a factory in Glasgow  and -- just 45 miles from Edinburgh and she used to work there -- she stayed with my aunt in Glasgow through the week and then come back at the weekends.
Anyhow  we worked at that detail up to the evacuation of Auschwitz  the death march  and that really saved our life because we were already getting terribly run down from the outdoor work in the marshes  you see  and now it was getting worse because the winter was coming.
My older sister Anna 1  my second sister Chris  and I were in the same wagon coming from the work camp in Starachowice  while our father was in an adjacent wagon with the men  also out of the camp in Starachowice.
And I come back home after work and I told Edna  I'm not excited.
So your uncle is out -- So my uncle -- my -- I -- you know  I -- my time descriptions  I dont know exactly why that happened  but my aunt arranged for my uncle to work in a little God-forsaken town thats not even on the map  not a town  a little village.
There was a a movie called rou Rosenschein   or something like that  which described one of these work camps in in Hungary .
It's so cold  so they send me to work...one day they sent to me to work at the stone quarry.
had to walk up and down the highest mountain  carry stones and rocks and cement  very hard work for young girls.
Do you -- do you have any memories of your father?
And I told Chaim  even if it means never to work again  I cant do this type of work.
They usually work -- SE: No  looks here  here -- CE: Yeah.
And it was some -- somehow in the morning  it was already daylight.
Two months later  in April  precisely on April 30  1941  the apprentice workshop of ORT  where I was apprenticing for sort of mechanic and m achine shop work  was ordered closed by the Gestapo  and all students in there were supposed to report to the labor office.
It wasnt easy  but we went back to -- we had to cross the borders illegally.
Well a good  before my father was taken to the  to Sachsenhausen.
Germans in camp were always occupying some f unctions whether they were in charge of the barracks or in charge of your work commando or whatever.
Finally something hit me because I had this young polish people signing up to go to Germany to work.
I used to work for them -- I used to work for them about two months or three months.
Back to the barracks  we spent a whole day in the camp  went back to the barracks  that same day  back to work again in the factory.
And when  when I was healthy enough again  then I went to work in one of the children's homes.
Somehow I was pulled to that profession  and I always wanted to work with children to protect them  to make sure that they're safe and protected and all right.
A nd we didn't disregard them in trying to work out the compensation laws to indemnify them for their injuries.
That the idea is good and just now again I will tell you about this Russian work I read yesterday before I go to bed.
But here  one thing is that we had  we thought that we had left anti -Semitism in the old country and when we came to New York  the first thing that there was some friends that had come  you know  my father's friend and the first thing they told us was to me  you know I was looking for work  don't bother applying to any banks or any insurance companies or IBM because they don't hire Jews.
And somebody got to do  and I enjoy the people here to work with and I learn a lot through what I read  through a person can never say he knows everything.
She used to work in the factory before and I worked on four looms and she set the looms in motion and she said to me  pull yourself together and I remember I still heard the beating of the loom  you know  and ev erything was sort of at different angles because I was running a very high temperature and he came for inspection.
A Good brigade means you can work hard  its no different.
In that camp  they took us out to work within the camp.
As was the case with most of the Jews and under this circumstances  we experienced unbearable pain because of hunger  suffering  and degredation and hard work.
And by the way they came to take the children when the  when the  when the people were out to work.
And then  in the process of -- of t-talking  he told me he was Jewish  because we were talking.
Interview with Helen Goldkind February 21  2001 76 Have you exchanged your story with other volunteers that -- survivor volunteers at the museum?
And they did observe the shala -- sha -- Shabbat  and the [indecipherable] The Sabbath  yes.
And to work as hard physically as I had to work  took all I had and a bit more  you know?
I think the the the museum d-doing the the museum work is almost like therapy.
And every Pole had to give a week work for nothing.
Yes  I began noticing that there  somewhere around 75  or something And so that in some ways  it is saying okay  we will work within the system  because this is all that weve got  and well give them their duorkle   their due  and then well Yeah  yeah  thats exactly what the provincial pa-papers did.
If we could start with the last day or two before you left the Soviet work camp  how did you find out you were leaving?
Not after well  lets see  that would be a-after  actually after I was discharged  and got very I went to work f I went to work for a a mannequin  where I designed the mannequins for for clothing style.
69 In other words  they were all experts in the sense that they continued to work with primary source documents  they continued to write histor y  they continued to analyze documentation  and they kept up on the latest research in the field in which th ey were expert.
Only because I was still able to work we transported  the Germans wanted to clean up that camp  and we had to transport the dead bodies  decomposed bodies  to the mass grave that day  and all of a sudden only and you couldnt get out of line  and my best friend Kurt Spitzkopf  with whom I went toge ther all the time from Minsk  a ll of a sudden  while we were  he said  Heinz  theres my mother.
Here you have to work  not with your brain  not with you brow  not with your brains.ﬂ So he assigned a barrack  a barrack  you know  like used to held animals you know.
But I went to the Did you did you work in the U eh Oh yeah  I was working.
And nowadays they have a company of about 200 people that work on this.
Happy  I know that my personal life leaves much to be wished for or desired  but I did find out that relationship doesn't work for me.
I didn't know during the last years of the war where I would go  so I knew that I had to do something in Holland and by coincidence in touch with the underground and that is why I started to work for them  but after the war  so many people in Holland talked oh I was in the underground too.
If somebody knew something special they wouldn't let him go because they needed his work.
Just do your work and dont say nothing to one another.
So my father arranged that I went to work on a farm.
Well  it took a few -- a couple of weeks before Mr. London could get the permit for me  but every morning and every evening I was taken by car to work  which was wonderful except it was a glorified prison  because where they lived was very excluded.
10 And he said  \ I know how old you are.ﬂ He said  \ You can go and work in the ammunitions factory.ﬂ And that's...that is how my mother was saved  because he had recognized her.
When we got to work they came for this work with a horse and carriage to give a days duty  performance  whatever.
Mrs. Rothschild  Ida Rothschild and she wanted us to stay with her which she was  actually had a grocery store and a small apartment in Brooklyn and I dont know if she thought my mother was going to work in the grocery store.
Be si -- since Father was working at the shipyard  he immediately put them to work there.
Josie's volunteer work at this Museum includes leading tours of the Permanent Exhibition for law enfo rcement  including police officers  the FBI  judges and others.
So we started to think -- and I al so  when I was in Breslau  I start -- well  even in Krakow   I started to work in that organization  a Zionist organization.
That's how we had to march into the camp  back into the camp from work  and the music was playing.
Yeah  in Nowosibirsk I got of work at the komatata .
On 16 blocks people lived who were sent to do outside work.
And so I didn't speak a word of English and yet I knew that it was very important for me to learn if I was ever going to get some work.
And uh  they had to be a place ready where those people coul d stay  and a lot of factories were given  uh taken away from thei r owners in Czechoslovakia and around  and some German trust  trustees come  and they take over the factory  and they get all those people to work  and they pay so much  they have to pay for the food of those people  was about 50 cents a day.
He doubles his job in the camp  locksmith; he did locksmith work  he and an another person named Otto Kraus.
She was a social worker who had been part of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue  which was then just called Free Synagogue because Steven Wise was still living.
On the -- the work place or somewhere  not concentrated where we -- yea h  it was the camp  it was the office -- the office workers of the camp.
hours of hard work  so I didn't go back there anymore.
And -- but they -- Marnie and Ben knew about the JDC  they had done some work for the JDC and they sent me around to the JDC Paris office  where I met Green leigh  Arthur Greenleigh  G-r-e-e-n-l-e-i-g-h  who was running the program of the Joint in Pa ris at that point.
And there you have still some hope that maybe  maybe you will be taken for work.
One time I was caught in the street  just for work.
The work was to hard  and uh I don't feel good.\  \
So he -- but he had a very broad  general educati on  so that permitted him to work as an economist  and since the war was approaching  he was able to fill in a lot of information about industrial production  coal mining and the like from -- in Germany because that had been his background  even when he was a lawyer for the coalminers union.
So he had to go to work  so he told us to stay in the apartment.
You couldn't do more than that with a little pump when you had 500 people to go through and here you had to go out to commandos  it's called  work commandos.
So I wanted to work in the lab  and I think he had two labs  one was for hi s real business  the other one probably for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 54 some other business.
Uh  but uh... (Pause) You know  it's interesting how th ese things work.
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2  2001 88 Yeah  I wa What were your what were your impressions?
The people were taken care of in that old -age home.
The next day she went to work just like anybody else.
So I was coming to work every day with the hope  my dreams kind of encouraged  maybe he'll find him.
So now these were Germans who weren t in the town before?
And uh I just refused to get into individual case work  uh services.
Tell me about the work that you do at the Holocaust museum.
And what did you do during the day in the ghetto?
We had to line up so that we were chosen to go to work  and where to go to work  and I was standing there  and looking at the heavens  and I was praying for myself  for my mother  my father  and my whole family.
Did they feel that maybe they could do something to help the Jewish people too?
Now  I know they went to Auschwitz  so -- as a rule  you know my sister was -- the -- you know  they was -- they were too young yet  you know  in Auschwitz the way the system  so they separated those -- those -- those who are able to work yet  know -- women or men and th-they -- they werent -- you know  I -- I -- I was sure that  you know  they went to the right or the left.
Was it ever important to you to talk about with other people your experiences during the Holocaust.
In France for a young fellow  I don't know how it is now  you needed a permit for a young man to go to work  and I didn't have that permit.
Its being friendly  its being togetherness  trying to work together  trying to understand each other from different parts of the world.
So the doctor didnt treat him  but he gave him a paper he cant work.
And they brought us to this camp  and we were there.
And to be part of that work group was very desirable because you had acces s to -to clothing.
But that they actually evacuated them  she knew that to o. That was only to work on road construction or whatever the case may have been.
In fact we were on starving ration and that was the idea  let them work as long as they can and then drop dead  and then they're just going to take them away.
The younger ones that looked older and were very developed  somehow the Germans accepted them more as the healthy el ement to work because they were young and well-developed.
And they were -- they did work for the -- for the government  you know  with -- for the army.
And that's -- I came and I started to work with my brother.
I did a lot of volunteer work with students on different projects when my kids were in school.
Now we have a place in these houses where a long house was together and it was not dilapidated too much  and there they wanted to make sort of a hotel  which means a place were where people work.
If you're sick or you can't work  you have no right to live altogether.
And just when the ghetto was formed  this was part of the ghetto.
You both talked a little bit about how it was [indecipherable] a self government -- government system -- ML: Well  each block -- H-How did that work  yeah.
But later on  for instance  when we worked in Reval -- we did not always work in the ports.
I had a feeling of  everybody knew  of impending doom  of th ings that were going to happen  but I wasn't totally wiped out or down in the dumps about it  I had a rather good feeling about it  and when it came time for our responsiv e answer to the guy that was doing the selection  my mother spoke up  she became the h ead of our family unit  and she explained to the guard that her husband and father work on the work detail at the airport  the aerodrome  and the aerodrome was an extremel y vital part and in order not to disrupt their well-being  and with her immediate pr oper response  we were allowed to go home as a family unit again  and we survived that selection where a lot of people didn't.
What  what happened with his work  with his career  did he remain on that committee after the communist takeover  or did he continue  you also mentioned that he went back to work for his former employer  did he continue to work for this former em ployer?
In an old  it was once a prison   but very nice  beautiful and the director was the chief there an d every family had a room of his own and everybody had to do something to work for yo ur keep  you know.
Right  but the -- the Poles did  but I mean these people -- Yeah  and the Germans.
The...uh...the State Department doesn't have anyone who knows the German  and so...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in Havana.
And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work  but when they have seen that we really were not working what they have beaten us.
