So  what was the store she was work she wasnt working that day  but what was the store you had gone to?
All day we had to fill those carts with the sand.
02:22:47 So I got back into the...to the....uh... working camp and I got back on...uh...on several details and...uh...I managed to get myself onto a detail to work in a woman's camp.
His son graduated from the University of Jerusalem and did graduate work in Amsterdam and Brussels.
I was in that carpentry work shop and there was a call on the telephone and the manager of the shop...uh... went to the ph one and listened very seriously and then he turned to us and said  \ There is some action on the way and you will be safer at home.\
So they tried the same way  but it Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20  2009 124didnt work with them  so its also fall apart.
Everybody says if you say you are good in mechanics and metal work  you will ha ve a better job.
And then they needed apartments and we were put into the ghetto  and in the ghetto a officer of the army who was in charge of this work camps came into the ghetto and pulled all these men out hoping that if he puts them in the camp that we're safe then.
The Germans came in and took everybody away from the l ine and locked us up.
So  in what capacity did he did he work with Interview with Niklas Frank June 6  2016 150 Freisler  and did he ha do you remember him having a personal opinion about him  or My my father founded the Academy for German Right.
After a couple of weeks when I was out of these um  um murder commandos  I uh  got a job as an assistant for the  for ----------  and was able to work in a hole  protected against the elements  and uh  there was also a bathroom which could be used  uh  otherwise we were not allowed to use the bathrooms of the German super-superrace  and there found a mirror  and I looked in to the mirror  and I got  I was aghast  I was  I couldn't believe myself that that's me.
So they were [indecipherable] they were policemen that they -- they used -- that they used by the Germans as Jewish police to keep order or carry out  you know  some of the orders that the Germans use d  especially in rounding up people  you know  for -- for the labor camps and checking documents and so forth.
He and several thousand of them went to work for the northeast part of Hungary  which was a freshly reoccupied part of Hungary.
Thats him -- nobody wanted to work or -- for him.
So I asked Mr. London to let me work in the machine shop  learn how to sew  but that was inappropriate at the time  so the owner to work with girls  so he said \ no.\
I know only a little bread  and on the way to work  always a bite.
Sometimes picking up some things...real manual work that didn't mean anything to you that you had to do because you were told to do that.
The German always liked my work  the way I laid the bead nicely.
So  try to rectify the mistake as s oon as you can  so this way its going to be much easier to work on it and its going to be quicker.
Uh in the same time  my husband began began to work...how to say to work  to influence uh his uh business friend from the Spanish Consulate who was the the name Dr. Farkas Zolta .
Three days after that  the -- the -- the manufacturer  who -- who was that other foreman said that  ﬁWe cannot keep you here longer than three days  because the others  we have to give some work  too.ﬂ Yeah  so they give them the work.
We -- somebody wrote it on wood and we had it -- hang it up in -- in -- in the work r oom.
My work at that factory consisted of working first with the bales  carrying the bales and sometimes just dusting the asphalt with the dry sand.
You know  a young man like me  I know the guy what they grabbed me for work.
At this point did you know anything about your mother or your father?
But the works condition was terrible because was very heavy work  very difficult work.
And  my mother didn't work  and I was little and my sister I think she was in school.
And stayed there and from there they took the men to work.
Is that ultimately what led you to volunteer at the museum?
I was shocked  shocked twice  so maybe this agreement that maybe was done with the Elderstrat  with the authorities through the ghetto  didn't work  or maybe another thing  so that's a puncture.
Its a lathe that -- [indecipherable] -- does repetitive work  you know  you set it up once  and it keeps knocking out hundreds of pieces of whatever you set it up for.
Thats actually interesting to me that you didnt get bothered when you were at work.
I said I have to work and I have to send him to a private school and we have to move there and after school  he went to Ohr Kodesh and took more Hebrew.
You see  when the ghetto was instituted  they had the large ghetto  and they had the small ghetto.
When there were enough sick people when they couldn't go to work  there were quite often  I don't exactly know  we didn't know what the purpose was  he says everybody up  you know.
In the fee -- and it was so hot in the summer  and the German was standing over you and you couldn t -- you know  you really couldnt not work  or play that you are sick  or you dont feel good.
>> Bill Benson: As you told us a few minutes ago  the Iron Guard did the dirty work for the Nazis.

Now second two family what we did and I was help to father because I was one family member to work with father because I was twenty two years old  I was not young like my brother  sixteen  or my sister  twelve or fifteen.
But the ambiance  and the work that is not work  and the food that isnt food  and the constant roll calls  and the threats if you dont show on roll call everybody else gets killed and all this  this has another dimension.
This in   in the  in the movie  I think  is that  that some people would work with the Germans there  they had access and they stole  it shows in the movie  and uh  so  I took Selma by the hand and I  I figured   if we don't run here we are dead  and I grabbed her and we run to the main gate  and people after us  and that is the way we came out from the camp.
Yo u went out to work when you were in the ghetto?
Thats German for the work they do is they dig ho -holes.
Thats why I do appreciate the kind of work youre doing here and what  you know  what everybody does.

Is there any reason for that  th at they might not think that he was a Jew or did they just not know  is that They did not realize that he was a Jew and like I said earlier  the German Jew was first German.
And it took so hard work  I came to America  I had to pay $10 to remove it.
Now  about his work  why no  there was no question about it.

They put on rifles and they went out to work with us  the women you know  after a time that everything calmed down.

And then he took in my sister to work in an office as a -- whatever she did have  but she didnt have -- allowed this -- this particular job.
Because the camps also  the camps themselves were operated in a large part by slave labor  which was pretty horrible  and some of the work that people had to do was pretty horrible.
We was working like slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other place to work in pieces of assembly of ai rplane.
And then I found out later I was supposed I [indecipherable] enter  because they wanted to send me to either Oak Ridge or Los Alamos to work on the atomic bomb.
By that point I know you  you know  from your story we get a sense of of real intensive focus on the work that youre doing  on the technology  on learning everything that you know about it.

something like that  in the morning before you even start to work.
