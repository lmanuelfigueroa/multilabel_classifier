MG: What daily life was like I said before  you got up in the morning  you went to work  and you came back and you were glad to have come back to uh and I mean you more or less the Jews were very inventive.

>> Bill Benson: And as you said  your mom then made the decision to put you into hiding.
But I think I experienced that more when I wa s selected for work.
Most Germans just woul dnt want to work in that  and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could produce.
Since then I have done charity work for the mentally handicapped and for the frail elderly.
How did you get to the ghetto  what did you take with you?
And did you did your mother still have help around the house?
39 They were small cards because all we had was the name  as I told you  the birth date  the barrack number where they lived or slept  and the department where they work  and a place whether hes still alive or dead.
They were the guards  they were the people who conducted the convoys going to work  and from work.
We tried to alleviate their problems by just show ing that we are there for them and for them  especially for children who came out from broke n homes  who had who had uh a brush with the law and so on  so that we considered them as uh as people who had to be saved and this was part of our work between our contribution to try to help them  a nd uh this was I would say very important because there we esta blished personal friendships  uh girls and boys and and uh we we we we followed the principle of Boy Scouts.
We fought for our life every day because when we came home from work  and we marched back into Buna  there was an -- an SS men standing there  and he decided whether you Interview with Gert Silver March 30  2006 35were fit to live another day  or whether you were so weak that they sent you to the gas chamber.
My father was work in Gdansk for a shipping company  and then he came to Warsaw for the last few years he worked  and the rebuilding the housing in the city  and then he went retired  and I was I was able to get him to s to come to America for a few weeks  few days.
After we left  we -- we -- the train stopped in Berlin  was bombed that time.
I do remember having work there  and what impressed me in my memory is that one day a man came from -- came in and asked me  ﬁAre you a Jew?ﬂ I said  ﬁWhy would you want to know?ﬂ And he said  ﬁI just was at the police station and I heard them say that at this hotel works a Jew  and they come to pick him up.ﬂ So I dropped everything  changed my clothes  went to the railroad station and went home.
So that's what you had to do too and - So that was -- sometimes they made you do other work besides the flax?
Deception being that the Jews were promised to go to the east where theres work  shelter for them and they imagined that nothing could be worse than the ghetto so the poorest of the poor began to report to the umschlagplatz with their luggage .
The way they took through people was they went to work outside and they could squeeze me  but he was already an educated guy.
But I went and he said  he worked for your father  your father had -- I said  yes  my father in that time wa s sick and he couldnt work by himself  and he took this person for -- and I remember him very well.
You know  I used to get up in the morning and go to work and then used to come back.
So then we have three in Astoria for a while  and we started to work.
So I saw the -- how do you do when they have to work to the Germans  sign for the thing  get a card.
Ah  15 -- or 15 I was already in fo -- 1943  so -- and I started to work in 1942 probably  when I was 14.
And th en later we work to load the trucks with full cases of of those drinks  help driv ers to help to help help drivers to load this his trucks  so he put where he want  according to his schedule  you know  first go first and so on.
Th-the -- the Jews  but they were still a little bit healthier  they walked into the kitchens to work  so they make money  they sold to the Germans.
People were dying  and people were sick  and some people we re shot  and he had to provide the work force every morning  regardle ss of how many people were available.
And then I went over there  and I am you know  pick up some woo you you know  I work  you know  like in the garden.
I remained with this family for about another two  three weeks and they came an order from the Germans that from each family somebody has to go to work in the fields or somebody to collect potatoes or other -- you know you take down from the fields.
When they started with the ghetto and they needed people to work for them.
And since we were going into fa rming  I went to work for a gardener and learned a little bit there.
They will arrange it  and once you will [indecipherable] in the -- in the certain order we will  it will work by themselves  unfort.ﬂ So  Rode russer was very afraid  because Roomkofsky got aggravate  he could send him away right aw ay to -- to be transported out to -- to Auschwitz  whatever it is.
So this factory -- I mean  he was able to -- to get some part ners  and he did go for 107 awhile  but then  here again  it was difficult  and hard to get materi als and things like that  so the factory wasnt going very well  and Freddy decided to -- to work elsewhere  which was a big shock for my father  because he was counting on having his help.
Let him work someplace where he can create his holy mission  save lives.
So  when they left to come to work and they used to be at work by the time we had got out of our camp and gone but they had to come past the entrance to our camp to get into the factory. [
So No rman  because of high position  was able for me to work out  I should be accepted.
There was a German asking young girls...put them...if they want to work  put them into a column and we were...after a long walk  we find ourselves on the airport of Polobonic.
Marcel and Ania also work on the current museum exhibit titled \ Some Were Neighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the Holocaust\  which opened in 2013.
I went to work for him  then he was hospitalized again for a very  very long time.
So  they were in Holland and hiding together with the Jews.
And they took them there to work and they forced them to write letters to their wives  they are okay and they are alive and they are working.
And maybe the atrocities of the Holocaust are not as important as the history that allowed this Holocaust to happen and we have to work day and night that this doesn't happen again  that we never put ourselves in that position as a nation  that we don't go after one group of people  no matter who they are.
It was rea lly lies  but to make it -- it -- its prepa -- a preparation for something else  bu t -- so they took 200 people  other words  let us go to work.
No  thats okay [indecipherable] the-then -- Okay  [indecipherable] in Italy -- he arrive in -- he arrive in the United States of America in 40 - 41  okay  this is all his work  this has nothing to do with it.
Which is good because you meet the people and you work for them  and they do good job  and -- and this is a free country  you know  and you can -- you can do -- so long  you know  you no do anything wrong  you know  against the gove rnment  you know.
We thought that they're going to do something to us  they're going to tell us don't go here  don't go there  don't do this.
They march us to the main gate  which is a familiar sign  \ Work makes you free.\
It was very hard work for the men and do you know the--the German--the forma and the assistants were very well-- SB: We got to put another roll up.
He had this Jewish editor  and he said it was very precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films  at the same time.
Because we heard it the day the day before and that had to do with the fact that my dad was so much involved in community work uh in uh within the Jewish associations  etc.
Did the clinic work with any of the other rescue organizations in any way?
The implication was that if we didnt work  we wouldn't eat.
And not knowing  really  the depth of that tragedy  I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't.
And work we we werent allowed to walk on the sidewalk; the middle of the street.
My son  when he s -- he was accepted in the same program  but when he saw that -- the kind of work my daughter had to do  he says to me  he says  ﬁIm not going to do it.ﬂ So I -- My wife and I  we up -- we wrote a letter to the director of the program  please give him one year USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0037 59 delay  a one year -- put him on a one year wa iting period.
Totally innocent  unlike the boys and the girls today  I was just a dreaming little boy  wanting to work [indecipherable] But he wasnt so innocent.
And I took some time off from work and then later on  hired a babysitter so I could go back to work.
We were only three or four days going over  you know  three -- nights.
And th en in May 1948 the American Friends Service Committee said  well  you've been working for British Friends Relief Service  and now that job is finished  why don't you come work with us for a little whil e. So I came over from England technically for two years and worked in Philadelphi And then I was going to leave and they said we have a very funny project in Washington.

And it used to get stuck during the night and in the morning I used to take it off and I went to work like that.
So I worked from  he was five  63 to I went to -- full time to Columbia School of Social USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 18 Work in s -- I worked for 10 years  73 I went there.
Poles admitted some groups and organized relief action  as I found out later also with the help of young people of the Polish-Jewish youth movement in Poland  and uh it was so absurd that I remember when we did this work  uh there we re transports still rolling towards the east and on the other side of the of the railway station  uh wagons  coaches came back with Jews who had not been admitted and had been pushed back  but they originated not from Germany but from Vienna  for instance  so that the problem for th e Jewish community was to bring them back at their expense to Vienna because they had nothing to do in Berlin and uh amongst these uh uh people who were deported were were were was a couple from Hanover by the name of Greenspan   and uh as you know from hist ory  young Greenspan who had lived in Hanover and had left his home in Hanover and had went ...had gone to Paris and lived in Paris under abominable conditions...he was not...he had no pe rmission to stay.
So  even in my town you could find a lawyer  the doctor  the engineer  but at the same tim e the carpenter  the shoemaker  and any type of work.
You see they didn't have enough uh guards to guard us from--there was a shift--was a shift--there was a thousand people they use to go work  you know.
And I uh  I do believe that if you were blessed with imagination that th at you could work that.
But I had some Hebrew education when I was going in in school in Europe  you know  before we were taken away and so I was not involved per se in theirs  except supervising t hem that they are doing their work and like a mother  a good mother's supposed to do.
Well  when I came into the United States  the  I got home  and I went to work.
And she  now I haven't really talked about the deportati ons  but the deportations had started a month earlier and Jews working in defense plants were understood to be exempted from deportations  so she had come to work main ly to show our foreman  Alexander Siegel  the summons to see what he could do for her.
This was...this was just a school girl that was very...uh...I don't...I am not sure if she wrote anything more  but she...I became very friendly with her and one morning when I came to work she gave me a piece of paper and this here was the poem.
the 10 people  marching out the door to their destiny  wh ich they received by the work service person  yeah.
He was at that time 47  48  and my sister Mag-Magda she was  the only one sent to the right  you know  to  to work.
That was in '42  in the summer of '42  so I went to school  a mid...a middle school you can say where I did some work  school work.
I think we were told we were going to the east to work.
It was the worst work and was working outside and I  maybe I learned like the animal the necessity of survive.
And they took advantage of this and they really ber -- th-they were terrible  they were worse than Germans.
But our main job was to work in the ammunition factory .
I went to work for the -- I mean  the largest employer in th is community is the federal government.
So when we came back from work hes -- he didnt let us in.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 5 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: homes.
Did you know what was taking place in Germany  especially once the war began?
My mother was assigned to go to work  and sometimes she was able to take me with her.
So they knew how to handle who could work  no -- the -- the head of the department was a fello w by the name of David Yeelgla.
They wouldn't have to ask the population to do the work for them.
I also had a -- I used to work very clos ely with the people in Friends House in London.
The middle one  I came back from the night shift one day  Harriet was her name  I came back from the night shift -- we don't have a picture of her -- they let them go to work  then they let the night shift in.
So youve -- you have ma ny languages  but w -- have you been able to use this knowledge at all in your work?
We know you have camps for internees  refugees  just to work and for food.
So from that point of view  I had an opportunity to do things during those unus ual periods of time  which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in Haifa University  and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics.
I had one man who did not want to go to work at the field.
For your husband's work and -- Interview with Eva Desrosiers 65 And then he had a heart attack a nd he had to come back to the states.
And we werent afraid to work  and they could see that.
All right  but at that time  do you have any sense of a My father went to work  but but but the the trains were horrible.
So I had someone already  Thomas Blatt 30 July 26  1996 Page 30 and he said  \ Okay  in that case  maybe you would like to work with me.\
But there -- each situation is different  and we  as citizens of the world again  not just we the United States  or we the west  we as citizens of the world are going to have to work towards strategies for dealing with internal disturbances  internal civil wars  internal persecution  in a way that is effective.
>>Rae Goldfarb: There we waited until evening when people were coming back from work and joined in with the returning Jews from their assignments of labor into the ghetto.
You know  they didn't...t hey wanted...they were hungry  and they wanted...but you had to make that soup  and then you had to go back to delousing them  and many things  and it took some time  but we work ed it out.
And  later on  when we were on Polis h papers  you see  and we live -- I work in a lumber yard.
I looked for some other kind of work [indecipherable] and I -- I worked in a -- I was hired in a professional choir  I sang.
It wasn t easy because we didnt have anything to eat.
What I think is people that didn't work or sick people that they got help from the soup kitchens.
Let us die  you know  without...ﬂ So all of a sudden  after the...quite a few months  I don't know exactly much...uh...how long we were there...uh...they came and...uh...they told us they're taking so many woman now to...to work  you know  to...uh...landscaping work.
When they blocked up the ghettos it was hard to go out for work.
And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia.
12 ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT VERBATIM RECORD And they did the same thing.
In the morning  there was an \ Appell \  and they counted us; and at noontime when we went back to work  and in the evening before we were get into the barracks to sleep  to find out whether there is anybody missing.
And every morning before you went to work there was somebody w ho took a needle and punched those blisters.
It doesnt -- it just doesnt -- It doesnt work? --
They gi gonna ta ke away from us everything  but we gonna go to work.
So there we were in England  and after a month  I got a job doing millinery work.
Well  hewas kind of concerned about me...uh...and he said  \ Well  wegonna...since they're rounding up children we're going to;:ao put you to work and make you look impor tant.
I don't think he had any idea where we're be ing taken; because we were told that we are being taken to some city in Hungary  to...for him to work as a tailor.
And I never had done anything  because I was youngest at home  but I quickly learned how to iron  how to fold up the shirts  how to the socks  and everything  because that was a special place  and not everybody was fortunate to work in the ghetto  in a place like that.
So said  \ I cannot.ﬂ \ If you can't work on Sabbath  then I can't keep you all week long.ﬂ So...uh...so he got...he left.
I might have said that those principles probably helped to influence me and the work that I do.
He said youre going to work with me and youre not going home with anybody.
And next day they took us 15 to...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that.
If you could identify with a factory that works for the Germans  or that you are in any contact or you have a connection with somebody that does work for the Germans  then you got your papers and you could get into the factory or whatever and have the right to live in the ghetto.
And of course  one thing  I always tried to work overtime  to earn a few dollars extra  because I knew the need.
70 So are you  before you are captured again and taken away -- I was [indecipherable] -- youre doing far -- youre doing this farm work the whole time?
We was in little room  like here would be ten peoples  but it was okay and I start to work by turps15.
I dont think so  I had a -- a flair for gardening  so they selected me to work in what they called the [indecipherable] garden.
I kept on doing the same work  then when -- when the war broke out  I got a job in a -- in a uniform factory.
Puchine was then closed down because the Russians came already near  you see  and we were shipped to another work camp called Scechochw  and this was from April to July in 1944.
I think -- I think now  the attitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course  they were not in the concentration camps  they were not in Auschwitz  is already different  and they are -- the willingness to -- to help  is also greater  because now  since we are established  and since we are -- most of us anyhow  are doing well  and want to contribute both financially  and with our work  to our -- the Jewish community  and all the others  not Jewish causes  we are respected.
So then I work ed in his office  so we helped -- one of the girls and her father worked in the office  and I worked for the lawyer in the office.
Well  I start working in this metal plant  and I was doing ve ry hard work  you know  like like a plain labor or things like this.
And we enter under the command of the German army  and they say to us -- oh  they didnt say in this way  but you are the worker  you will work here  and you will do whatever we will give you to do.
I don't know whether it was a rationalization  but  you know  that kind of work is not attractive.
Uh--uh and my brother said to him that it's an old broken watch  it doesn't work  you know  it's worthless.
Interview with Magdalena Berkovics October 15  2009 90 Have you been to the Holocaust Museum?
And the rude ness and I mean the attitude to work  I mean Edwarda Rorat 72 February 25  1996 Page 72 there is no ethics  everything was corruption.
They were non-Jews  yeah  there was -- ther e were no Jews left.
I can't have you have your base of work  I approve of what you're doi ng  but I can't let you have your base here at the monastery.
And just bringing all these agencies together under one roof  so they can collaborate and work together  I think has been a real positive development.
Now  working on the shifts  cutting the rubber with the -- the Poles who were coming th ere  the Poles  they were volunteers to work  and so on  they get gloves  and things to protect themself  we didnt get it.
At any rate  he says  \ Well  how long did you work in that Sonderkommando?\
I was able to volunteer to a group which was supposed to to go a different work camp  and in about three or four weeks I was able to get out of Kaiserwald and go to this camp which was about a couple of miles away from Kaiserwald  and there I was working for a unit called TWL  which is in German Truppen Wirtschafts Lager.
So I can work in the shop making toys for children.
In fact   there was some ghetto  it was not as large a ghetto.
She -- The -- I was in the student unit  and there were two Orthodox Jewish student -- social work students  and one was ta king off all the holidays  and she was kind of punished for that  she eventually had to leave.
But I did that for 13 years  until the children were 13 and 11  then I went back to work full time.
My first experience was I went with a friend of mine from school to to look for for a job  a summer job  and every job I went for I had to work on Saturday.
The Jewi sh police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that we re Jewish police in my city.
And the man in charge of us was very nasty to her and kept talking about the old ca nt do her work and so on.
I just didnt -- I -- I would sort of politely -- literally work my way out of the situation.
As the war went on  in 1941  possibly no Jews were allowed to walk anyplace unless they had business and they would be identified by some armband that would tell whether they work in an industry that is important.
What do I need to  I need to work on changing that so its not closing myself off from others  its remaining open to the input that others give me but at a very  on a very limited basis.
So what Dean Harrison had recomm ended was that camps should be set up with Feldafing as a model  that is they should be all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish committee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the camps  whether it would be uh a military group or an company or wo rkers from the Joint Distribution Committee who were by now being permitted to come into Germany  and to work in the camps  and General Eisenhower in that famous order of his of August 22nd also ordered that camps be made available for Jews alone  that non-Jews be remove d from those camps and sent back as quickly as possible to the homelands from which they had come.
So now what youre doing is youre creating this horrendous thing between people of the same marked  steri -- stigmatized group and saying  you do the dirty work  you choose whos going to be called up next.
And I knew its not going to work out for him.
And did you work on the farm with them  or did you just go to school?
And then we went to Berkeley for a year where he got his masters and when we came back to Cambridge  I got a master s of science  of library science at Simmons and then I went to work at the Harvard  at Widener as a cataloguer.
And now -- now I work mostly with the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine.
Then my mother  as I said  applied to the German military camp.
And we literally touched the ground running and became active immediately in community work.
Maybe one week before we get the locals to work and then again we did stuff.
Because we all said we were older  and we were able to do the work.
When we came to work in the morning  we start...we started uh by...by the machines  of course  and we were making the German uniforms.
But that was the cr -- well always see that in the -- in the book -- End of Tape Two  Side A Beginning Tape Two  Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 35 This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Preben Munch Nielsen.
Some were uh took their jobs too seri- ously and some--but most were pretty decent people who--whose uh--who was thought--who thought that as--as a job--as an easy a--easy work for them  as compared to going out and working on--on the airport that the Germans were building or to got to other working bri- gades.
You couldn't go in because in the ghetto there was nothing  so people used to go to the...to work outside town and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not buy because nobody sold.
I had to pretend like nothing -- everything was normal  you know  I went and did my work  you know  and kibbitzed with the -- with the guys that I worked with and -- and -- and you know  and all that.
I had to work to mainta in my parents and myself because we had nothing except what they had left from the 110 pounds.
Not in terribly significant ways  but one instance that come to mind was  not long after I had been there  I had put the whole organization to work to develop a list of requirements  how many of this  that and the other machines do you need in your school  in your district  in the Zone?
So I spoke with my mother and I said I am going to try to get you on the list of the capable work.
In 1966  I went to join the work for the navy.
The parents  when they came home from work they didn't find their kids anymore.
And so we went to work for them and it didn t take very long  we hit it just right and in three years we had rec overed practically everything we lost on the other company.
And after the line up  we were told that we were going to build a road.
And he said well  he says I know that your dad has done  well  she he would have said of course your husband  uh I know that your husband has done work for the Jewish Council.
I commuted by subway station -- by subway to work as a shipping clerk.
Interview with David Brombart May 7  2007 30 On her own  and you know  th ey -- we were si -- we deci -- And she thought she was going to work in Germany?
And as we are going  one man was work ing and we don't look even at that side  and he stops us    he said  do you have leat her to sell?
So some of us went to work on that  and we got housing there  also outside  you know  the main part of the ghetto.
So I took whatever I could  so I went into Canada and started naturally work as a furrier and then I... How come you didn't want to stay in Europe?
>> Ronald Coleman: And then you -- did you immediately then start working for the United Nations or did you work in Israel?
And I was al ready half dead when I already got to work.
I want to thank you very much for being willing to do this.
They had families  they didnt want to go to work in Germany.
I work in an business  and his sister worked there too  but she worked on the office side  and I was in the in the the on the counter  let me say.
So we didn't have to go to work every day  like the steinbruch  and do all public kind of works.
She had to do this in order to earn money so that we could go to school.
A2: But she lifted the heavy cartons and Ah  I did that [indecipherable] I have I am strong  and Im fast  and I liked the work.
And I work both with high school students and then college graduates on their admission application essays.
They promised that they will be put to work and then maybe even she will be able to join him later on.
Although we heard about it  we tried to work in order to save our lives  but we still did not believe that they are exterminating them.
I had a younger brother  which I send him out to work one time  which they worked at   and it was named   the firm.
yeah well the ones Ive worked with  I work on Tuesday afternoon.
The only thing  it was hard that my parents had to work and we both got malaria.
But he gave a chance that they could get work and there were a lot of poor peo ple and there were rich people like all over the world.
And that the neighbor who had 40 acres  some of it was very sandy  and a lot of woods  and a lot of work was needed to put into it  to make into you know  usable land.
DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 10 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: from the house.
We traveled several hours and final destination we ended up in the city of Hamburg  but our camp where we dwelled was outside of the city in a place called Tzazel and the station where we traveled into the city for work was called 20 Popinville .
We need to work -- they were they wanted to work on the underground hangars for the airplanes.
Ah yes  finally I left Illinois  I began to work at Bell Telephone Laboratories  and within a few months after starting work at Bell Labs  I was drafted. [
Oh  and -- and -- and we came there to work.
And they said that ﬁyou have to get off very fast from the train because you are going to start to work.
And we knew that his sister had made (inaudible) meaning she went to work in Palestine in the 1930s.
Well  unfortunately it didnt work out  World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered.
You know  at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the intricate work.
She never said a word ab out her work or the co nditions in which she was working.
And he managed to persuade those numskulls that he was taking work home because he needed to finish some cards for the next day.
I was thinking the antiªSeminites  they called us\  names  such low names  and work quicker quicker.
And were -- were there other people who -- who were killed  or died while they were doing this work?
We had to we had to report  and we had to do certain work for the Germans.
And I had a shift from four to eight in the morning and four to eight in the evening.
So I work in Martin Goldmans office  who is the Director of Survivor Affairs  and I also joined the circle for -- writers circle there  Im trying to put my story down from the war  which is very  very difficult for me  but I like the people there and I feel very comfortabl e. And when I came to the point where I felt I wanted to volunteer somewhere  I went around and I thought  where would I do best?
So he saw me and he called me up on the stage and said  come on  let me dance while you -- if you want to work.
It so happened I got a work card  and I worked there for quite a while  maybe five or six weeks  until they liquidated the work place.
They were not treated  you know  a lot better than the Jews  but the mere fact that we didnt have to go with the command and morning count  and we didnt have the dogs  and we didnt have the no  the SS that led us to work  no the soldiers who were watching us  you know  and we didnt walk in the rain  and we didnt stand in the rain that whole combination kind of gave us an opportunity to kind of become human again.
And during the morning or after work  they made somehow a little fire  and they put it on like they say in the United States  they barbecued and they ate it.
But I cant sto -- you know  some days Ive even thought   ﬁWell  you know  Im si -- Im going to be 65  maybe I should retire  and maybe I should ju st work on this other stuff.ﬂ But how can I retire when Ive got a son whos an artist  who really -- you know  the gallery keeps 50 percent  so it sounds great  he sol -- sold a painting for 10 grand.
That was our song going out to work and it has to be left  left  left  left.
There was Auschwitz I which was...which was the Auschwitz work camp which was a horrible camp.
>> Bill Benson: These work details  of course  they were incredibly hard work  taking down damaged buildings and all of that.
So from the Switz -- the border with Switzerland there -- they -- they sent us there in an attempt to get -- to smuggle us into Switzerland and that didnt work.
When we moved we were again with different people and ag ain there wasnt enough room to sleep us all on the floor so we had to build like bunks so there were three in a row stacked up.
It was announced from time to time that there would be a deportation  that people would go to work in the east.
Well  you know  putting whipped cream  which is like a lot of fat  into a little kids system  who hasnt eaten anything for a year and a half  just doesnt work out very well.
Even in Germany   you know  with You had to pay for it.
She was the cleaning lady  so she didn't have to work too hard.
What -- when you got over here  and actually its -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 40 Yeah. --
Besides this  at that time  they wanted you to work every day and I didn't want to work on the Sh abbat  want  couldn't get the job.
F ollowing a diagnosis of lung cancer in 1992  Henry retired from his real estate work.
Then there was another time we came out to work  this same thing happened  the American bombers are again there.
SSo  this was the bi -- the President Trumans idea  but anyways  didnt work out very well.
And now still the Polish American congress work hard to help somehow  that the Poland be a member of United Europe  what is very important.
Of course  I felt bad I had lied by then  you know  but y ou had  the thing is  I did my work  I worked very hard.
>> Bill Benson: So black market work to make ends meet.
Shell not able to have children  she ll not able to work  she is like a glass  you have to keep her very carefully whole life.
I mean  he would take diamonds home and he would have the machine at home and he would work 12  13 hours  so you couldn't expect him to do a lot.
ML: Number one  in the labor camp you did physical work  or if you were in these refugee homes  the homes had to be maintained.
Its interesting th at even though we had very assimilated  from the very beginning  my 50 year career in social work  was almost all in Jewish social work.
However  women and children can't work or the old people can't work.
Well  sick bay  there was no -- at least you were out of work then  you know?
We -- we had a job to do  we were there to do it.
But finally they they talked me in  you know  and the boss give me Interview with Jack Mondschein February 15  2013 138like oh  two days work and says  well  the unions gonna send you tomorrow to Universal for a couple days.
But the work wasnt as difficult as it was in Buna  or was it?
And I have a very high opinion of her  and of her work  which follows a book she did on the 1920s.
speaks foreign language here] [speaks foreign language here] I: They had  in  inside  what I said  inside activities like food distributions  looking after the children  they had a little bit of cultural activities because there wa s nothing else to do  but there was no physical work performed  like in our so-called [sp eaks foreign language here] [speaks foreign language here] I: The tragedy was that they made no use  du ring a war  where manp ower or womenpower was short to use the young family members  me n and women for someth ing productive  yeah?
But I was very busy trying to catch up with school work  to stay abreast of fellow students my own age  and trying to become American.
Well  the ghetto was still...uh...not terrible  by comparison to..to a work camp or a concentration camp.
Then I saw there were little wagons in there and there was a lot of and I said to myself you know  maybe I could find out if they had any mechanic work over here and I shouldn't have to dig and shovel rocks out of there.
But my Nuremberg work breaks off at this point  so that I think Be lle better carry it forward.
So  when he went to work  I went with my car  where my new license  parked in the parking lot  went inside  with my little ad I found.
If your -- So I gave up the job and I came to New York and I found another job.
Colonel Storey had done work during the war that had come to the attention of Justice Jackson  and he'd been a...gone abroad for OSS on a thing or two.
But I know Father was always  because he was so neat and organized  and he typed  and so he was always that guy who did the secretarial work through the camp  you know  through the ghetto and the camp.
As hostages they were forced to work but their food was in charge of the family  of their families.
If I'm remembering well  it's during one of the days when we came back from the work which we were doing.
So w-we found another place  and was good  she knew  was paid off  and was good  and and I came back to work.
I was like on pins and needles and I was...they took me out in the morning to work and I...and I was in such terrible pain and I...somehow or other I lived through  endured  and the swelling went down.
And some of the women they used to take to work too.
In Lauerhutte...whatever the the Polish name I don't know...the work was very  very  very difficult.
I appreciated that  but things never work out the way you think.
And I think we might find among them some who had really dedicated the rest of their lives to this type of work.
We had the Jewish workshops in the ghetto  the big workshops in the ghetto  so we used to 96send them to work there.
So to work in a bakery was something very good then.
you couldnt help them  and they didnt work  because of the -- so  whatever it is  my sister and my mother stayed home.
It was again a matter of sending people in work camps -- to work camps  or to resettlement camps.
Somehow it didnt work out so they stopped at the advice of the teacher  I guess.
So sure enough the Polacks they show us  they say listen  dont go walk down but the Polish people will grab you to work because the bombs what they were ruined  they want that you probably grab you to work to fix it up.
21 know  it's not just in the United States that they have invented social work  or that we -- to me  it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong  and there was no nuances.
We was going to work...was beaten up  after work all the time  kicked us up  beat us up.
And we used to go out to all kinds of work.
Tell a little -- te ll a little bit about the work process.
Then  I wanna go back to work  he takes out a cigarette.
It was hard work  but -- [tape break] Lets leave your business just for a mome nt  to go back to your -- your children.
We were carrying stones from one place to the other like one day carrying it one place and the next day bring them back.
I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to work.
They probably wouldn't have missed me if they were not called back because the--the main work was to carry the cement from the wagons into that uh barn there that they had a--a uh--a system.
There were men going to work  with pails of water cleaning the streets  and we were very easily recognizable because you had to wear a Jewish star.
And there he said  ﬁI want you to take over the labor department because we have to register every Jew  every child in the ghetto because we have to give them work.ﬂ For work we will get bread and we can live.
We worked in the camp  and I went every day to work.
And you just said [indecipherable] 130 Well  I wa -- I was very fortunate  I -- as a young instructor  I -- no  young assistant professor  I had a chance to work one summer at IBM  and I got introduced to some very useful theory and then I had a years leave of absence at MIT a nd I had some good colleagues to work with and I had a chance to -- to do something in very short or der.
The main thing so we were not hungry  we had bread .
And they sent me to a factory to work in a textile factory.
KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/MIRIAM GERSHWIN page 30 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films  Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd  Potomac  MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: there I mean--there you didn't have anything.
And I then decided that Id like to put  work out there and try to develop that as a novel.
What they did they went in...in the day time during the work in the barracks and they remained over there.
So you were seeking work that  in which you were really able to do more of the problem solving type than– what didnt you like about the job that you had in Texas?
If that be now  I wouldnt let her work the graveyard shift.
So a son going to work for a father is something acceptable but a father going to work for a son first of all is very hard for a son  because you cannot talk to an employee that's your father  but it had to be done.
